i wish that i could turn back time
previous thread   as always do not reply to shitposters just report and hide    as a counterpoint to last thread which figure has disappointed you the most
  the last 3 main lines yes really
  thundertron bought into the memes when he was the hot new shit for a minute thought his sword goes in his hand like a hook hes got a pegleg and his foot becomes a little parrot sold  only when transforming back and forth did i realize how much i hate static animal modes that do nothing but stand there robot mode is cool but fuck that lion mode
  i thought about getting punch/counterpunch but the feet are so unbearably dumb read nonexistent that i just couldnt
  the tr weirdwold the figures almost great but that fucking back panel is absolute garbage with how it breaks apart
  there isnt really a way to do feet for him although he stands well on his kankles
hi res pics courtesy or fwoosh
  i will not buy a bot with a beast mode that has those fucked up back legs instead of actual digitigrade style legs looks terrible
  im going to put that season 1 head on my optimus and never look back
  its hard to justify if you cant manage to get even a basic animal pose out of a beastformer i didnt expect much posability with say t30 rhinox but a more dynamic animal like thundertrons lion mode should be able to get a lunging pose or something at least
  how is he not disappointing all he does is have two robot modes there is really no point to him other than nostalgia
  well its not c/cp i love him in any configuration
  i cant wait to find out how nightmarish his transformation
  being this far into development and no one showing us the back tells us its going to be such a fucked up mp36 style mess and what weve got tells us its going to be just garbage even from the side    and i can get a tw constructor for less than what they want for it
  i dont have punch/counterpunch is he actually good cause 2 robot modes sounds interesting even if they look a bit odd  is he at least worth that price
  yeah no regrets
  fake chest windows can be seen right through the truck windows  this thing is such a retarded mess
  its pretty good for a whole new mold very poseable aside from the nonfeet it has  as for the price it also comes with the clear prima so you pretty much get what you pay for
  we havent seen it in color but there are pics of the gray test shots back
  i like him a lot some of his proportions are a bit off and i dislike the fact that he basically has no feet but hes really slick otherwise
  is he at least worth that price  yes you can use the included hand as a spy jetpack
all these shots of 44 and not one with megatron
anybody find any botbots yet    not so much to see if they suck more so i can finally know what fucking section of the store to look for them in
        those head sculpts are fucking hideous the noseandfaceplate thing is just repulsive
  why couldnt they give optimus prime his iconic monoeye and mandibles
  that is a bit weird but if it can stand up correctly then i dont think its an issue    alright then that sounds better
which figure has disappointed you the most    holy shit this figure is disappointment incarnate even his upgrade kits cant save him since one just makes his proportions worse and the other tears itself apart
will mp optimus version 4 be able to come apart and be rebuilt into a decepticon defense system or an alligator
there were takara repaints of pcc toys and this is news to me
  what is that why is he so fat
  thats news to me too i didnt know they even bothered
  with this price point it should
  combiner wars leader megatron it sucks
  yeah they exist  i want buildmaster
  tfw had to actually import grimmaster because grimstone was just as much money
  thats what happens when theres one diamond in the rough  dinopope overshadowed everything else in the line
  really i liked him
  which figure has disappointed you the most  these 2 well all the potp dinobots but these 2 specially they need buffier proportions with bigger shoulders and slag should share sludge wings
  he looks fat mind telling what exactly is wrong with him
  hes fat and his shoulders are at nipplelevel instead of where they should be
  buildmaster is pretty top tier
  awful proportions knees that can barely move past 20 degrees no ankle joints to compensate for his lack of knee movement nonremovable cannon that keeps hitting his shoulder when you try to move it low shoulders with huge gaps between the shoulder and chest and the transformation level of a deluxe figure hes terrible
  i was planning on buying steamhammer just because of that torso mode making everything constructicon colors just makes it better  if there was a way to give him elbows he would be the perfect pcc set
  hungurrr is pretty awful in robot and dragon mode whatever hes going to be a torso 100 of the time and that looks fine
  i wish tank master was attainable
  the transformation level of a deluxe figure  with how kibble ridden he is i thought the transformation would be overly complex instead what he turns into by the way for how fat he is i expect him to cycle through 3 alt modes
a lot of the studio series figs are pretty cheap on amazon right now i just got grimlock for 26 who else getting in on it
  right now my abominus is in a mostly complete form as blot is so good of a toy he gets to mingle away from the group
  just a tank
  that actually looks amazing shame they are all sold out i would have liked to see if they did smolder    seriously with all that kibble fattening him up
  what he turns into by the way  a tank like siege megatron except the transformation is actually simpler than the voyager version
  i disagree personally hes pretty great in robot and dragon mode because of his neck/ankle articulation but as a torso hes way too skinny and in desperate need of bulking up
  alot of it becomes a backpack on him    honestly his robot mode is so nice i cant hate him
  its all hollow and fake    you can buy the upgrade kits to fix his proportions but theyll destroy themselves due to bad plastic if you transform or pose him over and over i went through two before giving up
  please tell me they were cheap at least
got skytread today and just in case someone hasnt done it yet here you go no other siege stuff found in my ao yet on a slightly different topic please refresh my memory wasnt the first time anyone saw potp windcharger he was in a xmas stocking stuffer dump bin at wal mart im beginning to think thats where wms siege product will appear first
  40 at the cheapest new not sure about now
  oh that doesnt sound good    the upgrades right
the differences in plastic colors bother me more than id expect    and yes that is what happened with the first potp legends figures
respond quickly so i can tell you were to find him
  the upgrades right  not sure what those cost presumably not cheap base figure was a leader so 4050 was normal price new before upgrades  yep
  wasnt the first time anyone saw potp windcharger he was in a xmas stocking stuffer dump bin at wal mart  and a few other potp figures yes beachcomber at least
  i go lucky and snagged him and the repaint of the boat one from mandarake about two years ago for a decent price and im super glad i did hes a neat little figure to mess around with shame i never managed to pick up any of the mobine sets ive been super tempted to grab the little wwii bot limbs off bbts since they have them for a decent price i might just do that
  i was talking to you about this
      the first cw megatron upgrade kit on the right gave him a better cannon muzzle and poseable hands but was otherwise a wash especially because it junked up the tank mode something awful    the second one was by x2 toys and was the better looking one but unfortunately the plastic was so thin and cheap and the joints were so small that itll destroy itself from tension alone
  i mean just bigger shoulders make it look better
  youd think pe tcw or nonnef would have made shoulder replacements for them but i guess fixing the combined mode nobody asked for was a bigger priority
  oh right the cost was from it being a leader class      5499 for cheap plastic upgrades  and you double dipped on them fuck man
  more expensive than the figure  doesnt make it look any better  i think id rather have the old nerf megatron leading my con shelf fuck
  i was young and stupid its my only defense    i still dont have a decent g1 megatron though
  by where to find him do you mean for a price thats kinda reasonable most of the united ex stuff ive seen is mighty pricey
  check the preowned amiami section for transformers if you check from latest figures he should show up in a two pack on page 4 hes 2380 yen
  this one    over 140 on a bad toy do you at least still have the stupid thing
  i still have it and two sets of x2 toys upgrade kits with broken parts
  do the broken parts at least still make a whole functional set  how much did you pose it anyways
  no the hinges on the leg covers and the hinge joints that hold the shoulders in place both broke just from transforming it and i rarely transformed it the leg hinges broke while he was just standing
so i think im gonna do a bit of work on magnus   alcohol to remove all the scuffing   paint in the grill window and head light framing and smoke stacks with silver   fix any detailing that is damaged in the removal of the scuffing
  alcohol to remove all the scuffing    ive been trying to remove the silver paint from flywheels/skytread using isopropyl alcohol and a cuetip and it just refuses to come off
  not him but thanks for showing me that while i did want undertow at least i can get that one pcc easily at least theres another set there
  you gotta use like 91 and it can take a little bit of elbow grease    though that said if the part can be removed easily ive let things soak in alcohol in a setup i have for when i do customs the alcohol will not damage the plastic
  5499 for that quality  it just keeps getting worse
  you gotta use like 91    thats what ive been using i was scrubbing one part for a half hour and it still wont come off    normally i would just bathe the part in a tub of the alcohol but i want to keep the paint on the treads so i cant do that
  it seems easier to remove on some figures than others i had no problem cleaning up megatron but found sideswipes shins to be impossible and had to just paint over them
    trying dipping a toothpick into the alcohol and scrape the paint off that way itll take a little longer but it should have better success for those harder to scrub areas
  optimus and megatrons paint is easy to remove everybody elses not so much
  is the area where youre trying to remove the silver paint on top of painted plastic if its not you can use a mr clean magic rub eraser thing and it will take it right off
  the gold parts are paint im trying very hard not to wash that off
  im trying very hard not to wash that off  put some paper tape over it
  whats paper tape
  masking tape painters tape that tape thats sorta paper on one side whatever your local equivalent is
  not that guy but its a soft type of tape that wont pull paint off if you cant find that just use painters tape you can get it at any hardware store
  masking tape to protect parts you dont want to remove paint of
  ah masking tape that i know
  also known as masking tape its tape thats made out of paper and doesnt leave any glue behind when you peel it off modelers often use it to cover areas they dont want painted when trying to paint a specific area of the model
  also put the alcohol on a qtip if you want to do it manually
  if they gave him feet and were able to hide his other robot mode better this would be a god tier figure that being said mine figure quality is absolutely golden frankly im scared
  not the same anon but would any sort of grit be able to help without scratching the plastic itself maybe something very fine i dunno
  i wouldnt suggest it you might risk altering the shine of the plastic so i would just stick to using alcohol no abrasive contact with the plastic just a chemical removal of the paint
    yes its hard to replicate that semigloss to matte finishing on the toys those are done by sandblasting the metal molds
good news anons hasbrotoyshop will no longer sell their brands or something    at hasbro we strive to provide our customers with the best possible experience with our portfolio brands as a valued customer we wanted to let you know that our brand websites have changed and will no longer sell products directly that said you can still access your account and check existing orders using your login at hasbro toy shop     finding shit is going to be even harder yay
  nice cant wait for lewin oversized version
  they never had what i wanted in stock anyway even when it was supposed to be available everywhere
  well that doesnt sound good
    im confused as fuck now are they saying that they re no longer going to sell toys at all through thier toy selling website or that theyre going to stop selling nonhasbro branded stuff ie nerf magic the gathering etc
30 years from now   people are trying to collect vintage siege figures  tons of pissed off collectors trying to track down figures that havent had the battle damage removed by the original owners
   years from now   people are trying to collect vintage siege figures  not sure i can picture this tbqhf
well have to wait but it could be many things    they will no longer sell products on the site site essentially dies since the other site already showcases products  the guys they partners with are being let go or the contract ran out so until they get that sorted out they wont sell anything  the site will only link you to products on target amazon walmart etc
  his foot becomes a parrot  i must see this
well i caved the combaticon set for 15 with free shipping
is this set worth it for 30 cheaper than seeking a regular foc voyager also does anyone have the grimlock alongside wfc 2010 deluxes to compare
  fuck yes i love constructicons give me allllll the constructicons    this guys one of my grails nearly bought him a while back but i decided against it because of how overall shitty pcc seems to have been still looks cool as fuck though    speaking of grails i just scored gaia unicron for a fraction of what he normally goes for its too bad about the knee articulation but hes still my preferred unicron design glad i finally found him
  objectively wrong    hungurrr is kino hes stupid yes but hes so stupid hes just plain fun
  they only shipped to the us anyway fuck those guys
  its worth maybe 5
  not my pic but here you go just pop his foot off the pegleg and start folding around youll see the birdmode emerge
  thats a pretty good price bombshell himself is pretty alright and now you have drones for any other pcc figures you have/get
  have you seen nightmare unicron if you like gaia unicron hes worth it for the kickass color scheme
  kino  stupid fun  sounds bad
post your favorite stock photos    the shittier the better
  hes not for everyone i just like weird transformers
  the shittier the better    you could fill an entire thread with shitty hasbro stock photos where things are horribly mistransformed or have been photoshopped to hell and back to change colors and lighting
  my 2 cents
  literally two cents     hahahaha
stickered my predaking and put it together i can see some devastator style concepts like how the wing pack is pegged in multiple places to add stability to the combined mode ala devs chest shield they just dont work as well due to tolerances
  that crookedass truck    so this is the power of making a g1 optimus a fucking shellformer
  its ten cents though
  stop making new threads retards when we have a perfectly fine thread over      
what if starscream turned his seekerfriends into targetmasters
friendship is power of the primes 2018
  flywheels battle damage actually looks decent compared to the poop stains that prime and megs got covered in
  are those those targetroid things theres a guy on aliexpress sellin what i assume are knockoffs i kind of wanted to pick some up
  pretty sure there are no kos of these otherwise theyd be selling the original 4 rather than the repaints theyre just really old stock
  that sounds like something starscream would do non consensually
    there are kos of them but they are os multicolor fleamarket shit     these repaint sets have been stuck on taobao forever they are probably the same ones you see on ali really cheap about 50 rmb  8 usd per set before shipping
  i got this one as the perfect companion for dark rod
  wait can you link to the ali page or tell me what to search please and thank you
  dont talk to me or my moustachioed son ever again
  i think they were around 15usd the last time i saw them on alie i should probably learn how to shop with taobao at this rate
  nobody wants to post in your stupid thread
  fuck off with your shitty bait and micromanagement first kirafag
  i dunno if i can still recommend tb its true that they hoard lots of interesting stuff like the junkion blacksmith weapons aveo swerves and the domestic china version of hastak stuff are about 30 cheaper however theyve implemented text filters that blocks international buyers from listings with hasbro trademarks including the characters that spell out transformers thats like 80 of the tf listings you can still get them by contacting willing sellers but its still an added hassle     and for guys in the states youll get screwed by the postal rates soon
  aw fuck mine just broke it outer hinges not that long ago how long until it breaks off entirely and why did they come up with such a design flaw
  knowing their boneheaded decisions probably both
  damn that sword is huge as fuck
while i do have some issues with the line one of the things i do like are the effect parts especially the consistent pegs and holes on all the small guys for using them     except weirdly the barrel of lionizers which is much too small
  looks like lego doc ock arms
  well you convinced me to get those now
  how long until it breaks off entirely  it wont unless you force it the hinge plastic only breaks because theres too much stress for such a tiny piece of transparent plastic once its cracked the stress has been relieved just dont be a hamfister and the canopy should stay on just fine
    thats exactly the one i wanted and for the same reason have rodimus unicronus on the way and he seems like the kind of bot that would have a targetmaster with his same face on it    and yeah theyre about 15usd on alie ive never gotten around to figure out taobao but after middleman and shipping i cant figure theyll be that much cheaper going that route
  theyre pretty fun a smidge overpriced but im a sucker for tiny guys     i really hope we dont see too much variation in effect colors honestly i dont want to have to buy another lionizer just to get another blue slash for acceleration effects or another blowpipe to get a second yellow burst
  they fit on this barrel
  well fug i cant believe youve done this
  id seriously buy super pack of effect parts they look so much better than i thought they would
  when this baby hits 88 miles per hour
  i also dig that the yellow effect part that comes with blowpipe can either be fireing effect or a blast marker if you use the ports on one of the figures bodies    i hope they do more of those    more accurately i hope some ko company makes casts and turns out bags full of them for cheap
  same it probably wont happen though       more accurately i hope some ko company makes casts and turns out bags full of them for cheap  this is what i actually hope for though     also blowpipes effect is two parts which pretty neat
  also blowpipes effect is two parts which pretty neat  arent they glued together i havent tried pulling them apart
  no ive seen reviews where they come apart easily
  if they are its a very weak glue
  on mine they popped right apart didnt seem glued     also is there an intended use for the 5mm port under blowpipes gun or is it just general purpose
posts big sale notice  nothing new is actually marked down
monstructor is apparently coming with generation selects seacons are also something that could very soon be real with hasbro closing hasbrotoyshopcom youre now going to have walmartcom handling a ton of shit now and third party sites like bbts and tfsource are now going to play a larger role in distribution generation selects is to essentially stress test their new distribution system or something
  poorfag  expect shit released a month ago to go on sale just before christmas  complain on 4channel  hope other poorfags sympathize with him  snap get a job retard
  what are these guys retail
  same ill stop in the toys when i have shopping to do but im not sure where to be disappointed about stock concerning botbots
  says a fucker who thinks playing video games on youtube is real work
  just filter by filename he always uses the same ones
  zoomer cant use mommys credit card  starts s e e t h i n g  thinks anyone with cash is a youtuber  i accept your concession
  you can pop off the cannon parts for both of them and mount them on their arms in robot mode
  yes but blowpipe has a 5mm hole under his gun not just the peg for wielding it himself
  read the op
so the new seige sideswipe is just a scaled down version of the mp
  well its a whole new mold so no
  souce plz
  well i mean in terms of engineering and design it looks quite similar are the differences for the better or just a fact of it being smaller/at a lower price point
goes to tfw2005  people upset about the price are roasted because they are being childish  the usual suspects engage in a circlejerk praising lord kobayashi  someone justifies the awful backpack because it was seen a couple of times in the cartoon
   to tfw2005
  thats fair
  goes to alls park where the kirathing resides
  goes to tfw2005  dont like shit  post about it on 4chan  gets told about it  post about getting told onto tfw2005  dont like shit  post about it on 4chan again    
  who goes there /tfg/ is the only place ive ever gone to talk toys the other places all seem a little too gay
does anyone actually use tformers or seibertron as their standard tf page
  i use seibertron for the toy galleries not really updated but great for looking at older figures
i got dino getter 1 on clearance solely because of my deep childhood love for my terrorsaur toy i know next to nothing about getter robo so i guess hes a new honorary member
  i use seibertron its pretty tame there unless some 3rd part shill comes through claiming everyone should buy his fanscybertruboassblasterworld dingusaurus rex instead of retail hasbro or takara figures
  this the guy thats been giving you a hard time   yeah kick his ass getter
  i like this ongoing little team you got anon any other recruits youre planning on
anyone else feels really bummed out about not having a place to discuss customs and shit  i almost feel like i would be far more advanced on that one aspect of the hobby if this boards general wasnt so slow and unpopulated but i still despise moderated forums too much to go ask on any of them
  if youre the type that need to post yr customs for attention theres always twitter/instagram
  well i followed the advice of someone else on here and got that red motorcycle with a face like inferno but he needs some paint    i really like tm terrorsaur as a lackey of lg megatron since he fell into a volcano just as he was starting to transmutate i like to think this is where he ended up
  not for attention i want advice before fucking things up because the exchange rate of my country is really fucking unforgiving
  you all do dont deny it
  his head sculpt is way better than the mps
  everyday i look to see what stupid shit literally who said roll my eyes and come back here
  plan ahead i guess maybe some of the other generals on here would have more solid advice on specific aspects of customizing the gunpla anons come to mind
  dont put things up your butt especially sharp corrosive things
  of course or i would miss out on things like seeing the banning of all discussion anywhere on the site of that 3rd party sexy arcee figure
  yeah i dont go to tfw2005 or allspark so theres no need for that
  solid protip in general
  hey buddy mere   ᵖᵘᵗ ᶦᵗ ᶦn ᵐʸ ᵃˢˢ
  dont die     i bet runabout or runamuck wrote this as a diss against humans
ded thred
well   he looks good at least
  chest flap and shoulder issue
  pretty much without kirafag the anons here have nothing to talk about because hasbro/takara dont compare at all to third parties
  the cannons are mistransformed
  cocksuckers that thread last i checked was calm not many had a issue with it
  arms are weird my chest tabs in well enough   sadly his knees are useless this is about max bend    eating dinner so itll be a bit before i transform him
  what arcee is this in reference to
  what a bunch of pussies not that i would expect any less from a site that filtered retard and sjw
  ironhide by design does just have weird arms whats the exact issue are they limited    that cant be the max back bend thats fuck all
  one of these probably    
  this sjws on the site got their panties in a twist because of the lewd teaser images they could have just said no to said images but out right banned discussion of it because it sexually objectified the character
  im sure less would if 4chan actually started get news and leaks first like they used to    as is i use tfw and diam choc to find out about new stuff these days
  ommagerhd boobies how horrible
  its not even sjws its just old fashioned prudes
  as is i use tfw and diam choc to find out about new stuff these days  i think we all pretty much do them for news and /toy/ for actual discussion
  i started posting there in 2000 when i was 15 it was as loose and unpc as you could get tony actually posted and wasnt a giant fuckwit i distinctly remember someone posting a fanart pic of ai from car robots covered in jizz i was young and used to ask all the old perverted fucks about sex and stuff  better days
  itsnot even that sexual wow still cool though
  its not but the teasers were done specifically to evoke provocative pin ups by focusing on her tits and ass with coy censoring warning stripes
  i thought this was about those squishable boob replacement chests for rogue
  see 
  oh my
  where should we put the entire vehicle sir  meh on the back
  yeah he always had a big backpack
  is this finally out damn i want him but money is so damn tight this month with christmas and unicron of light to worry about
  due to how the truck bed sides fold around his knee it limits it a ton   having some issues getting his hood to fold right so messing around with him some more
flaws aside i may just try and pick him up was going to go with a 3p option but i know i woulnt be satisfied with it in the long run
    its not as bad as sunstreakers atleast    
  yeah but lets be real this mp is rob liefeld levels of body extrusion
  you dont know what youre talking about
so which one of you created an alt on that fancy website to callout tony the faggot
  cost is a big issue but it hits the cartoon look while the other options are trying to do 20 with toon touches and not going all in
so does anyone know if these are available anywhere for a more affordable price
  all of the predacon transmetals were fantastic waspinator becoming some kind of jet was really cool ive been really digging a lot of the bad guys since i got back into transformers a couple years ago autobots just seem so generic these days
i feel like there should two separate mp lines    one is the ideal ie far more detail than in the cartoons the other is cartoon accuracy
  maybe not two lines but id like two teams one for big characters one for smaller characters
  is that the pcc upgrade kit
  yep the maketoys mobine i bought a few pcc things recently and kinda wanna get one but unlike the pcc base figures this is like ultra pricey
  what i want is the ideal
  that would be cool personally the slavish show/movie accuracy makes sense for bw and the bay/knightformers as the show/movie was the main focus the toys the comics the other merch none of those define bw and the movies mainly because everything else merged to match the show or movie g1 on the other hand had comics marvel dreamwave idw the cartoons both us and later japanese the toys video games wfc/foc and later g1influenced redesigns in other shows armada op rid magnus all of these borrow and play off each other while maintaining a separate identity simply put many definitions of g1 exist if anything the toys were the most important aspect of g1 as that was the initial product hasbro was attempting to sell the comic and cartoon were created to sell the main product the toys
i do like his truck mode but a pain to line things up in the cab part still doesnt peg in right
          nope nope nope do it manually with 91 alcohol and a qtip just be careful and go little by little without soaking the tip too much so that excess alcohol seeps onto surrounding areas or onto your fingertips if you use tape the alcohol will still likely get underneath it and you will damage the paint you want to keep better to work carefully and be able to see what youre doing the entire time
   amazon has him but you cant get his order page has to be in your list
  which ones you ended up buying
      thats literally the definition of the word ideal and he was only speaking subjectively
  im still baffled that they never repainted transmetal waspinator into starscream as an homage to the starscream ghost episode
im having a hard time believing how many people are warming up to mp44 does anyone here remember the tenor of this general when it was revealed and how universally everyone panned it do you guys have stockholm syndrome or something
  people get over their knee jerk reactions  i still dont want it but fuck it others might
  heavytread and i got the full combaticons set spent about 38 for both of those heavytread lacks his minicon but thats not a big loss
  no its just what he wants its not ideal
  so you have bombshock too how are they  while i was unable to find anything on missile launcher theres still another alternative    
  dunno yet waiting on them to get here in the mail they look really fun    also yeah ive seen that iron army set im still debating them kinda wish they were slightly more modern its kinda weird using ww2 sets on a modern combaticon torso
  only place i was able to find the set is on ebay for around 199 bucks a bit too much
  i mean i think the official maketoys price is 85 on their site but even then thats a bit much you know
  so how is he in general
  eh its prime and i generally love takaras mp
  thats 3p for you and even so they are all sold out there are you the one who wanted to get tankmaster too
  yeah found him on amiami for a decent price will have to hold off for a bit though
  i like optimus
  shame theres only one though really wanted to get marinemaster
  i dig this redesign      id like to grab him now but adult spending and all that fucking bills
  he has a car mode too you know
im going to try and buy my first optimus prime tomorrow im pretty excited
  do you mean mp44 or something else because hate to break it to youbut mp44 looks nothing like that optimus
  cool anon which one are you going for
  dude you cant just acknowledge another mans car mode like that
  nothing does the vintage design is one of a kind  well two g2 and all that
  nah i think its pic related i saw one of two different primes at walmart and realized that while i own the prime that fires missiles via air pump i do not own a basic one    i think this is one of them im still trying to sort out the newer stuff
  forget cartoon accuracy how would a fully accurate boxart optimus look  the g1 is missing details
  cyberverse  get the siege instead
  i own the prime that fires missiles via air pump  this guy i wasnt aware there was another airpowered one besides him
  yeah dont get that one just wait for the siege version to release in stores which should be this month
  cyberverse  dont do this to yourself theres tons of better optimus toys especially ones with functional waists and right arms
  with a little bit of fixing this could be a great figure looking forward for weijiang
  i really want the siege version but im not sure ill be able to find it if it is even out yet i missed out on the legends class optimus and bought ultra magnus instead    thats the one hes pretty rad and i have kept him in good condition im not sure if the pump or tubing has rotted since i last pulled him out however
  i just want the guy i saw on reruns as a kid    also there is never going to be a toy that makes everyone pleased all this bitching isnt going to change peoples minds
  g2 prime is definitely rad one of my first tfs  gonna agree with other anons cyberverse is a waste of time there was a nice little t30 prime if all you wanted was a small one otherwise yeah wait for siege
  is that optimus as poseable as it looks in   that pic  poseable g2 figures are something im interested in
  g2 prime hes more articulate than he looks but the joints are stiff and old on mine so i have to be ginger with it yes though he can still rock a decent pose after all those years  also get cyberjets if you havnt already
man this fucking guy has me so mildly annoyed lately  i really want a shadow panther because his bio makes him sound fun but the old figure is not at all up to modern standards and the mp is just black cheetor when will warden announce a new beast wars line
  do you have pictures of yours and i think its going to be quite a challenge to find a g2 toy
  the old figure isnt up to modern standards but the ankles and head are the only parts really limited in articulation compared to the modern average
  robot masters convoy
  i meant that also in looks  the torso is just a mess
  i like it but i dont 400 like it
  mines seen better days but the pump still works broke a missile during childhood so he only carries one now
      fair enough ill do my best not to buy him tomorrow in a fit of impulse shopping i want the siege optimus but ill never say no to grabbing a legends/scout class optimus to go with my tankatron    mine is still as posable i tried to get it out for you but its currently inaccessible at least for now have a consolation picture of soundwave instead     the cyberjets are really great listen to this anon
  
    yeah that works it does look a tad empty without the arms    surprisingly well kept for a g2 thanks for sharing that anon  is that a rotating waist  nice
  its okay at least you did listen to reason  cyberverse seems overall not worth getting into even if they might be cheap    wonder if theres more of those box accurate tfs
  is that a rotating waist  yep rotation at the neck/shoulders/waist with a transformationreliant bent in both knees legs can swing outwards some from the hips too hes pretty limber for an oldtimer always happy to share anon    this is the t30 prime i mentioned if you still feel the itch to have a small pocketsized one hes not too old to track down and im pretty certain hes been knockedoff and oversized so thats floating around out there too also i didnt even realize roller hooked onto the back of him until i dug up this pic neat
  i never seen that optimus before how is it
  g2 is always something that i like seeing especially both primes done for it
  just okay nothing special takes only a few seconds to transform though and he was dirt cheap when i picked him up from a dollar store some years back
  i would love if someone made this
  seems like it has no knees now that you show it
  oh wow that one looks nice ill have to keep an eye out for it thanks anon    its not terrible but the rest of the transformers i have in that scale are far superior aside from grimlock its all sorts of fiddily but it was 5/6 i think
  he doesnt its a pretty simple little guy he does have an ab crunch of sorts though hard to complain for 5
  and what seems to be double elbows i suppose you could do worse for 5 bucks
  id take one of these at approximately g1 size
  i wish i still had this chunky boys missiles so i could do the gimmick
toy fucking when
  are we getting a new skywarp
  id love to see this guy get upscaled and repainted as studio series skywarp
  thats g2  never really seen him who is he
  id rather get acid storm/ramjet i like how they turned the conehead into a hoodie
  g2 dreadwing he came with a little partner called smokejumper and they sorta combined in jet mode my smokejumper is unfortunately cracked in the middle and now rests in two pieces awaiting a fix
  didnt know that he looks like a bulky boy  what is broken on him he looks okay on the picture you posted
  calm down thew
  dreadwing is the bulky boy hes not broken at all its his little parent smokejumper whos injured a clean break on the hinge right behind the neck  dreadwings bomber mode has space for smokejumpers plane to wedge in forming a chonkier jet   pic related smokejumper
  how good was smokejumper  i thought of getting it to headswap it into being a preearth alligator megatron which i treat as a different character than bw megatron because autism and nostalgia
  he still doesnt look broken but now that you said where it is i understand why it doesnt show  how articlated is dreadwing though for a chunky boy he seems to be on optimus level
  i always liked him but his transformation does result in potential for breaking since basically one joint splits the figure his jet mode is nice too so long as hes in one piece    knees elbows hips neck i think thats all his articulation points and the neck barely moves so i hesitate to count it hes pretty good though
  thats pretty good you happen to have more photos of him  i quite like how he looks
  where is he broken  maybe you could get some plastruct plastic weld and reinforce it with polystyrene if its somewhat hidden
  sadbeepwav  i know ill need something strong to fix him it im afraid of accidentally gluing more than i inten
how far should it fall before new thread
  christ i cant think of a place to put reinforcements since both the head and the peghole under are in the way    rip brave soldier
  sure anon here he is with his younger skinnier namesake    yeah thats why hes been in my will fix later pile instead of receiving immediate medical care im just not sure how best to go about it and dont want to fuck him up
  when his partner is injured theres no better partner than himself  i really like that shoulder mounted minigun he has never thought a heavy flying machine could work
  the little guy is named smokescreen smokejumper was the rid repaint    that set is one of the few transformers i kept from my childhood i love them
  the gun is cool as fuck thats why i wish i still had the missiles it was one of those spin the knob and rapidfire all the missiles one after the other type things its great the gun tucks up under the bombermode and is the prominent feature of the tank mode    sheeit howd i mix up those names i guess when i think smokescreen the little blue/teal dude isnt what comes to mind
  that does sound cool as fuck but it also seems like a surefire way to lose every missile at once
  behind a couch into a vent up a vacuum those little missiles do not last long in the hands of an enthusiastic child   i wonder if any 3p or shapeways people make reproduction parts for missiles seems like itd be an easy market everything from g1 through the last decade or so had missiles that im sure kids lost en mass through their childhoods itd be kind of nice to be able to use g2 megatrons gravityfed cannon again
  we can always hope that is the case  wait that was a childhood toy of yours its very well kept
  man i was pretty bummed when mine broke wish the waist joint wasnt made of clear plastic
  optimus is but unfortunately my original dreadwing and smokescreen were lost among many moves and i wound up replacing them some years back just to have them again  im not sure what fate my originals suffered but i know ive had smokescreens head floating around my miscellaneous parts box forever
  thought so still that optimus is pretty well kept too  nice to see that
  midwest us is a pretty stable climate for keeping old toys pristine so long as you dont store them out in the garage or a shed or something from what i understand extreme temperature swings and drastically changing humidity are the biggest culprits for toyrot   ive been lucky to keep what childhood tfs i still have in good condition everything gets a little battle damage after 20 years but they survive somewhere along the line my cyberjet spacecase lost his lightpiping piece so for years now he just stares out of a seethrough hole where his eyes used to be   mantaray escaped my youth unscathed but his spinnydisc gun and ammo did not
  keeping toys from childhood unscathed seems to be the exception rather than the norm  thats great to hear anon better than most bw kids
  tfw lost bw primals mace missiles swords and cannoncovering panels in childhood  god fucking dammit young anon what were you thinking at least hes still got the gorilla face i found the universe repaint at a thrift shop for like 3 who didnt even have that anymore
  if he still has all limbs and they are still reasonably poseable you can still feel proud  if tfwiki is to be trusted bw overuse of balljoints make the well used figures very floppy
  the only thing i ever lost from my beast wars toys was one of silverbolts feather missiles and i have no idea how i managed to do that when i loved that thing and was really mindful of what i did with it
  fyi theres a dreadwing and smokescreen for 5500 on mandarake right now 
  i dont really care to buy a replacement for my replacement but the anon interested in good g2 shit might find this link useful good find regardless
  thanks man i did get interested in it and ebay has much worse prices for less  while its no head replacement i did find something you might like  
  not the worst price but im too much of a poorfag to indulge at the moment i always did like those basic looking guns though theyre just garish rectangles of death
  at least i hope that the shipping price youre getting is far less ridiculous where you are and that it lasts long enough  and giant blocks for guns always are always the best guns
  free shipping
  living in a third world shithole is suffering ebay is nigh useless  so just to know in case i go for it how good does g2 era plastic hold up  even if mandarake says they only opened it im not sure if i can trust how careful i need to be
  i suggest being as gentle as youd assume you need to be given the age of the item the plastic isnt really more brittle than any other in my experience but better safe than sorry right if a joint you need to turn seems stiff give it some support with a finger so the stress is lessened on a potentially weak hinge that sort of thing you shouldnt run into too many issues but do remember that these things are getting old these days
  the oldest figure ive bought from them i think was a bw manterror and it was as new as if it came out of the factory yesterday  dont manhandle it but know that figures from mandarake are like that
  i want to say i have some experience with dangerously thin plastic since i have the cw starscream but since you own it mind telling any potentially dangerous spots    like what almost factory new  and i really try not to manhandle it
  potentially dangerous spots  for dreadwing the only ones i notice offhand are the black bits connecting his legs to his torso theyre pinned in and could potentially snap i think the cannon could also break possibly its a heavy part on a relatively small connector   as for smokescreen see the pic above for where mine broke thats the biggest problem area imo since the entire figure splits in two and rotates at that point as part of the transformation so its bound to see some stress
  some more questions if you dont mind  is there any part that can get loose easily  how did the head bit of smokescreen snap off to avoid doing that mistake as well  and last what do you think should be done to avoid losing every single missile assuming that still has them
  like what almost factory new  yes id take a picture but its late here and i dont have good lighting  another one i bought that was as old was bw apache and the figure was pretty much new despite the box being beaten to shit and back even the card it was packed with was in there
  i think my smokescreen was prestressed by the previous owner when it broke it did so suddenly and without warning like it was gps id say pay careful attention to that area when transforming and brace it with your fingers when you rotate it to lessen the strain as for missiles never ever fire them or just shoot them at an improvised range so they all fall in the same area instead of ricocheting off into purgatory
  yeahm used in japan doesnt seem to be on the same tier as used everywhere else  i already bought something from mandarake once and despite the warning saying the box was damaged what damage was actually there was pretty minimal and in a reasonable spot    or into a box lined with pillows to avoid them bouncing back and taking my eye out cw starscream already proved i cant be trusted with any firing weapons
           new thread migrate when ready
should a new thread be made
  thats some staleass memes there faggot
  if only this figure had fucking heels
    the mass release of the jungle/camo version was cancelled theres only a small initial batch of them out there
  this is on tfw2005  bunch of bay dick sucking assholes those fagamatrons would ban/close threads for the slightest disagreement of bay movies/designs back when bayformers was about to come out even after the movie came out any critique was met with bans/close threads  fuck those butt hurt assholes
  i miss when we got cool new optimus designs every series and not just g1 prime with the details tweaked again
  this is the case for a lot of franchises that originated 30something years ago they made actual progress during the 90s and early 00s in order to keep audiences interested but once their original fandom begins to hit their 20s its far more profitable to just pander to nostalgia
i want to turn my downstairs basement into a large scale city/village but i dont know which i want to go all out on the sets but dont know which will be better any opinions wanted
should i just do both    anyone else have similar set ups pics
  imo one of the best subthemes
  i dont keep up with lego too much anymore aside from checking out the aisles now and then that being said if you wanted a big lego city setup like in the lego movie i would think the city line would be a good place to start they have a good assortment of different kinds of building that look pretty good as well as things like fire trucks and other utility things get some road plates or build your own roads if you want anything fancy like skyscrapers or irregular buildings youll have to buy the parts and make them yourself     what id personally do/recommend is turn your basement into a large scale lego world with several different themes so youre not limited to one or two lines have your major city setup and have those roads lead into cowboy world/christmas village world/whatever have a train station that leads to hogwartsa port that has a pirate ship in it do whatever sounds cool
also start saving your pennies since that basement would have to cost well over 100k if not several 100s in bricks to make i have maybe 15k worth bought over a long period and many bought at discount or second hand and it doesnt even come close to whats on display in that basement
  youre op pic looks cool and if you have a dark basement make the buildings hollow and light them itd look great looks like it would cost a fortune to build though i guess with the basic buildings you could get away with using cheap china bricks or something in bulk from ebay
  ive always wanted to do this like the scene from the movie toys ive started several times using random things like cardboard cardstock and model kits ive recently bought a 3d printer and i think im going to start again legos seem to be a easy and easily customisable method but very costly good luck
  get a circular table about 4 to 5 foot across make what ever theme city you settle on into an island by having beaches or rocky cliffs surround the city with a bit a blue just at the edges of the table
i created this 118 spaceport city rotgut station in my playroom all wood construction so its sturdy enough for actual play whatever materials you use just decide if its going to be strictly for display or accessible for play the overall shape/design/layout should allow you to easily reach into any areas for play or photography think of a city sized open dollhouse design or modular city blocks that can be rearranged
  hey i built a building in that picture
  its missing something
  what in the hell
  im always impressed by this you did an awesome job anon
  easily one of the coolest figure display places ever
  im working on something similar had to buy a couple new storage containers to hold all the sections so they dont collect dust
  dat file name
  desmond is not amazing
in hong kong there seems to be a toy expo from 22  25 at the exhibition centre would it be worth to go for a day given the 20 entry fee     here is the website 
  do you live in hong kong or just visiting if living sure  if you are just visiting how long for and would you be skipping something else for this  are you from a place that has toy industry shows a lot or would this be an interesting novel experience for you
  im there for about two weeks and plan on wandering about quite a bit this seems like a good way to fill up the time ive seen my fair share of events and this peaked my interest
  then by all means go   two weeks in hk is plenty of time to get your fill in and you can definitely get something else done on the same day
its the new transformers thread    this is the old one  
  was alternators/kp optimus any good
  wrong thread you can probably find some here  
  no hes like one of those pickup spychangers looks ok isnt well articulated
  yes hot rod was the best one though
  what arcee is that
  hello mtmte head
  you were expecting optimus but it was me blitzwing
do you think anyone has used tr trypticon to give themselves a blowjob
    iron factory
  iron factorys pink assassin
  he does the thing with the torso stripe
not even the trailer is safe from cartoon accuracy
            this looks neat but not 440 neat
looks like all the truck parts fold up into the back you can see a piece of the grill on top
  i like the little figures they remind me of pic related
    i thought this was a colour edit of the grey proto    i guess it looks about what i expected i wouldnt be so opposed if it were only 200
price correction incoming
  599 us dollars
  that waist  im puking
  the little trailer space ship thing looks better on this than on mp10
  im not going to lie i think that looks pretty fucking great for what its trying to do  but at 400 with that backpack not so much
  that starscream head is pretty cool      its also neat that it has season 1 and 2 heads im pretty much done with mps though i dont like really big transformers and mps always have issues now such as fucked up ratchet joints or slathered all over in paint that will easily rub scratch or chip and are easily fargile so its just an expensive statue that ill never transform or get to fiddle with and the prices just keep going up its nice that theyre including all these accessories to try and justify the price point but its still a lot when mp10 was around 180 as recently as last year at retail at toys r us prior to the bankruptcy
    i hate to say it but not really i do not like what they did with his shoulders and i do not like what they did with his legs why would he be a dodge ram anyway        i hate to say it  again  but that looks pretty sweet        elaborate
  whats that rope
  not much head room
  preview of starscream attempt 2 i hope so
  its a gas hose original toy came with one for the repair bay
    tradition son its a fuel line for roller
    oh cool
so what reuses for the prime mold would you guys like to see
  g2 toy with a extra comic head with a few bullets in it
  head with a few bullets in it  god i wish that were me
  i wish that were you too anon
                  500 for muh cartoon accuracy prime  who the fuck would buy that
                  recycled accessory ideas from ths02  all those ugly gaps  red plastic parts poking out of ankle joints  that miserablelooking paintjob  not even any transparent parts inlaid into waist or forearms  insanely ugly shoulder elbow and waist joints  that fucking backpack kibble  trailer looks cheap as shit  the absolute state of the rear of the truck mode    this is an absolute step down in every appreciable way from mp10 and they want three times as much money for it i cant believe what im seeing here
  the guy below me
  oh i guess i should balance that out by saying    all the headsculpts are lovely  the minifigures look nice    thats it thats the only good things i can say about this figure takara have gone insane
  the guy above me
  ththanks
  ultra magnus
  what is wrong with his arm
  uuunnnnnhhhnnnh
  you mean your elbows dont look like that anon
  we are getting every version mp10 got and then some
  i put in an order before they pulled this so im interested to see what they decide to do im only keeping it in case amazon japan sells out to fast
  all these accessories for a cartoon and they didnt even bother to give optimus a basketball
so riddle me this why dose it take so long for takara to get mps out the door why not an early spring release instead of summer
  production numbers are higher than 3ps
          with every new picture we see it just keeps looking worse  how the fuck is this possible i hope this flops but you just know there are enough braindead geewunners out there that will buy three copies one to display in robot mode one to display in vehicle mode and one to keep misb      i remember early on when all the shills were saying well at least the back of the truck is going to look better than mp10 and like no it fucking doesnt look at that mess of hinges screws and hollow bits it looks like a bunch of random plastic shards that are just randomly forced together in the shape of a truck
  lol look at that random chunk of red plastic jutting down from the cab this thing is going to have like zero ground clearance    fucking takara they need to be put out of business over this this is probably the most egregiously horrible figure that anyone has dared to ask over 400 for
  hm i guess it is a lot more poseable than mp10 too bad it looks like utter shit from every conceivable angle
  look at that mess of hinges screws and hollow bits    agreed its about as slim as an actual truckbed at last but it doesnt look good at all at least mp10s cleaned up nicely even if it was too thick also look at  and see how far back the trailer hitches on for some reason gun storage is between the back of the cab and the hitch theres a massive gulf of open space there you cant even cover it up with the trailer awful
nothing new really for studio series it seems but hey dotm megatron is there
  dotm megatron  ever since his reveal they really dont seem to want to give us a good look at him
  probably because most of us unlike bayfags know its shit
  wow i think this is my most hated figure ever just everything about it is repulsive from the shards of plastic alt mode to the stupid cartoon aesthetic to them needlessly complicating one of the simplest transformation schemes in the entire history of transformers and the gall to ask 440 for this crap every single thing about this figure angers up my blood      for some reason gun storage is between the back of the cab and the hitch  fuck i didnt even notice that that right there is pathetic integrating the gun storage from idw prime was one of my favorite things about mp10 i remember how excited i was because i thought the mp series was redefining itself to create all star versions of characters which drew the coolest bits from different sources to create an awesome looking toy clearly we got shunted to the bad timeline somewhere between now and then
  it is odd the cartoon accuracy thing kills it for a lot of folks   i want it and will get it just not at the high us store cost   i will say i am interested to see how his skirt works seems it goes in when his thighs move
kinda wanting this bee
  the movie looks like total bayformers shit
  i wasnt aware
  man thats just a garbage design it makes him look like he has breasts
hopefully these dont suck
  predaking  i got bad news for you
  dont say that
  i think he looks pretty cool anon at least in combined mode i dont own him though sadly
cartoon accurate mp soundwave when
  looking at all those ugly diapers makes me wish more companies tried out this style of waist that x2toys used on their weird optimus prime    its hard to find a good example of it in action since no one bought this but basically the parts of the crotch plate that would cover the thighs are actually just a part of the thighs so like if youre sticking the leg out forward then the crotch plate just naturally moves as part of the leg rather than have to like fold up and look disgusting    i dont think x2toys execution of it is that good but i think the potential is there for a good design
  you see a bit how it works here
  no one does this you are so ass blasted about a toy that no one is twisting your arm to buy but please cry more about something that has no effect on your everyday life like a spoiled braindead child
does anyone elses siege fly wheels tank looks like it should be tabbing in more flush but not really i was wondering if this was just an issue on all of them due to the strange cheap storagebin like plastic they chose
      the guys inside me
  yeah the same timeline where robots can be faggots or trannies
i saw a picture of some textured furlike stickers for throne of the primes optimal optimus    i cant find any info on it did i imagine that
  t takaracuck
  bring back shogo hasui   not even shitposting i miss him that much
  if youre asking about his central cannon no it doesnt plug in all the way
    x2 is such a weird company amazing engineering stellar materials the worst sculpts youll ever see
line art vs actual animation    it is like gunpla all over again where people yelling and screaming about legs being too long or other shits     i know what takara is trying to do stay true to the original model but the problem is most people who watched the show and got their expectation from the animation and in the animation optimus prime barely shapes like its line art     in the animation the ops torso is much more pronounced enlonged instead of the purely cube like red torso the legs are also much thicker with its length relatively shorter compare to the torso     i dont know who is right in this fight over style but 50000 yen
  but nobodys yelling or screaming about any of that the only screaming is the one autist who always shitposts in these threads that the mp figures look too much like a cartoon that was made before he was born
    its called double elbow joints he has double knee joints too i know its scary living under the bricky tyranny of mp10 for so long but its true you can actually pose transformers
  no i meant where the shin panels go in vehicle mode
  v4 will need some noneuclidean engineering to pull this off for maximum accuracy  the question is which third party will give it a go first
                  is this the pokemon lets go of transformers
  no this is the opposite theres nothing overcasualized about mp44 i think a better comparison would be the cyberverse scout class figures that dont even transform all the way
  unwieldy impossible transformation  ugly action figure  useless truck mode  lmaoing at the life of the retards buying this unironically
going back to the bbts listing it says their opening per orders back up next week long shot but maybe takara took note of the mixed reaction to the price na retailers more than likely bitched at them too and are hopefully reconsidering the price just offer two versions of him takara one a limited takara mall exclusive dx version with everything seen here  plus the trailer the other a bare bones package including just prime ion cannon matrix axe and maybe spike and sparkplug
  liokaiser is kinda cool just wish theyd used a silverbolt and made him leozack would have looked better
  at last the dotm megatron i was waiting for  and it looks like shit
  well yeah thats what the design is
  the old figure looked good its just too small and the os kos need a container to import    its been 11 years get over it
  no i mean thats the megatron design where hes supposed to look like shit hes called hobotron for a reason
where would you be without me
  only one person is complaining about that shitty optimus  whatever makes you feel better champ
  tfw the ss figure i was anticipating the most ends up being the worst one
    geez the old dotm voyagers rubber cape looked better than that shit
                i seriously cant think of the last time i have been so repulsed by an action figure  how is this from the same company that has been knocking it out of the park with diaclone
  people that dont like overly design trash like you
  the first bumblebee was the worst
  this should be shot too
  he says talking about one of the most over engineered tf figures ever officially produced
  bonecrusher hump that truck
  jet prime looks like ass too    this whole display is pretty much wait and see if chinese will fix these later
  the dark background isnt helping either
  60000
bumblebee got big old tities
  im reading 35 000 where other than out your own ass are you getting 60 000 from
  no release date or price on the card  must be going to reveal officially them in a mag and the colored pics we got today were leaks
  thats what im thinking likely release of info is the middle of next month i heard
dotm leader megs is same size as rotf voyager megs according to someone there
  shit on this if you must but where else will we get a mad max style robo
  when did it become shitposting to prefer hasui he was always clearly the better designer for the mp line only people who disagreed were titsucking takaracucks and sunbowfags
  whoa ironhide looks big hes like towering over hound and sideswipe
  it is odd the cartoon accuracy thing kills it for a lot of folks  its not odd at all its a shit aesthetic that has no inherent appeal the only people who like it are brainlets soiboys who grew up with the show and cant let go of the past because of muh epic nostalgia get
  i guess that explains why his back looks like this then
  i didnt realize until now how small laserbeak and ravage are      he looks almost the same size as optimus
        you had one job warden  just compact the crab cannon of the dotm mold somewhere and oversize it fuck
  i cant remember specifically but i recall there being a few posts about a qc issue with flywheels that kept his tank from pegging together right could be wrong but that sounds familiar
  this all the way
i am tempted by mp44 because i knew the colors would tempt despite the price  but i own mp10 and mp10b  i also want the mp09 reissue    should i sell mp10 and keep mp10b in his place    also any shots of its matrix
  nvm i see the matrix just not in the chest also the arm arrows look like clear plastic inserts yellow possibly but nothing to back them up than the red
  why wouldnt he be big when this is the same line that made two voyagerheight leader classes just to keep the scale right
  nobody gives a flying fuck how you choose to waste your money
  is he doing the chad pose if this is the last new mp release i ever buy should it be this one
  at least it doesnt effect robot mode but man does it tickle my ocd weird for vehicle mode
  caring enough to post no one cares  you did enough to type that dunce
  stop buying masterpiece shit
post toys youre waiting for    big convoy reissue  ss shatter  ss constructicons  siege soundwave  siege shockwave
  what and buy those shitty walmart figures or are we wanking botbots now    why the fuck are we even here when we can go to 3p with that fucking mentality you poor fag
   scorponok   galvatron
  well im waiting for my artfire to arrive and im also waiting for a few 3p offerings but thats about it  maybe mpm ironhide depending on how that turns out
  i have an mp09 that never broke on me but i dont recommend it wait for hoodlum whos out later this month hes much cheaper and has a rodimus prime face even if he doesnt have a trailer
  big titty movie bumblebee
  and the shills are have arrived
  it became shitposting when it hurts their favorite companies quarterly profits   its a fragile company after all 50 year history be damned
  waiting for bbts to get my siege stuff and my mft hufferpipes duo
  can we appreciate the irony of /3pg/ being called poor fags
  weve gone through the looking glass    either that or sunbow/takarafags are just getting even more retarded
  can we appreciate masterpiece having the same overengineering that 3p got flak for
  i havent bought a single new transformer since titans return and i really dont plan on getting anything i have seen shown off except for maybe the ss devastator guys out of curiosity  there are a few 3ps that i am looking forward to like that sexy arcee and that weird little toilet dude
who else here enjoying their black friday trypticon wasnt really sure about him at 130 but at 70 he was simply irresistible totally worth it
    that megatron  that shatter
  ss constructicons  siege shockwave  ss dotm megatron   mpm ironhide    even if megs and ironhide are iffy ill just end up getting the improved kos down the line
  megatron himself isnt so terrible but his cape is laughably bad ill stick with the dotm voyager
  improved kos  start planning to add a new wing to your house
  paid full for mine when he was released zero regrets love that fat bastard
  wrong pic
  im super on board with a giant baystator
      it should tab more flush but its really easy to fix
  nice pic he is indeed a very glorious bastard totally gonna be setting up warzones in the next few days
  i dont understand why they ever took him off the line in the first place his run from mp10 to mp20 was the best the lines ever been
  he went on to the tlk line if i remember
  oh fuck me his cloak is an abomination
  i guess ill go and get the shotgun for my own    take this gift /tfg/
  id add mp21 and starsaber because one was cute and the other was rad respectively   otherwise im sour because the aa agenda lends itself to way too much compromise that im uncomfortable with
anyone remembers which ko brand was the cool become brave
  is the blue part his dick folding out
  straight up copy or are there any improvements to hugbot 9000
  90 degree elbow and knees that have no reason to be  nice nostaglia goggles
  cyberverse scout class figures that dont even transform all the way    i didnt know this was a thing until i bought one and i was so annoyed
  this photo makes it look like jazz has no arms
  well at least jetfires undercarriage look fairly minimal thats always a plus
  stop puking out bayverse ratshit toys nobody cares jesus fuck
  beast hunters says hello  you may want to repaint them though
  rotf lockdown is also a good choice  plenty of customs which play that angle up
  counterintuitively got rid of the spikes though
  any chance this backpack is removable or does the jackpack go on top of it it looks like the front of the cab forms the backpack kind of like how siege optimus does it
  the jetpack slips over the back of the toy and has a little clip near where that opening is 
  made before he was born is rather broad isnt it to enjoy the show as it aired you need to be born in the mid 70s even born on the year it aired puts you at 35  how many people here are that old
  spike and sparkplug are barely an inch high and have full motion shoulders hips knees neck and chest joints
  i always assume shitposting i only ever met one person that was a passionate toy collector past thirty and he never left his parents and was a blob of a manchild
  diaclone has to sell on the item alone transformers has nostalgia and name power behind it also this is the third attempt at making a masterpiece prime so you run into these troubles
  why is he a dodge ram anyway    i never got this if optimus were a tuner of any kind hed absolutely be an r34
    it was a push by hasbro they wanted the alternators line to branch out into trucks too and takara was very much gunshy about the idea as trucks are not nearly as common in japan due to their size they eventually reached a compromise theyd do the truck if it could be optimus prime to help it sell more to their domestic market so presumably either dodge got to them first as far as a licence went or they felt big american truck for big american appeal    ironically before the binaltech line was cancelled they were soliciting the figure as ginrai before ultimately not releasing it under that label anyway
  that angle makes dropkick look like a better toy in terms of robot mode
seriously anons why does he look like he has giant boobs    i mean just look at those headlights
hasbro leaks from baidu prices on right side are in chinese yuan
another set nezha  chinese tf crossover
  greenlight  neat
  the bottom block are web exclusives no idea what that means outside china probably amazon exclusives the potp ones
  ksi boss must be galvatron     voyager hero could be anyone but there arent many autobots left that warrant the size class could be aoe/tlk optimus could be hound maybe sentinel    tf3 leader optimus must be a voyager optimus with his jetpack and guns from the chicago fight
  also its good we have confirmation of aoe stuff since the aoe and ltk lines sucked and literally every character needs to be remade
  the one autist  yeah you keep telling yourself that tooner
  im sorry you cant read
  are we not gonna talk about fucking slamdance holy shit
  ksi boss is the body nitro zeus shares there were a few of them in the final battle in hong kong and we never saw their alt mode
  slamdance sideswipe and aimless are in a webexclusive set i wonder if the latter two have any changes from the single retail versions
  i know reprolabels has those for regular potp opop but im not sure about the throne version
  man he looks short
    flywheels redeco or new tooling
  what do you think the odds are that its some micromaster team renamed or like a repainted sixgun or cog
  we already have ravage and laserbeak in the line so id say more tapes arent out of the question could also be reissues of the originals like dial and zaur from those store exclusive studio series bumblebees
  elaborate     well hes got that mouth hole could just stick it in yknow
  like just white or one with car carrier armor cause id really like to see that
  nah i doubt wed be getting g1 cassettes in a mainline even if its an exclusive dial and zaur were just some random stopgap measure because they needed tapes for the whole 80s vibe thing and they knew nobody would buy them at jacked up prices unless they were something wed never gotten
  i think they got the left hand wrong that should be like his rotf one
siege voyagers are 40 in canada  deluxes are 30
i dont feel right
  how is this from the same company that has been knocking it out of the park with diaclone  implying diaclone reboot isnt generic realstic shit either    why takara not releasing repro vintage diaclone
  thundercracker   skywarp  barricade  springer  greenlight  leader class optimus prime    my body is ready    im interested in all the seekers and im curious if this new prime is him with his trailer perhaps using that ultra magnus mold
  i believe the new prime will be leader magnus redecoed into that plannedbutcancelled or diaclone or whatever it was optimus redeco of um from g1
  its a good mold and it sort of a waste having what is essentially two different sculpts of optimus prime in the line and not painting them both as prime
  imagine being so much of a pleb that youre upset we didnt get two optimuses in one wave
  more evidence suggests its going to be galaxy convoy um has the thigh guns and connector points where the two rail guns would attach
  im interested in all the seekers    honestly why     those legs thats vector primelevel worse
    powered convoy and i doubt theyll risk a blue optimus    but hope springs eternal    then again they might try to squeeze a delta magnus out of this as well making me wonder what kind of color scheme they could come up with for a straightup optimus exoskeleton
  just white
  that show is transformers if you think otherwise you shouldnt even be in this thread
  ive had hoodlum on preorder since i dunno 2015 or something to replace mp28 but mp09s hot rod bod mode is a thing of beauty i never get tired of looking at it
  if sideswipe is in g2 deco ill be on board
  i guess its possible but id really like to see them go the whole hog
  whats that damaged looking bit the wound that killed him in the movie
  theres a lot there i enjoy the white instead of gray looks a lot nicer than i expected it looks great from the front the articulation is superb and unlike hound it actually has some level of detail instead of being smooth everything even potentially having panel lining in the legs but then as the other anon mentioned theres the red showing in the ankle tilts the backpack clashes with everything and looks horrendous with the jetpack attached and the rear of the truck doesnt appear to be very clean    im torn on it the overall transformation looks impressive but ill probably wait to see if it has fragility or paint chipping issues like mp36
  yeah
  nice
  just what every boy wanted
  if this is real it probably means that stepper might have a targetmaster
  im so in love with this please dont have any qc issues like dinobot      i dont know looks just as bad as the original to me      leader tf3 optimus and potential mpm 12 reissues i could use that starscream
  im curious if this new prime is him with his trailer perhaps using that ultra magnus mold  repainting the first actual proper armored ultra magnus toy since 1986 into optimus prime  when delta magnus exists  i think that will just be the end for me i can no longer live within the horrid grasp of this monkeys paw
  thing i dont like
  i keep meaning to pick this guy up he looks rad as fuck
  i hate the god damn chest window hinges so much is that seriously the best they could do
  hes probably better than that awful deluxe class one i only got that because it was two packed to prowl who i wanted significantly more
  i wonder if the jetpack can fit on mp sideswipe
  more fembot shit  get ready for another sticcbot with a huge backpack and massive panels of the alt mode hanging off of every limb  yes neat indeed
  itll be chromia with a new head you dumbass
  this is /toy/ go to /co/ faggot
  which proves my point dumbass
  whoa whoa whoa since when are we getting a stepper
  with what the mp line has turned into it kind of blows my mind we got a figure of that guy
  but huge backpacks and panels hanging off of every limb is what the golden age of tf toys was according to these threads
  were getting 2 exclusive potp toys stepper/ricochet and red swoop apparently under a sub line called select series    we only know they exist oh and theres also one for megatron in a unreleased g2 color scheme but i havent checked up on that
    to be fair that backpack folds down way more than that and those arm panels flip around to stick out the front less you might still not like the truck kup for the reasons you already stated but the titans return one also doesnt really have to turn into anything in particular
  implying diaclone reboot isnt generic realstic shit either  what the fuck does that even mean      fucking hell i come back to these threads in time for the mp44 shitfest but somehow missed an actual interesting announcement
  well not a real announcement we just know they exist because a store had them in their systems its the same store that leaked the existance of the new siege flywheels
  pretty flimsy excuses i own both kups and like them both for different reasons but the engineering on old generations figures was pretty shit at times very much robot wearing car armor vs robot that is a car  but the titans return one also doesnt really have to turn into anything in particular  it had to turn into kups derpy truck mode the fact that its not a conventional vehicle doesnt invalidate the far more clever engineering behind it and really the old generations figure had way more leeway because both modes were left as mostlyblank slates while the tr figure was operating under the new mo of g1 with joints whatever designer was working on gen kup had carte blanche to design a good toy with tons of freedom for both modes and sergeant kibble is what he decided to come up with      you know i got excited for stepper but hes just gonna be a repaint of the pretty meh potp jazz mold what i really want is an mp stepper to go with artfire but sadly with the state of the mp line even if a jazz mold ever happens i know itll be an absolute disaster and cost 150
missed out on a cheap uw devastator right as i was about to buy it    im so fucking mad
  ouch that stings i really love how uw devastator turned out so i wish you the best in getting one in your budget
  as far as im concerned warden has brought about the golden age
  because they had clever transformations better articulation and original alternate mode ideas instead of just heres a deluxe that wants to be a masterpiece but fails thatll be 20
  original alternate mode ideas  dude no fun allowed because we gotta get the sweet bay bucks hurt those lines so much
  what
  no fun allowed  hftd seaspray joins the fray    what other period of transformers can you find seaspray as a giant bamf hovercraft instead of a manlet 80s dinghy how is hftd seaspray not fun
  how is hftd seaspray not fun  it doesnt look like muh 80s cartoon so its baaaaaaaaaad okay
  someone somewhere beat off to this comic
  megatron wanted two obviously
so its normal for this to not tab in flush and all the way
  please god
  if only hasbro had allowed takara to make a uw predaking that figure is such a letdown
  trying hard to justify that price tag
omega spreem remold never
  no bright colors no fantasy vehicle modes muh realism cause movie ruined everything  generations seaspray is a pillar of manliness with his girls tattoo on his arm  meanwhile this guy is so gay he put his gay lovers name right on his chest
  i feel like every single bit of g1 optimuse prime nostalgia is trying to vicariously live through that one sequence of animation because its the only time it was any damn good its like watching a kid try and convince himself that his abusive layabout alcoholic father is actually the best ever because he keeps remembering that one time they went out for ice cream and minigolf
  this is the most i can tab it in it seems like tolerance issues causes by that crotch piece being entirely coated
  how do you explain the fact that people are happy this figure actually has the season 1 head design as an alternate head you can swap out
  yours looks like it goes in more than mine though unless its just the angle
  it does go in more but still not all the way flush inconsistent tolerances between different pieces is one of the issues of coated parts
  those random bits of red plastic in the ankle are like the ultimate bullshit how do you make the transformation of optimus prime so needlessly convoluted that the ankles end up anywhere near something that needs to be red
  i got this on clearance for five bucks and it still ended up getting donated    people over hyped it like hell because seaspray had not had a decent figure in a long time and because the geewun purists gravitated toward it since it looked less bayformerish then the rest of that movie line    it was a strange time
  any solutions or should i just ignore it i mostly just have him in robot mode anyways
  being this much of a pedant  the only point im trying to make is that if you ask any geewunner to prove to you how cool optimus prime is 99 of them are going to link you to a youtube video of that exact scene its literally all theyve got
  you could shave off material/paint blocking the joint but you need to figure out where to shave
  and that scene where he starts shooting like a maniac and that other scene where he murders like 30 decepticons    and thats pretty much it
  sounds like youre making strawmen because you dont like the g1 cartoon chill bro people can like different things
  isnt that basically all in the same sequence
get the q formers skywarp and thundercracker  expect completely shit toys since i only bought them on a whim  theyre great    now i regret not getting them when they were originally released
  ones from the episode where teh aerialbots travel back in time the other i cant remember but its not from the film theres gifts of the second one ill bring it up in a bit
potp arcee is realz
emails are going out saying that masterpiece trex megatron is delayed until april
  good now i can save up money for it
  why didnt you have any saved up before
  finally a fembot that represents realistic body standards
  because it was being released the month after christmas and after october 1st i quite setting aside money or buying things for myself so i can buy things for people i care about a january release just wasnt effective for my month to month budget plan
  shut your mouth whore
  anon
  fat loser autobot is manly  toy that has a cool design and his own name tattooed on his chest is lame  right ok
  are you serious i mean money was getting tight because of the holidays a d having preorders set for unicron and big convoy but i was really really looking forward to this one
  nice reading comprehension
  seaspray and his stand o c e a n m a n
  maybe a new head maybe
  fuck i should have bought that hftd seaspray when i saw it
  you want mine
welp i may get this mold after all
new thread        
  go away archer
  whoops        
  absolutely not
  fuck off the mods keep deleting your spam for a reason  spamming/flooding  evading spam filters
  my god why did they give chromia so many greebles and why the fuck did they remove the combiner function when they were going to release a second use of the mold the 5fembot elita could have been real
  t butthurt idwcuck
  we dont need a new thread theres 20 pages of topics on a board we have a long time before we scroll off to the bottom
  you seem butthurt senpai i know you are the one who reports anyone calling out your shit
  weve been doing threads right after bump limit so i really dont mind
  youre a ban evading spammer you dont count
  nah i just report people for off topic posting 
  im not that faggot kiraposter tho
  no basketball
  no way jose go get banned for two weeks again      
  heh hobo megs is so homeless his truck mode has an unkept beard
  reminder to report this banevading shitposter on sight he got banned for this spam just yesterday but cant stay away from /tfg/
  
  i do not believe you and i refuse to post in that faggots b8 thread
why is it that its only /tfg/ that seems to struggle with creating new threads christ i thought hot wheels collectors were autistic but weve got some really soft skulls in this fucking crowd
  one shitposter makes his bait thread every time nobody wants to go there anons wait for someone to make the real thread and nobody wants to go first
  about that
  yep but at least i had a back up firebolt i got in a weird auction on ebay the auction had tr hot rod and lg firebolt and since they didnt know much about firebolt and was missing his weapons he was sold for 9 bucks
performin for u
so red swoop and ricochet are entertainment earth exclusives any other sites getting them
  this  if it has that shitty copypasta about going to tv or co its usually his dumbass mods have been deleting it since it counts as automated spambot
  bbts has them listed probably just online exclusives
  the crushinator
                    you guys asked for this piece of shit
  y00 h00
  i literally asked for anything but
    it better have combiner war peg slots for equipping combiner limbs then and a wing saber partsformers would work
  what the fuck does that even mean  the new micronauts are lame generic halo copycats and the robots also lack any character
  blitzwing
    this is the happiest looking transformer i have ever seen

  it looks so stupid desu id gladly trade the blue hair for a ss one also the noncanon head version is so much better
all of these ass blasted retards who think only two retailers will ever get their hands on the new super figures
  why wont they just make the ss4 version since they already have goku and vegeta in ss4
comes with a base head
  but so ss head i swear power levels in dragon ball make no sense regular gogeta should have beenabel to keep up with broly and ssj gogeta would have been more than enough ssb gogeta should be the most powerful character besides angels
face it autists gogeta is being released thanks to the movie if it wasnt for it god knows when you wouldve gotten it stop complaining about your ssj gogeta the movie is about ssb gogeta and thats what youre getting at least for now
    figurerise    yikes dude
  oh whatever who really cares that much ssj is cooler looking and more iconic but ssb is in right now
is gotenks out in your neck of the woods i preordered one at my local comic shop and it still hasnt shown up yet i see its out at bbts and on amazon and everything so im wondering if my store is weird or if its just taking awhile to hit all the brick and mortal retail places  have you seen a sf gotenks for sale at the brick and mortar stores where you usually get figuarts
  dont collect them myself but they are great for customs and repaints
  nostalgia faggot retard if blue had been the original ssj color and we were just now getting super saiyan yellow youd be saying the same shit try thinking for yourself
why is bandai utterly incompetent when it comes to scale is it really so difficult to pull out your previous figures and make sure shit is the same size
  armor trunks might actually be physically older than super trunks both are likely younger than xeno trunks
  how could armor trunks be older than super trunks it honestly seems like they based super trunks on the mold from time patroller likely candidate for trunks 20 which is supposed to be accurate to trunks first appearance where he is physically younger than his armored appearance     but thats a production issue it doesnt line up with the show in any way
  i just watched the episode where trunks leaves the hyperbolic time chamber a couple days ago characters specifically comment on how older he looks after his year in there
  if you ordered it from a comic shop it means itll get there whenever diamond ships it check their site for shipping lists
  arent figuarts distributed by bluefin not diamond
  i havent seen/watched the goku black arc so i dont know where super trunks came from or if hes even the same trunks that arrived during the cell saga
  nope time patroller is taller pic related someones custom trunks made on the time patroller body
  he is after defeating cell he got however long worth of peace until babidi showed up then not too long afterwards black started fucking his timeline up    super should also be the same size as xeno because the newer heroes trunks who is trunks following the xenoverse timeline has many aspects of super trunks including the red ascot super saiyan rage and the spirit sword
the complete lack of reviews of this solid color trunks head despite its high demand brings me ginyu flashbacks
  how could armor trunks be older than super trunks it honestly seems like they based super trunks on the mold from time patroller likely candidate for trunks 20 which is supposed to be accurate to trunks first appearance where he is physically younger than his armored appearance   future trunks scale is literally perfect so a 20 should be the same size the 10
  isnt armored trunks like in the grade 2 of super saiyan
fuck broly and gogeta this is what i need
depression is unironically settling in because i missed out on broly preorder    literaly cant get out of bed and even called in sick because i missed out
  are you nonus
  where did you find this pic hes looking great
  none of your business
  cant wait to get my hands on chadgeta
  no and how would that explain xeno trunks
  im guessing he goes up next month since he comes out a month later whyd he have to be an exclusive
  i already told you where to look and bluefin will distribute it to western sites hell you can find him on amazon right now but good luck with actually getting it from them
      here you go
  ah thank you
  lmao
    mine is being shipped but its super sketchy that no one has posted pics
  super vegetas leg cant do this is this trunks body never opened mine
  its the trunks legs
  speaking of scale issues
  its not that inaccurate vegeta is not depicted as short as he used to be anymore
i was able to preorder from cd japan last night but ive never bought from them before anyone have any experience with them
why do you call it a budget edition when it looks good at least to me its all i could afford if only i could afford the figuarts
  your customs fucking suck
    honestly you might as well just let the amazon order set since they come out last anyways got my roe goku for 30 after i missed all the initial orders    just stalk out the us orders soon be sure to check the likes of usagundamstore as that mofo seems to have shit for the cheapest and 10 off coupons are easy to find year round bbts orders will be easy to stalk out after the initial sellout because people will cancel orders out all the goddamn time just be sure to check the different packaging grades as it doesnt do a good job showing you stock for each      theyre legit i usually get my expensive ass metal builds through them and they always packaged them well
so i was going through some problems and couldnt preorder the new trunks how fuck am i at getting him now
  according to  he goes up on the 14th of this month
  i cant say no to that but im getting better i now have a house and i can start using better equipment to sell
  where you located good amount of sites still have preorders up
  youre right im ready
  if youre in the us bbts has had him popping in and out of stock all day so id check there occasionally
  usagundamstore as mentioned before has him in stock use coupon reddit10now
  current vegeta height is almost perfect for that now hes taller than vegeta has ever been depicted and taller than every prior vegeta
  why do you call it a budget edition  its all i could afford  if only i could afford the figuarts
  usagundamstore  will they charge me now or when the figure ships
  jesus christ it looks like theyre forcibly taking a cock up their asses
  theyll charge now but i havent found any better prices than theirs stateside only sites i can think of that dont charge upfront are bbts and amazon    not sure if poopoopanda charges upfront but they have it in stock as well
  damn ill have to take my chances that they still have it by friday
  did df just do a solid version for trunks this and ui heads are very disappointing compared to their prior head sets
  go back to making shitty customs and getting free figures from your friend    you must not be educated in the angels_figures lore
  i dont deal with budget  poorfag editions dont care about this angels_figureswhateverthefuck lore
amazon says broly is 3 pounds no fucking way
  probably am error since hes about the same height as the og broly fig
  budget figure  manages to mold the vest as a separate piece  figuarts cant do this  what the hell bandai
only places in aus i am finding preorders for the broly is 130 92usd and 120 85usd for gogetas    should i go for it or wait for nippon yassan and ami ami to open up their orders again
wait 1 day  can just casually order the figures on amazon and other western sources with zero worries or effort    see no use freaking out about any of this
  but you get the figure late why would you order from us sites
  i ordered mine like a week and a half ago but it only shipped yesterday    will keep you posted
  dude i know     if youre an american and youre sweating these import site preorders i dont understand you
  i have yet to see gogeta and broly on amazon may i have their links please
  search figuarts gogeta or figuarts broly     they are right there
  thats honestly the first time theyve shown up for me thank you
what are the chances that amazon runs out of stock on broly and gogeta like they did with goku black
  no idea just preorder them you can cancel later
    you guys do know preordering on amazon is pointless right youre not guaranteed a reservation and you wont get your figure until 23 months after its release
  ive preordered dozens of bluefin bandai releases on amazon and ive never had a cancellation or gotten one more than 5 or so weeks after release in japan
  waiting over a month to get a package just so you can save 15 bucks on shipping  if youre cool with it then more power to you i guess
  the only times this has happened were when bluefin was either  a fighting amazon over bullshit and amazon still came through on items   b bluefin shorted everyone on that figure
  its not like its a game and someone is going to spoil the story its a toy what kind of person is incapable of waiting any longer than release date for an action figure
  i occasionally see people on /toy/ saying whats taking amazon / bbts so long so quite a few people actually
  that guy literally is acting like waiting a month past japan is horrifying     for a toy thats not reasonable or normal
  i want to see the sfw version
  broly would stand no chance against base form gogeta everyone thinks broly is so bad ass but hes not even as strong as cell bojack is stronger than broly for whatever reason though everyone thinks broly is just amazing even though all he is is a roided our autistic person he has the dumbest motivation of any character in fiction not just dragonball but the entirety of fiction
  just wait for madman to stock it theyve been releasing all the dbz figuarts so far plus with free shipping itll probably work out about the same as paying retail price
hurry up faggots
i got gogeta  spike this morning its gonna be a good fuckin day
    broly is stronger than cell  bojack but he only lost because he has that shitty weak spot in his stomach from where he was stabbed
god damn every time i see this threads thumbnail i always think this is the sas thread for a second
  the gogeta form is considered cheating it takes 2 to handle broly would like to see how they handle this on even ground with brokale broly  kale
  just got mine in amiami may have been a cluster fuck but this was smooth sailing
  imagine the sex
  got em im sure theyll be sold out before noon
  goes to madman because ive never heard of it  110 bucks for buu  lol that site is shit
  lol you think you need to tell us
      good good
what happens to all those unsold toys /toy/ i was just thinking about all these ugly megazord toys i remember seeing at tru in its closing days still unsold in their last days did some liquidator buy them and is just sitting on them ready to reappear next year at closeout stores or are they simply trashed
  after a period of 999 days unsold they fall into a crack to the dimension of unloved toys where they become daemonically infested only to reappear in a violencestricken region of the world where some unlucky child happens upon them and forges a pact with the dark powers
  that fucking thing is the kind of toy that gets me wondering if skimping on engineering was really the right decision here  its not even imposing and has limbs sculpted that do nothing
  i thought they get sent back to the manufacturer and sit in their warehouse forever trashed  not sure where the money goes in that case at least they no longer clog their own space
theyre sold to outlets for pennies and end up dollar stores and sold in mexico probably
  fpbp
  plastic cant be recycled the same way metal or glass can can it
  maybe they can be turned back into plastic pellets
  sell toyline to retailers  performs poorly  retailers send you back unsold stock for pennies on the dollar  recycle into raw materials for another toyline  retailer and toy company write off the loss against taxes  rinse and repeat    is the entire toy industry a giant producersesque scam
id love to find a warehouse of unsold robot toys from the 80s and 90s ala the end of raiders of the lost ark
  some anon did  toys were cool as fuck though
  overall as a whole probably
  the plastic used for toys can be recycled but its a pain to disassemble and separate them into the various plastic types
  theyre sold to outlets for pennies and end up dollar stores and sold in mexico probably    yeah dollar store / big lots / etc then sent to india or south america
i know in japan if those yearly sentai toys arent clearanced out by the next new sentai show they go to the garbage
  so china
  outlets buy them in the uk at least this is stores like bm poundland tk maxx homesense etc  this is why you sometimes mysteriously find great toys in bargain stores    couple months ago they were selling tr sixshots in my local bm for 1999 as an example
  id love to find a warehouse of unsold robot toys from the 80s and 90s ala the end of raiders of the lost ark  somebody post the pictures
  it costs more to store them than could be recouped at a certain point like a game of hot potato you dont want to be the last person holding the inventory

con recap  malfoy plus snape coming in may  iron man heartbreaker and shotgun  captain marvel preorders tonight/tomorrow and star force version coming soon nebula scarlet witch teen groot  winter soldier bucky and cap  avengers 1 thor hulk loki coulson  stormtrooper luke and han esb pilot luke esb yoda dagobah r2 and a grievous comeback  aquaman and cyborg shown again but no dates      ah shit i missed that looking through the photos thanks for the correction
  big day tomorrow/today shit starts in less than 12 hours what will you be getting
  gonna try to get a preorder for gogeta and captain marvel but ill more than likely miss out on gogeta
  gonna get that broly
baked potato man gets a figuarts  why
  multiple brick walls
  spike  carol dont give a shit about anything else
  debating that myself though knowing my luck the chinks would rip them off nice and quickly
  wanna get gogeta broly too but ive got so much going on already that im kind of sweating
  just belialsama
  why havent they made colorful explosions like they made fire effects the chinese fire effects are fucking phenomenal and theyre just sort of lazy with the explosions even the lightning has more colors
  look at that long torso
  what does that mean no articulation why would the make a jedi luke of all things a statue
  maybe because hes too damn popular i dont know but yeah no articulation considering how they re released him not too long ago it wouldnt make sense to re release him again
  bunch of leftover heads from returns of figures with snapped wrists
  jabbas palace luke is different enough from death star luke that it wold be a new figurethey have most of him already and all theyd need to make is a new torso and possibly new head it doesnt make sense to make a dynamic character thats already mostly done into a statue  also if theyre making him a statue why give him a cloth cape
  ive asked myself that before maybe bandai are doing effects internally now to avoid these situations perhaps not sure on their structure so would be pointless to say for sure i have 1 brown and 1 pink explosion piece that came with their robot damashii promotion but would have loved some more pinks and even some blues might have to try and track down some of the most neutral clear colour and throw in some colour leds
what the hell went wrong during the production of shf iw bucky    only one trigger finger and cant even hold the lmg properly  lmg is around 10 too small if scaled properly to buckys height  knife permanently attached to sheath  ab crunch is super limited unless you like huge gaps  waist is super constricted    shame its such a rush job the ws bucky is looking great so far hopefully it does much better on every aspect
  gogeta broly and maybe captain marvel
  i ended up cancelling my iw bucky preorder upon seeing the winter soldier version best look he had in the films imo and looks to be a superior figure shame
  gunning for belial broly and carol
  gunning for spike but i really hope we still get the one with the coat and blood all over his face
metal build going up the same night  yeah its gonna be impossible to login time to look for other options just to be safe
  yeah ideally id shop at hlj but their website is hot shit you are forced to try and preorder with obscure and potentially unreputable stores nowadays if you want a chance at all    cdjapan might pull through for me though
  watch that be an exclusive
this is a special page since this product is expected to have many views due to popularity  whats that amico
wew hobbysearch is way way cheaper than amiami especially brolly they will probably last about 2 seconds
  please no dont do this to me
no star wars    gimme droids you jap bastards
want spike  but i want real folk blues spike  nobody buys normal spike  blues spike is cancelled/exclusive    i hate this shit
  dont worry anon im still getting normal spike even if blues spike is my preferred design   also nice trips of three
  good thing i only want normal spike
  whos not buying normal spike that isnt also buying blues spike im getting both because the ones we should be nervous about are the rest of the cast
  
  the problem isnt going to be people not ordering regular spike the problem is going to be nobody ordering vicious and blues spike making the already slim chance of the rest of the bebop crew happening to zero
when is hlj updating with the figures
guess im ordering multiples
  faggot
  
it took 21 minutes but i finally got mine ordered
  calm down anon i was just making a joke  i only wanted one of each
  took me 24 but i finally got carol
hlj    
hlj stuff is going up just search for the name and add to cart from the search page    spike is actually 30 yen cheaper there
  and his page wont load yeet
        dbz figs way cheaper too
  lol who cares about that lame shit
  already sold out anyways lol
so why is this dude wearing an astroturf skirt
got my carol and spike orders in time to head to bed
  still available i guess most people are waiting for the bloody version or his popularity is overhyped
  japan doesnt give a rats ass about bebop and most normalfags dont know about amiami
  overhyped in my opinion i never cared for that anime
  its comfy and its supposed to be fur
  overhyped and not every fan would necessarily want a figure from the series i love bebop but even i didnt think hed sell out immediately
  ditto times like these im glad im not into the real bloodbath shit      i dont think anyone honestly thinks hes gonna be super popular him being another lupin with the other characters trapped in exclusive hell is much more likely
  still no cloud city luke    god damn it maybe next year
  everyone else has given reasons but as soon as this shit touches stateside hes going to be sold out and selling for 9k minimum
  poed this version  april comes paid for order  got it  2 weeks later new spike now with trenchcoat new face plates  better paint  bring arts 2b all over again  fuck you bandai im not falling for this shit again show me all your cards first
  more likely  this goes up  fuck you bandai wheres ___ version  this doesnt sell  licence dropped  fuck you bandai when we getting more characters11
cowboy bebop isnt popular  picrelated  top kek
  you just woke up or something it was just recently only sold out hours later unlike broly  gogeta that instantly closed within seconds and still struggling also spikes order will be reopen later for the next batch po quota
  newfag detected
  no thanks waiting for the superior version you normalfags can just fuck each other with the barebone version
only on /toy/ does selling out within hours somehow equate to a lack of popularity
  only you are retarded enough not to understand that items from shows that arent popular are ordered in smaller quantities
  toy looks better than the actual actress  this is funny as hell
well im excited for carol her character may be all over the place in the comics but im glad were starting to see more releases beyond the usual waves of iron man/cap and people seem to forget that tony was stuck in a similar blist position of this guy is a dick is he supposed to be a badguy prior to the movies really locked down his personality and popularity
  tony was stuck in a similar blist position  a big mystery for me because hes always been a modern howard hughes antihero with much richer story imo than all those repainted superman shitters
  you have a source on this or is it common sense
check order confirmation from amiami  theres something wrong  i ordered two gogetas instead of a gogeta and a broly
  and the second gogeta order was canceled
  explain to them that it was a mistake and ask to cancel one ive done it before no big
not sure where else to post this and didnt think it warranted its own thread    if anyone wants these to actually be useful theyll have to buy 2 at the very minimum wont they
  you do know the coat version wont have the coat removable right im getting both if the coat version does come out
  but what happens to the sold out broly hes fucked
  yeah that part is a shame maybe hell go up again but i say its better than getting two of the same fig
dbzfags are retarded
  tried to order one last night  amiami refused to fucking load past the cart page  i hate this fucking site post upgrade  do preorders usually come back in stock or is this one of those figma preorder situations where you are fucked until they actually come out
people are legitimately panicking about not being able to order a figure that will be readily available without question
  hours  that isnt bad at all for a nondb anime release
  amiamis preorders do sometimes pop back up as available keep checking around when they would generally update
  i have the wall from the homecoming set and it would be more useful if the bottom base was more modular
  order through mobile it seems to be an issue with the desktop version be sure to check your cart before checking out though the desktop version seems to add to the cart even though it implies that it hasnt
  source is every store ever so yeah common sense
  whoever is making the poses for advertising this wall hes my kinda guy
  smell it
guess im holding out for the next captain marvel i want a bree larson damnit
  trusting nip preorders in a post medicom gyro world
  you dont even need to buy dragon ball figuarts from nip companies their main audience is the west domestic companies can and will get them from bluefin absolutely no problem
  oho very nice
  nah man go try finding old broly base goku or 18 for a decent price poing allows you to get it for the intended price    yea for 20 moreshipping and some sites wont get or ship the figure out until much later
  i was actually able to get old brody and 18 from barnes and noble for around 20 less each thanks to coupons
  nah man go try finding old broly base goku or 18 for a decent price poing allows you to get it for the intended price  actually comparing figures from a year or more ago to to current figures being released next year  are you brain damaged son
  i see you dont know how to follow a conversation some regular releases are hard to find nowadays they arent readily available
  i want battle droids and super battle droids
  youre not the one following the conversation here fucko the original statement made by me who you quoted was that people are stupid for being worried about getting a preorder from two of the many dozens of websites that will be selling this figure some of whom are based in the country in which they live
  you do realize that every site that put them up for po closed them in 20 or or so mins right any site outside of japan that gets them are going to go through the same shit im going to need you to rub your few brain cells together and remember that broly is wildly popular in japan and gogeta always had a steady fanbase these figures are definitely in danger of being scarce
take your dumb cancerballz argument to the containment thread retards
  you dont seem to understand that amiami and hlj arent the only ones who sell these figures and the us sites will likely get even more stock because of bluefin once you understand how retail works im sure youll get the hang of it champ
  every site means 2 sites  you dont even have an argument anymore outside of  its going to happen like this because i say so
  bandai are faggots and do this for every other release to build interest from dumb collectors
  i believe this after seeing bandai lie about mario having a new box ill believe they will pull any underhanded jewish tactics to increase interest/sales faggots
  holy shit dude fuck off about the mario box
  i remember when you guys acted like evil buu would be a nightmare to get overseas and i just casually ordered it on amazon     even goku black was a snap to get
  on amazon  see you a month after release  black  people still complain about how hard it was to get black or how they still dont have him
  see you a month after release  its a toy what kind of person cares about getting it first its not like someone is going to spoil it like a movie or something
nobody fucking cares  shut the fuck up already
  fucking marvel wheres roxas and more kingdom hearts shit did they get shut down by square or something i know theyre dabbling in melting plastic into grotesque parodies of their own characters
  see you a month after release  oh no an entire month never hurts to wait it out these days when you get mafex still putting out duds or bandai putting out captain america with his fake beard anyway     anyway take your dragonball shit to your containment general
  it took hours instead of minutes so its unpopular
  final form sora just came out i guess the line didnt really take off though which is a shame hopefully well keep getting a couple releases a year org roxas casual roxas kh2 riku and xemnas i think is pretty reasonable to expect assuming the line isnt completely dead
if carol hadnt sold out before she sure as shit will now that trailer was slick
  really looked extremely by the books sure hasnt made me want to place down a preorder
  yeah im really glad i ordered when i did
  she came off wooden and stereotypically hero movie character like in the trailer     it made me want the figure less
mfw spike is actually getting sold out
  youre gonna carry that weight
  this unironically i didnt hate the trailer or even the lines she was given rather her delivery just fell kinda flat in most scenes
  ami still have it
spike is available again you fucktards
so will he be paralyzed from the waist down
bbts has spike gogeta and broly if only as a last resort
    spending more money on importing a figure     ok buddy
  i didnt understand the sash for a second and thought he was tenting his robes
  its just a prototype you stupid newfag
  likely the hooded coat looks exactly like the sleeves texturally which probably means its hard sculpted plastic the folds and drape of his sash and robe also look way too good to be actual cloth so they are likely hard plastic as well    all of his points to his entire body basically being an immobile statue with only his arms and head poseable and in fact moving his arms would look terrible seeing as his sleeves are sculpted to drape over the throne arms why isnt this a figuarts zero again
  you dont know what a prototype is do you
  the fact that the knees seem to be sculpted on the robe is what scares me the most like hes supposed to stay in that position only
    bandai is messing with fabrics    please stop
  everything looks plastic to me cant really see any fabric desu
  its not fabric you stupid fuck
  do you
      damn you guys got mad real quick they really sculpted the plastic to fit over the arm rests like fabric how the fuck do you pose this thing
  same much better than the last one if anything itll be a visual spectacle like doctor strange or thor ragnarok does
  how did i get mad all im saying is that i cant see any fabric there    how the fuck do you pose this thing  you dont apparently
  you dont know the concept of interchangeable parts  fuck where are all these stupid cocks coming from
who was your go to toy your buddy you took with you when you traveled pic related was mine i thought the movie got the rights to use his design and name because i had him before i watched the movie he took up a lot of abuse from me before he went to the toy chest in the sky
cabbage patch doll
with a radical motorcycle helmet this guy went all over north america and for a few weeks in france my dad also used him as a pilot model for his rc plane for a few summer a chip in the neck makes the head pop out very easily but i still have him sitting in my office
sort of had this guy since 95
my boy plus the minicon grindor
super powers superman
these guys
some sort of gi joe figure
  i lost the ring in a supermarket every time i went back i would look for it for like a year those poor slave wage workers would help me look tirelessly for my kryptonite ring i just thought maybe its on the floor that gets cleaned daily
these two went everywhere i went for a while   they had epic battles in such places as yosemite national park disneyland and mexico before skeletor finally finally defeated he man by kicking him into a geyser in iceland  i mourned he man for days until i got my first ninja turtles
  thats the toybiz superman
this et plush  spoilermy sisters ripped his vinyl skin off and i was inconsolable /spoiler
this and a neopet plush i think
  i mourned he man for days until i got my first ninja turtles  something about that is both hilarious and cruel
i didnt have one until i was a grown ass adult
i got some indian locals to make her a sari 3
  why does he have a face like a cat
same as you op i took him everywhere i went even the bathtub i still have him
some spiderman figure not sure if toy biz or mcfarland this is what i think it looked like
  the black one and light up feature
  i mourned he man for days until i got my first ninja turtles
  this guy right here he was my best friend until i was like 3 some shitass little kid stole him from me at the park while my mom was pushing my brother on the swing i was inconsolable for quite a while even after she got me one in a green suit he became my buddy after a few weeks but stillmy poor red babar  when i was in 8th grade through likeembarrassingly late in high school i was going through this edgy gothic vampire phase and would bring this creepy antique blonde china doll with me on overnight trips her name was of course claudia after the child vampire in interview with the vampire  i still have claudia and my green suit babar along with his family but i no longer take her on trips with me because i recognize that antique dolls are easily breakable
  oh shit these little niggers i used to love these
  most of the pieces i have for takanuva are worn to shit and back god its great to see him put together like that
technically not a toy but i keep a squirtle card in my wallet for the last decade or so
  its toy biz plus now way mcfarland would have well articulated toys back in the day
  i had a tiny buzz plush i got from a cereal box and he was the only buzz toy i had im thinking i was like in love with him or something as a bab    i left him in a walmart somewhere on a shelf i think years and years ago
whinnie the pooh
this guy he didnt come with an official name but my aunt bought him for me when she was in france so we all called him little french guy  used to take him everywhere as a kid when i was like four or five i brought him with me when me and my family took a trip to legoland california on the trip back we stayed at a best western or something and i lost him and went absolutely berserk apparently he had gotten picked up by the room service he was under one of the blankets in my bed and went with the load of laundry when the hotel staff found him for me he was all clean and smelled like fresh linens  i still have him and if my house ever burns down hes the first thing i grab
uh yeah i barely had any toys as a kid
i used to use put him on a tech deck and have him do tricks on the nearest surface as you can see he fell a couple times
are there any toy soldiers that look like this guy
  look into the mega construx call of duty line couldve sworn ive seen something like this    try recon outpost    you can take one of the viking heads and one of the caps off a soldier and create your own body like this  sleeveless arms and all
  you can even make that gun by mix and matching parts  its fucking retarded
  rock  roll from gijoe kinda looks like that guy
  gi joe zombie initiative outback head sculpt is based on this actual photo
  make one    
im pretty sure one exists of him in the mid00s line by 21st century toyline but i cant find anything    anyone else know what line im talking about they also made taliban/afghanistan soldiers
    bbi made one back in the day came back out after they rebranded as elite force but theres no weathering on it now
  dat fucking elbow
  hot toys did sold individual parts for their custom figure system among them special force parts like tier 1 operator cowboys likeness  gears was years ago not sure if you could still find them anymore
  isnt he a tranny now
  bbi was some good shit i wish the figures had more articulation tho they were quality tiny versions of planbs special forces line
big powered gv destroyah      inb4 35640
comes with shades
da32 maneuver sky jacket   
transformers general is that way
  this looks sort of interesting but not 350 interesting  why is it so fucking expensive
  cause its a very complex design being made in a relatively small production run these guys are basically only a couple notches below something like a transformers masterpiece or a soul of chogokin so thats what you should be comparing the prices with rather than with regular transformers toys
  takara tax
  very complex  i dont see it  do you mind elaborating a little as to what make these so special
  i meanif he was the size of the recent metroplex sure butyea no
  another repaint    i love this line but its ridiculous how many repaints and slight retools there are and its really hard to be excited about anything when most of the announcements arent really anything new theres like 15 versions of that same little power armor dude now with slightly different heads and guns
  actually its more on their customizability that gives them their appeal the transformation is relatively simple but that paves way for it to explore a variety combinations engineered in it    they were made specifically to have any product in the line combine with each other hence battle buffalo and diabattles being able to switch arms and whatnot
  just wait for the ko
  this pic sort of gets at the complexity theyre just really customizable since theres a lot of compatibility between figures and scalable in the sense that you can assemble the smaller modules into a bigger form or endlessly expand with duplicate modules then after youve built something you can usually transform it into some other bot/vehicle that you didnt even plan i think this line is 3040 overpriced but you can really feel the mental labor that goes into the designs    anyone else have battle buffalo on preorder think its a late december release
cant remember the name but of all the modern diaclone out including the ones here this one is my fav and on my list to get
  this is the only reasonable answer the diaclone line would be good if it werent full retard expensive the kos make the line actually worthwhile
  the diaclone line would be good if it werent full retard expensive  for 40 us i bought 4 ko of the small powered armour suits like this one here
  yeah the kos go for around 1012 a pop actually reasonable for what you get rather than the insane 2040 takara wants
  more shots of battle buffalos intricacies    for the record i think the power suits are criminally overpriced not being as modular as the larger sets is a missed opportunity too 
  more shots of battle buffalos intricacies  come to think of it i kinda like this great design and engineering but againi just cant pull the trigger on paying those prices unless i have a few hundred kicking aboutwhich i dont but great if u can afford itim wondering if i retail on this in japan is the same price
  yeah the kos go for around 1012 a pop actually reasonable for what you get rather than the insane 2040 takara wants  for those who havent considered the kos are pretty damn goodthe packaging is shitthe dianaugt figs are not the same standard as takara but the the powered suit is pretty spot on but there is a bit of a give away on the quality but not much
howeveri did pay for a legit version of this guy on ebay for around 60usthe more robust color way looks a lot less cartoony and more in line with the other powered kos armoured suits i got
  bought this on early release way back in july/aug i thinkshould be arriving sooni hope lol
  dont know about retail but you can get dia battles for 105 usd  shipping on mandarake
      and battle buffalo is up for preorder for about 135 on amiami
are there any kos of the giant mecha  i am somewhat curious about these but the small suits look pretty dumb and i will be god damned if i drop over 100 on a figure i might not even like
  try sir toys he had the ko of them 5999  
  its just called diabattles v2    the version in your pick is the prototype paint scheme       im fuckin glad this is coming because i missed out on gv big powered
dia
  clooooooone
  135 on amiami  wow need to check that out thanks for the tip
  indeed lol
  thanks friend  i will give the knock offs a shot and if i like them i will support the line proper
  try looking through this forum thread on the diaclone kosloads of good info and pics   
why the fuck havent they made dropships that can carry their pods
  thats a point they have done the transporter trucksdrop ships would have been a cool concept to explore but perhaps the next versions
    technically the diabattles v2 components double as transports for the pods they have 2 ways to attach to the containers
  yeah i remember seeing that now and wasnt keen on itadding those pods like that to me didnt jive with how the rest of the concept worked im probably too picky about that bit but i guess i was expecting to see something like starcom or something like the pods more integral its not a deal breaker in not wanting itim just too difficult to please on that i guess lol
destroyer ko when
would really like to see some kos of the waruder stuff in different colors     btw wasnt there a big waruder mech in the old series
  are these the old school waruder u talking about
  i suspect the want to do dropships is behind the redesign of the raid cages and the new power suit types now they can shove a whole bunch side by side and be able to still all open whereas the old cages/pods cant open if theres something to their sides looking back the old style pods are very toyetic but not very forward thinking and somewhat limiting to work around
  ugh starting to consider replacing my da14 with this the color scheme looks like it would match dia battles and battle buffalo equally well and i want the new head and articulated hands
  battle buffalo  what i would suggest as im doing now is compare the vehicle combo options of bothi like the options of bubble dome from the buffaloyou get a extra bot from that version ok its a mini bot bit still the contrasts makes this look pretty decent
  i was hoping more along the line of small dropships that can fit inside the raidchambers rather than gigantic ultra expensive cargo haulers
i wish you guys hadnt have mentioned the level of pure engineering porn in these figures  i wasnt that interested in these guys on a glance but i watched a couple of video reviews to see what the big deal was and now i have a ko dia battles and cosmic upgrade on the way to my house and both of the upcoming official giant mecha preordered  my wallet is screaming
  thats how takara tomy intended this line to be the core fanbase of diaclone consists of middle age collectors that spend the thousands on these things i very much recommend you going through twitters diaclone tag
  almost makes me want to sell my regular big powered and get this one to match the upcoming battle buffalothis line is destroying my wallet though
whens gats blocker/multiforce
  im usually impervious against repaints but diaclone makes me weak
  yeah it is very clearly for the kind of guy who is willing and able to buy multiples of 100 figures  i am content to just dabble though desu  the few i have ordered are almost too rich for my blood    does anybody here have any waruders  they look kind of unfriendly for builds and i am curious if there is anything interesting they can do with other figures
  does anybody here have any waruders    the first waruders dont get released until february
  oops i saw some chinese dude with them on youtube so i thought there was a set out
    wasnt he talking about the larvae looking pods because those have already been released        thats what i was talking about thatd look cool if updated isnt blue star the guy in the logo a part of the new waruder logo i think they skipped over the older bad guy leader        never seen these nice
  oops  i saw some chinese dude with them on youtube so i thought there was a set out
  the waruder suits already came out back in august
any good monster figures that scale well with these something generic and unlicensed would be cool
    these were the ones i was talking about    my go to generic monster line is duel masters  the giant dragon would make a great kaiju for the big mecha to fight
  theres bigger waruders coming out in a bit
takara released a new promo video 
  the fact that theyre using the blue maneuver suit that i have is making me wanna get this    but i already wanna get gv destroyer in march and battle buffalo too
probably the most photogenic toy line
  ok last one
      speaking of the blue and orange advanced suits  are they worth picking up  they look nice but seem kind of expensive for what they are
  they are nice i only got into diaclone because my job pays well and i had worked a lot in the span of two months and i walked into a retail store that sold them
  fucking hell i already have diabattles cosmobattles big powered a powered suit and eight of the fucking waruder suits    i have no more shelf space    but this looks amazing
  i for one love the little fuckers
          thanks  i guess i was wrong about the not being build friendly thing  it just looks like you need five or more to really make the good stuff  i wish these came in multipacks outside of that one takara mall exclusive pack    thanks  i wish i had a retail store for that sort of thing around here
  i really like the waruder suits but the combinations just look like a mess im looking forward to the raptor one to give the waruder combinations a more distinct shape    but i guess it goes with the whole alien abomination thing
  yeah although some of them are pretty neat like  and 
  i am really damn proud of the kaiju mouth i was able to give it
  not gonna line  that alone is tempting me to buy a few waruder suits myself
speaking of waruders  i just saw that mechfantoys is in the process of making waruder suit kos if the official ones are a bit too rich for you blood
got the two pack of waruders today i must say i like them but the legs in grapple mode are a little disappointing     may get another two pack in the future
  i bought a ko to test the waters and while it turned out to actually be a very nice quality ko mft does nice work i can honestly say i kind of understand the price now these things just oozes quality it feels great in your hands the joints are pleasantly firm and the ratcheting feels amazing poseability is great gimmicks are great and it looks so good on my shelf    im gonna be real here ill probably stick with mft if they keep making good quality kos im not the richest guy so i save money wherever i can but i can honestly say that theyve proved their worth to me to the point where i would consider saving up for a legit one if there was no ko of it
must resist
  you know its futile
  buddy i totally missed out on the big powered original and ims version so im definitely getting destroyer in march saving up my yens as right now
i love the absurdly enormous cannons on the torso tank
i kind of figured these things would be more popular here    anyway i dont have any of these guys yet but i am really curious about big powered  does anybody here have the first two versions  how are they  also does anybody else have battle buffalo preordered
  im gonna pre order battle buffalo next payday he shouldnt show up till mid december    i just got the maneuver gamma suit its pretty fuckin sweet but the helicopter one maneuver delta looks absolutely boss
  i kind of figured these things would be more popular here  the high prices keep a lot of people away they are really cool but a lot of people are unwilling to take that chance and find out
  i bought a couple kos on a whim and ended up preordering the battle buffalo and manuever delta as my first official sets    gonna wait for the waruder kos though
  guy you originally replied to  i just want you to know that you have both convinced and bankrupted me  i am really looking forward to battle buffalo and the new big powered
    the animated shorts are pretty cool sometimes too
  the commercials were dope back in the day too    
who the fuck bids like this
the seller on a separate account to jack up the price
  show automatic bids button isnt clicked  these were all manual
  i dont even bid until theres like 5 minutes left on the auction the fuck is the point
  i hate this so much  i almost got an entire manga series in perfect condition for 30 bucks until the sellers aim bot sniped me in the last half second with a 120 bid  literally the last half second   thought id had it until the page refreshed
its the sellers other account must be the ebay equivalent of i cant find the toy i want because scalpers always beat me to it    maybe its just another collector who wants it more than you
  who bids on the same item 9 times in a row
  people manually increasing their bid when they get beat by auto bids
  whats the point if you intend to spend 100 max just put down 100 theres no point in manually incrementing it only for it to wind up at 100 anyway
  ops asshole btfo
  cant you just let the seller win the bid then laugh as hes blinded down by ebay fees
  me im the one whos doing that hell ive probably done it on an auction you bid on because im very indecisive and change my mind on what my max bid price will be
  people are such garbage
  but then the seller just has to pay ebay
  me
  i won a 24hr auction a couple months ago by paying the starting bid of 100 and set my limit to 200    if i had just bid 200 and ebay accepted that i would have overpaid by 100 dollars
  wah stop having fun at the suspense and thrill of the countdown
  thats the risk you take theyre banking on you competing with their alt accounts so they can maximize their profit its a scummy practice but you can take solace that it sometimes blows up in their face like that
bid on item  get outbid  big again  get outbid again  bid what im willing to actually pay and what i feel is fair and not a penny more  get outbid in the end again  seller the other guy dropped out do you still want it  the other guy was you it was always you you wanted a bidding war you dishonest fuck    in the end i still paid what i felt was the actual fair price so im not that mad or anything its not like i enjoy taking advantage of people on ebay to get dirt cheap stuff because i know ebays algorithms fucking suck and it makes auctions into a nightmare of potentially having to sell stuff for pennies so i dont blame them using shill bidders to get up to a fair price both people are happy with its just annoying
did i do well    some guy bought one of the figures i was selling yesterday its a used figure with a bit of damage clearly stated in the description and pictures today i sent the package and after a few hours i get a request for a return the buyer said he bought it by mistake because he didnt look at the pictures isnt it his fault for not looking at them and reading the description where it clearly says what condition the figure is in i also have a no returns policy what could happen next
  i declined the request btw
  what could happen next  he gets his money back and your figure
  even though it was his fault
  i never buy when this happens and i always report the seller
  i do this  sort of interested in an item so i place a low opening bid hoping the other guy just bid the minimum  get outbid immediately try again a little higher  repeat a few times  consider how high id be willing to go continue bidding in increments  think really they want to pay more than that maybe i can go a little higher  at this point its more than id consider reasonable  kind of glad i didnt win it at that price  the ebay app makes it easy to do little bump bids like that its almost like they planned it that way
  thats not how it works
  i do this when i want something i manually increase my bid by the minimum amount because it counts as another bid on the counter     what this does is it turns away a large number of people who see large bid counts assuming there are many people interested    people will generally avoid auctions if they feel there is a lot of competition i dont really go on ebay anymore so theres an ebay hack for you
  this is very accurate this is a good response to  sometimes auctions really are like mindgames the closer it is to the end time the more willing you can be to stretch your original maximum a little higher especially if its something really rare where it gets to be unhealthy is when youre caught in the fervor and excitement of the home stretch and bid way above maximum because you want to win and dont think as clearly about the amounts youre spending
  agree with this unless someones really interested in the item theyre not going to check the individual bidders and see that its the same person just that its a lot of bids
  i sometimes do this if it is something i doubt will have a market or win i bid way early to claim it like a dog peeing to mark his territory     i also bid like ops picture too up to a certain point if i dont win still good let the dumbass farker who fucks with me pay a higher price when i bump it up he can go eabod
  thats pretty clever i will have to try this      usually the price is much lower than my max so ill keep it as low as possible if i see it go past my max amount in the last 20 seconds ill stop myself from bidding any further
  yeah are you new to ebay  they dont care that you dont do returns   theyll force you to accept it back or just refund the faggot and have him keep your shit and the money
i just had something happen that has never happened to me before    on ebay  see toy for 15 reasonable enough but see the option to make offer so i offer 10 fully expecting the seller to decline it outright or to get a poultry counteroffer of like 1450  instantaneously my 10 offer was accepted    does ebay have a feature to autoaccept offers within a certain minimum ive made offers in the past and theyve only been accepted manually by the seller its either that or the seller is using some 3rd party software to manage their account that just really caught me by surprise
  inb4 you email the seller asking for them to cancel the sale
  may just be that the seller was online i recently made an offer and had it accepted about 1 minute later i messaged the seller thanking them and they replied shortly after
  lol no im happy with it      while it is true they sent a swift reply minutes after i accepted and paid for the item it was too fast i put in 10 and it was accepted instantaneously that just surprised me
  i do this when i am fucking with another bidder
the only smart way to bid is sniping an auction during the last ten seconds if you do anything other than that you give your competition too much time to rationalize spending more and more and that is counterproductive
    yeah when you make a listing you can set minimum autoaccept offers
  bidding  the virgin bid   vs   the chad buy it now
  theres no buy it now option  what now chad
  glad to see someone else who gets it i literally just did this to win an auction
spiderman superposeable
  i had one of these i tried to see how hard it would take to pull his arms off
  i remember when superposeable was just a sales gimmick after that it became a common feature
battle buffalo soon    discussion of mft lost planet and other kos welcome
  love it when an op image flips for no reason
  shitty picture so nothings lost
what would be the best mft suit releases to load up on suits and their storage containers  i kind of want to load up my battle buffalos truck mode with them but i dont want to end up with a bunch of differently colored containers

surashu  suraisu  sasuga mattosama
  no thats an official contained build and i agree that phaseons are great but i wish they and buildmen had more official combined builds like the rig killer
when you have a wor build you want to make but you dont want to drop an additional 40 on a colorway you arent 100 behind  im hoping for a minidrop with battle builders/kustom kits before 2019
oh
snaggletooth pheyden
so any guesses when storm shadow homage will show up
    huh first thought for me was a sabretooth homage due to wolveraan
well im done im pretty awful doing customs so i mostly just got these guys because they looked like fun builds
  what are you gonna do with all those hubs
i dont want anything this drop
huh i literally didnt even know there was a drop well
  im going to build the hub hub a cathedral made entirely of stealth hub sets and burn it to the ground in a grand sacrifice to hopefully convince matt to run more gobons
fuck glyos zbots are better
  bold of you to assume that those hub sets can be destroyed
  its kinda weird how literally every other sister company posts multiple pictures of every product days in advance and matt just kinda throw everything up the night of
suraisu is actually the best deal tonight 10 for a figure sword gun and powerfist
  the small ninja peeking over his shoulder
  thats his gun you hoser
another drop  parts i could really use in the colors i like  broke  pray they get rereleased in the next 10 years  probably wont
  whos the tiny ninja in glyos lore
blk swings soldout
  that honestly might be the most tasteless homage repaint ive seen come out of glyos the hairy upper arms make it impossible to interpret for its own merits its just deformed sniktbub
     and thats a good thing
  click here to find out why
  man i was tired of homages too but this one is great looks amazing bought on sight might have bought another if swing joints werent sold out
  i dont mind homages if they look good on their own merits lot of glyos homages look tacky to those who dont know what theyre homaging
  nah bro new mystery figure series is og kenner star wars figure homages
are the glyninjas other than snake eyes an homage to something something from ninja turtles
  silver samurai for sure and red hand ninjas i believe
  silver samurai  the hand
  oh cool thanks
where can i view the list of mystery figure
    
posted this on the discord but figured id share it here as well got this from my secret santa opened it early on accident thinking it was something id ordered thanks again santa you fucking rock i hope my gift is enjoyed as much
snake tits
couldnt get the name fightwolf out of my head while building these
next to impossible to stand on those little hooves
  oi you steppin wide to me go on then ill brain ya ya fookin cunt
  this may be the only use of bt/wow build i like
  this is sick its giving me a real troma/toxic avenger vibe kinda want that wrestler now
  goddamn it this looks so good i regret passing on this figure so hard now
  troma  oh shit nigga now i see it too
someone somewhere in the world owns this custom  tfw it will never be me  or you
  looks like a bong
  d u d e  u   d  e

im not familiar with any of these but im an old collector of muscle keshi are these things flexible like those    i always wanted to make my own keshi toys but i could never find anywhere that would tell me what material they are made of or if i could use a simple silicone mold to make them
  glyos figures are made of semifirm pvc and are about 4 inches tall they have some bend
  glyos pvc is far tougher than keshi keshi is like eraser rubber basically or one tier above     glyos pvc is nearly indestructible plastic but the thin parts like skinny limbs or armor covers are quite flexible
try to buy 2 stealth hubs  only lets me buy one  dang
  that little fella finally found a home you can proudly say you bought the last stealth hub just like i bought the last vamperann axis set
when you buy battlebuilders as fodder bodies for extra heads but then you try painting the blank heads and you end up liking your paint more than the heads you bought the bodies for  just
skeleton warriors    october toys is back
  skeleton  no octobertoys is still deader than dead but george did a new run of skeletons in skeletor colors as an exclusive for dcon stopped in to say hi to him the skellies looked great but i was already tapped out budgetwise

    matt stein is hinting at new parts
  i hope this is the case especially after all those food heads
bt teasers arent coming until friday morning
    where did this info come from their instagram post/comments dont allude to these things
  the savage realm of battle tribes on facebook
    fb /groups/226596081037178/
not sure if this will be the drop for it but theres definitely another new mold for bt on the way it has an ankylosaurus dinosaur warrior and the back shell can come off and be a shield
onell reposted some sellouts if you missed one
neon argenesis evangelion
  damn was hoping for black swings to come back but i guess theyre really gone    was also a little disappointed that we didnt get silver swings that was probably my 1 desire for this drop
  didnt we get silver swings in the hades drop recently
  we just got silver swings with the mechabon debut/argen silver drop which is the color that the glyninja is
i had an idea for hands what fit with a hub t joint like this and have a port in the palm how would i make this or get it made would plasticine work
  have you ever touched plasticine
if you get a million monkeys and give them a million glyos parts each eventually one of them will make a build that justifies the existence of the walking duds glyos compatibility
  oh looking this up i guess plasticine isnt right its not supposed to harden ever i dont know a goddamned thing
    i was having a really lousy and chaotic week at work during that drop and it slipped my mind completely by the time much later i finally remembered swings were gone    speaking of which if anyone has any of those silver swings from that drop theyd sell id buy em
  without going to full production and cutting an injection mold which will be real expensive even for a small part like this i think your best option will be resin casting at home which is pretty popular for smallrun glyos parts     first sculpt your original in something like sculpey make sure its perfectly smooth and shit and youll probably wanna cannibalize some glyos parts and insert them into the sculpt to ensure that the ports and pegs are the right size then you build a watertight box that you can later break down easily cheap wood and hot glue or many people use legos on a baseplate and use liquid silicone to make a twopart mold once that firms up you can carefully cut it open and use it to cast duplicates in resin youll want to watch a resin casting tutorial on youtube or something im just walking you through the basic idea here      im not sure i understand how the tjoint fits into the hand here is there a tshaped slot that it justpresses into
  just fuck off dude that sculpt is fine for what it is and was a way for an artist to be able to produce their figure
  still lazy
  oh thats a lot but dont sound impossible thanks and yeah it would pop into like a three quarter slot i guess its not an orthodox glyos connection
      whats with all the extra work why not just have a hand with a normal wrist connection and a port in its palm
  yeah i dont understand it either at first i thought he was going for a swivelhinged wrist like old toybiz marvel legends had but it seems thats not the case i dont really get what purpose it serves     also having a tpiece that just slots in seems really unstable like it would just pop off all the time
  speaking of making new hands im honestly really surprised no third parties have made mirrored traveler fists or open palms thats something the community has been talking about for a long time but nobody has actually done aside from some oneoff customs that looked pretty bad    it would also be cool to get thirdparty traveler hands that can actually hold shit since the shape of the fist makes it difficult to get stuff flush to that port
  matt actually discussed this not too long ago he wants to eventually release a customizer pack that has variant parts like open fists and other popular parts but hes hesitant to create new parts when the small runs he does with his current line already sell well enough
  articulation at small scale was the goal karate chops and palm blasts and that sort of thing thanks for hearing me out even if this ones no good
heres the first look at the new bakugans expect toy reveals around december alsobakugan thread expect bakugan action figures too
    theyre much more mechanical looking the game and the transforming balls are neat but im more interested in any actual action figures of the designs these 2 in particular look really neat
do they combine to make a megazord
        looks like megaman zero rejects  i welcome any decent articulated figures for them
they look like robots btw the reboot is said to air this december on cn dead on arrival
  that soon theres barely any visual teaser about it     even this thing looks like in the middle of sketching process
      too bad these are not what were getting    this one looks more like what were getting
  thats a good thing those reploid designs were kino
  op herethese are sketches but they are the final designs      the promotion will start around november/december there will be a special around december for the relaunch  11 minutes episodes too if i remember right they already work on season 2 and they want to get a live action movie off the ground for the next decade
  op herethese are sketches but they are the final designs  were just getting the balls if confirmed that we were getting big action figures then id be more hyped
logo
the series will premiere in the united states on cartoon network and in canada on teletoon in december it will also air on cartoon network in europe the middle east africa latin america in 2019 and in australia and new zealand at an asyet unspecified date    the animated series follows the adventures of dan and his best friends the first kids on earth to bond with the mysterious alien creatures known as the bakugan with storylines themed around friendship battling and competition combined with a new integrated toy line bakugan battle planet is anticipated to be one of the biggest and most dynamic franchises yet
cartoon network enterprises is leading the franchises licensing program in all territories except asia takara tomy will launch the toy line in japan and tms entertainment will manage distribution of the toys series and the licensing program the toy line will launch in north america and other select markets in the first quarter of 2019 and will launch globally in the second quarter of 2019
  after christmas i dont know if thats bad idea or playing it safe because tru is dead
screenshot found in the creators instagram story
from the looks of it the cartoon is going to be way more child friendly than the previous one i think we can forget about violent battles main characters fighting to their deaths etc
  i like the simple deigns and the pastel looking background     i wish the girl would show some boobies like the girls in the previous cartoon
  whos this creator 
  tron uprising guy
  youve got a link to his post
  everything thats not inhouse is doa at cn
  why does this art style make me think of tanya
  her hair style is god awful
  at least its not a side cut
  we
the based bakugan
when is the dog getting a highly articulated action figure
  im more interested in any actual action figures  same here i dont know much about what bakugan consists of but when they make good looking figures ill take a look and maybe buy some they have put out good stuff before would be nice if the actual toys look as good as ops pics also if they were decently articulated and didnt sacrifice too much articulation in favor of action gimmicks    wonder how big these are price and where theyll be sold  were just getting the balls  hope not ive got a red and yellow dragon and it seems like a lot of compromises in figure quality have to be made for the ball gimmick
      these all look amazing are they still playable bakugans were they even often available at the time
  not quite sure what playable means if theyre meant to accompany a game i never looked into it they came with some card maybe or that mightve been redakai if playable means poseable theyre not too bad they vary a bit on what joints move but all have decent range of motion not quite gi joe level i think most have some kind of pop open action feature    back around 2010ish they were at plenty of places like walmart kmart and target and after that showed up at that big lots closeout store  got a couple of their add on weapon packs that fit into the sockets you see on the figures i like them dont care for the action gimmick but the designs are neat and the fairtodecent articulation is a plus the 5 dollar price tag was nice too wonder what these new ones will go for
  where did u get that is there one for the other characters as well
  theyre called mechtogan and are a kind of adon weapon they were released in the last season of the series and were actually better quality than the actual bakugan balls
  cute    bakugan battle planet will put to shame modern american animation
  bakugan battle planet will put to shame modern american animation  with traditional japanese 5fps  duh huh
  did you the new thundercats
  did you
  did i did you
  i did you
  i did your mother       love the new bakugan designs
  yeah  its good  why
u will never own flare wilda
  i honestly thought flare wilda would be released in mechtanium surge along with the other delayed nv special attacks cyclone percival flash ingram meta dragonoid and iron dragonoid or gundalian invaders with sky  gaia dragonoid hell i even thought sega toys in japan would release magma wilda which wouldve been the closest thing to flare wilda because they literally have the same design save for magma wildas metallic chest    but nope neither flare or magma wilda appeared on store shelves id tell myself that it was super rare and only two people on entire planet have it but thatd be pretty stupid
  right instead of making really cool figures that were in the show they decided to shit out a bunch of worthless figures that nobody even knew about cosmic ingram wilda pyro dragonoid midnight percival dual elfin and a bunch of special attacks
  whats wrong with this
just why
  cartoon network has anime again i thought disney xd bought them all
  that red hair bit  ryukos long lost brother
  cartoon network  uh oh  dont look for this one to be around long or air anytime but five in the morning
  i never understand why all networks air anything interesting while the kids are still asleep or have to get ready for school i think satam cartoons died because all the filler starts after 89am
  because spongebob/teen titans go apparently needs every single primetime slot
  its pretty funny to compare transformers cyberverses ratings to the shows cartoon network airs at sensible times with the exception of teen titans go and total dramarama theyre pretty much even
trailer next week first episode premieres on 1st december
why are there always a shit ton of sand niggers asking for free bakugan in every single collection videos comment section on youtube     like someone does a video showing there collection and before you know it there are like 50 ppl from shithole countries asking for free bakugan like what buy your own jeeze
  look up pokemon tcg videos theyre kids unable to buy figures/cards
  sauce
  why do only a few have elements in front of their names
  more like shadows gijinka
  pegatrix looks awesome
  they need to make animals that work as balls like an armadillo porcupine or pill bug     i never liked their dragon balls
  their parents should have made better life choices
  mantis and top right looks good
  
  they probably leave it out if theyre in their canon element
  nicemore pics
  you can find them on the reddits discord
i like the scale texture on this guy
  not big into bakugan but ill probably grab any design i like this mantis being my favourite of this bunch
  yea its my favourite too
  looks better than the original too bad no hot baku girls
  no but we have a sexual tyranasorous
  monsterhunter tier
  hd looks better than the original
why are the paint jobs on the new toys so bad
  bakugan are back
i found this really cool guy who does high quality bakugan videos on youtube
  its time to collect bakugan again
    wheres the trailer
  delayed
  that visual so wholesome
  live action bakugan
best bakugan will this thread become into a bakugan general or /toy/ isnt interested in bakugan
no trailer no news
bakugan battle planet leaks  new bakucores are set to activate the ball transformationthey are also scannable for a tie in app/game  new bakugan videogame coming on ps4x box ad nintendo switch in development   later in 2019 for the second season new bakugans will be scannable for the tie in game  live action movie is pushed to be made with legendary/warner bros by spin master  the cartoon will release in north america in december 2018  the series has a lot of the original series characters  series will expand in the next five years  full continuity instead of the original series errors  no more hiatus  spin master believes this reboot will be even more successful than the original series so they put all their money on the property  they hope it will be as big as pokemon thats why the new tie in games are being made
best bakugan game the franchise finishing point was new vestroia gundalian invaders killed it hopefully the reboot will fix things up if they want a long run the best thing is to reboot every 35 years like transformers does
  i prefer the 1st one more even though it was extremely easy due to the bonuses you can pick up  the minigames
  ohthe first one was fine too gundalian on the other handi dont even think mechtanium had any games
live action bakugan movie  this would explain the new designs i guess  do people like the new designs
  this
japan got some pretty neat designs after they died elsewhere without going too gimmicky  this guys feet can be exchanged so you can customize the colors
  they hope it will be as big as pokemon  theres that coffin nail have they not learned from yokai watch yw played it safe and quietly retired
  i feel that hasbros downfall was putting everything into the watch and less into the characters there are so many neat designs and here they only pumped out jibanyan komasan and whisper constantly theres very little reason to collecting anything outside of a disc with a sticker on it
  the news is going to drop on december 1st for some reason people think the show is going to debut that day even though it makes no sense for that to happen
  rise of the resistance was released during mss run but isnt based on it
  neat bakutech
no new toys
  theres a bunch of new toys no nongame general action figures/transforming toys yet though
any recent news on battle planet
  not really the thing with yokai watch was that it literally got milked to death both in japan and in the west level5 tends to do that to their franchises
  trailtrailer on december 1st
    more no idea what to saythis is not anime but american animationwhy
  cn  dead on arrival
  its supposed to be animated in japan
  looks awful
  remember teen titans
  looks like garbage nuanime to me     which is why i stopped watching in 14
  bakugan  this isnt real anime why    teen titans  i miss this one bring it baack
is that supposed to be dragos ball form or sumn
  huh so they changed it to the toy rights to the japanese transformers guys and tms huh here i thought spin master was coming back
  disregard my last post
  thats modern day tms for you they aint the juggernauts they used to be    besides its at least a marginal improvement of the originals garbage heap quality
new screenshot
  kino  i  n  o
    spin master owns bakugan theyre very involved with this tms animated the first series as well     takara tomy is replacing sega toys for asia ive heard its because sega toys shuttered their boys division a few years ago
  thats why i said to disregard my previous comment and yes i know that tms did the previous installments still makes me wonder why theyre doing this one when nelvana and spin master could have hired any other studio is it just because tms is the primary copyright holder
  noidea trailer whend
any news
  b a s e d
looks like shun got bleached since this is apparently his brother masato kazami
masquerade surrogate magnus
spin master is very equal rights the main villain is a granny
this one might be fake    refuse to believe someone would name a character china riot
        does this mean translucent bakugan
  okay but is he also secretly best girl
  i dont know why but i really want to bang her she makes me want to get dominated
      new packaging photos revealed
  and even then the inhouse stuff only has a marginal chance of being successful thanks to ttg still being a thing
  jojo
  at least their inhouse shit is generally guaranteed at least two seasons if its owned by a third party theres a good chance cartoon network will air it at 6am with no promo and take it off after a few weeks when that strategy shockingly doesnt net them top viewership
og april oneil equivalent
blasting off again
i am mad scientist
  best girl
first bakugan battle planet teaser        bring on live action bakugans
  wow its fucking nothing
  no but he is a char as per the other not masquerades
  what is wrong with his fucking torso lmao
new shit dont know the source
heres hoping theyve retconned the other drago design
  the trex looks really good  hope that model is accurate
  i dont like the dragonoid but the other two look great
  m a x o t a u r  a  x  o  t  a  u  r
monster jam will promote the bakugan reboot with a dragonoid truckit looks cool
the designs look nice but i am betting the toys will be the same ballformer crap so pass
  bakugan looks pretty cool just not the bakugan part
  im assuming he means the expanded designs from the anime which also needs toys    id buy the actual bakugan and figures
      i doubt they would ever make model kits of the monster designs they have in the reboot but if they do oh boy ill gladly empty out my wallet
how come none of my pikachu plushies are this fuzzy i feel gypd
  because no media up until now has depicted him in this way
ted 3 looks good
well will they be making nontalking plushies that are like this in the aftermath of the movie
  i hope so id totally get one
  id like a realistic greninja plush
unironically only mr mime looks good
  all of your plushies are made in china
japan is bitching that pikachu has fur    the us is screaming white genocide because the man character is black    so nice to see this film is already triggering plenty of stupid snowflakes who dont matter
  why are his shoulders literally kickballs though
  america culturally appropriates japanese anime    okay
  not liking the seam on his shoulder
  japan is bitching that pikachu has fur    why its literally sparknoise mousesound in japanese isnt it do mice not have fur in japan
  black mc  missing dad plot
  mc probably should have been asian
  build a bears is
  make it so that the tongue can unravel and id buy a dozen desu
  nah my favorite looks good too
  if the jiggs wasnt in this pic this would be a great reaction image
you dont want your plushie that fuzzy as soon as you would rub it against your baby dick youd cum
  nigger just buy a springhare plush for now its the og pikachu after all
itt we post the toys that are the best replicas of the characters they represent    ill start optimus primal masterpiece action figure
the shfiguarts shinkocchou seihou figures feel like someone shrunk the actual suits used in the shows and added some toy joints to them they are really screen accurate      the same could be said about the other bw masterpieces too specially in their robot modes
  definitive version of toys    screen accuracy plus engineering is pretty important    i will say robot damashii veranime    the mp beast wars line is probably the most consistent sub line of mps
  yup the shinkocchou seihou figures are amazing their initial advertising literally asked which is the sh figuarts which is obviously a little hyperbolic since you can easily spot the joints if youre a toy fan but at a glance the illusion is quite good and i think it could fool an average viewer
    i think thats giving those shfs too much credit     they still aim for the heroic ideal body proportions instead of realistic real life proportions of a person in a thick rubber suit just so it looks better as a toy and easier to pose and place in joints    the head is smaller hands and feet are bigger etc something like rah usually the 1/6 stuff are more focused on trying to look lifelike including body balance
  i dont know much about animorphs but that gorilla looks like shit
  that is really impressive not a big toku fan yet but some of the figuarts riders look awesome
probably the best one i own is the soc spec unit 01 evangelion was kinda inconsistent with the proportions of the mechamilfs but this is pretty much as close to the control art as a figure is ever going to get maybe aside from using silver instead of blue helps that its an absolutely gorgeous figure in general
  the most screen accurate rebuild eva should be medicom rah and mafex the best tv ver should be the tamashii spec
  yeah rah/mafex are definitely the most accurate rebuild eva01 so far though the rd isnt bad either the tamashii/soc spec is pretty much the only option for tv which makes me sad
    the kotobuikya kit is nice
  it is and i want to build one though obviously for people that dont like kits it might not be ideal also it has some proportion issues though again the proportions arent exactly consistent in the show    reminds me i still need to paint my bandai unit 01 kit
  hmm you are correct that technically does answer the ops question better since they asked which is the best replica visually as a whole though id take the shfs any day theyre much more fun to pose and fiddle with than the rahs
  ok  this is saber from fatestay night
  sader is the best saber since she makes me feel something other than apathy and slight annoyance
  
  where can one buy one of those saders
  idk but like other crap toys/bootlegs that got famous like the flipping sasuke you can bet that youre going to pay a lot for one if you find it
    if it had to come down to accuracy it would probably go to megatron overall so far as far as i can see hes pretty much perfect in both trex and robot mode    thats not to say that the other bwmp are any less than him  is right in that they have so far been the most consistent of all the various mp lines really its only a few naggling issues with primal cheetor and dinobot that hold them back from being on par with megatron but thats mostly due to design issues otherwise theyre all pretty fantastic and im excited to see how theyll handle terrorsaur after accomplishing a design like dinobot
  if only they had filled in those damn elbows
  shittalking beast wars    you should be profoundly ashamed of yourself anon
  still looks like shit
i i kinda want adult miles morales
  widerman widerman friendly negro widerman
  assuming we wont get the comic original characters whod you want more dadroc or mohok    ive got a soft spot for dadroc but if i had to choose well the ml version is serviceable cheap and readily available
  man seeing this im super glad i didnt buy any of the neca ones because that leg movement is all i need
  mafex continues to be one of the most exciting japanese toy companies in terms of license choice if only they could get their qc under control id buy from them way more often
  looks better here than he did on display in that standing pose still dont see the point in making this an adult miles though and the ml is good enough that im not looking to replace it with anything im not 100 satisfied with
  yeah adult miles is pretty pointless i just like his proportions but honestly virtually any other gwenpool character would have been preferable id even take a poolboy over miles still he looks breddy gud
  stupid sexy miles
  fucking hell do i have to buy a second pennywise toy yep i do i hope they deliver on the mold and the paint though
  yeah qcs the major reason why i dont preorder with them
  the neca get the exact same leg movement there is zero reason to spend more money on this      what a complete waste of a character slot we could have gotten another villain or something goodfucking miles of all things and not even a miles everyone knows fuck that i would have taken spider armor over miles morales
  its not really a waste of a slot per se im not even sure if slots really apply to toys in most cases but as a relatively small company mafex cant afford as misses as say a hasbro or bandai so putting resources into arguably one of the top 3 most pointless characters from the comic seems like something of a risk    the way i see it they chose miles because hes a spiderman i mean batroc might be more important than miles but hes certainly less popular among the casuals but in that case they really should have gone for dr doom or whor    but hey if theyre making characters who dont even get pass a single issue like evil gwen or miles then fingers crossed we might get power pack i need a katie for reasons
  give us superior spiderman then
  there is zero reason to spend more money on this    i actually am in for this i love my neca pennywise but am in for an alt style both actually seem to get the likeness right in pretty different ways
  now that id buy the ml is fine and really marks the point when hasbro started making good figures imo but id kill for a proper superior spidey that has his gauntlets and waldoes
  i feel like id like miles way more if he was always an adult the teenager thing works better for peter
i dont exactly dislike miles as a character but i really struggle to understand why they thought this version of him was the most appropriate he does look better than the convention display we saw before but even sticking with gwenpool i would have much rather seen ms marvel or dr strange or any of the other characters that were cute in the mangaesque art style    definite pass for me
  im really hoping for a gurihiru kamala since they seem to like doing gwenpool adjacent characters and the art styles for her actual book while great might not translate as well to an action figure
  such a weird choice the masked head with relaxed eyes doesnt fit miles
  i need some context here did they age up miles in the comics or is this just a what if kind of figure
  spoilerfuture miles comes to the present to murder gwen because future gwen is a bitch who spilled everyones secrets for teh lulz but hes a hero he doesnt kill so it was important for him to explain to gwen why he was willing to make an exception for her although in doing so he inadvertently/spoiler
  in the gwenpool comics gwen is confronted by a future miles due to time shenanigans and he kind of blames her for his shitty future mainly due to evil gwenpool
    man i really need to read more of gwenpool thanks for the answer guys
  the neca get the exact same leg movement there is zero reason to spend more money on this  okay necanon
  there is zero reason to spend more money on this  higher quality plastic more sculpt detail more accessories better paint apps i could go on
  higher quality plastic  its not      more sculpt detail  oh come the fuck on now youre pulling things from your ass    more accessories  nope    better paint apps  again hell no itll use the faceprint tech maybe but thatll look just as bad as it does on their dark knight figures and peter parker heads mafex does good masked things but they still havent figured out flesh
  actually believing any of this
  actually believing any of this
  just give it up necanon no one thinks anything you have to say is true neca is brittle garbage
  actually believing any of this
  i like mafex a whole lot but you gotta be mentally challenged to believe the shit you do just cause you have an axe to grind
inviting necafags into the thread  thanks mafex  you could have at least made a figure from a good movie  can you fags go spam reaction images at each other somewhere else
      we get it you fag
  pretty wild that theyre doing miles morales before the inevitable symbiote spiderman someone at medicom really has a boner for gwenpool
  the inevitable symbiote spiderman  this is the biggest travesty
  id be interested if they included the spider arms since neca hasnt yet
what is the consensus on the qc of the latest mafex figs i dont think ive seen anything about them other than some problems with the astro boy release
  i bought gwenpool tdkr batman 30 and homecoming spiderman last month and theyre all pretty good gwenpool has a small paint mark on her wrist but other than that i havent had any problems with any of them
  everyone seems to love gwenpool
  all of them have been good to great save for the astro boy
  my gwenpool came with only one phone holding hand i got a dupe of her right relaxed hand instead theres also a small paint smudge on her standard head but its not noticeable from afar its hidden behind her ear
        alright bros ive been debating with myself for a while about ordering mafexs peter parker looks like im biting the bullet
  the neca get the exact same leg movement  prove it
  false flag
  i had no flaws on my robocop that i could see and it was my first mafex really good first impression there and im eagerly awaiting the other stuff i have preordered robocops john wicks that eva and black panther now
  kek neca is finished
  which one homecoming spidey was just before their shift to digital printing and full face paint apps so he doesnt look as good as recent releases that said its still the best homecoming spiderman around
  neca is for cucks
  neca btfo
    even shartimus prime roasted the neca for its shitty fragile plastic    lmao        sharted
  ive never seen this review of his damn
  hahahaha shartimus is such a fucking child that might be the funniest shit ever i see now why everyone hates him
  for you
  go back to your containment general
  ive always hated the way he moves the joints on his toys  he does it as fast as possible without any care and because of that you cant see the range that the figures joints can get    piss poor reviews and a complete hamhands
first of all neca pennywise is perfectly fine i have no problems with it my friend who hasnt even seen any of the movies has it ive seen and handled it in person its perfectly fine i did skip it though as i just didnt like the movie all that much but i do have other neca products such as various godzillas xenomorphs and predators now all that said              i decided to google neca pennywise 2017 and the first review to turn up was a fwoosh video review which coincidentally did a crappy stop motion of the dance        so yeah the neca pennywise is able to do enough of a splits to do the dance but lack the torso  waist flexibility to do it properly    will the mafex be able to pull it off i think it likely will    pros of neca looks good decently articulated good loadout of accessories relatively cheap good for display    cons of neca scale incompatibility although its size is variable articulated but not overly do limited for posing    probable pros of mafex looks good well articulated probably nice selection of accessories more scale compatible    cons of mafex almost 10k yen fuuuuck man i can get like 2 or 3 neca pennywises for that
  best review ever
  more scale compatible  to what
  goddammit   how well does mafex scale with neca not well i assume right i want to display this with my horror collection but if he doesnt scale its gonna bug me
  he looks fine and i love that arc but i am just not sure i care about future miles or frankly miles in general enough to buy this one    most import lines  i cant say i am interested in the figure since the actual story never hooked me outside of some cool ideas but i can see the appeal of having a wider pool of victims for the spiderclown embodiment of fear from beyond the turtle  i wonder if they are going to do more horror guys if he does well
  they are around figma size
  to marvel legends figuarts black series figma dasin mattel multiverse basically anything that isnt neca and some lines/versions of dc collectibles neca is 7 scale mafex is 6     pic related are the neca pennywises next to a m black panther      technically pennywise is size variable i guess you can have normal sized pennywise mafex and scary big monster pennywise neca
oh i didnt know about this one 14 looks like its one of their older ones
  anyone know anything about this howsit
  i dont mind him doing it on toys that are reusing the same damn sculpt over and over i think he got used to doing this due to the sheer amount of marvel legends he reviewed he needs to slow down for unique stuff
anyone got an space suit for cheap plugs i would love one for 40 shipped
    i recall hearing about that figure having issues falling apart not breaking but a lot of the parts especially the arms just didnt hold together and constantly fell off
  falls apart like there is no tomorrow mine wouldnt stay together for shit but i still liked it because its pretty much all were going to get that isnt statue shit then his mid section joint snapped in half just avoid the disappointment anon
  wow that looks really good though sculpt wise and accessories wise
  man i need clearer shot of this but it looks like they really nailed the proportions like i said before i love my neca pennywise and it is dead spot on but somehow this matches some of the scenes really damned well too so im probably going to get this     this was one of my fav recent movies and designs im just hoping that hand and balloon will last longer my neca one has warped so he cant hold the balloon anymore my only doubt is if theyll be able to match the texturing details and the paint since i havent seen them pull this off that consistently yet with more realistic looking characters
  like this      and miles  
iconic
  when did obama get a super suit
  during his office thats what all those foreign diplomatic visits were
  based
  miles was pretty important in her story but still youd think theyd go with the younger version for more overlap between miles fans and gwenpool fans someone there must really love gwenpool id rather see batroc or terrible eye
has mafex really not fixed their issues  fuck i wanted their xenomorph
  yes
  no
  maybe
  there is zero reason to spend more money on this  this but unironically otherwise youre paying more than double the price for something thats clearly not vastly superior  maybe if they did a candyman or a thing id be on track
  this man does not deserve the recognition hes got
  younger mile was only there for one of those weird modern marvel character pushing arcs that absolutely plagued gwenpools series so i can get why they are doing the future version instead  i sort of want it but i just cant get excited about any version of miles  future sarah would have been cooler
  i dont know
    thanks anon
  fuuuuck man i can get like 2 or 3 neca pennywises for that  yeah thats great so you can enjoy those 3 pennywise figures in total for about 3 weeks or get one mafex that if they dont totally go back to how mafex qc used to be should be able to last you quite a while
    made back long before mafex fixed their qc honestly they should rerelease it at some point
if they deliver anywhere close to this then im in the likeness is really damned good
    this fucking figure brings me back i had this before i sold it  comes with some awesome accessories and has a great sculpt and the faces are top notch likeness  but the figure itself is a complete fucking shit show any movement of the legs and they will just pop off super easily same went for the arms the joints on mine never broke luckily but ive heard they are very very brittle its a complete shit show of a figure im surprised i even managed to sell it this is the figure that made me not trust mafex
  i think the big pro for necas is the expression options between the three releases granted after buying all three youll be in for more money than if you just bought the mafex but to my mind its the aforementioned options are pretty important i want to see a little more on how much poseability the mafex version has before committing looks pretty good allaround however       fuck me i actually have both the 90 and 17 pennywise figures and didnt notice that much of a height difference
  why is this figure so similar to the neca one same faces same accessories even the joints look similar not that neca joints are good
  because its the same character from a movie that theyre both trying to nail the likeness to
  i do see the point though same faces same boat even a similarly it looks like executed balloon and balloon holding hand
  are you fucking retarded
  well to be fair you get way more faces if you bought all the neca though it kinda sucks to have to tripledip to get everything having said that just the basic pennywise comes with a good selection of faces anyway    i didnt notice the 2017 pennywise was that tall either weird    hopefully this mafex pennywise will be awesome
  like that anon said because theyre based on the same movie the execution of joints is a valid comparison but no shit its going to have similar faces a balloon and a similar balloon holding hand thats how the character looks thats how the character holds the balloon what were you expecting
  so yeah the neca pennywise is able to do enough of a splits to do the dance    wait are you talking about the opening of the video because that articulation range is terrible
  well hes technically got the range of motion in the hips to just about pull it off but as noted without the upper body articulation then no it cant be properly pulled off the dance isnt just a matter of doing the splits its actually a swinging/pendulum movement from the torso/waist
  no just honest with myself and others
  its actually very good whatre you talking about
  the boat is a key iconic scene as well as the balloon the only other accessories they could have with this are the spider/lobster arms and the werewolf hand the various key faces from the scenes i mean if they ever did the terminator theyd probably have the same accessories as the neca does you know
  to be honest that deadlights face in the 2017 movie wouldve been pretty cool in my opinion
  if they ever did the terminator  i hope so
  hes technically got the range of motion in the hips to just about pull it off  i dont think id call that just about      its actually very good  those are some rock bottom standards you got there
  if they ever did a full fledged terminator line i might die t2 arnold t800 t1000 and sarah connor figures lets be honest they could probably do t1 mental hospital escape and rest of t2 versions yes please hell id take a pops from genisys too and kyle cromartie and cameron from tscc wouldnt be unappreciated too
  sounds like youre only here to be a cunt you are wrong about the range of motion and so far everything else youve said but im sure your ego wont let you realize that
  when is wick coming out are both versions coming out at the same time
    why the fuck do people buy these imports when marvel legends has you covered and neca too these are looking more and more simplistic but with a higher price point
  approximately 45 degrees out is hardly close enough range why are you so upset about this
  congrats you dont know what youre talking about      that miles is definitely a step back from what they were showing us with spidey and venom hopefully it wont continue they cant keep doing gwenpool shit forever
  congrats you dont know what youre talking about    prove it
  lets not have this argument again  some people have different standards for covered
  because theyre actually able to get into spider poses and actually come with web accessories and in cases like gwenpool they actually look like the comic art unlike mls aged prostitute gwenpool     also unmasked heads that arent limited to being released once in a store exclusive box set that was poorly distributed
  youre a bitch there its been proven
  unlike mls aged prostitute gwenpool  sup revofag
  sup mlfag/necanon
  not that guy but the ml gwenpool looked like a 35 year old heroin addict and had a really fucked up neck  also female mls cant pose for shit
  also female mls cant pose for shit  this is wrong    the ml gwenpool looked like a 35 year old heroin addict  and this is incredibly wrong
  sup greg
  also female mls cant pose for shit  this is wrong  i get that you like marvel legends but you dont have to lie
  being this upset over a toy    that makes you the bitch buddy
  this is delusional
  nah its actually incredibly right
    imagine being this retarded
  imagine unironically liking crackwhore gwen with noticeable creases running down her legs
  imagine being this defensive over a childrens toy
  its a case by case bra    for marvel legends mafex gwenpool clearly scratches an itch that the ml doesnt ditto evil gwenpool though to a lesser degree miles is admittedly pointless    for pennywise yeah i dont see a reason to get mafex except for scale and better engineering/articulation in terms of appearance the neca is perfectly fine and much cheaper
  ml gwenpool looked like a 35 year old heroin addict  youre thinking storm collectibles chun li ml gwenpool looks like a 2535 year old woman trying to cosplay as a 15 year old girl shes okay as a standalone but gwenpools popularity is from the gurihiru drawn comic of which mafex is the representation of    female mls cant pose for shit  yes they can    look i support the mafex gwenpool too but i think shes got enough great points to stand on her own without having to attack other figures
  yes they can  have they fixed the terrible legs since spidergwen  because if they havent then i am going to have to disagree
  yes they can    low standards man strikes again
    do you morons just close your eyes as tight as possible and jerk off to your animes together pretending its a woman ive never seen a sadder lot of children
  legendsperg why are your retorts always so predictable
   mls cant pose for shit  yes they can  they can pose better than a mcfarlane but worse than imports
  so you admit you dobt know how to pose anything that or youre just too much of a defective human
if any of you actually bite this retards bait then youre just as much a shitposter as them
  youre the one trying to start company wars here
  remembering that this is medicom they will eventually they used to be the ones making all those 12 inch movie toys
  the matrix is another id like to see them do
  better than a mcfarlane  not even that anymore lmao
  says the crybaby throwing fits about neca and mls in another companys thread
  this happened with my neca pyro figure
  this and fight club i need jack tyler and marla
  to be fair gwenpool did look like the ml in her comics
  i guess if you want to point to one issue of howard the duck and the poorly drawn intro to her first issue then yeah
  i guess if you want to be a salty cunt because youre wrong then yeah
  what am i wrong about exactly
  you mean in comics that werent hers
  everyone who makes me mad is revofags    lmao you are in the mafex general retard perhaps you should leave
  being a salty cunt over cheap walmart toys    pretty funny really
lol
  shut up sylviahoeksismywife we know its you
  and this is incredibly wrong    areare you sure
    just saying she was created by a different artist and drawn by other artists for over a year before she got her own book if you dont count the holiday special    you shouldnt be looking at mls to do any sort of comic design anyway they mainly only do generic realistic looking sculpts 99999999 of the time   im glad mafex is doing accurate comic book looking marvel characters and hope it isnt just based on gwenpool stuff id love to see comic book accurate whilce portcio and jim lee xmen their spiderman stuff looks too generic albeit comic booky looking
pics from tokyo comic con
  its a meme because of how fucking horrible the ml looks thats the joke its why its funny and why people keep posting them     youre the only one defending it
such bad posture georgie
  i hope they do jim lee wolverine soon
    you are a literal sperg
  dont reply to shitposters that only encourages them to do it more
  spiderman is looking good but i dont like that the belt part of his costume is on his lower abdomen instead of his waist
  venom looks nice and bulky there standing next to tchalla
  shit i didnt even notice   thanks a lot order cancelled
  sure
  its not a good joke then because the ml looks good just because it doesnt fit your pedophilic fantasies youre all pissy about it
  no a crack addict with huge seams in the legs doesnt look good legendsperg
  the ml looks good  i cant imagine having such low standards
  calm down legendsperg enjoy your happy meal toys
  god its like they brainstormed how to make a character the opposite of cute and then put it to paper
  she was created to be a joke character of an alternate universe deadpool  she really didnt get her origin nor her guruhiru art until a year later
    you two are just prime examples of the absolute worst this board has to offer
  i appreciate the compliment
  being this mad over a shit figure
  i know right youd think youd have gotten over how bad the mafex is by now
  kek i havent seen a more fat stupid and obvious bait in a while  sperg you arent even trying to be convincing
  oh look a spider monkey
  sperg you arent even trying to be convincing  its like youre talking to yourself weird
  the fuck
  wolverine hulk thor and superman and ill die happy     ill die happy with a decent superman from them     like fuck not one single decent superman
  the ml looks good
  hes not wrong though it is a good looking figure
  whats good about it the troll like design that only matches her original appearance the shit articulation and sloppy paint the awful cuts that make it look like she has prosthetic limbs    even ignoring the vastly superior mafex its just a really shitty figure
  fuck right off the design is good its well sculpted and matches that appearance the articulation is not shit and the paint isnt sloppy either its better than the mafex there for sure awful cuts im sorry your autism gets in the way of you ignoring normal articulation
  everything you just said is disproved by that picture any actual arguments pictures to show that it can do some cool poses or proof that the paint job and hideous face are just bad examples of qc anything
  not a single thing is proven wrong by that picture and the ml can be posed without relying on a shitty mafex stand too on top of that it wouldnt matter what gets posted because youll still shit on it your ego wont let you do anything except shit talk
will you faggots stop poking the mlfag  i am getting pretty tired of looking at his posts and if he is happy with his weird cosplay thot gwen then good for him
  normal articulation is awful
  how can you type that while looking at that picture im honestly baffled
  the paint isnt sloppy either    i picked the best one out of three in person and even mine is covered in paint slop
  im more baffled that youre this much of a company whore that you take multiple threads to shitpost about gwenpool of all things
  i dont have a single mafex product and my first one will be the spiderman
  which is a good choice their spidermen figures are great even from shitty movies like amazing spiderman but that doesnt make the ml gwenpool bad
did anyone else here besides me order gwen through bbts i got a notice a month ago that she was supposed to be instock soon but still hasnt arrived they even got murphy in before her im starting to worry i got shafted
  aww fucking hell youre subjectanon arent you    which would go a long way towards explain the preferring a figure that doesnt match her appearance in the one series which is the reason anyone is actually is a fan of her   because iirc he apparently often buys toys based solely on liking the design without ever actually reading or watching the source material the character is from    also the particular telltale strain of defending mls over all imports and saying they have better sculpts and articulation regardless of whether thats actually the case for a given figure    if this is him we should definitely stop engaging though because he genuinely never stops in a argument/pissingmatch
  blowing it over to somebody else  pathetic mlfah really pathetic
  i was being racist you fag
  just more proof you guys dont know shit about who i am  thats not me these are        the one series which is the reason anyone is actually is a fan of her   because iirc he apparently often buys toys based solely on liking the design without ever actually reading or watching the source material the character is from  hilarious given the fact she was created a year before she got the series youre talking about and all those appearances are what made her popular and why she got the book youre talking about which got canceled    fucking casuals please stop posting if you dont know shit
  and the ml can be posed without relying on a shitty mafex stand too  well yeah because its not articulated enough to do anything but a basic standing pose
  he  kek
subjectanon is here    new mafex thread when
  and the ml can be posed without relying on a shitty mafex stand too  the mafex can stay up in a straight position without the stand can you pose the ml to show it in any kind of pose like that without a stand no of course not because the articulation doesnt allow it to get into any kind of pose    your ego wont let you do anything except shit talk  but that was only the second time ive posted in this thread as shocking as it might be to your ego more than one person are arguing with you    hilarious given the fact she was created a year before she got the series youre talking about and all those appearances are what made her popular and why she got the book youre talking about which got canceled  her howard the duck appearence is not what made her popular she was created in the fad/meme of creating gwen versions of characters there was spidergwen thor gwen gwenpool and various others spidergwen got a serious because people loved her design and gwenpool got one because it presented interesting ideas but she only actually became popular after getting the cute art style and endearing story/character traits    and yes it was cancelled comics are cancelled all the time and replaced with different series they cancelled superior iron man a while back and then invincible iron man started does that mean nobody likes iron man gwenpools story concluded the run finished and she was immediately inserted into various team ups    youd know this if you werent a filthy casual that cant see beyond hasbros dick
jesus fucking christ you retards stop replying to the faggot thats saying the ml is good its so fucking obvious that theyre just shitposting and baiting you bunch of /co/ckroaches and youre gobbling his bait like crazy of course hes going to keep posting the same thing over and over again when thats all it takes to get a reply from you shit for brains
  baiting    i mean nobody actually should reply to him but he is actually dead serious
  its pretty clear by now that most people in the thread arent from /co/ and are only buying gwenpool because shes a cute meme like most stupid flavor of the months      her howard the duck appearence is not what made her popular  oh boy i love hearing people whose only knowledge comes from what the wiki said and are totally ignorant on how she got popular instead of being treated like a throw away gag that she was created to be like all the other gwen crap
  kon   fom  check yourself mother fucker
  ive run out of ways to defend the ml and cant refute objective points so lets argue about comic origins
  anyone pointing out how retarded i am is samefag arguing the same thing  two months from now youll forget why you bought the figure and sell it off on the bst so just fuck off with your wiki knowledge and buying your memes of the month
  implying being from /co/ is something to be proud of
  implying its not
  you know whats more sad the fact that youre this dug in to your insanity that youre getting this wound up because people like different toys than you but instead of going cool i like this one instead you shit on everyone and everything because youre that fucking pathetic
  its better than being an idiot who wastes money on characters he only knows from stupid memes and flavors of the month that youre going to sell a week later because oyu forgot why it was supposed to be xd
  im not sure it is actually theres a reason its called /co/mblr    now go back to throwing your toys around like an inbred child and crying when they dont hold up to your abuse
  oh its you  i guess it isnt just your fragile diecast toys that you treat like a baby its also your other ones because you cant actually afford them and need to resell them for maximum value after you got tired of their xd meme
  or maybe i just treat my belongings with respect and care not everyone is a retarded hamhands like you subjectanon
  implying the majority of toys will get damaged like shitty diecast ones  again i treat my diecast stuff as well as you do  too bad you have to go into your little imaginary world of pretend to try and argue anything    but ill humor you what toylines do you own that have such shitty quality paint that itll rub off or have such crappy plastic that it will break by being put into a box with other toys
  trying this hard to justify throwing toys into boxes like old socks  apex kek    just admit that you cant treat your toys right and need to buy kidtier stuff to avoid it breaking
mfw subjectanon ruins another thread  im sorry everyone it shouldnt have to be this way hopefully one day hell break his neck and cry about what a shitty material bone is
  no bullshit you ruined this thread by starting a company war you are the one to blame
      what a miserable fuck you must be
  talking to yourself
  i know i shouldnt respond to you but fuck it mafex threads are officially over for the foreseeable future now anyway so i might as well  first off those arent flavors of the month  those are characters from two of the biggest names in moe anime that helped form the genre as it is today and one of them is dressed like a still popular program mascot who is celebrating her 10th anniversary this year  second off where is gwenpool a meme  also i was following comics after that howard issue came out and the general reaction was minor curiosity and confusion from most people  gwen only really garnered her admittedly small fanbase after her gimmick was drawn out a bit better in her own series and the holiday special
did anyone order unit 1
  gwenpool is still a shitty character and only the lowest of low pretenders even like her
what happened to /toy/s jannies
  even they gave up because of subjectanon shitting up every thread
  its literally you starting off with durr my thing is better than your thing
  projecting this much
  liefeld drawing feet  cursed image
  first time ive posted in this thread champ and people complain compare and shitpost about various figures all the time youre the only one taking it this personally
  it literally started when ml/necanon came in here implying there was no point in buying these when hasbro and neca are making toys of the same characters    nice try though
  first time ive posted in this thread  literally what every shitposter says
  so fucking what thats a completely valid response to the same fucking thing being released again by some other company its a response that you can find on every site fwoosh toyark etc is your ego so frail that you take that as an offensive act     what should they have said hm oh thank you lord jesus thank you im so glad this is out again and just barely different lawd lawd youre insane
  barely different  youre either trolling blind retarded a shill or all four
  and right there is why you ruin your own threads
  this isnt even my thread i just joined and came across you and subjectanon shitting up the thread because gasp people like brands other than your favourites youre incapable of having a conversation like a regular fucking human being and yet you think everyone else is the problem the pair of you need to fuck right off
  people like brands other than your favourites  and gasp people see the same character with the same accessories with no improvements and are completely in the right to yawn at such a reveal     youre incapable of having a conversation like a regular fucking human being     ohhh right right because people arent impressed with the toy line you back that means something must be wrong with them you need to seek some major help
  this is a joke right
  this whole post is just you going its okay when i do it
  with no improvements  nigga what are you serious  ohhh right right because people arent impressed with the toy line you back that means something must be wrong with them   jokes on you i dont care about the character at all and wont be buying either version im just sick of you shitting up every single conversation involving a toy you personally dont like you dont like it when people say they think your toys arent worth buying so why should we like it when you say you dont think our toys are worth buying are you really this low on self awareness
  im sick of you shitting up these threads because you want to wave your ridiculous dick around like you matter at all youre the reason all of this happens every fucking time
  only one person can possibly find me annoying  good god youre pathetic
  only one person can possibly find these mafex releases redundant  good god youre pathetic
  more like only a retard can possibly find these mafex releases redundant theyre obviously superior to their western counterparts albeit at a higher pricepoint which if youre a poorfag i suppose is a problem look at their robocop the only other options are the mcfarlane ancient and a bit crap the figma decent but with a generic face and the neca which looks nice but can barely pose even by robocop standards and cant stand up to save its life and is too big for a tamashii stage the mafex isnt just not redundant it renders every other robocop redundant meanwhile gwenpool is obviously going for a different style and has more better accessories and is better made    but if you hate mafex so much and consider their products redundant why are you here just to troll
  theyre obviously superior to their western counterparts  aahahahahahahaahahahahahahah
  yeah youre a troll nice job proving you have never held anything other than a bargainbin happy meal toy in your life
  holy fuckballs you are one retarded motherfucker ive been buying mafex since they started but im not going to sit and suck their dick as hard as you do you autistic piece of shit and yes their pennywise is 100 redundant its good for the japanese who dont want to import an american toy and thats it
  ive been buying mafex since they started  prove it
  100 redundant  if you enjoy gambling on whether the toy will disintegrate out of the packaging then i guess
  this isnt even my thread i just joined and came across you and subjectanon shitting up the thread  this is a lie but if for a moment we gave you the benefit that maybe youre telling the truth none of your actions so far speak kindly in your favor you arent trying to discuss mafex at all you came here looking for a fight rather you came to continue the fighting just stop
  i just did thats one of my figures dipshit      im luckiest guy around then because i dont have that problem
  
  ill stop when subjectanon and mlfag/necanon leave forever their presence ruins every thread they pollute and they have the gall to think its everyone else that is the problem    good for you because plenty of other people did
  then post other pic faggot this time a new one supposing youre the one from the link 
  yep that was me too ive got all their spiderman figures because they are pretty damn great but that asm2 figure was indeed floppy as fuck       can do faggot
  good for you because plenty of other people did  good for you because plent of other peoples didnt
  their presence  no see youre trying to justify you showing your ass youre not taking responsibility for your own ignorance they didnt make you come in here acting like a tit you chose to do that you chose to instigate all of this you are not helping anything at all
  they and by the way youre typing i suspect youre one of them or at least as retarded as them were the ones who came acting like tits in the first place literally 75 of the shitposting on this board would go away if they sodded off subjectanon has been going at it for 8 years now 8 years
  even got their homecoming figure but im not going to pretend its the best thing there ever was its still inaccurate when it comes to some details of the costume and the tom holland headleaves a lot to be desired
  your attitude does more to drive people away than any shitposting by them youre disturbingly hardheaded
  youre insane if you honestly believe that
  youre insane for keeping it going
  neon genesis evangelion never ever just shitty rebuild designs  fuck
  why do you keep posting variant art by clist artists as proof of your point variant covers are basically fanart and we all know it
  moving the goalposts this hard
gwenpool has been drawn ugly before therefor this figure being ugly is actually accurate  imagine actually being this braindead
  still thinking thats ugly just so you can keep a lame argument going  imagine actually being this braindead
  why would i be miserable    im not the sad weeaboo whos trolling this thread because hes lonely and wants anyone to speak to him    i actually like gwenpools comics think mafexs figure is great for being comic accurate and dont mind that the ml is realistically done because the comics were also that way and not just buying it as a flavor of the toy to fit in with a bunch of anonymous people online  i like what i like and dont need to lie about my stuff nor lie about other peoples stuff to feel better about my likes like that guy who needs to pretend diecast isnt a cost cutting material whose paint wears away or chips easily
   i was following comics after that howard issue came out   good for you but im not making my posts to you  my response was to those people who didnt know gwenpool was a thing for a year before she started being drawn by huriguro that her character was already being laid out and becoming popular before the weeaboos suddenly started to take interest because she was drawn by hurihrowhatever    thus making those fools sound like they know nothing about the character treating her as nothing more than a flavor of the month or meme
  treating her as nothing more than a flavor of the month or meme  youre the only one whos been doing that
  just because im pointing out thats how people sound when they didnt realize she was drawn differently and popular before she was drawn by gurhiru     nevermind the fact she literally was a meme but again this only proves my point that you guys shouldnt talk about things you have no clue about
  i dont think you even know what a meme is
  this guy is awful
faggots here complain about subjectautism  while still constantly replying to him  are you niggers under twelve or something i dont know how else you couldnt have heard of the term dont feed the trolls before if you want him to leave then stop replying to him biting his bait makes you just as responsible for this thread going to garbage as him
  those are characters from two of the biggest names in moe anime that helped form the genre as it is today  not subjectanon but man im not a fan of what those two represent okay first off never really watched lucky star i saw bits and bobs here and there it looked cute but i wasnt in the mood for it when it was still a thing i liked kon season 1 mio was super moe it had some great music and was overall pretty good    but the huge popularity of season 2 pretty much killed the moe genre for me season 1 actually saw the evolution and dare i say growth of the characters especially yui but season two was just eating fucking cake and drinking fucking tea and the girls fawning over azunyan the whole music aspect went from being a central focus to just window dressing the characters were pretty much flanderized dare i say they became memes of themselves but god season 2 was successful and it changed the genre for the worse    the genre went from trying to be witty and cute to being utterly banal suddenly we got all sorts of clones where the motif/gimmick is just window dressing and its just a bunch of girls snacking calling each other cute and being utterly devoid of humanity in that they dont act like humans especially teenage girls    although it did spawn a couple good satires sabagebu and bakuon yuru camp is the genre done right since its done in a prekon style
  where you at dawg      memes are manufacturer as much as they are spontaneous and gwenpool is a long lasting one huh
holy fuck this thread    im the only one with taste the rest of you know nothing and only buy figures for xd memes    if youre over the age of 16 you badly need to reexamine your life if youre not this is the kind of behaviour that leads to you becoming a sad bitter 40 year old virgin
  more like   you shouldnt like x because it doesnt look like it came from the comic  proof it came out like that in the comic  but its not what made her popular  proof she became popular from the different comics and artists before the current style  bbu changes subject and strawman  assholes like yourself and the troll just shouldnt talk about things you know nothing about
assuming the big chap comes out well you knoe who needs a mafex
  i knoe
  wait where is any of this alleged proof the fact that she existed as a character prior her comic run doesnt prove your point and if anything the fact all the merch other than the shitty ml is based on the gurihiru designs would suggest otherwise    disagreeing with someone doesnt make you correct
  pick the one that makes sense  unpopular/unknown characters get their own comic series  or  popular character gets their own comic series    fucking retards    nevermind that it takes over a year to get an action figure made     if anything the fact all the merch other than the shitty ml is based on the gurihiru designs would suggest otherwise  can you be anymore of a ignoramus just shut the fuck up instead of arguing shit youre clueless about
  yikes that style really is horrific i have no idea why hasbro went with that look rather than the gurihiru look though that said the thought of hasbro trying to do a quasijapanese style makes me sick
  that statue looks like the villain in a disney movie
fuck all of you peoplesubjectanon slightly more than everyone else    you guys are at much at fault as the shit heads with crap opinions at this point    from now on how about we just stop talking about any gwenpool entirely unless you have something new to say about her mafex figures and only her mafex figures    and since im not a mod or a jannie every time one of you does that anyway or replies to subjectanon or any of the other inflammatory dickwads im just going to reply to you with a pic of gwen crying    get your shit together thread or there will be gwen tears everywhere   i will fucking do it i swear to god
  im not reply to subjectanon though because hell just use it as an excuse to post more im ignoring him like everyone else should
    appreciate the blog post dude
  he is just going to keep going anyway even if you dont respond to him  but yeah its best that we just dont let him get to us  if we just dont mention the marvel legends i dont care for it either but there is no need to keep bringing it up anymore he will probably get bored eventually  probably    anyway i am pretty excited for evil gwen  i wish the rest of the gurihiru line would have included extra expressions or accesories for base gwen  that would get me a little more excited about future miles at least  even as a big fan of the comic he is a hard sell for me  also do you have any angry or happy gwens
   characters get their own comic series  implying marvel doesnt do this all the time
  i fucking warned you
  he  there is no he here its just you youre the one that keeps starting and continuing this bullshit every single time you keep blaming other people for your fucking problems
  you reply to a different person almost every time you say this
  its telling then that you idiots have grouped together to make these threads a living hell for the rest of us all because youre so emotionally stunted and placing your ego at the forefront    he is right about one thing you guys blame everyone but yourselves it never should have turned into this
  for the rest of us  by which you mean me and subjectanon you two are at fault this is your fault these threads will always suck until you two leave
  big nope see thats your problem you wont accept any dissenting thought im not your troll and im not your subjectanon you refuse to see the reality that theres those of us tired of their shit and your shit you are as bad as they are you or anyone acting like you are the type that keep these ridiculous company wars flaring on this board your whole attitude is the gasoline you throw onto the fires
  radical centrism
  i am totally not one of them despite my incredibly similar posting style and the fact i cry like a bitch when people criticize them  nice falseflag fag    and if by chance you arent one of them youre just as bad for enabling them
  he is just going to keep going anyway  you mean calling people out for their ignorant bullshit because they have no idea what theyre talking about  yep      i have no idea why hasbro went with that look rather than the gurihiru look  already been stated  gwenpool was so popular that they decided to make her figure before the gurihiru comic came out it takes over a year to produce a toy      unknown/unpopular character getting merch made  always love it when people ignore common sense just to stick to their ignorant talking points
    im sorry so youd rather have every thread shitting on other products just to make your dick feel better attack everyone you can to keep those 200 post fights going what is wrong with you you morons claim you want it all to stop but youre doing everything in your power to push it as the only option available open your eyes for once
  you morons claim you want it all to stop  by subjectanon and mlfag leaving forever yes until that day this will continue
  youre worse than they ever were by making a statement like that you are the main problem front and center
  subjectanon has been tainting this board for 8 years 8 years hes become synonymous with thread derailment and obnoxious faggotry nobody likes him and yet he carries on regardless if you honestly think the people that want him gone are the problem you need to kill yourself legitimately pour yourself a glass of bleach and chug it
  yes that describes subjectanon and mlfag to a tee
  ever watch kids in the hall   embed    whiny babies wont stop and theyll continue to support each other regardless of how fucked up it gets because their little egos cant handle being told theyre ignorant and wrong    basically theyve watched too much anime and their honor requires they never stop      ive been here since /toy/ was created only reason you guys became a problem is because the various brands got popular enough to create fanatics liek yourself  thats neither here nor there because i actually like the mafex figure but you guys got butthurt that people liked gwenpool before the gurihuris comics and dont like being told youre wrong
  aww thats cute hes trying to blame everyone else on his own shittiness again    subjectanon /toy/ will continue being a cesspool as long as you are here nobody is ever going to listen to you ever ever ever because you are a retard you can either leave forever and make /toy/ a better place or stay and continue to be shat upon by everyone whilst accomplishing nothing whatever your retarded mission you failed you need to go
  bro i went on vacation for a week once and when i came back you guys were still accusing others of being me and you guys shit up other threads regardless of who you blame like the psylocke revoltech reveal for the marvel general  this is why mlfag is a thing despite there being like 4 different guys being called that    youll never stop because youre petty whiny babies who are only here to shit up threads if anyone disagrees with you    pic of more merch that was created before the gurihuri comic
    god damn you are a couple of stupid motherfuckers you dont like toys you dont like shit you just come on here to call people stupid nicknames and bitch and argue you want things to be terrible thats the real truth
  yes mlfag is another retard that needs to be removed from the board but that doesnt change the fact you are one of the most notorious shitposters on /toy/ you both need to go
well congratulations mlfag and subjectanon youve completely ruined another thread to the point its been pushed to the bump limit by your sperging i hope youre proud of yourselves
  there is no mlfag retard it was shit started by some asshurt revoltech shitpostsrs and youre carrying it on like a shit covered torch you are helping to ruin the board with that shit
  being this oblivious
              what did i just fucking say
  nah if you leave thatll be one less troll who will cause a shitstorm because someone disagreed with them    have some more merch created before the gurihuri comic    and boy there sure is a lack of figures based on gurihuris art proving this guy even more wrong   if anything the fact all the merch other than the shitty ml is based on the gurihiru designs would suggest otherwise        the only people ruining the thread are the people who wont shut up when theyre proven wrong because then they need to change the goalpost and other stupid shit to continue arguing  you wont stop regardless of who it is and will create another strawman to blame for your whining
  i love seeing memepool cry
  i dont give a shit about gwenpool i originally came here to see if the alien had been shown off anymore at this point all i care about is you fucking off
  t mlfag
  youre your own worst enemy
  im not a fan of what those two represent  i mean i am not either but they arent fotms  if anything the oversaturation of the sol genre is one of the worst things to happen to anime this side of isekai despite it resulting in some great series yuruyuri non non biyori galkosan ect  sadly i would say that the lack of humanity is a feature not a bug since most otaku seem to find girls with emotions other than constantly being happy but not too happy threatening judging by the continued astronomical popularity of things like love live
mlfags necafags mafags seething
  thanks for that bit of stupidity
so when are we gonna see captain marvel announced
    in a year
          you made me do this  this is on your heads
mythic legions siege at bjorngarr  this coming monday december 3rd at 3pm est youll be able to place a preorder for your very own mythic legions siege at bjorngar allinset for only 200 that allinset includes the already revealed characters  kkurzog bolthar the tower thwikk faustiaand the ogre legion builder all for one great price this preorder will run through december 27th shipping for multiple preorders will not be combined    mythic legions allstars 20  mythic legions soul spiller  2nd advent of decay pre order  the preordered items for the 2nd advent of decay preorder summer 2018 the allstars 20preorder spring 2018 and the soul spiller preorder fall 2018 are all expected to ship from our factory to our warehouse in february 2019    missing sword horsemen  if you get pledged into the mythic legions advent of decay kickstarter campaign for 3000 or over and you didnt receive your kickstarter exclusive version of sword horsemen please contact 4hmdshippinggmailcom     four horsemen on instagram      bbts has advent of decay allstars 20 and soul spiller waves up for preorder at an increased price      complete list of figures needs siege update      accessory list can be found here      last thread  
      four horsemen still has some stock left over from the store if you want to avoid bbts pricing
i wish someday theyd let you buy just individual weapons even as a limited run preorder or something i dont generally want enough from a weapon pack to justify buying the whole thing but there are a few weapons in most of them that id gladly buy multiples of if i could
  no giant skeleton  bit of a missed opportunity but i understand they they just wanted to make only one kind of giant body for now
  theyve got more coming im sure they showed off that ogre vampire and he wasnt listed this time around thank god too because i actually wanted that one
im disappointed in faustia i like the cleric look but the black paint makes it look cheap and shitty to me i might grab the goblin though
happy family
  give me that illgar
i tried to match the yellow on the tabbard for the shoulderpads but man it came out differently when it dried i was going to do the recesses in the skirt and arms in the same color but i think ill just go with gold instead
  it doesnt look bad but i can see what you mean the small golden details on the armor really shove the figure in that direction
  yeah i agree i actually dont like the black paint in general except for detailing
no posts about preorders
    go to make second instock order  everything down for a month during bjorngarr    why
why does this line trigger so many autists its a decent line and it fills a niche that many companies arent actually able to offer
  love the posing here with morgolyth kind of want to buy her
  because four horsemen studios are offering what they want their favorite brands to offer  thats why the majority of the arguments are   well _______ does it like this 4h should do it like that too    4h have come a long way doing there own thing but thats not something a few people are willing to accept
  more like their method of selling toys is completely shit and means people who couldnt buy what they like or find out that they do like something that theyre stuck needing to pay scalper fees if they they decide to want it    or that their prices for the features they offer are bad in the first place    or that they havent really improved on their figures since their first minotaur and its disappointing to see next to no progress in how their toys are engineered    lots of reasons what autists want to see improvements made
  more like their method of selling toys is completely shit     missing two kickstarters two backerkits two store preorders two more store preorders two allstar preorders preorders for four additional waves all unlimited and instock sales for every release warehouse finds bbts    i wish every company was this shit
  their method of selling toys is completely shit  is that so gosh wonder where all these figures came from then so weirdi mustve conjured them up from the netherworld     you fucking idiot
  i dont get this im literally a latecomer myself for almost a good two years now and ive gotten everything i wanted from the line you must have the shittiest luck if youre still having a hard time getting the ones you like
  agreed i came rather late to the game and managed to snagg quite a few
they took all the aod stuff off i wonder if they actually sold it all or if they just took it down so it wouldnt compete with the siege stuff     still undecided on it i really like the ogre stuff but i wanted the vampire
    so if someone were to wander into this thread right now how would they go about getting toys that just barely came out based on all the pictures being shown off
  who cares its not our fault if someone misses out if you feel so bad about it youre welcome to spread the word and send out flyers and whatever else otherwise fuck off
  by waiting for the in store sale after the figures for the second preorder ship
  please clarify your question its a bit foggy
  how would they go about getting toys that just barely came out based on all the pictures being shown off    by buying them with currency
  this  there are multiple opportunities to get them between the kickstart and the last instock sale wanting anything after that is not much different than wanting anything from any brand that was soldout and even than both with other brands and 4h theres a chance they will bring something back in the future we had the allstars preorder not long ago
      so in other words you cant buy anything right now and a lot of the figures are sold out anyway so youre shit out of luck and need to rely on scalper sources huh    pretty shit way of selling toys if youre not already a fan
  cant buy anything right now  a lot of the figures are sold out anyway  gee what gave it away sherlock yes you cant buy sold out things thats how it usually works try walking in a toy store and asking what sold out itens they currently have for sale and see what they will say
i dont know why anyone wants to buy this fuckhuge toyline that was designed to be 3 1/2 inches tall the proportions are fucked because of it actual army building is prohibitive from both size and price and that goes doubly so for monsters and hypothetical playsets that would have no doubt been far more abundant cheaper and more possible if they actually followed through on their plans rather than playing it safe and catering to their whining faggot ass 1/12 fans that reeeeeed for months on their boards
  they usually remove the in stock items while they have a preorder because the store isnt set up to split up and process the orders and people are retarded as is evident by some of the comments in this thread   fucking hell either wait and save your cash for when the pre order ends for them to put the remaining stock back up or wait until the second in stock sale early next year  alternatively you can inhale co2 until the figures come back in stock that will fix the thread at least
        dont engage in a debate with the troll nothing you say will affect him in any positive manner and nothing he says is of any merit he just likes shitting up 4h threads because hes got nothing better to do and because of him the scalefag is back in here crying about things that never happened so pretending either of them exist will only make things worse for everyone    its far more constructive and beneficial for everyone to ignore the asshats and just talk about and share pics of the actual figures     like how awesome the goblins are i only picked up a small group from the initial ks as i figured that would be enough for me but after having him in hand and kitting up the gob lb i now realize the absolute potential for awesome these guys have     my favorite part about them is that the sort of remind me of the goblins from final fantasy xi i played that game for a decade and the goblins were always a major enemy to be wary of not so much important story wise but rather they were always a thorn in your side gameplay wise and they had such character that they were easily one of the best enemies in the game     the legion goblins share just enough similarities that i kind of want to grab a few more gob lbs the next time they go up for sale to see if i can make one a bit more similar to the ones in that game the full masked helmet is already perfect i just need to do some minor part swapping on the arms and feetand somehow hunt down a backpack for them
  getting this upset over toys
  my dude thats the exact reason i decided to get gonxx he reminds me of the masked goblins from ffxi he was the only goblin i preordered but after seeing inhand pictures of snagg i ended up getting him and knubniknoglin as well from the in stock sale cant wait for them to arrive
  no pic of bend elbow  no buy    no pic of bend elbow  no buy    fool me once with the vinyl troll figure cant get fooled again
    yeah we get it you posted your lame dubya joke in the last thread
  sherlock  funny you say this yet youre blind to why people dont like 4h for exactly that reason    and unlike those toy stores 4h doesnt restock    but whatever your refusal to understand and calling me a troll just shows how up your ass you guys are in how awful their company operates  everything they sell shouldnt be like an sdcc exclusive
  those big orc/human warrior figures look awesome but they look like they have very limited range of motion and also those necks look way too thick
    my brothers how else can i customize the gobbo lb   im at the point where i want to start learning sculpting and going on from there i just want a gobbo army goddamn overlord and goblin slayer
does anyont have the forest troll im debating if its worth it at the latecomer tax  pic unrelated
  i doubt well get a full on skeleton in the ogre size but i could see them doing a zombie or something in that size and give it a skeleton head
  neca released a pretty good big zombie for mythic legions stiches
  that actually brings up a good point we should try and make a sort of list of figures that fit well with mythic legions both in aesthetics and sizelike how that lizard figure has been used by multiple anons as a lizardman figure or that liz figure from the rampage line gets used as a mount for the goblins and orcs    also is stitches there an original design or from a preexisting property
  i vote for king kong from the playmates peter jackson movie
  hes from world of warcraft but in the neca heroes of the storm toyline
  sour grapes the post
  i only own the forest troll and i really like him personally he has the best troll design of the initial release but i keep him paired up with my bog goblin as a duo so the colors work for me
  that guys a shitty troll but i actually really wish 4h would put a little effort into showing articulation i mean i love the trolls sculptwise but they definitely disappointed me with their articulation and im a little gun shy on these ogres
boy i love my figures but this fanbase is absolute shit tier youve got to stop being blind to the 4hs glaring flaws you can still like the toys without fanatically defending their poor store model  what do you even get out of that at least the people who white knight cam whores think theyll get some
anyone know what the fuck happened
  he tried to buy some food at spacemcdonalds but couldnt fit in the drivethru then he tried ordering inside the place but had to walk on his hands then he tried holding the bags with his mouth but it kept falling on the floor the clerks were able to help him out in the end but it was still embarrassing
  getter toys hardly ever make it to production and those that do are usually heavy redesigns that dont resemble the source material
the arc was released after years of delay maybe theyre just figuring out a warehouse
  meant factory

  we did it folks first new thread in a month
  woah slow down there save something for next month
    hasbro doesnt start releasing stuff for another 5 months and boa has completely given up the series has also been bland and forgettable outside of the anniversary theres not exactly a lot to talk about
  thanks for the explanation we were both too dumb to know why the thread is slow but now that youve told us we wont make such callous jokes what fools we were
  member when boa said to stay tuned for amazing surprises yeah i member
  next thread ahould be something like running out the clock edition or  i cant die cuz i am kill edition
  just fold the wings snd itd make a neat robot bird poncho with a claw arm
  i dont    did they mean hasbro getting power rangers or was it before that
  they said it in reference to supposed surprises before their liscense ends i believe they said it around the time the were unveiling the 25 for 25 ill see if i can dig out the tweet
  its neat but not exactly signature for a luxury item imo theres no real thought put behind the zordbuilder concept
  falconzord doesnt actually have a zordbuilder port it was a fan alteration done primarily to give it a more secure connection to the ninja megazord
got something weird to hunt down  i came across a loose model kit for the crimson insectizord/gorai beetle from ninja storm/hurricaneger which appears to have all its pieces and stickers and hadnt even been taken off the part cages however the instruction sheet it included doesnt actually show how to put the thing together instead showing how to combine a bunch of the zords together    has anyone seen this model kit before and if so would they know where i can find gorais instructions ive been trying to muddle it out but the pieces feel somewhat fragile so i dont want to force and snap anything having a guide on what stickers go where exactly would help too
  just b urself
  so upon further digging i found that it comes from this crazy expensive black and silver model kit version of the megazord which i cant find anywhere for less than 350400 still however cannot locate instructions so if anyone can help there would greatly appreciate it
  i own this set but its not a model kit idk how you came to that conclusion
any chance that well ever get figures of the first mmpr movie with hasbro    theyre so slick for the white ranger i prefer the mmpr movie suit over the classic one featured in the show  i wonder why theyre not releasing it again on february with the rest of the legacys rerelease and i dont want to pay scammers prices on ebay
  any chance that well ever get figures of the first mmpr movie with hasbro    youre asking if theres any chance hasbro will take another chance to felate mmpr    i wonder why theyre not releasing it again on february with the rest of the legacys rerelease   because those were from the older and superior 5 inch legacy line
someone want to tell bluefin what the battle borgs are
or how to spell ninja even though they spell it correctly elsewhere on the box
  welp back to the drawing board then i thought it was because of the black and silver parts which i cant find in any other edition of this zord ive tried every other thing i can think of to figure out where the fuck the model kit comes from
  its not wrong in japan the battle borgs are the humanoid fighting forms of the five zords that make up the shogun megazord its only in america that the battle borgs and the shogunzords are two entirely separate things        
  doesnt make sense to say battle borgs as the english term and then refer to them as their japanese names everywhere else     ninja/ninjya is still inexcusable no matter how you slice it
  although the kakurangers are able to assume the forms of the beast general fighters themselves they are typically autonomous machines allowing them to function independently of their respective ranger and battle alongside the giant beast generals or muteki shogun
  you forgot the white kirk beetleborg thing i just want my white kirk asap
    jesus if i didnt know better id think this was a bootleg
  why is it with all the releases reissues and super special rereleases over the last couple of years we never get og dino megazord    ive seen a few dragonzords thunder and ninja megazords falcon tiger titanus and some other stuff i paid little attention to released for the anniversary editions and they have reappeared everywhere but not the first one
im actually kinda happy about the break in new product production gives me a chance to go for a few legacy items i missed and replace parts of my childhood collection that have been lost/stolen my current goal is a sdcc dragon dagger
  its one of the bigger oddities in the line it was rereleased at least 3 times and even got a black and gold variant but its not part of the final rereleases which has almost every other legacy item ever released    my only guess is the master mold is too worn down to reuse since it is basically the 2010 megazord with some die cast added or maybe there was going to be a 20 rerelease in the near future but the license transfer put an end to that plan
  boa would rather see it sit on the aftermarket at the same price as the soc retailed for it makes them feel better about heir version being so shit
  what you talkinh bout willis you mean the legacy megazords or whut
im just waiting and i know its gonna happen soul of chogokin muteki shogun and kakure daishogun watch
  and tsubasamaru the whole set is a gold mine just waiting to put out
  maybe there was going to be a 20 rerelease in the near future but the license transfer put an end to that  i really wanted them to revisit the original and give it the proper legacy treatment because compared to the zords that would follow it stands out as an inferior product making nontransformable individual zords versus a 20 was stupid even by boa standards
  wed get the thunder megazord firstim not looking up the jp name and that wouldnt be a big seller the megazord already lingered long enough to go into clearance even if its climbing in the aftermarket now titanus will probably sit too it depresses me but the audience just isnt willing to pay chogokin prices for this stuff yet
  the original 93 megazord or at least the 09 one the super special soc one is a bit beyond what i want and the legacy came out years ago and is not on the horizon    i just kind of wanted it to come out along with the dragonzord and titanus
  making nontransformable individual zords versus a 20 was stupid even by boa standards    i am no fan of the legacy versions of the individual mmpr zords that cannot be used to make a megazord
  some of us wanted non transformanle zords nigga just that that didnt do them justice you already got plenty transforming mecha
  i doubt it simply because the whole ryusseioh red dragonzord knee issue i dont doubt boj could pull it off but it will no doubt need time and dedication alotted to it thats why i believe we will get muteki and kakure first their engineering is not as complex as dairenoh and i would disgree with the idea gx72 didnt sell well its a very popular toy among the pr fandom lots a very positive emotions around it it died down a bit with gx78s disapointments though not many but if they give us the ninja and shogun in that same level of quality it will sell especially with all the battered muh legacy shogun megazord housewives laying around
  i have no toys but i must post edition  and i thought being character was suffering edition  how about mystic knights of tir na nog edition
    so after years and years of only getting transforming zords that are horrible and off model on their own cannot be properly displayed because they were never meant to be displayed we finally get a set of nicely designed posable zords that are not total wastes of time because they were only meant to be a leg or arm first time this has ever happened in 25 years and you complain what about the rest of us who actually liked the tyrannosaurus zord but had nothing this is the first damn time we ever got anything worth a shit
  im all for nontransformable sorts but those things are worse than the imaginext no contest theyre terrible
  have you even seen the soc
  the soc fills all the things you want and ate still able to combine whats youre point
  ill tell you why the soc falls short its amazing but its too small i want a fucking huge motherfucking tyrannosaurus rex that can kick the ass of legacy megazords if the soc tyranozord wouldve been the size of fhe legacy dragonzord or any other legacy megazord i wouldnt be here complaining     tommy fags got their full size dz and white tigerzord but we get our tyrannozord figure and it feels like a plastic middle finger
  having both the imaginext and the legacy line zord theyre much more comparable than you think first off the imaginext is better built has paint apps not many and is bigger but thats about it the worst part about the legazord is the fucking face thats why i had to sculpt a show accurate one other than that its actually a good poseable figure with much more show accurate proportions the plastic feels cheap though to be honest the legacy zord gets way too much bad rap becuase every one ia doing it group think its obviously not a true legacy zord waaah buy definitely not a piece of trash
  the tyrannosaurus is shorter than the dragonzord and the dragonzord is shorter than the megazord
so whats wrong with this one
  missing the sheath
  i was going to get this but at this point ill just wait for hasbros love me some dragon shield jason though
  im kind of disappointed they actually corrected the white arm bands from the proto would have been more fitting given all their other fuck ups in this terrible line      its probably in there theyre never packaged on the actual figure
  i was just about to ask when this was going to come out its been forever since i pre ordered mine
  ill let scale fags answer this one but i want my rex to be bigger than the dz the legacy looks better than the soc in terms if scale soc  too small legacy  too big but when displayed ghe legacy looks better
  nevermind i just got a shipping notification
  i just wanted a rerelease of the 93 megazord i was definitely not willing to pay soc prices for a megazord not was i really interested in something with any added levels of articulation or super intricate detail    largely i want to make use of my 93 dragonzord and combine with the other zords
  this looks better than the soc to you
  if they do it would probably be a sentai artisan version which would likely end up being close to the chogokin version in price
  93 megazords commonly go for 100120 on ebay quit being cheap and go there
you would think with the releases of the legacy tyrannosaurus sabertooth tiger and classic flip head figures they would at least drop the 2009 megazord again especially with the dragonzord coming out last year and again in january why not release that one again so we can combine them
just bought this did i make a grave mistake
  but you can literally see in that pic that the rex is smaller
  why should they you had your chance to get it in 2009 and again in 2013 it is no ones fault you sat around and did not act
  he looks fine with some more paint
  that doesnt look so bad  theres already a show accurate megazord i wonder why theres never been an attempt at show accurate zords
  i wonder why theres never been an attempt at show accurate zords  boa did with the legacys
does anyone have both full sets of the normal and black and gold legacy mmpr zords  im curious if any particular combination of them looks better than either straight line
  just got mine he is missing the white on the diamond under his shield but green was missing it too the helmet somehow looks worse than the previous 3 releases i dont know what it is exactly but it looks extra weird the red is cast in this weird shiny plastic much worse than other legacy figs both elbows on mine were also stuck and very difficult to unstick i actually popped the forearm at the glove off one arm and the other at the bicep swivel i was able to pop everything back together and get the elbows working but goddamn was it a pain in the ass they didnt fuck anything up too badly but ite still kind of has weird issues here and there im curious if i was the only one with stuck elbows
hasbro lightning collection leaked     definitely getting magna defender and shadow ranger if the assortment stays like this
  there is a really good change hasbro actually will make a few rereleases of the 93 zords since they really like rereleasing the main 5 g1 transformers every few years    fucking starcream in walmart right now
  i doubt they would have access to the original molds or would bother making new ones for zords  although the thought of them making megazords more akin to transformers would be interesting at least
  yea but they love to reinvent the same character over and over again eve if they do not make the exact same 11 zord they will make something that is 80 similar then a year or two later make a new series that is loaded down with extra meaningless surface detail  then make another that is basically a hardcore extreme version and call it a classic series
  if this is indeed the first wave im very underwhelmed three mmpr figures is more than i expected in one wave the way they kept saying anthology series lead me to believe mmpr would be spread out more only one villain and its zedd for the hundredth time dc red is probably very low on peoples want lists given hes from a not so great recent season and already has a figuart in the same relative scale magna and shadow are not at all unexpected as 6ths/extras tend to be very popular    they said at pmc when we saw the rest of the wave wed see that it was a whole new world but three 6ths/extras a red a girl and a villain is a pretty par for the course wave if the bm figures are part of the lightning collection that adds another red and extra though im willing to give current season stuff a pass     ultimately i expected more variety and maybe some things we dont typically get figures of i think tommy kim and zedd right away is blowing their wad too soon ninjor a nonranger ally whos never had a basic figure and scorpina a villainess whos never had a figure outside of imaginext would have been much more interesting figures for a first wave if they were intent on having three mmpr characters it would better show the range of characters who are on the table
  nowwhichultrazord are we getting
  why is hasbro playing it safe with their first ever power ranger wave especially after bandai fucked everything up for years     i dunno i can understand most of these choices  maybe if the second wave is three mmpr characters again ill get as underwhelmed as you
  if not for the fact that they kept stressing anthology and said the rest of the wave would be a whole new world my expectations would have been lower
  doesnt matter   youre not wrong to be upset but this is perfectly natural for a first wave even the sixes they picked were like the number one choices in fucking shf polls back when they still made sentai shfs one of the most popular villains one girl from the original show hell dc red might even be there just to see if kids are interested in this line although his actor was super popular at morphicon so who knows   again if wave two is mmpr blue black and baboo ill share your feelings
they mentioned unmasked actor heads in the hasbro presentation how would that work for someone like shadow ranger    are we actually getting a doggy cruger head or do you think thats a case where they would skip that sort of thing
  i dont see why we wouldnt just get the dog head
  the only thing im interested in is the ultrazord ill wait and see what that is if it fits well with the baf astro megazord and dino megazord ill pick it up
  i think itll certainly be case by case for characters like phantom ranger who didnt have an unmasked form he wont get an extra head cause why would he for cruger im almost certain theyll include his anubis head hasbro tends to love sculpting alien type heads and im sure hell get one hes too unique not to though i wouldnt mind if we got cruger in his civvies but that would set a strange precedent     also if dc red is in fact in the lineup i hope we see sledge and snide and again i hope for the villains they dont go with how the suit looked like but what the actual monster would look like
  im also noticing all these choices are characters theyd have no problem including every weapon for to help fulfill their morphicon promises     still waiting to see what they do when they get to anything like this
  i hope for the villains they dont go with how the suit looked like  didnt they say they were doing that for the rangers though
  dc red  mmpr pink  alright my dino team collection will be off to a good start    bm gold  whats this one meant to be beast morphers we talking beetbuster or even better j
  most communities seem overjoyed that the first wave is something other than mmrp again
  for cruger im almost certain theyll include his anubis head  itd be awesome if they did both us and japanese versions of his unmasked head
  also if dc red is in fact in the lineup i hope we see sledge and snide  i loved kyoryugers supporting villains so id love to see the deboth generals get released as part of this series ive got a soft spot for luckyuro
do we know what the scale is going to be on the lightning collection figures will they be like the larger black series or marvel legends
    yes
  why should they rerelease the most ondemand toy alongside all the other rereleases    retard
  and
  kim should give us a good idea of how theyll handle bigger arsenals figuarts tyrannoranger is the gold standard all three blade blaster forms plus thunder slinger plus combined blaster/slinger plus power weapon kim would also need an arrow or arrow holding hand if theyre not willing to go all out on one of the core mmprs then other teams have little chance of getting all their gear
  overjoyed that the first wave is something other than mmrp again  half the wave is mmpr characters whove been rehashed a thousand times
  rehashed a thousand times  i mean if youre going to split hairs you might as well admit that none of these have been done in an actual 6 scale by a domestic company
  lord zedds been done before but hes never actually had a good figure having the line start off with a good representation of him is only a positive in my mind and will get people to actually pay attention to this line
  super legends zedd is pretty much 6 inch scale if were talking figuarts/star wars black 6 inch and not legends 6 inch and boj being a domestic company means nothing when their mmpr figures were offered domestically through bluefin via countless retailers but ultimately the scale doesnt matter nor the company its the fact that weve gotten so many versions of those characters in recent years and even an old school mmpr fag like myself is feeling fatigue     and again hasbro are the ones who made it seem like this series would be treading new grounds and wouldnt just be an mmpr circle jerk so the fact that wave 1 contains three of the most obvious mmpr figures isnt instilling me with the hype that was promised like i said if they were at least offering mmpr characters who havent gotten love from bandai i could appreciate that but im kind of sick of zedd always being the go to villain pic related isnt even factoring stuff made after 2010 to which theres a lot
  if they were gonna do a dino charge character it really should have been koda seeing as he appeared in the 25th anniversary and will be appearing in the xmas episode tyler is kind of a random/blah choice for the first wave
rip imaginext
  it is 100 up to you to either acquire something at release or try for the second hand market no company is responsible and should release things just for you because you are lazy
  bummer my son adores the imaginext line and i hate that weird arm swapping/giant weapon fused to the arms gimmick playskool has replaced all of their normal figures with
    ill be buying this line for the villains so like others im not too hyped but maybe theyll kick out a decent goldar baf i can pick off ebay i figure well see escape by wave 3 and hopefully a nonmmpr villain too
    urgh i meant enter
  a shame i heard the imaginext people were really upset about that wave getting leaked and now theyre not even gonna release it
  so i see theyre trying to do a first wave where everything doesnt look like recolors of another thing in the same wave like what the legacy line thought was a good idea   so not only might it take maybe up to five separate waves to complete a team but they might end up giving us more then one monster a wave just to break up the designs more
  they want to impress me they should make zord sized monsters something bandai was never fond of doing
  im cool with that
can anyone tell me if the new white ranger figuarts is in line with the height of the others or is it the same body sculpt as before because the one i have is a manlet i have dairanger to thank for japanese justin ranger surely they wouldnt reuse the tiny sculpt again on a western only release of tommy right
  oh shit the only one i dont want is dino charge and beast morpher red
  not making horrible looking roided out power rangers toys is treading new ground everything in that picture looks bad and there are some great figure choices here that arent mmpr but boas was dogshit so redoing them isnt even bad you posted the same thing like 4 times youre entitled to your opinion but we get it man
  why would they make a new sculpt its just a rerelease with a new head
  i thought they might use the body of the other male power rangers since its a western release it was only small in the first place because in the sentai the kibaranger is a little boy
  this did suck back in the day they released all the zords but the monsters were on the figure scale no goldar to fight megadragonzordtitanus
does anyone here have a pic of miniforce rangers side by side with official rangers
  its not even that the sculpt is small some of the difference in height is due to the ankle joints green is a little bit shorter than the core males because his boots sit a bit lower on the joints and white sits even lower than green i dont think this was intentional i think bandai just fucked up you can see what im talking about in pic related
  the way they pacakged it bend the elbow joints i bought him mostly for the sword i didnt like the metallic figures so i passed on all of them getting red in regular paint with armor that came with his sword made more sense the other ranger will have to do with the 5 legacy weapons and imagenext axe for black
    i always used the 8 figures sure they were a bit shorter but it was better than northing and better than anything theyve given us since
  i just want a good looking gold and hopefully silver for beast morphers sonce beet and stag never got shf id also love for beet j stag to get a figure
  i feel like that was the intention and why they went with larger than usual figures when launching the line so monsters could be used with both rangers and zords though as far as not giving us anything better since dino charge made a large scale fury and snide which scale great with the zords i know people give those nutcracker figures shit but id have been over the moon to get some villains who were properly megazord sized as a kid
  how has bandai managed to hold on to the molds so well that knockoffs never happened anyway usually you see chinese knockoffs of most major series after a while but power rangers ones seem to be rare to nonexistant
  as a nonpower rangers fan and in fact i hated the original mmpr because i felt it talked down to the viewer ahem anyway as a nonpr fan im actually really digging the upcoming first wave of lightning    mmpr white ranger  we knew tommy was coming hes the flagship    mmpr pink ranger  an obvious yet welcome choice for the first female of the line if youre a figuarts collector you know that she was pricey to get itll be interesting to see how she looks i have a feeling her body wont look as great as figuarts but the head could potentially be great    dino charge red ranger  googled him looks cool as a red ranger variant i might grab him    lost galaxy magna defender  googled him holy yes i need this hell be put alongside my marvel legends black knight and he will say ni    mighty morphin lord zedd  ive always liked his fleshy design with the exposed brain  shows a bunch of zedds but honestly they dont look that good i mean im not trying to be a hater but theyre not great by contemporary standards maybe they were great for their time    spd shadow ranger  googled him nice a nice variation on the basic ranger design hopefully well get a doggo head    beast morphers red ranger  googled him i like the design but a bit no frills as a nonpr fan i might grab one red ranger the dino one looks more interesting to me    beast morphers gold ranger  googled him another nice variation of the basic ranger design much like shadow ranger    so as a nonpr fan i might just grab the entire wave if theres a discount for grabbing the whole wave its a nice mix only ones im really iffy on are the reds but thats because im not a pr fan
  if youre a figuarts collector you know that she was pricey to get  since i preordered the shf when it was first announced i didnt even think of that  thats probably why shes picked for the first wave
  theres actually a few on aliexpress you can find bootlegs of wild force animus several jungle fury ones a repaint of the classic dino megazord and a much upgraded version of the dino megazord
    looks like they took a lot of liberties trying to make them into something more unique rather than remaking the same 11 copies of the zords
  is the upper right corner supposed to be a more stylized version of  lower right corner
  yeah its a chinese ko that ended up becoming its own thing tv show and all
  chinese kos seem more interested in chasing the super sentai toys instead of mmpr ones
  that head sculpt is atrocious though even figuarts fucked it up one of hasbros tests will be getting that right
  bandai is so stupid for not rereleasing the pink figuarts along with the red and green ranger
  back in 0102 they were doing it you cold buy megazorddragonzord on a card back then for around 25
so brunos the one who was posting here complaining about lightning collection wave 1    
  i remember seeing a turbo megazord like this at a local five and dime store back in the day for like 15 and being so confused
shinkenger figuarts set on sale for only 50    
  jesus christ thats absurd
  he just seems bothered by people wanting mmpr figures so badly i mean fuck i want them too but when was the last time we got a magna defender fuck the way hasbro operates well probably get his kid too
  hell yeah thanks for the heads up
  i remember getting that in 97/98 union city nj used to have all these wonderful little toy shops with stuff like that
  2013 that sucks that no one bought them since then
  they were priced too high i wanted a set but not for 225
  he doesnt seem to think the legacy figures were bad but hes probably right to be worried if mmpr pink will shelf warm
  i mean at least for marvel legends females dont always pegwarm anymore which has been very refreshing but for some reason thats just not the case for ranger collectors regardless of plot importance red rangers sell first then sixths then blues and assorted males and then finally females its pretty absurd why not get the whole team idk maybe im just a completionist
  ive not seen either series but thats an awesome deal
  45 a piece thats what one figure usually goes for fair price for 5      as long as they dont put two per box it will be fine i saw blue ninja storm and in space yellow long after they released mmpr pink and mmpr yellow lasted forever because their cases contained two of each
  fair price for 5  i have no argument you are correct still though too high to want to buy it 50 however already waiting on my tracking number   i already have 2 shinken pink and the female shinken red so this set should round out my shinkengers nicely
  he just seems bothered by people wanting mmpr figures so badly  and hes not wrong the mmprs including zedd have been done to death its hard for me to get excited about characters who keep getting regurgitated    when was the last time we got a magna defender   only magna defender figures ever made were in the lost galaxy line i assume his armored form is why super legends and super megaforce skipped him in favor of cheaper to produce 6ths so the biggest takeaway from this wave is that hasbro is willing to do elaborate oneoff sculpts zedd magna and shadow are all unique sculpts without reuse potential    fuck the way hasbro operates well probably get his kid too  seeing as magna is light on accessories i wonder if theres any chance of zika being an accessory i dont care if he has little to no articulation thatd be pretty awesome      hes probably right to be worried if mmpr pink will shelf warm  i dont think the girls in this line will the sculpts bandai went with in the legacy line were a huge point of contention and then on top of that they dont come with their signature weapons realistic bodies weapons effect parts and unmasked heads will makes these girls considerably more appealing to buyers
  as long as they dont put two per box it will be fine  fucking this yellow mmpr and yellow in space are still peg warming where i live i swear ive seen hundreds of them good thing hasbro has learned from marvel legends and started making more desirable figures the doubles rather than the obscure ones
  so the biggest takeaway from this wave is that hasbro is willing to do elaborate oneoff sculpts  i really do see it more as hasbro looking at the legacy line and seeing the lack of design variety as one of the main problems   but yes that too
    hes more likely every day boys
  the red ranger has been done a gajillion times yet no one can nail the head sculpt i just want one definitive figure of this motherfucker
  lack of design variety  i dont think this would have been such a problem if the figures had their weapons the weapons are a crucial part of adding individuality to a team thats essentially the same figure five times boa not understanding this after 20 years is pretty crazy and they deserved to fail for it
  i wouldnt be surprised if the civilian head sculpts were also a way to offset this     its gonna really help out when they run out of sixth rangers and we have a wave thats one monster and a bunch of people that almost look the same besides their colors
  yeah they definitely will the actors have also amassed enough of a following to make a living off of attending cons so i have to imagine having their likenesses on figures will help sell them versus just a helmet head for instance im sure raz will buy a couple dozen emma figures with christinas likeness
honestly all i want from this line is all the villain generals we never got significant ones like darkonda deviot olympius should be at the front of the line since they were always very popular and highly demanded since the early days    i also want releases of every canon battlizer in the series most of the releases over the years were hindered by action features and weird scale differences they didnt seem to do them properly until samurai
what are your hopes for monsters and rangers/allies in the lightning collection im listing most of these by their japanese counterparts since ive seen more sentai than pr at this point    kyoryublue  kyoryugold  dragonranger/mmpr green  ninjaman/ninjor  megasilver  beet j stag remains to be seen if buddyroids will appear in beast morphers so far as i know  gokaisilver  abarekiller  abareblack    pleprechaun/finster   bandora/rita  grifforzar/goldar  junior/ritou  luckyuro  aigaron  candelira  dogold  dora skeleton/bones  dora circe/pudgy pig  dora sphinx/king sphinx
      no green ranger fig  no rangers fig from the comics    no no no no my sweet dream
whats the chances hasbro gives me another shot at this
  did you really think wed get both mmpr tommys in the first wave or that hasbro would start using up their mmpr slots for comic figures already all that stuff is guaranteed to sell so theyre saving it for waves with characters that might not sell     plus green ranger has a figure on average every two years why are you upset they didnt make him in the first fucking wave ever you know hes coming at some point
  with lord zedd coming in first i can see rita being in the second wave    id buy these figures  rita repulsa  scorpina  goldar  putty    ecliptor  astronema  quantron
  i kind of doubt theyll do any transforming megazords
  you dont think hasbro makers of transformers and where the gimmick of zords is that theyre individual bots that transform from one form into a combined mode are going to make any transforming zords i think its a safe assumption that they will
  yeah but will they make them at their usual size most transformers arent the size of megazords i doubt theyd willingly want to make a full line of larger than your average leader sized figures
    i can see them pulling an okoye sp from black panther and making rita a baf that way they can save shelf space for more rangers
  oh i doubt it i could imagine a masterpiece style of zords yet still smaller than the big bricks of the past whether theres also a line of big zords that forgo articulation for size or maybe smaller ones that remain articulated in favour of price maybe something like deluxe transformers or who knows what in between well have to wait and see i do think theyll definitely want an affordable alternative though just like for a current show mainline too       no indication of any baf yet but really no official indication of anything other than white ranger so also a wait and see     im sure well know a lot more for all of hasbros 2019 offerings probably mainly power rangers and overwatch outside of their normal items at ny toy fair in february
    it never made sense to make them so large in the first place they are not big enough for the figures to ride in them and they are too big compared to every monster its just an awkward size that never worked out for anything also it kept the earlier zords priced pretty high since they were all in the 1316 range and you typically had to buy three sets before you got the whole collection
  true enough a completed zord around the size of a combiner wars combiner albeit way more stable would be probably as big as id like them at leader size they probably wouldnt need to compromise much i suppose depending on the complexity of the zord    i wonder if well also get zords in the lightning collection non transforming articulated detailed weapons etc since that way the monsters from the series could pull double duty
  the figuarts dino charge red is still on amiami so id pass on the lightning if you like his design the red gobusters/beast morphers figuarts is always cheap online too but they never gave us a gold or silver so im really excited about that    magna defender is the best character getting a toy this wave in my opinion hes got such a great unique design and hes in the boom comics right now    shadow ranger will be best if theyre crazy enough to do the dog head though      and i missed the figuarts and never bought anything else so im excited about the mmpr guys and especially zedd
  buddyroids are on products for beastmorphers so theyre definitely in the show
the lightning collection is a definite improvement from boa but the torso/belt area looks off to me what do you guys think i hope they tweak it before release
  i thought the point was to make the zords bulkier and thicker to accommodate all the little moving parts and snap together pieces since it was designed for smaller kids to play with
    imagine how mad that one guy will be if they dont include the leaves
  youre completely right but they already said its the star wars teaming working on power rangers not the transformers team
  thicker belt looks the best
  haha you just know hell be livid about it
  no baf for the lightning collection
  granted i do hope they use the actual concept art while sculpting the monsters
  figuarts  good point on the figuarts their pricing might even go down after lightning gets released although if lightning gives us the human heads i might go for those    magna defender  hes a good design whether youre a pr or not    shadow ranger  hopefully he gets the doggo head
  thank god people need to stop pushing this shit put the value into the figure youre buying not an additional one that most people will never complete
  star wars team have made some transformers and im sure if it was required they could probably ask takara designers for help the marvel and sw team definitely discuss things which is how the face printing tech started on sw so i assume itd be much the same with the tf team either way i hope they bring their agame i have to wonder that at some point power rangers will need its own team i assume theyll do that once it establishes itself more firmly under hasbro they talked about this in their latest investors call how theyre treating it like an emerging brand for now same tier as gijoe and other lesser properties to let it get established      i dont believe it was confirmed nor denied i think they just said stay tuned which was their answer for pretty much everything though
  what the hell i thought he was a goat not a tree
    any tommy faggots looking for the sdcc figuarts its 70 on ee also sdcc jason version is on discount
    did i mention free shipping
  in zyuranger hes a woodland sprite or something to that effect because the series has multiple ties to mythology and magic
    yeah also every enemy was based on book creature or villains or even just the concept it was one of the shows themes that people dont bring up much but i believe the op did open with a book opening         i stopped bringing it up cause it seemed like it was really bothering some people
so is hasbro gonna do figures of fivem i mean power rangers supersonic
  dont forget kakuranger we still dont have solid figs of them
  and dairanger too bad figuarts only gave us ryuranger and kibaranger
  also them being separate was due to the fact that the alien ranger footage was taken from the very start of kakurangers before they merged the battle borgs into one big zord     power rangers flipped the order of kakuranger zords for season three/the movie using the animal zords from the tail end of kakurangers for the movie/start of the series then switched to the shoganzords for the second half of the season before deaging the cast and replacing them with the alien rangers
  before they merged the battle borgs into one big zord  the battle borgs and shogun zords are not the same thing
  did somebody say beetleborgs
  i stopped bringing it up cause it seemed like it was really bothering some people  nah man everybodys got their nitpicks about things i personally just love the character and want to have a good figure of him his big figure was one of the only villain toys i had as a kid and he sort of became my favorite among ritas gang
  holy shit thats needlessly confusing
  i doubt it theyre 1 story in a giant hardcover book most people will miss out on i can see drakkon ranger slayer and the solar ranger happening one day the sentries would be a great choice too but i dont know how likely it is theyd get the army building crowd too        i had a huge toy of the fatass blue thing that i loved the zyuranger monsters were great
    ok so  bandora  witch  pandoras box  wicked witch of the west  griffindor  griffin  manticore  flying monkey  squatt  gnome flying monkey too because hes blue  baboo vampire flying monkey    am i missing anything    i love how the zords work this way too    godzilla  dragon ceasar  roman motifs and pretty much dragon quest the brachiozord becomes his chariot
  wild force megazord with the eagles wings pointing upwards like in animus with two dino thunder zords as arms and a cyber planet keyshaped sword
    gx78 on sale 131 free shipping niggies
  even at that price it isnt worth the upgrade from the legacy version it would have to be around 100 for me to want to get it im still kinda hoping it hits clearance level process like the megazord did
  thats only like 10 less than it was shipped from japan
  the monster of the week was always some western mythical monster circe pig sphinx cocktrice a few black knights chimera     i thought the main group was wicked witch of the west a flying monkey henchman vampire goblin finster i have no idea
  rerelease the dinozords please hes sold out everywhere now
    a flying monkey henchman  i never understood why mmpr played at goldar being a monkey his japanese name is grifforzar in reference to his being a humanoid griffin    from what i recall baboos origin in the japanese version is that hes a vampire outcast for having never tasted blood    squatt/bookbak was i believe a sort of mashup of a troll and oni
  more or less confusing when you find out that the less bulky ones are actually the rangers transformed using ninja arts while the bigger ones are sentient in the japanese version
  they arent though 1440 they call the borgs unmorphed then morph and show up alongside them in the shogunzords    
  why did they give them the same heads theres be so much less confusion if they had differentiated them
  its a wizard of oz thing wizard of oz has a very big pop cultural undercurrent in the us that pops up subtly zordon is the wizard rita is the wicked witch ergo goldar is the flying monkey that said i dont remember them bringing up goldar being an ape too much maybe he was called such nowandthen but he never ooked or whatever plus when you say griffin most people think about eagle heads and wings and goldars face is more canine than lion
  i remember seeing the battleborgs loose at some momandpop shop years later and thinking they decided to sell the shogunzords loose for whatever reason i do think its cool how cohesive all the kakuranger designs are confusing as they may be       i mean they can assume those forms i believe but theres really no reason too when its more efficient to just have them act independently
  the frankenstein monster was always the easiest one to point out though  someone on /m/ said one of these was a triffid but i forget which one
  yea i cannot find the original dinozords anywhere but dragonzord the thunderzord set and the ninjazord set have been available everywhere for a few years now
  the damn mmpr megazord has been released several times now some series have never seen a rerelease at all i do not want to see yet another first series zords reappearance again when they have had their time and all collectors have had their change and second and third chances at it time to give the other fans a chance at their favorite zord sets for a change    you want a dino megazord ebay is overstuffed with them go there and get one of those if you really got to have one
  you had the 2009 legacy dino megazord a second run of them in 2010 which included finding them in walmart a rerelease in 2013 and the soc dino megazord which was released in 2014 cry me a fucking river if you somehow never could manage to get any of those at your leisure
  youre talking about the 1993 zords or whut
  hes an obvious newfag who cares
  any rerelease of them i would like to have one to go with the legacy dragonzord that had been available for the last couple years and is getting another release again in january thought it would make some sense to have the dinozords and dragonzord come out around the same time
  its really not unreasonable to want them to rerelease it along with everything else theres obviously still a demand for it its weird to me that theyre going to rerelease dragonzord the thunderzords and ninjazords but not dino
  ebaycom  here quit being a disturbing casual and go find your dino megazord there
  no it is very reasonable to be sick and tired of the exact same set that has been released 4 times in the past and then only see more people request that it be released a fifth time while the second hand market is overstuffed with the remains of the previous 4 releases meanwhile the other better series that i am a much bigger fan of is consistently ignored and never see any rereleases at all
  youre not going to see rereleases of any prezordbuilder stuff if they even still have any of those molds and if theyre gonna rerelease dragonzord again it makes sense to rerelease dino it really doesnt hurt anyone to do another run if the demand is still there theyre gonna lose the license soon and all those molds will be worthless so why not use them as much as possible before that happens
    i was specifically talking about the soul of chogokin release not the legacy it barely came out last year and supply only really dried up when dragonzord was released    i specifically remember amazon had some limited stock come in last summer that was only available to prime members but i didnt manage to buy one in time     i hope theres a restock when titanus releases next year the demand always seems to be highest when ultrazords can be completed
  the soc daizyujin is available on ebay but i suppose youre looking for msrp prices
  soc is priced higher than i cared for the legacy editions were good enough for me and their original prices were not too bad
  well currently the soc and legacy are around the same price in the aftermarket you might as well go with the superior product which would be the soc
im debating whether to get the legacy ninja megazord or the kakure daishogun mini pla whats your opinion goyims
  theyre around the same size the minipla is the size of a deluxe transformer and needs to be painted to looks closer to that of the legacy  although it does have much better articulation than the legacy  i prefer the legacy myself
  not really a legacy goes for 85130  the soc is about 300400
  its getting reissued overseas i dont know about the usa i wish it would get a reissue here too    the only hope i have is that i remember the dragonzord getting reissued in the uk then a couple of months later it was reissued here
  theyre around the same size  not even close
  oops meant to say theyre not the same size
  the awesome articulation and ethic involved in building the mini pla is what draws me to it but the legacy does look good
  hate to break it to ya but theres more where that came from it ridiculous but true
  typical 4chanism the chap is just having fun
armored red ranger is 17 bucks at fucking gamestop if anyone still cares    thats about the only pr related deal besides the funko monsters they have
beast morpher toys looks like its gonna be a 6 inch line like their marvel kids stuff i say 6 inch cause that stuff is more like 55 anyone know who blaze roxy evox drilltron and tronic are supposed to be cruise smash and jax are the buddyroids right
  blaze and roxy are rumored to be the enter and escape analogs and i assume drilltron and tronic are some of the motws
for the doubters that insisted psycho red psycho blue and dino thunder white were the last of the figures        
  these listings have been known for months they dont mean much unless they get updated in the next 4 months
  and yet you can preorder psycho black and dt yellow on gamestop
  no its great
i just realized pic related never showed up i wonder if he was planned at one point or if bandai just assumed they would use his revival footage
  he showed up in canada i believe
  i meant that he never appeared in the show
im interested in seeing how different the beast morpher hasbro zords are compared to the bandai jp release    honestly expecting an overdrive vs boukenger difference but maybe the bm megazord wont be a clusterfuck of bulbous armor unlike go buster oh
  i dont think itll really matter because buster oh is one of the ugliest mech designs of all time imo
  its true but i think hasbro engineers can rectify ohs bulky clunkiness and fat chest/wheel guards
  bm megazord  at least itll be fitting if it sucks
  no it is very reasonable to be sick and tired of the exact same set that has been released 4 times in the past    no thats pretty unreasonable unless someone keeps forcing you to buy it
  i dont know if youre new to power rangers toys but mighty morphin has been getting milked nonstop since 2013 maybe even 2006 if you want to be generous    half the super legends releases were mmpr  the first line when it switched to 4 inch scale was mmpr  90 of the legacy collection toys were mmpr hell we didnt get a nonmmpr replica item until this year   even with japanese releases we have had super minipla mmpr megazords and zyu only soc releases    that mmprtoys video makes a pretty good point whats the point of hasbro promising less mmpr when people are getting excited for yet another armored red ranger especially when the psycho rangers are getting their very first figures after 20 years of demand in the same wave     power rangers collectors have to deal with an overabundance of mmpr because the majority of buyers do not refuse to buy it its why they can get away with reselling the exact same morpher with new coins for 5 years with only slight redecos or why fighting spirit edition green ranger keeps popping up too
  to be fair bandai has fucked up details on mmpr rangers and the dragon vest so many damn times from helmet innacuracies to missing arm bands etc if hasbro releases the team with no problems and armored variants without the missing things then they might be able to stop for awhile also combining weapons
  i wouldnt expect this to stop with hasbro they love rehashing the same optimus starscream megatron bumblebee grimlock constructicons and hot rod over and over and over again since they were that first series that made the brand famous mmpr has the same thing going for them as that first set that made the brand popular
  the same  i thought they were different versions of the characters and werent the same from the g1 cartoon
  sometimes but it gets real old when other characters mainly decepticons  are thrown under the rug    bayformers has failed now so theyre going hard on g1 again to retain money
  the issue now is that hasbro has way more mmpr variants to work with than bandai did   original 1993 suits   rerelease with the replacement ranger heads    metallic armor    wild west rangers   ninjetti suits   1995 movie   2017 movie   dark rangers from the marvel comics   gender swapped colors from boom studios   sentry rangers   drakkon/ranger killer    the last 2 are especially in demand right now so they could easily slip in more mmpr in future waves
  they were different for a while but in recent years they seem to be making just slightly more complex adaptations of the g1 versions almost the same but with a much more complicated transformation with a lot more moving parts    there are 3 or 4 various classic versions of optimus and grimlock in stores right now
   1995 movie  hmm a super chromey shiny foil version of the ninja megazord might be interesting
  i guess bumblebee and grimlock have at least been different their past three incarnations   grimlock is just the hulk now in the new cartoon smart in robot mode me grimlock in dino mode and bumblebee in rid was basically marge simpson put into a leader role and told replace optimus while also taking care of bart lisa and homer
    rehashing the same optimus starscream etc  theyre the same ip which hasbro has to release from time to time so as not to lose the rights it also helps that these are consistent sellers but bear in mind that there tends to be a lot of variety in hasbros lineup its not like gundam where its 70 rx78 variants 25 zaku variants and 5 new  wacky outside of the core prime megatron etc there are lots of different characters and designs and even the core cast can be radically different        heres my take on hasbro inevitably revisiting mmpr hasbro is promising actual good mmpr boa had not given fans what they want they kept giving people either inaccurate unarticulated or otherwise somehow lacking figures even when they gave decent representations with decent articulation they made them musclebound or in a scale that didnt fit in with any other toyline    assuming hasbro delivers and gives pr fans ml level figures pr fans can finally get what theyve been wanting at that point they may not be as receptive to new releases of the same characters but that doesnt matter because hasbro has a lot of material to go through    not counting whatever series is on at the moment because those will obviously require a wide range of merch but as far as the lightning line is concerned hasbro has decades of material before they have to loop back or resort to variants    i mean consider this they release mmpr white and pink in the first wave next year assuming well see say 4 waves in total for 2019 and hasbro wanting to milk mmpr quick you can expect the full team by 2020 maybe polish off the mmpr ninjas by end of 2020 there is an abundance of other pr to do from 2021 to 2023 while barely scratching the surface of pr thats 5 years after the first lightning figure toy technology might have improved at that point people are going to demand that a new tommy white ranger be made
  mighty morphin has been getting milked nonstop since 2013    and yet the rerelease people want the most hasnt happened at all in that time period craaaazy
  which is what
  is this the bandai killer     it looks awful on every aspect  proportions articulations size paint disgusting yellow cheese  go grab yourself some legacy restock or shf if you can  sure bandai were scummy on prices and quantities and fucked up on many levels but you fools are going to regret it   hasbro will fuck up on quality and deliver shitty kindergarteners toys on a budget  they will drown power rangers just like they did with star wars
  wait you really think legacy is better than these you gotta be shitting me
  thinking legacy is better than lightning  preferring roid muscles and no paint to skinny proportions and actual paint detail    i guess i knew there would be doomandgroomers when the license got passed over but damn these facts are just straight up provably untrue legacy was a shit show from minute one when mmpr red came out with no sword or gun and its gone downhill from there
  paint disgusting yellow cheese    are you blind
  probably a fan or someone that hopes to someday complete a collection that may not happen now that bandai is out    the problem is bandai is really cheap they make terrible molds things are almost always unpainted or they shaped incredibly weirdly and seem to always include small parts that are not really attached at all just slid into a peg hole and can easily be lost     i like what they do but comparatively their stuff is always subpar even when they are trying to be super especial and make some amazing expensive version it is still subpar
  shorter torso is definitely the way to go
  considering the last line its probably just a butthurt star wars fag
black  gold titanus on entertainment earth for 75 definitely worth it for that price
  you know whats actually nonexistent bootlegs of the original power morpher zeonizers or turbo morpher ive seen everything from in space onward but never those first three
did anyone order the metallic samurai figuarts from bluefin since theyve been on sale have they shipped them yet
  i did but they have not shipped yet
      link for anyones whos interested
  theyve been on sale for what 2 weeks now they must have a fuck ton in stock samurai being mediocre must have really fucked sentai figuarts in america
  thats only part of it the bigger issues were      all of those figures had been out for 2 years by that point so anyone that wanted them wouldve had them by now   metallic paint which nobody likes outside of mmpr   super red instead of regular red   no gold   the standard red didnt have a metallic repaint at any point in time   fucking 250 dollars at release    i guarantee that set wouldve been long sold out if it was mmpr or even super megaforce
  that set wouldve been long sold out if it was mmpr or even super megaforce  mmpr no question super megaforce im not so sure though i think people would have been able to better justify the metallic paint on those by nature of that form being a power up if bandai were hellbent on doing samurai they should have done them all in super samurai mode it would have required some new parts for the girls but those parts did exist in prototype form and that set would have been infinitely more appealing to people even if it were still metallic the power up rational could apply same as super megaforce
  super megaforce  behind mmpr these are by far the most popular team of figuarts
  people still loved the super megaforce suits even it they hated the adaptation since most knew of gokaiger    mmpr shouldve been the logical choice but i guess these guys were in the plans before they got the chance to see that samurai wasnt a hit with older audiences
if anyone was still holding out hope here it is    ive already got most of the boys so im probably keeping my psycho black po
  whatever happened to the anon that kept saying they were gonna release rita
  so glad i didnt bother with them i had a feeling wed get fucked
  fuck man literally the only one i gave a shit about was pink because she survived the longest
  hahahahahahahaha the psychos were the only good figures they made and they couldnt even finish them
  what a fucking waste
  she was canceled along time ago but people always want sources or proof not worth risking someones job over a figure
  so glad i chose to stop after the lightning news
  this is most likely true but prn is not a reliable source anything that comes from them should be taken with a grain of salt      seeing as rita wasnt ever a part of the 65 legacy line this has nothing to do with her the 65 line would need to get through two waves of figures in order to get anything beyond psycho black/dt yellow and at the rate theyve been stocked/selling well be lucky if they even get to the psycho black/dt yellow wave     however unlikely it is nothing would be stopping bandai from releasing rita in a new 5 series of figures could be another wave of good versus evil walmart exclusives could be something else entirely we wont know for certain until their time is up or they themselves confirm nothing else is coming the last we heard from them they mentioned still having some surprises up their sleeves and they previously said early 2019 was the final window for new products so its premature to make any assumptions beyond the 65 line at this point and we can only make assumptions on the 65 line because its backlogged by almost a year
  i hope you never stop posting stuff like this even after the license expires
so has there been any indication of what hasbros toylines are going to look like besides jerking off mmpr obviously    i would assume that theres only so many times you can release the same handful of zords
  lighting collection was leaked    zords werent besides ultrazord i believe
  i would assume that theres only so many times you can release the same handful of zords  you would think so but between titans return classics power of the primes and new movie there are 4 red truck g1 style optimuses with the same transformation on shelves right now hasbro is a huge fan of releasing the same handfull of figures
  where the fuck do you live that titans returns and classics optimus are still on the shelves did you mean cyberverse and siege i havent seen any siege shit personally maybe you should have said cyberverse power of the primes and studio series but i guess the studio series has a different transformation though   oh speaking of the titans returns transformation is completely different too because hes a triple changer
  see that was exactly what made me start thinking about how hasbros going to handle this line all those optimuses and megatrons have different gimmicks or transform differently tr has that triple changer and powermaster one potp has the evolution gimmick the movie ones have a distinct design etc    but i would assume theyre not going to alter the mmpr zords right i would guess were just going to get some kind of simple kids line and a studio series thing short of making the same zords a little more screen accurate every year or so i dont really know how theyll do it    transformers is good at milking designs but theyre just kind of applied in broad strokes optimuses are always trucks but different kinds of truck but i dont see them making the sabertooth tiger a different kind of sabertooth tiger    how does star wars handle it those guys are all about acreen accuracy right is it just the same tie fighter toy every year
  i mean they completely own the brand so i guess its not impossible for them to just invent oc zords and make them compatible with the same toys
  how does star wars handle it those guys are all about acreen accuracy right is it just the same tie fighter toy every year    i think the last vehicle was the haslabs jabba the hutt thing     maybe well get a haslabs juice bar or something i dunno whats a big thing you could see being crowd funded that would never have a real market in retail outlets
  i expect to see a dino megazord release with insane levels of greebley detail all over everywhere and then call it some super special classics line or something similarly titled
  i mean id probably buy it    i just want zords that are good toys individually instead of solid blocks of plastic if hasbro can manage that ill be happy
is 279 for a used black edition legacy ultrazord a good price thing apparently has a repaired sword that was busted though cant really tell how much wear and tear there is from the pictures
  might as well get a soc if youre going for that price
  i think it might be possible if they released them like their combiner wars sets where each individual zord is sold separately and can stand as a figure by its own
  i just want zords that are good toys individually instead of solid blocks of plastic  buy the soc then it fits your requirements
  this piece of garbage has been sitting  in bluefins warehouses for years
  in a nutshell
  but i want the whole shebang not just the megazord
  oh i missread that as megazord for that price id definitely say go for it   if its in good condition that is
  oh i think everyone knows that
  its accurate but i dont like how it does stuff like have the tiger legs not be fully posable    a cheaper mass market toy might be more likely to take liberties with the designs to make individual zords more playable toys like putting balljoints in the tigers legs so it can pose like an actual animal or making a not shit pterodactyl
  the tigers legs are fully posable what are you talking about the socs range of motion on the individual zords are pretty screen accurate the sabertooth tiger never really moved like an actual cat
  congratulations you missed the entire point
  didnt they sort of do this with the more recent legacy tiger and tyrannosaurus the ones that cannot transform into parts but are standalone tows
  yeah something like thats what im talking about
  no i see your point im just not sure exactly what youre looking for how exactly could the triceratops mastadon and pterodactyl be made better than the soc the extra range of motion the legacy single trex has is nice but it looks funky and then the tiger could maybe benefit from some outward motion on its legs but its hardly necessary but the other three are basically blocks and youd have to take major liberties with the designs to give them more articulation more changes they make more fans they piss off just look at the reception the legacy trex and tiger got
  are you actually autistic
  how can you add articulation to the triceratops mastadon and pterodactyl without compromising the designs
  literally the first post you replied to addressed this you illiterate chimp
  a new command center
  if youre willing to compromise the design and the main feature the combination whats the point why do they have to be pr why cant they be any robo dinos
  nobody said anything about combination
  just shut the fuck up and get the goddamn soc already you arent going to get anything better than that
  no its made of bricks because its trying to emulate cardboard robots from 30 year old tv show with a 10 dollar budget
  go buy the 2017 megazord then
  no its the same
  its trying to emulate cardboard robots from 30 year old tv show  well yeah thats kinda the point of a power rangers toy go buy a transformer or something if youre going to be like this
  i think you would be pretty much alone in wanting that the tv series had guys n cardboard and some slightly more articulate toys seen in the transformations and that is going to be what most people will want
      so how does transformers manage to make a multitude of different versions of the same character while maintaining the spirit of that character but power rangers always has to be a perfect recreation of the same thing    is it just a shallower brand
  bandai didnt own power rangers hasbro can do whatever it wants with tf
  right which is why i said that now they have more freedom to make different kinds of toys
    bruno seems to believe the 5 rita was canceled if you trust his word on these sort of things
  because there tends to be multitudes of different versions of said characters how many different versions are there of optimus and megatron theres been two versions of the original dino megazord the original and the 2017 version also transformers arent tied into a very specific style like pr is
  while im firmly in the camp that its canceled bruno said at morphicon that as soon as the bandai people lost the license they literally stopped returning his calls    i was honestly surprised he still considers the legacy figures fine after that i guess he wasnt a shill after all
  circular logic its tied to a specific style because theres never been a new version of the design but theres never been a new version because its tied to a specific style
  theres never been a new version of the design  but that is blatantly untrue what is the 2017 megazord wouldnt it be considered a redesign weve also seen stylized action figures if the megazord like pic related the style is different but the actual design is the same
  yes those would be redesigns but    said that never happened so i was referring to his circular logic
  the style is different but the actual design is the same    stylization  design
  2017 megazord  stylized action figures  and those were both shit lesson to be learned is if it aint broke dont fix it
  hahahahahahahaha     im sure hes still a shill just wait until he tries to blow hasbro
  he already is all of a sudden hes started posting marvel legends
  actually at this point it seems like hes given up on buying them except ps4 spiderman there hasnt been anything about them in almost a month and the thing i remember from his marvel legends videos was gosh this paint is great i sure hope the power rangers have paint like this   if hes trying to shill to hasbro hes not really doing a good job with it
  translating animation to a physical toy allows for a lot of liberties but the mmpr series actually showed all the function of every zord on screen so people are naturally going to want something pretty close to what they saw
    that seems to line up with the timeline ive been trying to piece together their last big showing was new york comic con and they stopped mentioning power rangers after october 2017 on their twitter page more than likely they learned the license was going to lapse around that time so most of the planned items for super ninja steel were scrapped and they only produced the bare minimum to meet contractual obligations with retailers and saban at the time      were in the middle of the christmas season which is usually the time when we see new items if theres nothing out now we probably arent getting anything new in the next few months    pretty sure those surprises were just those random red ranger variants weve seen the last few months      its almost like no one wants to watch him review marvel figures when theres hundreds of others already doing that
  say what you will about bruno but at least his reviews are light hearted he pointed out good stuff about legacy figures just not the bad stuff too unfortunately    id still take it over cleavage pay me through patreon shartimus prime and i cant be wrong because my reviews are objective anthony customs i miss glenn webb
  cant blame him guy worked for shout factor who worked with saban and he made good friends with bandai employees since he moved he probably wont get that intimate hook up since hasbros pr team are also going to stay in cali instead of their rhode island hq    also if like his reviews more if they didnt have so much fluff feels like he often drifts off to completely different subjects and loses you before his plugs at the end
  that was the point of the post you replied to
  if boa had taken more time and throwna few pennies at the legacy rex it wouldve been way more welcomed by fans desu i do think only the tyrannozord would benefit from an individual treatment for several reasons
new 
  jesus christ way to shit on the people who bought the other psycho rangers    i thought about getting white dino but he looked like such shit i passed i hate the visor
    where can you buy miniforce figures
why arent there more toys that have drills for hands     also this is not a tf general
anything can be drill if you spin it fast enough you just gotta believe

im drawing a blank are most polys fully painted or semi painted i recall someone mentioned that they were made of resin
  the original garage kits were resin but since becoming a retail line all of them have been made of plastic    as for painting there was a short period of time where their entire bodies were painted vania and i think one other in order to avoid the yellowing issue but daibadi has since switched to a different factory that isnt garbage so theyre back to being bare plastic
  the newer old vania shits on the older original by a good mile shes great
  thanks for the info i wasnt sure if they were or werent plastic because they sort of looked like topcoated resin at least my lana sort of does several of her parts felt similar to a daibadi colored resin kit i obtained recently so i wasnt sure
finished building a friend for lana
lana
  is that a garage kit looks good
  yeah its the daibadi venus one got one off gk model but i wanted to change the colorscheme
  left one is cute af
how likely it is that a used polynian will fail a black light test bad daddy general
so i was a dumbass and lost one of my shamrocks ear pieces is there a way i can buy/order a replacement
  i guess it depends on the level of degeneracy
  unfortunately not
  disappointing but understandable    long shot but would anyone be willing to sell me one its the left ear piece
  i glued them on cuz i didnt want that to happen
i know they sell branded replacement joints for these figures but are there another brand of joints i can use
  figma/revoltech/hobby base    whatever fits into the holes
  thats not really helpful
  nice tasteful colors too by the looks of it
  thanks anon
  okay i take it back actually theyre pretty fuckin great
alrighty everyone looks like grey iana is going up for preorder real soon as in tomorrow according to the tweet so tonight for us set for an april 2019 release shell come with the same accessories that original iana came with except in grey price is set at the regular 5100 yen
  her full load out
  and another pic to show of her charm
also going up tomorrow is the first official polynian clothing piece the polynian open back sweater this here puppy is set for a january 2019 release so hopefully it ships out with reimu price is set at 1500 are you guys excited about this or are you skipping it
  pic of dear ol iana wearing the sweater       this looks real neat anon very nice job
  ooh i didnt even know this was a thing at 15 im not sure if ill buy it though it looks a bit too simple if they release more casual clothes id be all over it
          wasnt expecting these so fast  i wasnt expecting the sweater at all actually
  im gonna need a source anon
  hair here looks closer to purple than the brighter pink seen in previous protoype photos hope its not just product photo lighting because it looks much better than the pink
  he cant reverse google    i found it
iana and the sweater are now up at amiami     iana sits at 5230     the sweater is sitting at 1530   
  the tweaked hair color is a huge step up
that sweater gives me weird vibes like they actually have seen my photos
  if youve posted them on twitter than he probably has
  tell you what post a shamrock pic and ill give source
  was the original release this fat on the front or is it just the color
  literally the exact same
  optical illusion someone always comments this on grey releases
  yeah the gray models show lighting better and it works well with the curves
     here
  this  mean this for you
  cant say i really like the pink hair more than the green but ianna is ianna so of course shes still precious
  it probably is too much but i am weak and already got a few from piconeemo before
  the alternative was blue hair but die baddy is dumb and went with pink
sweaters up    
  preordered two of em cause why not
did daibadi photoshop out the foothole or is it gone i dont recall the feet being different on my standard ianna
  shoop or special promo foot part
  just give her a pink dress and some cake accessories
  make a diorama with spoilercrossbone gundam/spoilersontoylol
  special promo foot without hole to plug into peg for easy posing    butwhyjpg
  i meant promo as in they use it for promos not its distributed as a promo
    id say the best thing to do is just contact daibadi directly they may still be able to help you although the longer you wait the less likely the chance becomes    they helped me out when my ianna had two of the same bicep pieces but i got in touch with them as soon as she was out
fucking around with my new camera and monitor backlighting cant wait until i get a proper tripod so i dont have to worry about my shaky hands ruining the focus
happy halloween polybros
    i absolutely love your photos and your clover setup ive been wondering where i could get pinkle faces to replace mine because hot damn theyre cute keep up the good work
  thank you so much theres a decal set which has blank faceplates too i think but its decalbased and that scares me
    every website i find those on has no information except ami ami which just says to use the faces with the stickers or paint them but the decals say nothing about using them im a little confused as to why they didnt just make a face kit importing those would feel like such a waste
  thats great
  yeah id pay good money for a preapplied decal pack with some more facial expressions i would love to see motoroidstyle faces with real eye expressions that arent just  or 
  also im pretty sure the faces are waterslide decals very forgiving in terms of placement but im sure theyre still very difficult to align i dont even use my mels standard faceplate anymore because of a very tiny misalignment and i have very shaky hands so im sure my own work would drive me nuts especially if its meant as an accessory to my photos
    i do like waterslide decals i have shamrock who has no eyes so i could in theory just use decals on him but i do like the nomouth roboteyes look ill figure it out
  orrr make custom eye decals if you can find hires pictures of the eyes but its looking like most images of the decal sheet are pretty small
newfag here one of the figs caught my eye so i asked about her on a buyfag thread and got directed here  is there like a guide on these girls the figures look amazing
  a polynian users guide  1 open package  2 enjoy figure
  why would you need a guide they arent gks dont be silly
    i was just wondering if there was anything to look for specifically such as better models or defects  also curious where they even come from i only just noticed that one in particular when shopping for other figs and really liked the designs googling just brought up more figs so its just a toy line
  geez its just an action figurine
    try to use at least google next time        
  first link is all jap cant copy paste  second is just a bit of lore    tthanks
  jap  watch your language    second is just a bit of lore      nope thats the main directory so there are tons of links there even the short movies also   there is a thing called ocr for images
watch your language  you
  what the fuck do you want  go to myfigurecollection and search for polynian or daibadi and youll see all the models
    so people help you and on top of that your only response is being ironic
  theyre expensive but if you need thick girl i would preorder that gray jana/iana her white model and the renewed clover/shamrock figures have as far as i know the best quality control so far and i believe pinkle and bluet are pretty good too im not sure about the others but i know some of the older figures had qc issues before they changed factories
  let me clarify aftermarket prices can get expensive
  mel and yume are to be avoided at all costs in terms of qc yumes original release had horrible joints and yellowing mel yellowed and had slightly misaligned face prints and yumes rerelease had issues too i think lucio had fuckedup face prints too but i think you can still get replacements
  my mel is still white and has faces that are just fine
  grey mel should be fine though right
  yeah shes fine afaik
how good of quality are these figures i want to start collecting but i hear mixed things about them falling apart easy
  i think that was just one original yume and some had discoloration issues because china    most are okay i only have two but theyre solid
  they are as solid  qc is a bit better than mafex and a little worse than figma  the paint can be a little wonky on certain releases and three of the releases are to be avoided at all costs yume mel and lucio but other than those they are all pretty good
    thanks anons was mainly interested in ops pic and reimu when she comes out   so thanks a lot
  ops pic  its a recolor of vania and i can confirm the original is fine  some joints are a bit of a tight fit but otherwise shes good
  thanks anon
    what about the gray versions of mel and yume do they have the same problems
  grey mel came out after the factory switch and should be fine  i dont think grey yume is out yet but she is also probably going to be good
    thats good it also helps that gray mel looks nice with the alt colours although i still think original mel looks nicer
finally got my first poly really pleased with her out of all the figures i own shes probably the most fun to pose i think thats why i was interested in the series besides being cute theyre just so expressive
i like that they work well with 112 accessories too
hey does anyone know how to get the yellowing out i got a secondhand clover a while back and shes fine except for her angry/ embarrassed face its got some yellowing on her cheeks but nowhere else is it normal
  probably the faceplate the prior owner used the most thus had the most exposure  fixes for yellowing are generally chemical baths with peroxide mixes i think would probably scorch her face clean off along with the yellowing if it even worked
  i thought the update ver were made better
    yeah but i just cant buy a gray version
  was this update then it was likely in a bad environment possibly a smoker or direct sunlight  if it was og then itd be really yellow and not just the cheeks
  yeah shes the updated version so im pretty confused the rest of her is perfectly fine
  well updated arent yellow proof just brought up to normal industry standards instead of 3rd rate chink factories  even top tier plastic will yellow if you leave it in the sun or humidity   the only likely answer is a careless owner
expanding my polys with more shammies
  nice shammy army do you have a number goal or do you just get em when you see em for a good price
  i just get them when i see a good deal those two were sold for 45 here on bts
how hard would it be to mod one of these
  depends how good you are at sculpting
how are my preorders lookin
  that ass and ponytail  alvin comes with girly parts
  yes
  emil sold way too poorly for them to risk another maleonly release
  alvin look pretty much just like a cheeky flat chested girl even without any of her female parts on
  i think that had more to do with the colors they chose for him but he is one of my favorites came out clean and is sturdy
  if he was a more pleasing color scheme i would definitely want one
  emirus muted color scheme was always a charm point for me and ironically helps him stand out among his polypeers  anyways thoughts on his recolor dont like the hair but like it otherwise
  is that one gray skin he looks pretty cute to be honest
  same here he looks like he raped and ate some poor ups driver
      my main problem with emil is that i feel like his outfits color scheme should have been the same as or at least similar to yumes theyre both sailor outfits for presumably the same school so it doesnt make sense that hes got this ups driver color scheme
search new polynesian robot in gelbooru  no vania porn  no vania art at all  why
  if they included the female parts i would have opted for him i only found out they existed long after they sold out but i would have probably put in a preorder had he come with them from the start
  i might buy him just to put the hair on other polys i love pink and already got a shammy head on normal emil because it looks super cute with his clothes
  polynesian  cant wait for the daibadi x moana figures
  forget moana daibadi bionicles when
  kinda wish it was blue instead heres a custom someone did
  or even like clovers uniform here
  why is the girl wearing blue and the boy is wearing pi    hes shamrock    nevermind
emil has one of my favorite color pallets in the line  fuck alla yall
  gday mate 
  yes which is exactly why he didnt bargain bin  i forgot i had him til i read this post
ive almost finishing collecting the complete line of polys not including reissues/update versions ive got my eye on lucio next but i want to buy one with fixed parts/non derp face backordering from amiami probably wont get me those update parts included right
just got these for 165 shipped as my first step into the line did i do good
  check them to make sure theyre all there and in good shape if they are its cool if more than one are unusable then you got scammed though yume and swimmer both have some qc issues which might by why they were sold
  thank you what are some of the qc issues with swimmer and yume
  loose joints
  ah ok thats not too bad   also is shamrock considered a boy because if he is then im gay
  that furniture
  mel swimmer has yellowing issues and some had some misaligned faces back when she released yumes original release had many things wrong loose joints parts would not stay in place and also had yellowing issues her rerelease intended to fix these but she still had some porblems ircc also yes shammy is a guy he ended the war by getting a human girl pregnant       
  he ended the war by getting pregnant    fixed
are there any manga/anime/game series with similar character designs
  western but my life as a teenage robot  drossel from fireball if you want something motoroid flavored   cave story a little bit
having a lotta fun with these picco clothes
  pico boots that fit polys  how i tried their sandals and there was no way theyd ever fit
  im guessing he took off the feet and its just shin in the boot      cute
  polys amputate themselves to be fashionable  metal as fuck
i hope you all had a great thanksgiving guys
anyone have the artwork of the titty police chief
  here you go anon
  release when
  i got hammered set up a model kit bathroom for my polys and glued myself to everything in the process
seems like a new polynian clothing piece is being displayed at ak garden cute little dress       sounds like a grand ol time man
  dat shotgun  literally cannot wait
  how about asking the daibadi folks about it on their twitter or whatever if they see enough interest maybe theyd do a release of it
  your shamrocks missing an ear did you glue that to yourself too
  esas12  jej
how do you sort out the pieces  do you keep all the hands together or separate them
  i just use the original box
  oh my
  if theyre like me they keep the ears put away most of the time im too paranoid about losing them on my grey since theyre loose    also theyre pretty tight on my white shams so it adds a bit of difference to the two
closer picture of the baby doll dresses seems itll come in two sizes one for the thinner frames that most polynians share and one for the thickness that iana brings with her the pink shows off the smaller size and the blue is the larger size
  they best crank out some more thicc bots in that case
  shamrock wearing the pink baby doll   official polynian display in a public exhibition/convention/whatever    ok just in case anyone was wondering if the trapbot was an accident from /d/aibadi heres the ultimate definitive proof they fully knew what they were doing
    nope lost one  i already contacted daibadi a month ago and they basically said im shit out of luck      im into shamrocks but lanas doesnt even cover her chest
  is the iana body type going to get some more detailed figures or is it going to remain those basic figures
  kelly will have the same base bodytype
  i keep all of my pieces together all hands all faces etc
  they made a robot with a crotch bulge there was never any doubt
  well its a long shot but you could get into molding at home and make a cast based off your white shamrocks pieces    i think some of the fellows in the shinki thread do that kind of thing
  how was it in any way possibly an accident
  yes i thought about that but im no good at sculpting for shit
  on that thought maybe 3d printing would work though im not sure the technology is at a point where the resulting products texture wouldnt stick out like a sore thumb on a regular figure
  im glad someone else shares my dumb sense of humor  im half tempted to to a mockup but cant think of anything except trapbots with masks
how rare is pic related and where can i get one
  here  com tw/ gkm/ product/ p17097510
  easy its up on ebay but you have to put in the work to make it
  lanas doesnt even cover her chest  i mean it is sexy lingerie also it covers half her boobs where her nipples would be if she wasnt a robutt  regardless its super cute
  do it different anon but i would also like to see this mashup
  what are the correct colors i want mine to resemble the promo as much as possible
does the gray version mel suffer from qc issues like her white version does
how poorly do the whites match between lucios face and shamrocks body
  mine turned out fine it wont run into any offwhite sunfade issues and joints feel normal
why are the gray versions less coveted im prancing back and forth whether i should get the thicc robot as my first
  why are the gray versions less coveted  aesthetics
  why are the gray versions less coveted  are they i didnt get that memo
  you can but you need a very detailed printer because its so small or at the very least you can fiddle with the settings and then sand out the final product
  because white is right
  can anyone answer this
  the mismatch between painted and plastic is noticeable id definitely like it if having the other boys in swimwear would look better
im finna order three preorder polyniggas from amiami    what shipping best fo these hos
  dhl if you want it quickly sal if you dont give a shit about possibly waiting two months
  usually the difference is around 12 bones
  sounds about right    where amiami is concerned ems isnt even worth it anymore since dhl is both faster and cheaper     with it i regularly get my stuff within two days of being shipped
  thank you very much friend    i cant want for my janna to get here
    airmail the best of both worlds unless youre not an americunt
   seems itll come in two sizes one for the thinner frames that most polynians share and one for the thickness that iana brings with her    i think its just one size fits all like the sweater
so that schmetterling shinki addon pack works pretty well with shamrock i just needed to cut off some pegs on the inside
  holy shit thats cute does this essentially mean that other shinki gear would work ok on polys
what are some other sexy robot figures  im too poor fag to drop cash on polys
  zaku ii
  
  ooo i already have this one i dont think ill paint her though    thicc
  theres racaseal and that figma robololi that looks like a ripoff red drossel
  original effect momos if you can find them for a decent price on mandarake
previous thread     were less than a month out from bumblebee anyone looking forward to the new studio series optimus figure
  if you mean this one then yes if you mean the one based on the bumblebee design well im going to need to see the figure first
youre going to buy me right anon you arent poor are you
  you look hideous i wouldnt have bought you if you were 50 im so disappointed with what the mp line has become
  whether or not i can afford it has nothing to do with why im not getting it
  i fell out of collecting movie figures after rotf how much better is ss prime than the rotf voyager  i replaced the first movies firststrike voyager with pic related and havnt ever thought that he needed further replacing
  g1 cartoon accuracy is the worst thing in transformers since springloaded projectiles battle damage and beast wars retrax
  sorry fag saving up for the big convoy reissue and ss constructicons
  i am sorry cartoon optimus  i like your older brother better since he doesnt have cartoon aids
  springloaded projectiles  whats so bad about those
start posting toys you fags so i can see what kind of stupid bullshit i want to buy with the money i dont have
reminder to report and hide him do not feed him yous
  real talk no memes will this sell out or shelf warm
  it will wait patiently until the first price cut then fly off the shelves
  and yet i bought one used from a comiccon  because i was curious alright mom    still him and bonecrusher give the best hugs
  kay
  i like his altmode better but thats just me
  it will sell  g1 cartoonfag loyalty levels are only matched by their pure unadulterated shit taste
  im only worried about not being able to get a pair of swords since i skipped the first one
  you fucked up if you didnt look for a good sale last weekend
  yes
  im still trying to figure out how to order from amazon without getting fucked by customs
did this little guy ever get a standalone release of any kind or any repaints i wind up messing with him far more than i do metroplex hes great
  no
  i see what you did there
  only one but it was funpub
    too bad hes a fun little guy
  eh im gonna use my va payment for him   thank you taxpayers
  i wish you had died for israel
im usually pretty positive on bayformers but this dude sucks ass
  is there a single funpub figure worth paying the late tax on
  what in the fuck is this supposed to be
  tlk skullitron
  when theyre all in a row like that mp10 looks like a fat dumpy dwarf how did we ever trick ourselves into thinking he was worth the money then
    enjoy being owned by a subhuman nouveau riche gook insect with more money than common sense i guess
  hah i was intel my job had me in a office hidden away
  jesus look at this thing what a waste of plastic
  please stop posting pictures of it
  im not touching this thing but i absolutely cant wait to see how it transforms
  its going to be absolutely hilarious because were going to get to see takaracucks going full sunk cost and the turd party guys flipping out over getting called poorfags
  there was controversy even then about his proportions but he was shiny and new and that overrode those criticisms now with a much more expensive price tag and a world where 3rd party exist hes not getting such an easy pass this time
        is this the shit serious collectors put up with  i guess theres no reason to dive deeper than regular lines in that case
  toss out all the crap i dont want to lower your price and well talk    thats probably going to happen anyway though hastak is seriously overestimating the chances of this thing priced as is
  what i can see his roof and grill is in his backpack his bot mode gas tanks are here   this is going to be a mess to transform
  seriously this other companies do that shit all the time   basic model includes gun and matrix maybe the ax  dx model includes trailer and all that other stuff hes coming with now
  thats semen isnt it
  this is going to be a mess to transform  paint chipping is guaranteed to be worse than megs
  a lot of what hes coming with i really have no care for   want  main body x 1 optimus prime  compartment x 1 trailer  war damage head x 1  battle damage chest parts x 1  cabin antiaircraft gun x 1  small ball x 1 roller  energy axe x 1  beam special effects x 2  laser rifle x 1  not want   energy treasure x 1  energy supply tube x 1  spike x 1  carly x 1  spike pula sparkplug x 1  rocket backpack x 1  starscream head x 1  starscream wings accessories x 1  an unknown item x 1   replacement head carving x 1    i am all for references but when its a large cost figure it makes me sour on anything extra
  oh my fucking god even the truck mode is hideous
  ill probably buy hound but honestly exhaust was the last mp i really enjoyed i absolutely hate the how flat theyve made everything and dont even get me started on the train wreck that is the beast wars mps plus the prices have gotten ludicrously excessive    as somebody who more facets of the brand than just the sunbow cartoon ive just totally soured on the mp line i guess theyre cash in on as many boomers as they can before they croak but i hope its worth it for them to chase everybody else away to turd parties
  sell out retards cant fucking help themselves and always buy what theyre told to even if they know its bad    thats why fallout 76 still made money desite being god awful
  ill probably buy hound  a fool and his money are easily parted
  well see at least he doesnt look like complete shit so far but if hes more than 80 then no fucking way
  you are the single ugliest figure ive seen this year including one step shit and shampoo bottles
  sunstreaker went for over 100 on us sites and around 85 or more on japanese sites before shipping so i expect him to be in the ballpark if not a little higher due to price increase
  he doesnt look like complete shit so far  hahaha  if hes more than 80 then no fucking way  but dont you want your accessories referencing one particular scene of the cartoon
  60 for sideswipe   90 for sunstreaker  80 for ironhide  90 for hound  this timeline is kinda shit
  im glad the mp line has turned to shit  you guys are a blight on the franchise
  i know i wish i would just buy shitty overpriced main line figures
    thank goodness for siege hound
  if by you guys you mean g1onlyshitters who have to have perfect cartoon accuracy then yeah but there isnt really anything wrong with wanting higher quality tfs than what you can pick up at the local walmart
  it didnt used to be like this there was a time above a time before      at least theyre making it abundantly clear that the mp line isnt for toy enthusiasts anymore they have shifted their focus to hardcore collectorfags whose knowledge of transformers begins and ends with sunbow and who are also likely single with lots of disposable income      ive just totally soured on the mp line i guess theyre cash in on as many boomers as they can before they croak  sadly its probably the most profitable business model for them right now      but if hes more than 80 then no fucking way  oh he will be especially when they include a ton of transparent minifigures with him to approximate every hologram he ever projected as well as a 6x8 inch plastic cage to put the eventual clusterfuck edition mp ravage in
  ravage really does need a redo hes so puny just to justify the tape launching gimmick nobody uses on mp soundwave
    im not good going to buy you because im just fine with mp10 also why dont you take a hike with that giant ass backpack of yours
  mp44  msrp 440  i see what they did there takara is having a cheeky laugh at all the dipshits that are going to buy this they probably specifically inflated the price by adding all of those useless plastic baubles just to fuck with retarded american sunbow fans who are going to import because they fucking know theyre going to bite
  you do realize normal figures went up in price as well right  not by literally several times  mp10 the entire package with the trailer and all was originally around 150 dollars  the new optimus mp comes with meme garbage and it goes past 400 dollars thats just unacceptable    a p o l o g i z e  classics was shit all of it theres not a single good classics figure      if by you guys you mean g1onlyshitters who have to have perfect cartoon accuracy then yeah  i meant that
how good is generations scoop im really having the urge to buy that orange boi
  we were just talking about him the other day a couple anons got sold on him i love the orange lad myself
  440  for that price you could buy 22 siege cogs thats twentytwo i dont think im being hyperbolic when i say that is probably undoubtedly a better bang for your buck than mp44
i collect the modern diaclone line and even i thing the new optimus is comically overpriced    that thing is pretty shit looking and has mongaloid tier paint
  good lord think about the combined monstrosity you could make with that many cogs
  im going to buy the green one and the normal one when i find them cheap because of you guys  normal scoop will be the base for this guy though
  youre gonna need something to replace his scoop for the altmode unless you planned on leaving it asis it covers up a pretty sizable gap so if you remove it youll want something else to go there and stow on his back in robot mode   also i have no idea if green scoop will ever be cheap anywhere magic 8 ball says outlook not so good
    takara killed bandai and is now renaming mugenbine cog
  sunstreaker was ridiculously overpriced i think i bought mp prowl for like 50    ironhide was pretty big and had a good set of accessories and even he was pushing the limit at around 100      that actually looks way worse than i thought those fucking knees are inexcusable and that head is looks like he has cancer    but dont you want your accessories referencing one particular scene of the cartoon    why do they fucking do this does anybody ever use them just give me more goddamn guns or a sword
  you could also buy a decent starter collection of the best postrotf era tfs even at scalper prices  hell you could even buy a couple of better g1 3p optimi  there are so many better things you could do with that money
  i dont know his beast mode is pathetic but theres something about him that i find pretty fun maybe its just how goofy he is      at least theyre making it abundantly clear that the mp line isnt for toy enthusiasts anymore    this
  youre gonna need something to replace his scoop for the altmode unless you planned on leaving it asis it covers up a pretty sizable gap so if you remove it youll want something else to go there and stow on his back in robot mode  yeah i plan on giving it an altmode based on his ben hur buggy so pic related would be the actual starting point of the custom  i thought of also modding the chest so it cheats the lanciachest from behind a windshield but ill see if its possible once i have it    also i have no idea if green scoop will ever be cheap anywhere magic 8 ball says outlook not so good  it pops out on mandarake once in a while a long while  i just have to make sure to actually buy it this time
  cog and sixgun are my favorite mugenbine releases
    though if youre dumb enough to buy it at 440 from bbts then you deserve to lose your money
  thatd be an alright way to do it then you could leave the scoop in place and just modify it slightly to be random engine bits or whatever by filling it in with something the chest part might be replaceable with a similarlysized windshield of your choosing theres only a pin on his belly holding it there
  at least theyre making it abundantly clear that the mp line isnt for toy enthusiasts anymore they have shifted their focus to hardcore collectorfags whose knowledge of transformers begins and ends with sunbow  fucking geewun nostalgiafags ruin everything  i remember a few years ago after starsaber and the announcement of the beast wars guys when some people in these threads thought this line might branch out from full on pandering to western geewunners more often than once in a blue moon  those were more innocent times
get a really cool idea for a custom  go search for the materials  all sold out everywhere locally  importing would cost too much to feel its worth it  bbbbbuuuuuueeeeeeeeehhhhhh
  what character was it
whos the prime of actionmasters
  geyejoe prime
  rollbar  i was planning to get a cw hound for cheap gut the combiner peg cover the hole in the torso with polystyrene and add some square sunglasses now its completely gone everywhere and i used to see it as shelfwarming filth like two years ago
  geyejoe prime  ahh the mortal enemy of geeaxus cousin of whatchagonnaduimus
  reminder that thundercracker is the only transformer who is a member of gi joe in any continuity
  you meant skywarp right
it is awesome
  skywarp
  have you not caught up on the comics or are you just retarded skywarp is also a member
  hang yourself
  its okay but since its the inferior g2 megatron it gets a yawn/10 from me
  have you tried your local flea markets or fb groups i know people here hate fb but if you only use it for finding stuff locally its pretty useful
are micromasters and minijpcobs basically the same thing also who are your favorites from either group i love the star saber crew and the street team who become armada percepter also sideways combining buddies theyre great
  pic related even
  minijpcobs  fuck you too then autocorrect
  the difference is that micromasters arent shit most of the minicons were ugly little things with dreadful articulation to accomodate their gimmicks just like everything else from armada
  i dont disagree really but how is that different than micromasters minicons seem to be micromasters with a powerupport articulationwise most were on par with micromasters a few faired better than others i like the little silver plane/gun guy that came with deluxe optimus and the team who became the requiem blaster were cool too i always liked how the rocket could ride on the little truck vertically or horizontally and the satellite guy was pretty neat
  so far ive only looked on facebook and retail just in case  i plan on trying this saturday on a flea market that is only assembled on saturdays but i might go tomorrow to check on a mall thats mostly dedicated to toys and weebshit
minicons or targetmasters
  more like minicucks targetmasters are the most chad of masters
  he only has two modes
      not being both  imagine having only 23 modes
  is there anything chopster cant do
i saw a picture of some textured fur stickers for throne of the primes optimal optimus    i cant find any info on it did i imagine that
  be found alongside smolder for a reasonable price  for all the shelfwarming these things did its sure hard to actually find them for sale
  think its just thew or jobby bobbys hairy arms
  reprolabels
  i didnt realize the pair fetched a high price on the aftermarket finally smolder gets his due
  no its more like not being able to be found at all
  really    
  well shit man youre far better at searching for him than i was  all i found is those that charge 20 bucks for him plus shipping
  might as well spend 450 usd on 20 inch tall threea tlk optimus
  it was the 3rd listing when i searched transformers smolder on ebay as a matter of fact their are a lot out there around that price loose and new they are like 25 shipped    i think youre just kinda dim
  alright i lied i couldnt find it on a reasonable price  i think the problem is that i live outside murica and they dont ship here or at least not without overpaying the shipping  most of the loose ones have such a high cost of shipping it defeats the purpose
  the other version is better i love the dragon mode big wingspan for a deluxe
  cant find it dont think its on toyhax
  or lazy anyways thanks for that i did want a smolder /tfg/ sold me on it and pcc for a while now
  is this the shit serious collectors put up with    no the serious collectors just move onto 3p
  3p is doing the same
  fuck you hes goddamn great you fucking pleb hes easily an 8/10
  is that one of those early tr customs made before they revealed the blitzwing/megatron mold
  micromasters all the way if i had to choose minicons or targetmasters then id have to say minicons because of how unique some of the transformations were but i still love how charmingly chunky the micromasters were and im glad theyre back for siege
  thats hot
  500    i will be sticking to my legend class master race mp10
      you mean purple thundercracker
  ugh they shouldve just made an updated version of the mp01 mold
holy shit imagine all the triggered trannies at the allspark
  muh diiiiicckkkk
    prime arcee will never get a better toy
  isnt this 3p
  allspark exiles cant tell the difference
  why does it need boobs
  because its cool
    unf  can she actually transform though  if not i am not really interested    maybe someday those wily chinese will do some 3p figures of the best two arcees
  whats the name of this hottie/the company that made her
  why do transformers need faces and pinkie fingers
  they could fuse them together
  faces  to see stuff and drink energon  pinkies  to open the matrix and to punch
  whirl shoockwave and prime soundwave dont have faces and they can do all of those things just fine and pinkies dont really add much to a punch
  oh yeah well look at this    
  if those tits are rubber or silicon its gonna react with the plastic over time and either melt it or rot off
  why would her boobs be soft shes still a robot
  to temporarily hold humans while you escort them to safety
anyone saved the pics of those snapdragon and apeface customs from the chinese messageboards they used the decepticon targetmasters as bases
  i was just guessing from how they look its not uncommon for certain figures like that one to have squishy boobs
  thats the first shot ive seen of the alt mode from above and im in shock people are still defending that mess i dont think ive ever even seen an optimus figure look that jumbled up in truck mode
  its especially bad considering siege optimus comes close to the same aesthetic of the sunbow cartoon without nearly as many bait and switch parts
  leeme see that original pic
    no
  pretty cool though he looks oddly happy for a megatron especially a g2 megatron
  mommy
  this has everything i want in an optimus prime toy so of course im preordering it when real sites put up preorders the proportions the design thats all spot on i couldnt justify paying retail for mp10 but this prime looks well worth the 300
  youre really gonna have to try harder than that
  thats my stance i understand that this figure is not for everyone it upsets me just as much that my only option for that aesthetic of transformers is the masterpiece line since any time some other attempt at the style is done its some nonarticulated vinyl figure of optimus and then nothing else
  can she actually transform though    yes
          unf and why are they using the name arcee hasbro could sue them and leave us without delicious robotits
  looks like a metal and lace figure  will buy
        its everything my dick wanted
  cool id sure like to go for a ride
    its another arcee wears a tarp made of car parts toy  but with added partsforming
    300  are you the retard from the 3rd party thread defending the pricing because even from import sites preorders wont drop that low   real sites  ok dumbass whats a real site in your shitty opinion
do you guys ever think about what arcees or any fembots vagina would be like i imagine it would have a kind of silicone sack that could tighten snugly to the size and shape of your penis and apply suction then there would be thicker rings of the material on the outside that would clamp down and rotate in alternate directions and pump up and down and it would be heated and produce its own lube of course
  amazoncojp amiami hlj hobbysearch 440  30 early bird preorder  300
  wonderwave fleshlight
  go back to the allspark msipher
  just saw a preorder pop up for 429 euro  does this thing come with solid gold joints and a blowjob or something
  i imagine m i end every post with a witty last zinger in my signature sipher actually gets the shakes at the thought of anonymous posting
  need boobs  it doesnt i think thered be a charm if were a more modest or straightup flat design that said i think that would actually cause if not an uproar then at least curiosity as to the design choice since even g1 arcee had some angles at the chest area    i hope the clearance for transformation is fine but perhaps the chest isnt facing the ground
  why doesnt it you homo
this thread is a gold mine 
  i cant believe people can begasphornyfor attractive figures  i love this kinda mentality
  for motorboating
  he gets the shakes at the thought of overlord
  looks like company is making lolibots too
            the golden age of glorious fat roboass has come
  plot twist literally all of them except amalgamous and alpha trion and sometimes vector nexus and the fallen because none of the others have ever been show to transform into anything
  reminder of that brief moment where it looked like in rid humanoid transformers were merely the majority instead of the defacto norm    which it proceeded to do absolutely nothing with any of those character designs except occasionally kill them before eventually forgetting about them entirely
  i figure it like this  primus thinks organics are cool so sometimes his children have secondary sexual characteristics     small chance to be specifically male or female small chance for females to have roboboobers like blackarachnea and arcee and males to have an adams apple like megatron sometimes does or luscious energonsucking lips like overlord and chromia or the inexplicable need to breath or blink like springer or the need to form romantic pairs like tigertron and airazor or having an organic brain like the predacons or having autism like shockwave
  its omochasouko02 on twitter  he used triggerhappy for apeface and brainstorm for snapdragon
  look at all those poor sufferers of empurata they didnt deserve to be punished and now their bodies and faces are outside the perfect normal like all transformers should have
  want      im not into loli but minicons are always great       i think onyx kind of transforms given he goes from centaur to satyr his back legs and horse body probably pop off to become weapons like combining an actionmaster with a targetmaster into something someone would actually want
  emergency energon reserves thats why it must be squishy too    please dont my wallet is suffering enough already
  empurata  other than silverbuggo there no one is missing their face or hands most seem to wear masks like grimlocks silverbuggo could be an alien species too      why did they keept coloring horribull yellow
  its actually less worse than expected  more people on board with it and telling the offended group to suck it up
rodimus prime reissue at 230   what the fuck is going on
  googled g1 horribull and the images that turned up at the time was a badly yellowed toy the wiki also used this image but it was in a published book long before then too
  at last someone is making sakamoto looking titty bots for my degenerate tastes
  more titty bots     id be so down for a prime arcee and airachnid like this
   from who the expected msrp in china is at 899 cny  130 usd
  if it comes with all the problems fixed thats not exactly an awful price thats definitely steep for a 10 year old toy though    but honestly if you want a dedicated rodimus prime figure you should just get dx9 carry a fair bit cheaper than 230 and a lot better designed
  kino
  oh bbts big a merry can prices btw the collector coin is not confirmed
  if it comes with all the problems fixed
  the new line titans return
        i request more lewd tf fembots
  wasnt there a ko a while back that fixed a lot of the issues
    the beast wars mps are the best stuff theyve released in years
  i dont recognize the two above lickity split
  one i believe is clipper from victory the other is prime arcees arms micron
  arcees arms micron on the left and clipper from victory
    cool im unfamiliar with both so good to know
wasnt there a jap reviewer who put the fembots in lewd poses  i think some of the pictures were posted here
  
  shh dont respond to him the more yous he gets the more often he shitposts just hide and ignore
              hnnnnng
  spamming/flooding or extremely low quality
  intentionally evading spam filter has worked in the past im not sure what the criteria is exactly and wish we had an opportunity to ask a mod or janny directly
  nah even silverbugo has a face of a sort   all known empurata faces are exclusively the black void with a single optic configuration ala whirl and shockwave  even javilin from caminus isnt an empurata victim since she still has a mouth and lower face below the cyclops eye
dont fucking  me you scum
  airachnid is almost as flat as rodimus
maybe this is just our divine punishment for posting about 3p on the main thread 
  oh for funcks sake find a new one weve all seen that image so much it doesnt even register anymore
  theres only one way to counter it  post lewd 3p arcees preferably ones you own
  no she was built by optimus to interface with human feminists and let out a warning siren when she sees spider alt mode spies
    search kira in the archive to see just how long this shitposter has been keeping this up its been at least a full year if not longer hes an unwanted plague on this general only here because he hates /tfg/ and wants it to suffer endlessly
so it is a revenge thing at least theres a motive for this mental illness
  black and pink arcee with a sword as tall as optimus is best arcee
  sigh fine  its officially licensed so posting this is technically a lesser sin
  all this hate for shitty new mps  makes me think theres hope for /tfg/ yet i dont go to any other online tf forums whats the consensus at those shitholes are they all sucking its dick or what
4channel janny  4chan janny
  the biggest sin actually is that its a statue
  yes
  doesnt matter keep at it    nice strongarm
  whats the consensus at those shitholes  no clue you wont catch me dead at any of those places i think our resident spammer is the only anon who actively goes to those shitty sites
  reminds me of this  ironically had to search through actual porn on r34 to find this
  fuck thats nice  thanks for that one anon
  relevant to both replies
shouldnt we have seen another mp beast wars prototype by now i wonder if this is it
  oh right were not in the 3p thread then post lewd official arcee
  its the same model as this 3dprinted custom might be statueshit not sure if some joints are real or not
  how much did you find    i still love that one strongarm doujin    is that the warrior one
  no
  who do you think they should do next i dont follow mp news much but so far theyve got cheetor primal megatron and dinobot are the only ones whove been done so far right id like to see them attempt terrorsaur with folding wings
  o
  legends arcee is best arcee
  its the scoutsized one that comes in a 2 pack with the minicon
  picked this up by same artist since i was on there anyways
  the most likely is waspinator or tarantulas
  nice artist name    oh i didnt know about that one
  waspinator  does the generations one require an upgrade that much i mean outside of scale hes pretty much right at least for my nonmp shelf
  think theyll retool cheetor for tigatron or do a whole new bigger mold for him they seem to autistic about robot mode sizes with the mp line
  ban apparently i feel like ive seen him on tfw2005 and/or deviantart but im not really sure about either
  new airrazor never ever  it hurts
  add a bulge accessory to mp airrazor  charge 20k yen
  the tm is postop they should just do that one
  he has a pixiv and twitter account
  theyd have to do a new mold to make the size right but its not like the engineering isnt already done no one cares about shadow panther but they really cant get away with a straight recolour for a main character on the show
  dammit blur its not halloween anymore take off the costume
  i would absolutely love to see terrorsaur scorponok or a transmetal tarantulas but i kind of want rhinox and rattrap to round things out
  i know they already did cheetor but i always loved tm cheetors design and think itd make for a killerlooking mp if done right an articulated tailmace would be icing on the cake too  rattrap would be a safer bet though im sure theyll get to him and rhinox before they even start considering tms
  its altmode is the winnebago   eh
  fucking autocorrect i mean its
  thats not how autocorrect works
  figma arcee with sakamoto styles when
i like nautica better my bubbly inquisitive thicc bluebotloving boaty beauty
  that was sort of my point man
what is your favorite fembot
    face still needs tons of work
  nautica followed by chromia velocity airazor and nickle    fuck windblade arcee and blackarachnia
  i will once you get the ko treatment uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu
      how good is the warrior strongarm  is it worth the 6 bucks bbts is asking for
    
  only 2 of those have toys  sorry for your loss
  thanks    nauticas toy doesnt count though its shit
    i can so see a proper horribull figure being retooled from skullcruncher
  i like naughtica but windblade and her evil repaints are my favs
  is that a succubot
  we live in a new golden era of fembots though longgone are the days of only having a couple energon arcee repaints and a bw blackarachnia be the only ones in your collection  im sure nautica will get her due eventually
  i wish them luck its a unique angle in 3p scene
  well i have more of less gotten out of tf stuff outside of animated and i dont have anything in the masterpiece scale but it looks like either my polynians have a new goddess or my diaclones have a weirdly sexy new mecha    i was excited until i saw the boobs  that is no lolibot just kind of a cartoony fembot    nickle sari and slipstream
  id love it if we got hip wings on a fembot
  nice shell
  i wonder how big this is
  hope you are right on that
  yeah    from a third party company
  weve gotten two chromias in the last couple years well get a general release nautica pretty soon
  wont be a repaint of a male with a girl head slapped on  wont have disgusting weathering  might even have a shapely body and decent altmode  i fail to see how that isnt the best case scenario
spider pedipalp tits are now irrefutably appropriate     
  windblade nightbird and airazor
  ba and prime arcee
  ba  who
  im assuming blackarachnea
      i pity da fool
  oh right  i forgot for a second there
anyone mind helping me understand something from that new ebay coupon    the coupon discount is capped at a maximum value of 50    does this mean the coupon doesnt work if the order costs more than 50 because its the only reason why this coupon wouldnt be working for me    my orders under toys it ships to my locations and theres still time to order
  yes and both of them were retools of another character
  you can only get 50 off at the maximum basically youre not getting a discount at any dollar past 500
  alpha trion obviously
  then i dont get it theres no reason why it shouldnt be working
  this has happened to me a few times during the category specific sales what i had to do was close out of ebay and restart my phone/computer and then like 30 minutes later it worked    so basically i have no idea what to tell you just keep trying
  im in puerto rico and not only does the deal not specify continental usa it also ships to the caribbean    it shows up under that transformers category in a search does the product itself have to say it in the description    guess i could try this thanks
your robowaifu has been kidnapped by terrorists are you bad enough dude to rescue her    post pics of your player
i think my biggest issues is that this new convoy is still looking like a real world truck in robot mode while his robot is cartoon it changes so much from one mode to the other it seems uncanny and will be a eyesore really in most collections if you have a bunch of masterpiece figures
  i wonder how big this is  small yet still too big for your tiny dick
  what do you think it is mp or generations    i kinda hope its mp scaled and not generations trying to stop collecting those
new thread  
    in an age before third party products i might have
  are micromasters and minijpcobs basically the same thing    no micromasters are small but normal transformers they cannot plug into bigger ones    and in fiction micromasters are simply transformers that were either downsized or constructed small to preserve energon    whereas minicons are a completely separate subspecies
  i remember people threw shit over this too because it looked too attractive
  thats hardly a loli unless you consider something like senran kagura parforms lolis too
welcome to plastic building block general this is the thread for discussion of nonlego plastic building block systems tell us about what youre waiting to clear customs whatever cheap junk you found on the shelves at the dollar store or show off your stockpiles of guns    previous thread 
did somebody actually knock off block tech minifigures thats pretty close to scraping the bottom of the barrel    
  ive seen these figs under another brand that escapes me right now its possible the amazon seller has a direct link to the manufacturer    mfw that one customer review whining about muh diversity
  saw something similar at staples today maybe they were block tech but they looked close
just bought this  think in gonna keep it in the box and not open it
  the box is the only part thats worth anything you can buy the contents for less than 5
  alright will keep it unopened
  and the full set will be a whole 6 sealed new within 10 years even his own supporters keep turning on him but he doenst care he has putin to ensure a win in 2020
  orange man bad pls upvote
  this has to be satire
  claims that it is satire that trumps own supporters are turning backs on him  posts hitler
  trumpets are that stupid yes    they think hes a white man with a huge dick when hes an admitted jew after all
          cool great thread guys took you all of four posts to get baited into turning a bootlego thread into an episode of saturday night live
pretty sure i posted this in here before but it was a while ago        some awesome anon made a video version of a quest i ran in april with music and sound effects
tracking information is temporarily unavailable you could track your order here    oh boy its another fucker didnt actually ship it ill send a reminder and the package will be magically returned/resent on the same day episode
any places to get a shitload of gold minifig coins id appreciate some tips anons
      they arent exact copies of lego coins but yeah
can someone explain why that new challenger 2 set from cobi is in the same price range as their fucking maus tanks its neither a huge superheavy tank nor an spg why does it cost so much
recently got into cobi and their tanks managed to snag a panzer iii j that popped up on amazon and he showed up yesterday was so excited to get it that i stayed up til 2 am to build it haha    aint the most accurate rendition of the panzer iii but i love it and it looks great with the tiger especially since theyre both afrika korps models
  tiger 131 was my first cobi set got it as a gift and it totally hooked me on cobis tanks funnily enough the tiger is also the only cobi set where ive had a qc issue the antistud side on the unique gun mantlet piece was cut at an angle so when attached to the turret the piece was sitting all crooked managed to straighten the piece out by filing down the inside edges of the antistud side thought id have to glue the piece in but even after getting filed down the part still had enough grip to stay in place which was awesome
  panzer iii with a stug iii the stug is probably my favorite cobi set so far love how they did the camo scheme on it
  jagdpanther is probably my least favorite i think it looks great and i like it but its really easy to dislodge the tiles used to make up its sides so you have to be more careful with it    wanna pick up some allied tanks and ive got my eye on getting a pershing next i want to get a sherman but ive read negative things about the thintype tracks they use for it so im trying to stick to tanks with the wide tracks also want a t34 but the only readily available version i can find is the one with polish markings and id prefer a russian one
i love cobi tanks too been collecting them since their big merkava tank i find their tracks too proportionally wide for alot of ww2 tanks but i collect their post war tanks so its less of an issue these tanks look great next to megabloks figures    id love to get some big ww2 heavy tanks too but the space to put them is becoming a serious issue
  wtf its actually real i knew the minifig existed but i assumed the rest was just a funny photoshop
  the people selling it just buy chinkbricks and knockoff minifigs and repackage them at a tremendously inflated price    theyre currently selling a bunch of other ko figs on the various rightwing sites i think its a hilarious racket buy the figs for 50 cents each and resell them for 999 plus shipping that wall set is like a dollar worth of ali and probably another dollar for the package since they likely had it printed in bulk
dont miss out on goofy lookin deals
  enlighten pirates are the best  skeleton hamlet
  when i see prices like this i can see how lego toys are overpriced
  and trump doesnt see a dime of it    not that he needs it i think still wont release those tax returns will he    inb4 but the suppoters eventually give him that money    fuck you they blow it on luxury garbage and junk food
  kindly take that sort of talk to the appropriate board please
anyone know where to get some dragon ball z minifigs
  this store has been my goto for most figs they have quite a bit of dbz    
so i want to finally take a dip into the forbidden bootlego lake any recommended cheap military vehicles on aliexpress preferably unique designs rather than cobi clones
  also does anyone own pic related ive always wanted a lego kaneda bike and this looks shockingly gorgeous does it come with the stickers included by the way
    see        
  your pic related winner bloks sets scales better to mega bloks figurines all the larger high detail bootlego tanks are this case kazi and xingbao make especially great large scale vehicle models     more minfig scaled stuff would come from gudi enlighten kazi sembo jie star and sluban    gudi is my personal favorite their bricks clutch even stronger than lego which compensates for their tendency to skimp on structural integrity in their buildstheir designs are very clean and i aleays imagined them to be closest to what a lego city military subtheme would look like    enlighten has insane variety with as many fantasy themes as military ones i only own some of their alt history ww2 stuff bricks had inconsistent clutch im hoping their newer stuff has improved these clones have a scary tendency to radically improve within these few years i recently saw a review for their new un peacekeeping theme vehicles looked more megabloks scaled but brick quality wasnt brought up as an issue    kazi gets mentioned again because they have insanely huge variety in military sets unfortunately alot of ali sellers are too dumb to even properly label their products with the correct brand they had a minifig scaled line of military stuff under their ubiquitous field army label but i cant fucking find it    sembo ive never tried but they cropped up with decent designs just as i stopped collecting minifig scale builds they had a styker osprey and pantsir set but their new line seems to be doing ww2    jie star reputedly has lego tier brick quality but their designs used to be so childish their most recent line is however charming chibi proportioned vehicles from both ww2 and modern day pic related for cuteness also note how none of them are properly tagged as jie star by any seller remeber to use these buzzwords to find your bootlego chinks love calling every military set ww2
  sluban has been copying the korean oxford designs for the longest time out of the bootlego with acceptable quality i considered them shitest tier however they started to make original designs and even licensed stuff based on pacific rim and predator their apc and irquois from the predator line shows potential and indicates that brick quality has radically improved    personally i consider the large premium bootlego sets far superior in detail and impact costs for xingbao is like 60 of legos prices they are basically lepins sister brand and command the highest premium of all bootlego kazi is the opposite with comparable quality to xingbao and regularly pumps out 1000 parts sets for a mere 40 they havent made a big cool tank in ages sadly you probably wont care for all of this as i am speaking as a mega bloks fan with hundreds of their sweet action figures    pic related shows based gudi sets next to megabloks scaled builds that abrams in the back is kazis masterpiece
   of course this is the tip of the iceberg there are gazillions of other little bootlegos i am also biased towards more practical looking designs so i must of missed some pbbg classics     panlos previously just made fuckhuge tanks that dwarfed even mega bloks figures but they are also doing an alt history ww2 type line now     woma also makes mediocre large scaled tanks but they hilariously have jack stone esque figures    pricewise you can expect to get gudi and kazi for extremely cheap despite being two of the best bootlego brands sembo sluban and enlighten should not cost much either always take the extra effort to find lower prices    jie star and xingbao might be too pricey for you    pic related new sembo shit actually looks really good
  for some reason i feel like youll love the new jie star shit i certainly would if i still cared for lego it almost has a classic 2000s lego aesthetic in its simplicity
does anyone know what this torso is from
  unfortunately alot of ali sellers are too dumb to even properly label their products with the correct brand   also note how none of them are properly tagged as jie star by any seller remeber to use these buzzwords to find your bootlego chinks love calling every military set ww2    fucking this how difficult is it to copy whats written on the fucking set
  looks cute
2018/11/27 0817   me did you ship my order    2018/11/27 1258  posting  guangdongshengshantoushi chsd      fucker
  at least youre getting shipping seems a lot of aliexpress stores are currently withholding most or all shipping options from us canadian buyers in my experience anyway was checking on my cart as i finally have some surplus money and noticed one of my items was now in the hundreds of dollars all of it for dhl shipping the store wouldnt offer anything else to canada but switching to the us brought up all the other options freaking canada post just had to start striking again
  on a happier note tomorrow ill be looking to pick up a chinese brand pirate ship from crappy tire spotted them the other day and they were 60 bucks was a bit rich for me but they go halfoff starting tomorrow might get the police station they have as well cant remember the brand name but the minifigs are in the squarehead style like pic related though not the same brand
  dat visible seam    is it wange
  yeah the ones i have already are the pirate ship and police station are something else though
  damn that sucks why are they striking anyway
    looks like one of those mini mini figs from kreo
  the usual they want more money i did get the pirate ship today and the the police station 60 cdn for about 2000 pieces not too shabby the brand is dragon blok never seen them before but the box suggests theres more to follow after this initial offering there was also a house set and a girlthemed one i didnt look at pics will follow when i have enough spare time for building
just ordered this for my girlfriend does anyone have any good things or bad things to say about this i have a couple lepin sets and they seem very flimsy completed compared o lego so i wonder how well the castle will balance
  thank you so much  now i can dress that nudist toddler
  xingbaos quality is very high bricks have very good clutch and durability plus unlike lepin and some other brands they actually commission their sets so they pay the designer unlike lepin
  based i didnt think there was a difference between xb and lepin how is sembo ive been looking at that strip club and rooftop pool set 60
  i personally dont own any sembo but from the anons here i hear its quality is pretty up there
  this set is beautiful
dollar tree here now has specialty parts packs
  at my local dollar tree they have tons of smaller baseplates and they are 1 each
so i bought this      it turned out to be kazi brand and garbage parts barely stay together the transparent panels are shit at least it came with some halfway decent guns     i dont even want to build the rest not sure what ill do with it
  how this is kazi i doubt it doesnt fit together the set design looks flimsy however you should of gone for a larger better designed set    the cg image also looks shit vs the real thing
  whats your location i dont think ive ever seen block tech at dollar tree just the baseplates mentioned by  and little brick assortments and weird minifigures sold under myblox/topblox/whatever
where to buy   rakuten  recommended stores toysanta  kidsroom     mandarake      news about latest releases            recommended viewing       aquashooters available now  
  oh fuck i hope these show up locally
aqua shooters is sold in box and capsule form capsule color shows whats inside    red/pink  long black hair  green  blonde  yellow  twintails  dark blue  solid black weapons  white  clear weapons
  only the weapon sets are on rakuten  nothing on mandarake  what where the hell are these being sold online otherwise
  places like amiami and hobbysearch sell them in boxes sets of 10 apparently
  shit thats kind of rough when theres only 3 of each and 2 weapon packs i imagine its two whole sets
  also damn checked both of those and theyre sold out and shipped in late october guess i missed out
  op here at the time i posted the thread they were in stock on toysantas rakuten page
  it figures
  send a direct message to their facebook page theyll respond and tell you when or if new stock will come in also keep an eye on the page in case they do restock
school girl outfits    meh
    were they individual like the weapons packs as in you could buy the girls individually
  i just paid for the aqua shooter  the desktop army flare nabbit sisters sets    here is thread from futaba with pic for both of these sets plus other gasha stuff  
the flare nabbit sisters set is still available in amiami if someone is interested    
i like the aesthetic look of these nabbit sisters and if megahouse released these armor variants it would be neat to get them also the mech for them looks cool as fuck      
yall i desperately need a set of these    anyone know where i could find some in stock
  little lenses and tripods    i absofuckinglutely want those too anon heres hoping someone knows
and if you want a ride for the desktop army and aqua shooter figs you can get the megaman minipla ride armor released in sept its still available in amico        it can be used by nendos and poches too see     
  makes me wonder how the 4inchnels fit in this
  i dont need it
  maybe they will fit decent enough by guessing from a few pics i have saw of these 4inchnel they arent that tall afterall
  they are much bigger than the 66 action scale toys
arent these mecha parts similar to gridman  sure feels like it to me
  gridmanish weapon too
  look at the left side its totally related to gridman
      maybe not gridman but form some other mech gasha set gundam maybe
which aqua shooter girl is best im thinkin its black hair
  black hair is cute and this the best but blondie is a really close second
  how the fuck can something be so generic yet so desirable
  im so pissed i missed buying at least one girl off of rakuten and a weapon pack 8 dollars for the figure shipped 14ish with the weapon pack added thats a great price for such neat little figures with what they come with im kicking myself in the ass for not seeing this thread last night
highly debating letting white rabbit express buy the one i want for me for an 8 dollar fee
  i hope more waves get released i passed on the first ones because the default uniform is just too generic but those all look great
apparently you can bash it with gundam ensembles gacha you can literally make your own gundam girl sold
  are you me anon also can you confirm if aqua shooters box comes with 2 of each girl seeing only 1 dark hair girl worries me      is this modded or are they perfectly compatible      do they come with accessories it looks like they come with a ton of faceplates which is almost better      i really hope smoll articulated anime girls kick off and become a big thing      would anyone whos good at kitbashing and customising be able to cut off the twintails off brown hair and show us a potential 10/10 tomboy          my fucking wallet
  are you me anon  maybe  also can you confirm if aqua shooters box comes with 2 of each girl   will do when the package arrives the info of the item on amiamis site says that it is 10 packs per box with 5 different types of figs/sets     is this modded or are they perfectly compatible  dunno but i guess that they actually are    do they come with accessories it looks like they come with a ton of faceplates which is almost better  from the promo pics each nabbit comes with a extra face and alternate hair/head ornament but not sure about hands or other things i havent found a video reviewyet    i really hope smoll articulated anime girls kick off and become a big thing  same here also if any of you want to give the these aqua shooter or desktop army girls a mech pet/ride you can get one of the beast box dinos for them
  cut off the twintails off brown hair and show us a potential 10/10 tomboy  like this
  super cute  i really need to do this to one if i manage to get two of her now    ive never modified figures before would i need to sand the area that got cut what material is her hair even made fron
  which one is that
  yes    
  they were only 6 bucks each
  theyll be back just keep an eye on that page
  i tried contacting their facebook for information like someone suggested earlier in the thread but they dont respond on weekends are you familiar with how long things usually take to go back up is it something i should be following closely for a week for example
  i suggest checking it monday/tuesday theres a lot of demand for these so i expect them to restock it pretty soon
  thanks for the info anon
anyone had one of these yet or a series made by the same ones    unlimits project kansou heavy machine bb
  legs are probably the weakest aspect design wise the plastic is prone to popping apart so i wouldnt recommend unless you adore the design
  yeah i really like the design was the one in your picture hand painted
  only the eyes are painted i filled in some details on the hands belly cleavage and feet everything besides the shoulders face and hip joints are white plastic
watching rakuten page for a monday restock  have to go to bed at some point    im gonna miss them again
why are desktop army so expensive
  bought the original sylphy set for 60 dollars only wanted the scout  sold the other ones for 20 dollars a piece on ebay and people were willing to pay it and i made my money back and then some
  another futaba thread with pics for the aqua shooter figs and flare nabbit sisters   
    what is that mech
  hexa gear bulkarm
  what is megahouse    people should be glad that dta is alive and well     i wouldnt bet my money on aqua shooter survive pass wave 4 with the bandai in charge
  this     
  bandai candy toys doing a diaclone reboot
  their blog says the zakuii is 60 mm while gundam is 65mm if this is true then the pilots are very close to takara dianauts
    pbandai
  its a mass release some sellers are opening pos for a box of 10 now the pbandai link is just obligatory
  looks like they may not have elbows and knees
  honestly im kinda guessing its just swivel shoulders and maybe a ball neck and thats it real convergelevel stuff i mean the gimmick is the opening hatch and the pilot inside i dont see bandai being generous enough to give us good articulation on top of that
  im such a fucking sucker for little poseables that go into these things
  this i dont own dekstop army but isnt aqua shooter literally the same thing except you have limited customization oob
go to aqua shooters rakuten page  in stock  bwmegatronjpg  literally changes to sold out before my eyes  fuck this gay earth
  dtas come with a good variety of accessories and parts oob and have nicer paint jobs     my only complaint is sometimes their eyes are super dead
  whooooa did not realize that dta had that much variety
  who cares about the rides gimme all of these right fucking now my toys need toys to play with too
  it baffles me how anons here didnt order the aqua shooters on amiami hlj or hs back when order open back in july   they were even mentioned a couple of times in the gasha threads here on /toy/
  wasnt on here during the summer honestly my visits to /toy/ have been sporadic
  cant be helped this board is half dead and gashapon threads even deader
  like the idea  dont like the current school uniform    im sure itll pick up a few waves in like unlimits project
  dont like the current school uniform  i want to believe that the pic on  is future variant outfits for the girls in future waves
  i think i was the last person to order before before they closed it luckily i got my shipping notification
    did they seriously sell some again last night and i missed them again
stick a fork in me because im done placed an up to 29 usd order to get aqua shooters through white rabbit
  its only getting better     also they have some of the models up on the megahouse website for free so you can 3d print your own
  when the fuck are these coming out
    sees may 2019 release date  oh duh are these up for po anywhere
  may huh praised
        i dislike the pink color that the main girl uses not /ak/ apropiate if you ask me the othergirls are cute and colors are ok  i havent seen the series it is good worth to watch
  i havent seen it but a friend of mine liked it  
  its videogame shit which kind of kills it for me
  ive heard the writing is aeons better than sao but that isnt saying much so idk
so all in all i got the one i wanted off of amazon jp by using white rabbit express to forward it to me total price was 20 dollars about 810 dollars more than rakuten not gonna bust a gasket or anything
   amazon japan is the only place im seeing any naturally the full set is being sold by someone that wont ship internationally
is there a single jojo gashapon machine in tokyo
  lurk around places that have lots of machines stores with a single floor of machines try talking to the people that work in those stores
        dawww  bionic jks oneechan game is on point
snails
  cute  very pikminesqe
oh baby the mail has arrived
  box if youre interested
    those are all 5 in each of those boxes youre gonna sell some or
  i think the case is two full sets i was going to cut the pigtails off of a dupe to make a tomboy but i hadnt thought of anything for the others
  oh okay i was confused since rakuten has the gacha orbs individually if you just buy 1 character or weapon pack so i thought each box was all 5 orbs
  i think i missed a step
  that took longer to put together than it should have probably the 5 breaks i took
im a pleb at kits how do you remove the plastic flaking when i trim it it still leaves behind whitish plastic
  1 youre prob cutting it wrong and need sharper nippers  2 sand paper
  i do gunpla regularly and simply use the hobby knife to remove it and then go at it with a fingernail it never leaves a white mark and like 90 of the time never leaves a dark spot
  wow that actually works thanks anon
  see that i wouldnt mind seeing an infinite stratos line even if its past any form of popularity
  girls are individual sets  mechs are individual robutts with a skeleton as a place holder for the girls and can be used as a stand  connectivity with gundam kits given bandai tends to reuse certain joint and connectors over the years  wonfes exclusive bunny girl set with pool table  pbandai exclusive set in maid uniform    could work
                  
                        
  where are these heads from
  left girl is henrietta from gunslinger girl  head is from this figure i believe    the saberface one maybe is from a nendo petit or some mini figure                  
  triela    i dont need it
    shit these guys seem like a alternative to acid rain guys decided to order 3 of the human infantry guys and that one mech are the men models as well how hard will it be putting them together
  huh i wasnt aware both were designed by fujioka kenki now it makes more sense
  if youre getting them as an alternative to acid rain be warned that these are significantly smaller than acid rain    yes the people are models as well and some of the parts are fucktiny get a fresh sharp xacto knife and a pair of tweezers youre gonna need them assembly isnt particularly hard no more so than a standard gundam but as i said tinyass parts if youre a butterfingers or hamhands you may have a trying time ahead of you
  for some context those are hexa gear figures on the far left
    oh i know theyll be smaller than acid rain i dont even have any anyways only japanese models ive done are the little armory guns and those snap into place without glue excluding the m4s will i be needing glue for these guys and how many parts will the soldiers be and recommendations for nippers ive heard godhand are the top of the line but i dont think i wanna spend that much on them
another japackage came in today
  tfw still waiting for ten in the mail
  they look as small as mega bloks figures wtf
  hexa gear turned out to be that small  what in the fuck
    they are supposed to be that small  its so they can fit in the vehicle kits  that is the point
  in shocked its smaller than desktop army but i think its awesome i really love small posable figures and these ones are some of the smallest yet not cartoon proportioned    i was concerned that id be a shit kit assembler and was about to pass on these but at this size it doesnt even matter if its assmbled unpainted    anyone got a pic of these next to mega bloks
  not /ak/ apropiate  anon how can you forget about the pink panther  also the actual in lore reason is that the lighting or graphics or whatever of the game have a pink tint to them so it makes her a harder target to hit
  i expected 1/24 figures to be larger than 1/24  huh
  so it makes her a harder target to hit  how so
im now officially mad that i passed on these when i had the chance
      jelly im still waiting for mine to arrive  the waiting game goes on              
  that fluffy mod looks really good
  these will be 100 snapfit no glue necessary however somewhat like the little armory guns glue may make your life easier if some of the tinier pieces keep popping off im gonna say most are in the realm of 40ish parts but if you bought those militarylooking soldier guys this count will be higher since they have lots of optional swappable parts    tamiya nippers are quite good and not too pricey at 25 if you want to step up a little bit more gundam planet nippers are 35 and damn near as good as godhands
     nailed it the intent was to be a super small scaled line so that they could release impressively large scaled vehicles at a relatively low price point its pretty great honestly one of the best ideas kotos had in years      i absolutely would recommend it they even have some prepainted parts so they dont look that bad unpainted like a stock parapawn has prepainted head eyes and abs     also i took a size comparison shot for you with 66action mega and acid rain
  i love you anon
    i didnt know any details about the figure i saw them one time on amazon while searching gundam kits and my experience with them was those look neat but not for the price i didnt see the size
well went to the town today    my main goal is to get the ensemble v2 buster and forte xm01 denan though i only managed to find the ensemble figure for half the price of the whole set maybe i should just get the whole wave 6 instead but i dont care for the other figure did get a mk2 on the side     the tripod is ok the size of it is able to be used with the 1/12 figure     as for aqua shooter instead of box form they sell them here as gachaphon guess i am lucky to get a figure instead the one with the guns     did saw a lot of interesting stuff but i really should cutting back box toy and gachaphon used to be cheap now these days they really add up with just 2 or 3 items
  still worth the price have you ever looked into older machines sometimes decent stuff can be found for 100yen
  she blends in with the background
  well in this landscape yeah but in the forest she is like a blinding sun
    she has a pancho for the forests they touch on her outfit choice in like the first few episodes
  she has a pancho for the forests  poncho yeah she needed to cover her clothes with a poncho just bacause she was retarded enough to not adjust the color/camuflage of her uniform for a forest setting stupid thot so the other guy that was with her has to give her a pocho to cover her retarderness
  well yeah she never did anything like that before she only played the game because she got a avatar she liked besides look at how people dress their characters in fortnite they dont dress for the settings
just got these kinda pricy tho
  mashs my fave jeannes a piece of shit
  best king
  my jeanne falls apart like crazy
  yea especially the shoulders  i think the peg hole isnt deep enough
  whats the purpose of the clear sword      arms on mine are finnicky because i dont think the ball joints are evenly molded i had to rotate them into a position where it fit the socket tightly over the widest range of motions possible
  lore wise she uses the clear sword to hide her real sword to hide her real id
  they touch on her outfit choice in like the first few episodes  yeah she dyed her outfit pink because she thought it was the only cute color and she bought the parka so she could go to the nonbattle area without getting harassed
      i liked the look of those figures so i just watched the first episode of gun gale online    well i guess i wont be getting those figures after all
  well i guess i wont be getting those figures after all  why
  because the show sucked
    you only watched the first episode
  and many anons here gets a figure based on design alone not knoeing the source material or disregarding it completely see how many have buy the sinon figma/nendo because they liked the characters even thou she is part of the shitmess that is original sao or the anons who collect the black rock shooter figmas/nendos because they liked the aesthetic of the characters  same goes for fate kancolle gup and so on  sao ggo could be shit but the girls designs are decent imo and for this scale there isnt many options for cute operator girls tbqh
  if they werent so expensive then maybe like i bought a bootleg alter jeanne darc figma because i thought it looked cool even though my fate knowledge is playing fgo on my phone for a week before getting bored but that was cheap and these desktop army figures are pretty pricey for what you get    plus id buy a figure for a show i thought was just ok or that i didnt really have an opinion on if it was cool but for a show that i think actually sucks when i see it im just going to think of that show that sucks      i know judging a show by the first ep isnt really fair so i plan to watch another one just to give it the benefit of the doubt so who knows it may grab me and ill end up wanting the figures even more
  if they werent so expensive then maybe  i wont deny that the desktop army figures are a bit expensive maybe the aqua shooters are more of your liking and they comes with guns too    i know judging a show by the first ep isnt really fair so i plan to watch another one just to give it the benefit of the doubt  gp watch 2 episodes more to see if you like it if not then the ggo girls arent for you anon
  i actually did pick up some aqua shooters at the same time as my first set of desktop army no less  and i just finished episode 5 im enjoying it more or less the non fighting scenes are enjoyable but jesus christ the battle scenes wildly fluctuate between half decent and sonichu/pubg crossover fanfiction  this roller coaster ride is giving me whiplash
  i actually did pick up some aqua shooters  nice im waiting for mine to arrive those bunnies sisters looks really cute some of the links/reviews posted in this thread are making me wanting them
if anybody missed out on aqua shooters and is having trouble finding them theres 2 5packs all 3 girls and both weapon sets on ebay right now from the same seller 28 shipped for the 5 pack
  whats the middle snail tissues
    nice i have the rathalos and tigrex didnt know they made more of the other flagships
      bought niitengo triela  now just gotta wait for a second wave or something that isnt just a school uniform
                    
  why isnt blondie available anywhere
idk what figure is this but looks neat
  those tiny glasses    where can i get those
  one of the main reasons i want that da gungale figure pack is for all the weapons the meme value of arming my da jeanne with a shotgun is too great to pass up
buy the little pink unlimits project robogirl  looking at the parts as im clipping them  the ass has little panty wrinkles    incredible amazed i even caught them
  they are something
  i scoured the net quite a bit for glavenus i also have gammoth still looking for the other 2 from the same wave  mind posting some pics of your monsters
  something from gundam ensemble figures
gashapon dev blog showing initial as prototypes and a sneak peek of the next wave    
  seems like the size for next wave will increase a bit
  actually the small one is the prototype left is the actual figure
  if thats the case is good it will trigger my autism to have different sizes for them  the new girls looks cute the one on the right looks like you from love live
  are those new ones or just prototypes for the first set i thought the new one was the one that was half designed at the end of the post
    those are the first set
  ooo i like this
  senpai and kouhai
super highmoving cat with builtin magnets  coming february  
  its time to stop
  cute
    ok the want is real
  where are your parents
hmmm
  really like that blue colour way on it
        all sold out
  hmmmmm
really makes you think
  cute
  archer enjoying it  the madwoman
can anyone tell me where to find these     gyoza man /dumpling man
  i would also like to know this
    there used to be some on mandarake for fair prices and some on ebay for ridiculously inflated prices all are gone now you might try hunting on yahoo auctions but youll need a middleman to buy anything from there past that youre out of luck for the moment all you can do is keep checking mandy and ebay
  i think i may just have to hope more merch gets released when the anime comes out
  i want a full box each of these and the isopods
  im retarded can you tell me what key words to search for 
  i hope so too but a part of me fears that the adaptation will be butchered or that the existing dorohedoro merch some of which are grails for me will become even more expensive and hard to find thanks to a flood of new fans this series is like my baby you know i have a lot of fear about it taking its first steps out into the big scary world of mainstream anime viewers      just dorohedoro gyoza or dorohedoro dumpling
  i understand why you feel that way but it gaining mainstream appeal means a bigger chance of mainstream merch like some nonboutique figures or at the very least a reissue of the gachapon
nononono    good thing i have a spare figure that i used when last time something like this happen though the right knee is now black as the rest of the leg
  i had a fucked joint on my mash too had to change the joint with the shitty jeanne
for a line that supposed to have great articulation in tiny package   the newest figure is rather lacking with all the junks she has on her though the figures main draw is the crowd funded armor mech
  extreme fucking caution is advised with these little chicklets    especially the waist joint is a bitch
  its a fun show
is it me or does the aqua shooter pistol and shotgun need some glue
my fucking god i need this i fucking need this in my life aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhh111
just found these eygptian gods gachapons and god theyre adorable
  im just missing bastet and set
  is there a medjed it would make a great pairing with mashu for chaldea radio shenanigans
    ah shit disregard this im blinded by all the dicks im sucking
        
  bastet is all kinds of adorable
got my girls today god theyre so cute
  what are they called      what are those holy fuck    i need to preorder them now
  this is true happiness
  gangs all here

  easily one of the best toys ive ever gotten
represent
you can use pose skellies as generic enemies
  customs already
  i am making it  hello it is kawa in charge of development  aqua shooters thanks to you the sales are also very strong  this is soon   well today i will introduce you what i have received  right  new head and armor  this is  pleasant  this has a premonition spreading the world  its short but today is the end  look forward to the next report  im glad they recognize it was a hit theyre gonna sell loads of these so long as they keep making more that pricepoint is just too appealing
  im glad they recognize it was a hit theyre gonna sell loads of these so long as they keep making more that pricepoint is just too appealing  im glad too this means more aqua shooters in the future new waves or reissues these little girls are too cute and the price is great
  i hope they release new bodies and outfits too
    looks like theyre called cup figure magnet cats
caiman a cute
  thats so sick what is the official name of that
  read the thread
so ive accidentally ordered two da frea sisters and im gonna go into custom/scratchbuilding territory for a custom    question though can anyone recommend any fitting hands for this scale
why is shipping so fucking much 24 shipping for something worth 15 fucking bullshit im moving to japan
  what are you buying anon i am guessing one of three things is happening    1 you are new to import toys and are underestimating how much it costs to ship internationally    2 you are buying from some randomass rakuten shop with limited shipping options    3 you are using toysanta which has plentiful shipping options but you havent figured out how to change your shipping method
  all of those things i just want to buy some 20 toys and shit like mini gundem or cool ships i thought the rakuten thing way just a single store i live in canada btw
  looks like this  
  rakuten is full of different sellers and they all have different policies and shipping options definitely pays to check out a shops policies before buying anything if you are using toysanta they have a wide array of options right before you finalize your order when youre on that screen that shows all your details and address and stuff click edit under the shipping portion and you can choose a cheaper method be aware that this may make your order take longer or not give you any tracking or insurance if you only have a few items they may give you a shipping estimate on this screen if not youll find out later via email
  you can find them on ebay under epoch camera
  its that time of year for orange transparent chainsaws
  still an absolute banger
is it that time already
  i loved that chainsaw didnt know it was a meme lol    the set was cool but was too colorless
  
id really love a revival of this line
  but wheres the orange transparent chainsaw
based otc
  when someone saves your picture
fucken love this
vzzzzzzzzzzzz
dont die on me  lets get more content
  lets get more content  all the art i have has already been posted all ive got left is pictures i took
    fuck these are both really sweet
  a decade later i realize that mars mission was made for mashing up with ice planet  excuse me i have work to do
  otc bike
  all space series they even used the same pieces theres one with train track    therere blue green orange and i think red team
    
    i just wanted to let you guys know    this is my first time ever visiting /toy/    and this thread made me laugh my ass off     i cant believe this shit exists
  its the coolest piece ever
picked up one of these guys a few years back and made him is own snowmobile with orange transparent skis
  welcome to /toy/ anon
  same here just had a flashback of being in 2nd or 3rd grade with the front pocket of my backpack filled with all my favorite lego characters/weapons ill just lurk this board
  it transforms apparently
this thread
this thread doesnt get to die till i say it does
  glad someone finally posted this one
  rebuilt the space police galactic mediator entirely out of ice planet parts    holy fuck thats awesome
    where did you find it
  right now i know what i should get for my nieces six year old birthday  i did consider lego already but she needs a damn orange transparent chainsaw
  groovy
  i got the pics from here      he probably got them from one of those etsys that sells acrylic accessories or something
      wanted to draw gay daddy pinup drawing of this character for quite a time  gonna do it soon  thanks for references man    fucking hot
  cant wait to see this i love your art
  well thats familiar this was before i started buying stuff from bricklink so i somehow built a nonship ice planet thing without any chainsaws    ive been meaning to actually build a version with an actual mostly transparent orange chainsaw for awhile now and this project has been on/off i might finish up the legs soon
  wait a minute    i recognize that      god thats great hats off to whoever made that edit
im glad to see this thread still going good work everyone
  audibly kekd
    where do these recordings come from i nearly died after watching webm related
  i dont want to link anything because mods get anal about it and i dont want to risk ruining the best thread on /toy/ right now    the thread for it is still up here  but /toy/ got eliminated already
    thanks i was able to find a few recordings of older games on youtube but i had no idea that this was an ongoing contest
does anyone here have the mp32 reissue that comes with the commemorative coin does it have the same problem the original did with the robot mode upper arms not fitting all the way into the robot mode shoulder guards to form the beast mode upper arms also is the paint the same as the originals or is it less prone to chipping
  fuck i posted in the wrong thread and didnt realize it until now so i cant delete that post because its too old if there are any janitors around could you please remove that post and this one
  good news i found out who sold them    bad news they dont sell them anymore    
  uhhisnt this just richigo who posts regularly in the gunpla threads just track him down and ask him to cut you one im sure he still has the files and he owns his own laser cutter at home now
  thanks anon
  cute    theres a facebook community for this meme
  i cant find any confirmation on this but i want to say i remember reading that during development titan aes placeholder title actually was ice planet    coincidence yeah probably
1 move to the ice planet  2 launch satellites  3 protect satellites from blacktron  4   5 profit
  nice saved
  okay so full disclosure im starting to run out of otc images    so im tapping into some slightly more meme based ones from the facebook that the previous pic came from    this thread doesnt get to die just yet
  lego hologram chainsaws are a meme  nice
  great drawing generally but freaky pseudohuman face i really dont like it when people draw minifig head with realistic faces
my latest ice planet moc  please bear in mind i have limited parts available
  chomp
  it looks good but i feel its missing something
its a tankdestroyer hover craft  it designed to hunt and kill blacktron 6876 alienator
    i think that the saw is orange due to heat being applied to the blade but it could be a hologram too the beauty of lego is that the vagueness and ambiguity of the pieces allows for multiple interpretations and usages in constructions and varying contexts     one of my favourite examples of this is the use of the hot dog piece as a lamp spine in the simpsons house lego set unfortunately i didnt buy it at the time and the secondhand market is awfully extortionate when it comes to reselling
    sorry i uploaded the wrong image i didnt know i had a file shared by the same name
  thats pretty clever
meanwhile on /bizarrotoy/    is there anything cooler than blue transparent chainsaws fire planet 5005 was the best line ever
  i want that patch
  shit i was able to track down the creator of the patch but the ice planet patch is sold out they do also have a cool blacktron patch but it and everything else in their store is marked as coming soon and you cant add anything to your cart i think its probably dead
  shit i was able to track down the creator of the patch  the guy on /k/
  oh hes from /k/ i had no idea i meant i found his site not that i contacted him personally
  oh hes from /k/ i had no idea i meant i found his site not that i contacted him personally  yes if you ask in the lego general someone can probably provide his contact info it was a big deal earlier this year because he had so many patches and was basically making them on an asordered basis
  fire planet sets with iceblue transparent pieces for weapons and stuff  that sounds fucking awesome
  yeah i kinda want to make a mockup piece now    i have a red baseplate too
  i rebuilt the deep freeze defender into a castle a while back and wrote up a catalog blurb for it    far beyond the realm of the blacktrons deep in the heart of a frozen nebula stands the fortress of the king of the ice men
high above his vigilant guards the king of the ice men surveys his endless and unforgiving expanse as he broods ever more in the melancholic solitude of his frostcrusted tower
lower the drawbridge to admit delegations
open the tower so you can make the king of the ice men brood upon his solitary throne
  post it on general
  brb developing an entire story based on this post
    i love it little bases like this are totally my shit i especially dig the alternating white and translucent orange pattern on the drawbridge
  thanks    thats how it was in the original model
  this concept doesnt seem to have ever gotten made but its still kind of cool
  bbut it needs the same proportions    it needs to be bigger but scaled up
  will not be colored only clear  whats the point
  the shapeways 3d printed clear acrylic doesnt come in transparent orange you can however paint it in translucent paints    and im getting a test print made before releasing it that way i can post actual pics of it instead of relying on renders to sell the item if all goes well check shapeways for it in 2 weeks or so
  uh make that a month i added it to a larger order im still getting printed so early january is the estimated arrival time
  how about some mechs  someone actually built the the concept one
  the edit was made by a /toy/ soldier back in the day and coincidentally was requested by the same /toy/ soldier who did the song in the op
how is this thread still alive
  because its the first quality content weve had in months men are laying down their lives to keep this body warm in the harsh conditions of    ice planet 2002
  its a cool thread
  damn you carlos
  how about you chill out
will we get figures on the bumblebee movie bots and cons 3rd party studio series  are you hyped for bumblebee for wfcsiege toy line studio series or mp    bumblebee g1 designs       old thread  
  theres supposedly another upcoming studio series optimus next year that might be the bumblebee movie design
  hopefully any blitzwing figure alsothey changed the seeker jet on cybertron headthat must be starscream
  for wfcsiege toy line  firedrive blowpipe and the race car patrol finally showed up so im excited for the rest of the wave to join them  mp  a graveyard of dashed dreams
  this design is so beautiful i want a toy of it
  so what should we expect from the vehicle mode its gotta be cybertronian right unless he shows up on earth during the movie
    i do not doubt we will have a tiny shitty one first and if it sells
    i hope we finally get a toy of this
combiner wars  titans return  power of the primes    rank them best to worst
  kind of hard when they all deserve the worst label
  thats easy just compare the best toy from each line  cw must have something right
  titans  cw  potp
  titans return  siege  cw and potp
  titans return  shit  cw  potp
  theyre literally all the same trash theres nothing redeemable about them
  tr  cw  potp    also thank you mods
good work janitors
  reeee
  thats siege optimus just flip his roof back in atmode
    ugly
titans return is the best toyline in a long ass time the amount of variety was staggering and all the different size classes were great    with what theyre doing with siege and having each leg of the trilogy last a year i think it will only be fair to judge siege once the second line is at least finished since that will be almost the same amount of time as titans return was out and getting new releases     potp is very small in comparison even figuring in the exclusives still though potp completed bruticus monsterbots and gave us a real punch/counter punch so it wasnt a loss    i still like cw for giving us a toy accurate computron and a really interesting version of liokaiser liokaiser is one of my favorite cw molds
  in this instance you are very wrong jannies are gods for removing kirafag hope they are even more swift next time he shows his face here
so any guesses on those two walgreens insecticon packs    do you think theyll really have all 4 of the colored insecticons    i mean you cant call them deluxe insecticons more than likely theyll be reusing the legends size class molds since the price point is the same as cloudraker and wingspan
  stay mad retard
hoi doi such wonderful custodians
  i like all three   return has both the best and worst of the line though
  does this count as spam or advertising either way its getting ridiculous and needs to stop
  mppotptrcw
  eat a dick you numpty fuckboy   i suggested ae and now youre kiraposting eat a street in downtown india
  walgreens insecticon packs  link or no more you for you      linkfag posting kira shit  i thought you were cool so disappointed
  fuck mp id rather have a hollow fog of every character who appeared in the uk comics than two of characters that are done in every fucking line
  tr  potp  cw  i only put potp over cw because it gave us abominus and motherfucking battletrap
  fuck off linkfag you were btfo last time and youll be btfo again
hey since flywheels got a new figure do you think that the smaller decepticon headmasters have a shot    i mean hasbro has a shitload of decepticons that need new stuff when compared to the autobots all the autobot combiners and bases have been remade decepticons still need scorponok seacons and monstructor/dinoking    id really like hasbro to revisit pretenders they didnt even scratch the surface i got some of those third part dinoking shells just because retro looking armored dinosaurs look cool the toys are roughly leader class size or bigger hasbro could easily do articulated pretender shells that could store the same size class robots
  i really hope we get a proper update to the horrorcons one day
  tr and cw would rank much higher if they had less figures to them they both slummed it super hard with too many loweffort retools/redecos towards the end
  what low effort retools    grotesque was very good i really liked those giftsets as well chaos on velocitron and siege of cybertron had a ton of interesting figures    arcee was maybe the only weak one because its arcee and it just reused blurrs mold
so are we all agreeing not to talk about the prime wars trilogy beast cassettes
  spambot and evading spam filters it was posted earlier and then deleted
  the wave 4 and wave 6 deluxe autobots and battlecore optimus in cw krok breakaway nautica arcee astrotrain cosmos and quake in tr    i swear to god those wave 6 cw deluxes took forever to clear out and often they were the only things i could ever find in stores
  and bases have been remade  not quite still missing star convoy sky garry grandus countdown rocket base although i think siege omega is to homage that and the various micromaster bases    i do hope they go back and finish off the headmaster jrs though both autobot and decepticon as well as a new snapdragon and apeface
  i think hes referencing quake nautica brainstorm orion pax tidalwave krok and metalhawk
amazon has masterpiece barricade on sale for 47 bucks if anyones interested
  god i wish i had money
  no thats gay
  allspark is that way cunt
  bless your heart cunt
  away and fuck yersel pal
      when you take bait this obvious you need to leave too
  you need to leave  no thats gay
  good all that shitty unscaled retard bait should fuck off to the trash bin it deserves so that glorious 136 scaled wfc figures take their place
  are you hyped for bumblebee  cautiously optimistic    for wfcsiege toy line  eh mostly for custom bases i already have a sideswipe a megatron an ironhide a starscream and an optimus i like  im only really waiting for the gun guys mirage and how micromasters turn out    studio series  yeah i only need a really good beetle bumblebee and a bulkier starscream to repaint into thundercracker      or mp  mp is dead lmao
  1 potp  abominus is my favorite combiner and hes pretty good with a nice looking 3rd party upgrade set on the way  2 tr  i really like sky shadow triggerhappy bros and the jumpstarters  3 cw  the only things i bought are optimus and g2 superion
  fuck off bayfag
      someone help me out here official or black mamba
  get directly beneath my testicles give me your face and lubricate the man
do people here actually like that bobby skullface guy i just saw the most fucking absurd video he did where he talked for half an hour about how to assemble a perfectlyscaled collection of cartoon accurate display pieces it was the most autistic thing ive ever seen    is that actually how people think do people only buy things to fill the requisite shelf slot and make sure theyre perfect representations of an animation error riddled cartoon
  litrully who
  heh
  some reviewer who dresses like an idiot he gets talked a lot about a lot more in /3pg/
  i like his reviews i dont watch his other stuff
  i only ever watch thew other reviewers are boring as fuck
official mpm baricade is 47 on amazon    is the black mamba version actually better or just more economical
  i like him hes been very helpful in my choices towards figures and i always consult his videos when transformations get too complex    granted hes really only one you go to for mp and 3p stuff
  its also been half price at toys r us in canada for a few months wish id just waited instead of buying him when i did
new generations book up for preorder on amazon jp
  i know its a buzzword and people here have grown to be stupid enough to start dismissing it but i think he is a grade a shill  saying that people shouldnt buy bootlegs because it might hurt the poor little third party companies like weeks after the omega supreme wars left us with a hundred options for an omega supreme is either stupid or malicious    hell what has buying original third party at full price said to takara theyll pay for it
              well at least you guys arent using the n word so thats a step in the right direction
  hes basically irrelevant here both to this thread and the 3p one he really just collects mp and mp style figures avoids official retail stuff and legends both official and 3p hes the typical tfw2005 boomer collector just trying to fill out a checklist of g1 guys before his fat wife complains about their budget too much and stops him from buying more you see this all the time people willing to stuff shitty toys on their shelves because its an 85 guy by xtransbots or kfc with a fucked up face but it complete their ark collection
  shut the fuck up nigger
  glad to help noodle
  did kirafag decide to switch tactics again after the jannies deleted his stale shitposts
  potp optimus looks nothing like that then again transformers toys are rarely concept art accurate
  thats not concept art tho its promotional bs art like that on the 80s packages
  that retro styling is awesome
  a humble archivist  leads a faction valuing ideals and politics over physical strength  more powerful than bots bred and trained for war    i dont like it yes authority should go hand in hand with badassery but it doesnt feel right in this case i liked the idea of prime being smaller than megatron in armada it made prime seem gutsy and gave a sense of fate rarely calls upon us/i wasnt a lion that really goes with optimuss character  id like to see a tv show or comic where megatron is good at team tactics as a result of his experience in the pits while optimus is a good macrostrategic on account of having been immersed in information during his time as an archivist orion would be physically average but his new role as a warrior/symbol and his frequent encounters with megatron would force him to overhall himself and go through radical reconstruction at some point prime suffers from depersonalization after realizing that this is pretty much not his body anymore and that he has changed so much as an individual that even his name has changed then he looks at his world and his comrades and sees theyve changed just as much there is nothing to defend anymore theres only the potential future
say it with me now    four hundred forty dollars
  the only versions of optimus to have been archivists before the war were the dreamwave and prime incarnations the marvel one youre responding to a pic of was an athlete/gladiator before the war
  and hell even in armada and its sequels prime had a upgrade pack that made him bigger than megs anyway
  meh   seeing as i havent bought a mainline figure since titan wars and the only ones from that was hardhead and brainstorm i feel i could give a little money to tomy
  nine hundred dollerydoos
  one mirron dorrars
  five hundred ninety nine us dollars
just got this guy today hes a real scream    where is everyone
  maybe theyre down here
  is that more than a brazillion
  hmm i dont think this is the cube i was looking for
  no prisoners only trophies
  yes but less than a gorillion
so are there any things out now that are worth picking up i work at a store and some of the shit i walk past looks kinda sweet
    there are figures of the bb movie bots and cons on shelves right this minute
    i doubt the brand really needed saving all that bad
  why is meme wrestleman in a transformers movie
  they wanna be as successful as the mcu
  you see randy savage when looking at that optimus too
  thew is more of an entertainer than a reviewer hes not so much trying to inform you about pros and cons but rather show his toys to you in a fun way     theres this other reviewer whose name i forgot his who does figure study videos which are these long form detailed videos of him just talking about every detail of a figure hes not entertaining in the way thew is but hes interesting like a documentary      avoids legends  what the fuck
does anybody else have problems pegging studio series leader blackout together in vehicle mode    i impulse bought him after hearing he was originally supposed to be soundwave in the first movie and heard he was supposed to be the best blackout but i kind of hate it its too goddamn big and doesnt hold together    wish id just bought the 07 toy instead
  still waiting for a blitzwing toy
  not buying the oversized ko that requires adoption papers to buy
  jesus the leader is already too big to put anywhere id have to build another house to store an oversized version
  the oversized ko is a tweaked mold that fixes most of its issues
    if you dont like toys that dont hold together well do not buy the 07 toy
  i impulse bought him after hearing he was originally supposed to be soundwave in the first movie  what a stupid reason  wish id just bought the 07 toy instead  it was trash
  fair enough i was really only interested in him as a curiosity since he was supposed to be a weird trasititionary character i saw that the 07 toy was supposed to be based on earlier concept art so i thought itd be more interesting in a whatcouldhavebeen way      well i dont want it now so give me your address and ill send it to you
  if youve got the same issue i had try rotating the hips up one more notch forward into the skirt past where you think they should be you might need to splay the hips to pull this off but its basically fixed 99 of my issues
  yes
  its probably the new mp optimus
  nah man youre looking at it the wrong way  a group may share ideals but without a leader who seems impossible to beat they wont truly be galvanized  look at george washington the colonial embodiment of having everything to lose but still risking it all    movements especially rebellions are often lead by superstars for a reason  some rebellions lead to bad things some lead to good but their leaders tend to be examples of the type of person their followers imagine themselves to be
    youre acting like no other movie has ever had a wrestler star in it    protip they have
    one is on the way its arguably the best and most poseable of that subseries    you shouldnt have to wait too long some folks have seen it out already
fell out of transformers fandom a while ago  stopped buying toys dropped comics a little after mtmte and the other one came out  only been lightly following tf recently  check on cartoons  kiddie shit and cgshit that isnt prime  check on movies  fucking bumblebee spinoff  check on video games  dead aside from some mobage  check on comics  rung is primus  what the hell happened
  entropy
  same thing that happened to star wars video games doctor who and any other scifi franchise you used to like
  not the seeker design    yawn
  pictured from left to right  nutjobs the lot of them
  fucking hell i wish takara would just do their own thing again maybe get some anime studio like trigger or sunrise to do another anime that isnt a production nightmare throw in tons of fanservice and rake in them nostalgia bucks seems to be working well for gridman right now
  throw in tons of fanservice  it will be prettyboy fanservice for the fujos now though
  i meant more like nostalgia and deeper references but okay
  nah itd be kiss players 2
  is that working for cyberverse
  you know im right anon
  i dont know havent seen it though if youre just talking about geewun nostalgia thats not what i meant either i was thinking about some really obscure references triggers character designs for gridman are a pretty good example theyre practically begging hasbro to let them make a tf anime
  racknruin is in cyberverse as shockwaves obsession trying to figure out how he exists i guess   or would you still consider that geewun
  pictured pov robot girl giving giving ratchet a handjob while optimus and bumblebee walk in horrified
i hope studio trigger gets to do the transformers anime they clearly badly want to do someday
  what was the last japanese made tf series that ninja series
  get the ko    i have the original i can get the ko for about the same price as the original and even less without the scene cover thing     but original is already huge in its helo mode that i have not even have it in vehicle mode after the first time i got it
  that size  jesus fuck i mean it looks great and all but thats just a little excessive
    ko 11 scale never
  not having a forklift to convert your helicopter    into a massive robot bit by bit over the course of 20 hours  plebs
  i want 2d animated transformers back badly or at least something like cybertron
  im not buying another 50 soundwave especially one with an alt mode as bad as this i might still buy the cassettes though let me see if they fit in with the potp mp3 players first
  50  its retailing for 30 what the fuck are you on about
  50  u wot
  tr was garbage    dude lets ruin every toy with partsforming ugly heads lmao
  tr was garbage  saying dumb shit aloud doesnt make it true
  im fine with huge blackout despite my surprise but black mamba just fucked up when making their starscream  i just want the accessories who thought anyone needed a leader movie starscream
    i bet you liked combiner wars too
  something something bayformer bullshit jets are huge so starscream must also be huge or some garbage    really all it is is just tf fans being literal size queens not gonna be happy until theyve got a life sized optimus shoved up their asshole
    straya
  even in austraya msrp voyagers are like 45 usd
  only blockheads like titan return
  haha le toy turns its torso around so that means it has le mindblowing transformation even though it has to partsform to do it    i love this meme
    saying dumb shit aloud doesnt make it true
  tr was pretty shit  the headmaster gimmick was fun but it was poorly implemented and the actual figures were only marginally better than the horrid combiner wars line
  it was a joke because the heads are square  you blockhead
  this is fine    slightly selfish on my part but i wouldnt really mind if tf went a little more sjw  i am just in it for the toys  the fembots are some of my favorite designs and i feel like they would push the ever loving fuck out of them like they do prime and bumblebee now  i have been burnt out prime since i was like 12 and bumblebee will never be anything other than a stupid yellow midget to me so i would really only come out on top
  tf should be more sjw cause i like femmebots
  that explosion of panels and hinges  shelformer alt mode   400 burger bucks    the mp line is a dumpster fire at this point magic square is getting my money
  dont get me wrong i think it would be a disaster and all but as long as the designs were better than the weird manly fembots we have gotten in the last couple of lines and we didnt get an rid situation where they tried something completely different only to utterly halfass the toys i would be into it  idw was an sjw dumpster fire from what i could tell from the outside but visually i loved quite a few of its designs
  you dont even know what a shellformer is
  anime    any kind of transformers anime would just be about a bunch of high school girls and tournament shit if youre lucky theyd be wearing armor
  he said shelformer not shellformer    a shelformer is a transformer that is meant to be left on the shelf and never transformed
  tournament  that is a little much for modern anime desu  it would much more likely be some robot girls z shit where the main characters are highschool girls wearing autobot headgear that just kind of sit there having dull conversations and occasionally having mock battles with girls who are kind of sort of cosplaying as decepticons  maybe the success of gridman will cause a bit of a mecha resurgence but i kind of fucking doubt it since i hear more about the girls thighs than anything else
  thats called a shelfwarmer shelformer turns into a shelf
  better than jobby
  jobby is zoomer thew but thats still better than watching a boomer in an isis mask talk about shelving for half an hour
  i would unironically buy a shelfforming citybot
      consider the following     high school girls   hang out or work in a toy store after school  buy transformers and other takara tomy products  entire show is about how you should buy more toys to make the anime girls happy
  yup im here with you bud
  yeah basically make dagashi kashi but with tfs instead of snacks
  i would actually watch that if the girls were yuruyuri style spergs with actual character  i am sure it would turn out boring as fuck but a series about cute toy otaku is a potentially great idea for an sol
calm down 3pfags and general takara haters mpv3 optimus is 50000 per case of 2 so approx 220 usd
  phew i was going to bomb that takara sushi place thanks anon
  tfw they literally have takara plum wine
  wrong the price for everything else on that list isnt combined sg24 is 5500 yen a piece not 5500 for six
  oh thats right the heading says pcs fuck this shit which takara sushi should i go to
  instead of blowing something up drive to ri and rob john wardens house then use that money to buy mp44 and laugh all the way back home
  thats almost the plot of that promotional manga from young gangan wish it got a fullblown serialization or replaced legends honestly
  soundwave  all i care about  tell me more
  studio series and botbots say hi soulless faggot
    that backpack
  what a fucking retarded leap   the things i liked as a kid are different now and i dont have the same connection with them  its clearly the fault of the sjws
  i wonder if all those people who hate forced gimmicks are going to be mad at this since it seems like every mp figure now has the gimmick of carrying its entire fucking alt mode around on its back
  well sir
  lmao the state of takara
  they have no comic line they are showing the current cartoon for free om youtube and the film partnership they are in now grants hasbro less creative control that is not something a film company does if everything if going well    they really do need to revitalize the brand
  fuck off  that one fits the state of transformers media today
  thats easily enough time for everyone here to be able to afford it  thing is that would anyone actually want to own such an overpriced unit
  thing is that would anyone actually want to own such an overpriced unit  thats pretty much how i look at it sure i could save as you suggested but honestly dropping that much on a single figure just doesnt sit well with me anymore
  its not even just paying that much for a single figure if it was something deserving of a pricepoint like that like a 1/60 or 1/48 macross valkyrie which are usually superb quality with intricate transformations and paint apps it wouldnt be so bad but its just optimus prime its not a hard transformation its not a colour scheme deserving of lots of small paint apps itll be a bland red and blue block that theyve just gone in and way overdesigned for muh cartoon accuracy muh parts count to gouge you for every last penny they can
doing the math with potential discounts 30 on japanese retailers he comes out to 315 before shipping which will probably be another 20  30 havent ordered from overseas in forever so forgive me if im way off here
why are there so many few pictures of toys in here
  because no one actually buys toys and would rather discuss the inane and misinterpreted nature of idw despite also not buying that or talking about how much they hate x reviewer
  while the sjw boogeyman is a dumb argument dont pretend idw comics actually did a good job talking about neither homosexuality or any topic it tried to discuss arcee was the result of an insane experiment lug and anode were pisspoor comic relief rewind and chromedome were bad fujo bait bots crushing on thunderclash was the only nice thing on this subject
  i bought 20 figures over the consumer holiday because i have no self control
  im looking for a good deal on a vintage overlord anyone have any suggestions i dont want to have to pay a lot
  moshi moshi bumburr bee desu
starscream parts to recreate the cosplay optimus prime for g1    if the head is a new sculpt would we begin to speculate a seeker v3 coming
  thats honestly pretty cool that they would include starscream bits
  until we get a true in hand his alt mode is gonna be hard to judge  theres gotta be more going on underneath  could be like shockwave whos true alt mode is a gun
  why starscream head and wings
  
    my question now is why was starscream wearing a prime costume
  the decepticons dressed up as the autobots to steal energy and make a propaganda video basically saying we dindu nuffin the autobots are evil which gets the autobots banished from earth
    not bad
runs away from you while sick guitar riffs play in the background
  the obvious allegory of the decepticons being fascist authoritarian military dictators and the autobots being an oppressed majority in g1 is really hammered home by false flag stuff like this  that and sea change which established the decepticons colonialism relying on their technical superiority not their numbers adds to it  the way it is relatable to almost any heroic rebellion across the world is impressive really    but japan didnt get that somehow instead we get toys referencing 35 year old cartoon gags and charge 450 dollars
  it was primarily a giant toy commercial anon the japanese dont need to get creative when reality is hard hitting why do you think their games mechanically are clunky as fuck compared to western games with sticky dynamic controls and movements
  but japan didnt get that somehow  because they are not a bunch of selfloathing virtue signaling faggots rebellions have only fucked things for everyone
  not him but  why do you think their games mechanically are clunky as fuck compared to western games with sticky dynamic controls and movements  thats a yikes from me dawg
  oh i just know that everyone who buys that piece of shit is going to say to keep the jetpack on if you dont like looking at that block of kibble on primes back
liveaction optimus prime compared to the siege version
  himitschi  children cheering  ohhhhhhhhhh  good old wotafa
  kore da  hantaigamodoyo  slide whistle  best reviewer
    i really like watching his reviews despite not understanding a word  i wonder if my opinion would change if i understood jap
  monado boy
  i think is more like huh would you look at that
  he was so fucking cool     dun dun du dun    prepare for extermination    launches self at higf speed
  are you literally retarded
  an overlord you say
  wait is this a legit thing that happened or a meme  i could have sworn ive seen something similar on here about some allspark poster or am misremembering and thats something totally different
  theres that sipher dude on allspark that apparently sold figures in exchange for sex yes
  reminds me of this weird ass thing which will never get a toy mp or otherwise
  well this was posted here probably not an actual event but it certainly was a fun day on /toy/ when it was posted
  angel starscream thinking hes hot shit because hes so big  manlets when will they learn
  wasnt transfomers go technically anime  it didnt seem good from what i saw but it definitely wasnt that
  best transformers game in my opinion
  your opinion is invalidated too bad activision is too cheap to pay for the license and now the game has been pulled from all digital shit unless you already owned it
   throw in tons of fanservice and rake in them nostalgia bucks  so are you basically just asking for the legends comic animated
  ikr
  not the anon you asked but yes yes i am asking for that
  i agree with him transformers ps2 is more fun and intricate than devastation dev is mostly just flashy
    whoa strafing while holding down the fire button this is so cool
  does it emulate well i have a rarelyused ps2 emulator and never played this game i own devastation but never got around to giving it my full attention
  press s to spit on mps grave
  i mean thats a pretty good number of accessories but a bunch of that shit oneoff episode stuff people might recreate cosplay starscream once say ah i remember that and then toss it back in the box forever id rather have something like two guns and two axes so he could dual weild weapons or even some original weapons    the takara figures are so absurdly focused on replicating the sunbow cartoon that they forget to be fun toys
  i bought flame toys drift  tarn money isnt the issue takara isnt capable of making a piece worth the price theyre asking
  yeah the japanese are way too uncreative to have the decepticons act like a bunch of wacky cobra reject retards every other episodes  why do you think their games mechanically are clunky as fuck compared to western games with sticky dynamic controls and movements
    
    arent these updates supposed to improve on the previous figure  jesus
  their games mechanically are clunky as fuck compared to western games with sticky dynamic controls and movements  nah western games mk series ki series pretty much every rockstar game are clunky as fuck
  technically tfp and rid15 are anime because they are all animated by a japanese studio
  hell no especially when u know a ko with improved quality and cheaper price is eventually going to get released i paid 74 bucks for the it megs and laughed at idiots that threw down 200
  starscreams externally 
  travis knight saves the brand    these designs are still shit
    hes supposed to be animationaccurate to a cartoon that ended 31 years ago
  i wish i could find other tf pics with this face
smoll boi
  triggered much head on back to your tumblr safe space
  i own it physically so i dont know      play it before you knock it you might like it if you can put your bias aside
  what the fuck are you talking about
  reminder chromia got away with killing innocent civilians without facing justice
  it looks like fucking shit dude
  theres that bias i mentioned a shame
what am i in for
  thats like saying calling a shit smelly is bias because you have a nose
  some younger anons are mentally incapable of playing an older game because muh grafix
  hours of being mesmerized by the beautiful shine of that nice golden key
  yeah thats it its not like it looks like boring cookie cutter buggy licensed fucking garbage
  tfortnite kiddie
  its not even graphics it looks boring as shit its a generic third person shooter just like cybertron games
  holy shit stop whiteknighting some shitty shovelware from fifteen years ago
  stop liking what i hate
    damn all these pointless accessories just to overinflate the price another 100    all optimus needs is his gun and trailer
  you can like it all you want capn crunch i fucking still like shadow the hedgehog doesnt mean its also not a turd dinner plate
    im about 20 certain theyre trying to make the backpack look like that jetpack
  wow those accesories ill never take out of the box sure do make it worth an extra 200
  30k just for the robot is in line with mp36 and 41 pricing but an extra 20k for a trailer and starscream bits    they are really going insane even bandai and arcadia dont go over 40k in price point bandai always maintain below the 30k mark except for their soc dx and rocket ships etc    they might as well spend legal fees to shutdown one third party to kill their market takara really has been driven to a corner
  you should try it bet you wouldnt be able to beat it
  that said arcadia sv51 will most likely be at least 45k with no discount    takara will crack down on kos and fans toys first
  right over your head
  thinking street fighter is better than mortal kombat    its been inferior since the first mk was released    thinking metal gear is better than manhunt    now i know youre retarded
  arcadia sv51  holy fuck i didnt even know that was happening when are yf21 and vf17 getting another shot though
  why couldnt they make a mainframe for titans return when they had the perfect mold for it fuck
  action masters ruled but their thigh joints become loose real easy using a gi joe style metal tbar
  wanting a simplified version of the toy design dumbed down to make it easier to animate  i cant say i get it but as long as people are happy i guess  personally i would take the more toy like looks we were getting over cartoon accurate shit any day of the week
  get in the robot shinji
  thinking metal gear is better than manhunt  i love manhunt too but lets not exaggerate here  mgs is better than manhunt in just about every way
  people want what they saw on the screen whatever it means more or less detail tons of toy lines try to do the same like the dc animated and filmation heman lines you could even say figmas and hot toys too
  get the shapeways faceplate
  i know this isnt the place for this but holy shit is your taste in video games god awful
  yeah but not all of it looks good just because people want something doesnt make it good    i would reconsider my hell no mp44 position if they make a toy deco thats a big if though
  buying a toy just to put it on a shelf to collect dust  no wonder you dont like masterpiece figures theyre made to be played with
  nah i just think its weird for echigratuitously fanservicy like comics to be officially licensed   dont have an inherent problem with them existing or being made just think it ends up reflecting negatively on the brand when theyre the ones producing them    yeah like i said i wish their were other tf pics with the excalibur expression so that i could use it without someone thinking i was a tumblr
  dont have an inherent problem with them existing or being made just think it ends up reflecting negatively on the brand when theyre the ones producing them  i think its a good thing for a company to have fun with its own product far too much american shit is no fun allowed ever because everything has to be designed to appeal to the broadest fucking audience ever and its annoying because i want shit to be made for my tastes japan understands the power of targeted marketing for everything
  and its annoying because i want shit to be made for my tastes  dude a childrens toy company is not going to make stuff for your dick kiss players was the one time it happened and its pretty obvious its never happening again  japan understands the power of targeted marketing for everything  ans that super niche specialized marking to one tiny group killed alot of stuff
  i would reconsider my hell no mp44 position if they make a toy deco  possible but at the same time it wont fix the backpack and panel lines and pantsonhead retarded transformation
  i play with my mp figures too but im not reenacting a random episodes from season 2
  masterpiece figures  made to be played with    theyre literally not
if ya think sakmotos comics are too lewd youre a boring prude
  jesus fucking christ you little git why do you think anyone gives a single shit
  are you linkfag
  wheelie say  anon is gay
  mortal kombat is literally the worst major fighting franchise by a mile
  i can see where dcau hot toys and figma fans are coming from since the toys in those lines are directly based on their source material for the most part  heman and transformers are straight up cheaply produced toy commercials so figures based on them are just sloppier looking versions of the original designs and its not like the models were that consistent from episode to episode  like i said i really dont get it but hey if people are happy with it then good for them
  theyre way more playable than most japanese robot toys of that level recent soul of chogokins have been way more playable but mps have always blurred the line
  dont like ta you big gay from usa i say
post noncombiners attempt in to combine
  who does she think she is slide
  not preachy enough plus people actuallylike her
  thats far too creative for that guy
  i snagged repugnus and blastoff half price from amazon on cyber monday i feel good
how the hell do i afford this new optimus im supposed to be taking on a car payment next year maybe ill just skip out on health insurance
  just dont buy it it looks like shit anyway
  just wait for the superior ko like anybody whos not a raging moron
  how do i save 300 in 9 months  reevaluate your life anon
  just get one of the many 3rd party figure that look nearly the same but cost 1/3 the price 450 is fucking ridiculous thats like 300 bucks for a trailer and itll get kod anyway if you just wait
  i guess the opposite also works
  hey kid wanna /ss/
  yeah heman is actually a perfect comparison when they made the collectors oriented heman toys they made them as idealized versions of what you saw in the cartoon not 11 translations i used to be kind of a loyalist but the way takara has been taking the mp line leaves me completely cold      either dont buy it or wait a year for a knockoff    if you really want a new optimus then youre way better off with one of the turds since theyll be way cheaper
    and im 100 sure that its a gigantic mess trying ro stow 4000 unnecessary panels and hinges for a toy that much to takara tomyss annoyance im sure must transform from a often wildly inconsistently drawn robot from an 80s toy commercial into a truck as well
  when they made the collectors oriented heman toys they made them as idealized versions of what you saw in the cartoon  no they didnt they were making them as 11 translations of the toys
7262885  not even waiting for the bump limit to make your meme op  baka
  how long until they start incorporating alternate heads or transformations to emulate specific animation errors    does optimuss right side come off so i can accurately recreate that one scene from the cartoon where they forgot to draw it
  just report him and wait for the real thread
  the main line toys already do that thats why scourge has a gimmick where you can deploy his head in vehicle mode it was an animation error from an old character model that they did now and again so they put it on modern toys
  suck a dick you friendless shitposter
again  is it seriously that fucking hard for the new thread not to have that garbage stuck to it
  welcome to 4chan
  its just that one anons tireless shitposting effort thats to blame for some reason he just hates /tfg/ and wants to stir shit up for yous
  generals only ever get this bad with the absolute bottom of the barrel like what /vg/ shits out    didnt he get banned twice
7262913  no you  kill yourself already
  this has a dick doesnt it
    lurk moar or learn how to use the board you fucking newfag
7262938  sad that you dont get any yous
how about making a new proper thread
why are you even here
  you dont do that though you just shitpost and b8 all day every day here and everyone knows it
who is making a new thread
  you i guess post the link and well follow linkfag will too and probably shit up the new thread like always but not much you can do but report and ignore him
    here we go        
  so did literally every decepticon     when your race population is reduced to like 005 and you go from an intergalactic empire to squatting on an organic mudball with all the newborns there will ever be looking like nerds whos names cannot be remembered you gotta let bygones be bygones     hell they didnt even kill shockwave even though hes objectively the single most evil being in existence in that universe
  i still say that slash makes a better volcanicus weapon than a belt     i mean in a combiner vs combiner fight being able to throw someone onto their head where they dont have the articulation to reach is a decent tactical maneuver     just give him a bandoleer full of slashs make him master of the throwing clevergirl
  a treat action masters are underrated theyre great fun mainframe has a nice design and pushbutton is one of the better weapon/partners in the line

how many of you cucks gave disney money for your precious zuckusses  more like turning over your balls to disney
  doesnt it at least send the message we want ot and maybe prequel stuff by buying zuckuss and not nuwars shit
  all of us who get disney shit are shills so we actually all got zuckuss for free lmao imagine being a broke ass nigga
2018  still buying star wars merchandise    worse than pops
  but anon they rooind ur chyldhoowd  you arent supposed to like anything from the franchise anymore
  on that note seriously fuck bbts and anyone that recommends them in these threads for starting to charge 25 for all black series as standard now
  i pretty much only use them for neca now a shame
  i didnt give disney shit i paid a scalper the price was steep but its worth it for the satisfaction of knowing that none of my hardearned dollars went to disney
  so you both supported a disgusting filthy scalper and disney because the scalper bought and gave his money to disney anyway congrats youre part of the problem and more
  how many degrees of separation would be needed to buy something from soi wars without giving disney money  buying bootlegs
  probably even then im sure someone bought the original in order to make cheap molds of it
  cry more you fucking poor baby
    cucks    when will this shit die i honestly cant tell if its trying to be ironic anymore
that vintage tie fighter from walmart refuses to not suck super hard ive been through three of them now trying to get one that doesnt have the wings shoot off after 20 minutes piece of shit
local disney store was flooded with new black series exclusives this morning i dont think they will be difficult to find
anyone else going to buy these available online in mid november and in stores the first week of december
  theyre too small for 375 inch scale right ill probably stick with droid factory stuff
  i heard these are droid factory figures repacked not quite the same level of quality though
  my bad i was wrong apparently these things are tiny
  oh so its terrible when disney does it but its ok when bbts scalps fuck off shill
  making bad financial decisions to pwn the libs
  bbts isnt scalping you fucking psycho
  how are bbts and shopdisney not scalping have you seen the prices theyre charging
  neither of them are scalping
  charging above msrp because they know they can get away with it  this is literally scalping how does your stupid npc brain not get this
  charging 25 over msrp isnt scalping  fuck off bbts defense force
  disney is awful but paying scalpers is so much worse my god
  this is literally scalping  it literally is not you braindead fucktard
  explain how it isnt
  hes going to give you some bullshit about how its a retailer and scalping is only when individuals buy from retail and mark up themselves for resale and actually taking items out of the wild as if that somehow excuses a 25 markup
  id love to see you take your bullshit math to them and try to reee some more theyd laugh your fat ass right out of the store
  i hate to break it to you but retailers are allowed to set prices as they see fit that doesnt make it scalping you sensitive snowflake
chuds rail against disney for being liberal sjw communist atheist muslim jews  chuds also rail against disney for being textbook capitalists  hmmm
    pretty much    bbts is ordering from a distributor who orders from hasbro and this is putting more figures into the market because of that
  thats fucking adorable     but im not buying any i have ascended beyond those scams
    i agree the are fucking cute but whats the point its better off just grabbing the droid factory stuff or the bs figures model kits are great too
  if they really were capitalists they wouldve kept politics out of their press and respect the old characters  there are many people that bailed out of star wars because the new movies have no substance shit on the old trilogy and are full of heroic gay atheist muslim jews that act like sociopaths
    that hoth han and leia 2pack is on ee for anyone that wants that thing
i was between high school and getting my first real job for a couple years and missed out on all the actual good hasbro shit it seems now that i go back and try to catch up on stuff i always wanted its crazy expensive should i just try to buy shit loose/used no ones gonna hotglue a falcon or the big version atat right    fuck how much is the barge gonna go for in a couple years i shouldve taken out a loan and bought five of them
  that was a big regret for me  i saw it on sale for 75 at walmart i could have bought three of them and made a fortune
  i mean the mf not the barge
  fuck  obviously not the barge because you cant buy that at walmart    i spilled my spaghetti on fucking /toy/ fucking hopeless
  i read this in the voice the dead milkmen use on stuart     dont you know what the queers are doing to our soil
  that lego freemaker cartoon totally made me think of this guy in a completely different way that i had before
  surprising no one disneyashit
  just look rregularly on ebay  they turn up sometimes for okay prices
i used the 25 target coupon and got this guy for 22 bucks  hes fun
  the 25 target coupon  which what now
the hovertank is 48 on amazon    
  you got 4 more days to use it
  aw snap thanks
  i should buy another
    thanks anon i am going to use it        shame i missed out i would of bought it at this price
  best boy
if youre in the uk and need zuckuss staractionfigures put up the preorder  28    not cheap but not nearly as much as scalpers    they also put up that shitty phasma/staff/damaged eye figure  28
i just got zuckuss hes ok i guess i feel empty inside even the bounty hunters cant make me happy anymore
  same think ill just go back to sleep
  my target had that 2499 sale sign up for moloch and i talked them into knocking the gamorrean down to that he wasnt the one on sale but he was in the same space and i used the 25 off coupon got it for about18 i feel good about thathes worth that much at least
    same
  i think ive heard stories here on /toy/ about people who saw the big atats in clearance at sams club but didnt pick them up    you could get a halfdecent car that runs alright and passes inspection for the price of one of those now
  thats awesome anon my target had the same sale and i didnt event think about asking for that  well maybe next time 18 for it its a great fucking price
figuarts anakin 4500 jpy at manda if someone is interested  
  why bother when the clearly superior black series is coming with a better face for over half the price anon
  clearly superior
  even with the face print the darth vader face still looks goofy
  why because it actually looks like hayden get real the figure is a huge step up over the figuart hasbros face tech is changing things in a wonderful way
  get real  this from you is fucking hilarious 
todays purchase  shit photo good haul
  but the hasbro sculpt doesnt look like anakin
did a hack job to switch lando heads youll have to murder the bespin landos head ball joint to get it to fit in the new one and the old one will be loose and sit a bit high also the skintone is darker on the skiff guard lando so youll have to repaint it if you want it to look good    probably wasnt worth it but oh well helmet fits on old head at least
  why the fuck is revan so small
still have to wait a year
  recent cops
best ot little stormtrooper i can get personally thinking about revo but wouldnt it be hard to find
  look on the bright side anon it may take a while but at least its coming
  why would anyone get the disgusting revo when the shf rogue one ver exists
  muh exxxtreme poses11oneone
  which one looks cooler
  yes it does
  hes not just sits lower in the pack
  pic on him and baze on the shelf
  the revo i guess if you want cool ass anime poses no stormtrooper has been seen in any media in ever and if you like shitty joints gaps and an ugly sculpt     if you want an actual great figure the shf rogue one stormie is best black series are good too
general veers prepares to lead a storm commando strike force on a rebel outpost     just kitbashed the unhelmeted one with cosmic spidey head and the cape thing from shf kylo turned out pretty good besides the eyes lookin derpy really loving these officers
  he looks like he smelled a fart
      can the shf even do a crouched aiming pose the black series cant im sure
  does it counts as crouched aiming pose    nice funny how sw itself inherently influenced by japan culture references from samurai stuff to space adventure cobra and battleship yamato
  it can
  that shadow scout is neat
  youre looking in the mirror again
  hes still pretty small and shorter than all the other male figures made me think they went with the female version of the character at first
  short people are angry and hateful it makes sense for a powerful dark lord to be tiny
  the black series cant im sure  it can i guess you didnt try very hard
  then post pics shitcock
  the black series cant im sure    it can why are you being such a contrarian
  prove it
    since no one itt has the damn thing ill post mine excuse the poor quality
    you must see that that isnt nearly as good as the mafex
  youre right its actually better good job anon thanks for the pics
  the mafex  but anon the best figure is the shf
  i dont buy mafex but from what ive seen they do have better articulation than the black series
  where did you find baze for 799
  thats not true at all though
  tuesday morning its a closeout store chain dont know if it exists outside of texas
  would you care to explain why
      oh shut the fuck up  someone post a sidebyside comparison
  come on limited hip mostly and torso angles dont allow to put his body in organic pose shf and revo can do this without doubt
  come on limited hip mostly and torso angles dont allow to put his body in organic pose  i agree thats why i posted  posing the figure for those photos was just to demonstrate that it could indeed get into a crouching position
  to demonstrate that it could indeed get into a crouching position  not one thats worth posing him in  and not nearly as good as mafex or figuarts  its just a fact
i recently got a new darth revan from black series very cheap  this figure is not wonderful but it is good enough and most likely the only figure we might get from the character one i particularly love for the kotor games so im happy with it
  people have added a custom cloth hood/robe which i think would be a large improvement considering doing it myself
    ive seen that but im not that much into modifying my figures still a goodlooking fabric robe would be a huge improvement
  if that guy that did that mod to his revan still browses please post your revan and maybe give a little info on how you did it please
  6 figures cant kneel  thats pretty bad since pretty much all of the stormtroopers have been able to kneel since they got knee articulation    id like to confirm if the 6 figure can or cant but i have no idea where mine is
  fuck off already your precious weeb toys arent the only thing that can do the pose deal with it
i walked back to the toy section and saw an unusual amount of employees back there in the star wars aisle there were lots of boxes of hasbro product and two hasbro reps they were stocking tvc    i grabbed two tvc range troopers and started talking to the two ladies i asked them if they were hasbro reps they said they were i told them i used to see reps in stores quite often but it had been quite a few years since i had seen them    they said they have been doing this for years so i said that i was pleasantly surprised to find these new figures because distribution has been really bad the past few years and most people like me have had to resort to online purchases because its so hard to find new figures anymore    one of them said something along the lines of weve been hearing this and disney has reps she said it in a way that sounded like she was critical of disney but didnt want to come out and openly bash them
  making the revan figure so you couldnt just head swap with other black series or even marvel legends heads was a huge letdown
  how hard can the hood be glued down i am tempted to just break it off since the figure is easy to rebuy on other sites now and my imperial navy troopers holster came off with no issue or traces
  that is disappointing actually has anyone tried is it totally impossible
    its basically impossible without cutting the hood off entirely heres a pic from a year or so ago i did a cloth replacement and im working on a 20 currently with better quality cloth and fully replacing the whole mantle
  that does look pretty cool keep us posted
  i told both sides to put up or shut up i dont know what you want from me
just got a bunch of those episode i accessory sets from an ebay auction i only wanted the tatooine disguise set but i ended up spending less on the lot than the individual listing which is nice    now my potf obiwan can finally sit in the landspeeder with his hood up
  those are pretty sweet  the lightsabers in there were much higher quality than the packins
brand new in the box unopened black series 64 range trooper variant/bootleg figure one of a kind soooo cool and so unique check out photos its a must see only flaw is the minor bends in the side of the box perfect other than that    what did the shitty customizer mean by this
got piett and veers i need more officers when are we getting an admiral ozzel so i can buy 2 and custom one to be his appearance as hitler in last crusade
  mfw its 1000 now
  i wish veers didnt have such a tiny head i got two of him and tried switching one head with a rebel trooper but it looks ridiculous
  would totally fuck
still no 375 holdo  still no 375 lieutenant connix  still no admiral statura  still no sa general leia    why are they missing out these characters
  was 6 inch holdo released  need to track her down
  not yet  i dont really need her in 6 inch because there isnt anyone for her to go with but i will get it anyway because the photoreal face will be worth it    i guess it will be released in spring/ dec/january because i havent heard anything
      thats pretty poor
    i missed it bros
  better than what the shf can do
  repainted the gamorrean guards face
  no figure of these guys either
  im depressed at how much better that looks good job dude
  nazis  kkk  cobra  too much awesomeness at once
  no where to run  no where to hide  panic spreading far and wide
  cobraaaaaaaaaaaa
dengar an hoth leia just shipped i just need ig88 to complete the empire bounty hunters i hope bandai makes a model kit before the hasbro rerelease
  why the model kits are terrible not to mention unpainted shit     ig88s the only one i need too now i skipped on it because i wasnt thinking theyd actually get the other bounty hunters out ever
anyone else have an atat driver with a left arm that wont bend
ive been out of the black series scene since late 2016 is it still a fucking nightmare of shitty distribution scalpers and baby boomer hoarders shit was so demoralizing i gave up and sold off a bunch of my crap
  distribution isnt very good at brick and mortar stores but ive been able to get every release in the last year with no issues online or with the help of brickseek for target/walmart exclusives seems like hasbro is getting better about case assortments not having a bunch of figures nobody wants carry forward also seems like most figures on ebay or whatever dont go much higher than 30 which after tax time gas etc might not be so bad
    ugh wish i could find just one my target never got him
  never had much of a problem finding the bs series in stores i dont collect them aside from one or two figures a year but i see every wave nonetheless  ive seen pretty much everything but the pig guard    i go to multiple targets and barnes and noble btw live in one of hte largest metro areas in the us too so its quite a few targets and walmarts within 15 minutes of me
  the sequel figures and rogue one and solo figures have almost killed the line over and over again closeout stores are choking on jyns and crappian andoreand next will be solo and his lame ilk bs could be a healthy line if they limit that shit
  the r1 figures would have been fine if they didnt print so god damned many of the same ones replace half of those cassians and jyns with baze and chirrut and there never would have been an issue
  wow thats not subtle at all fucking marvel
h
  me rey  me telling you   strongest jedi
regrets general  after months of pining for baze and chirrut i found them at five below goddamn theyre awful going straight into the sale pile i guess  leia turned up at target today and shes pretty ok for the lack of accessories but thankfully i got a cloak in a facebook deal that is alright with her and that same facebook deal yielded this luke kitbash with a custom jacket that looks pretty rad inhand tarkin is also worth the fuss
  and ironically now baze and chirrut can be had for 5 at five below
  havent had any problems with mine
  hes right about the springs on the wings they refuse to allow them to lock into place its a really bad design flaw on this version
  eh ive never once seen them in a mainstream retailer so they got shipped straight to those discount stores further proof hasbro distribution is all kinds of fucked up
  given they got full cases of mattel dc multiverse shit theyre up to 4 waves now i dont especially think its hasbros distribution
  fucking kek
ummm lads    if youre a britbong the entertainer is selling oop 375 black series figures including commaner neyo doom thorn and wolffe desert gear    for 5
  name one bad model kit droid or fully armored character you cant hasbro dropped the ball on ig88 its undersized and floppy a model kit would be more solid accurate and detailed
worth the wait
  they moved her around and its obvious they did it because they know shes a shitty character that will hurt the line but have to crap her figure out somewhere as if obligated too contractually by disney shes being released in wave 20 sometime between february and april with a whole bunch of prequel and solo figures shes one per case while theres two battle droids and two padames in each of the cases along with mace windu mudtrooper and dryden vos     
  shoot me an email i have a couple loose for sale
i have a question for everyone here since hasbro has divided up production lines its been an occurring thought for a while for me im wondering what are your collecting habits as far as the hasbro toy lines go do you prefer the 6 line over 375
  literally every fucking one of the model kits are crap
  i prefer 375 however ive only new things ive bought from retail this year are the wampa and hoth rebel everything else that i got 2nd hand from a toy store    for 6 inch i only have 1st release sandtrooper 40th vader  leia hera  revan would get rex  jaina if i ever found them
    i think the death trooper is pretty amazing imo
  i only bought the occasional 3 inch figure as a child because distribution in europe was fucked up in 2006 i tried to go in full with online shops but they just became more and more expensive it wasnt fun and i stopped within the year this meant that i skipped over the good times completely though judging by the archives i would have always found a couple details to bitch about    i started 6 inch originally only with the bandai model kit line because the stormtrooper was like a dream come true for someone who bought a 2004 tvc stormtrooper and was always pissed at the funky a bit offlooking details hasbros first figures looked like shit and prices seemed ridiculous with 25 when they started doing sequel shit they even got insulting with 35 since hasbro started digging deeper with things like revan nonarmored imperials and actually finished some teams it got more interesting the faces improving while prices go down back to 25 for some of the figures makes me happy i only pick more obscure figures from hasbro since japanese lines do better jobs with the heroes though since i vastly prefer the lesser known characters its still much i just prefer how 6 inch figures get the details just right when 3 inch is always of lower quality though i dont like how hard it is to find display space i already have as many 6 inch figures as i did 3 inch figures sold all of the 3 inchers when i started going 6 inch i just think and hope that i can keep to only buying figures from my wishlist but i already have made a couple of exceptions like getting the full bounty hunters gang instead of just some of them but it finally feels so fun to get toys that look so lifelike compared to what was available previously in the price range
  i prefer 118 scale so my purchases for 112 figures is pretty limited   only figures i get are main character favorites that benefit from larger details and better paint apps so i have like 5 112 sw figures    i dont bother to buy armored figures or soldiers nor aliens so no darth vader stormtroopers boba fett pig guard etc etc etc because the detail is practically the same in the 118 figures no secondary favorites either so no lando dengar leia etc  oh yeah i did buy a few k2so in 112 just because i like robots    used to buy a couple dozen star wars figures every year from hasbro but when they killed the 118 line by making it a walmart exclusive they didnt actually stock i probably bought a dozen total sw figures in the past 3 years    so with recent purchases i bought that power armor legged snow trooper stormtrooper from solo two weeks ago and couldnt find anything from the new stuff since i dont care for any of the nutrilogy designs and thats all ive seen shelf warming on the shelves for the past year or so    i bought the jabba barge and hope to see more
  you dont buy aliens but you did buy the barge i dont fault your for that it just seems odd
  inference is that i dont buy aliens in 112 scale but i do in 118 scale detail is great on the 118 figures    whereas 112s larger size lends to more accurate appearances for the actual actors because realistic sculpts benefit from the better paint were seeing you can fudge the paint on the less realistic stuff and theyll still look good  aliens dont need that paint and sometiems the paint is better on the 118 figures like pic
  whats he look like without the fur  need to know for science
  holy shit does someone at hasbro finally understand how to pack cases
    kinda
  
    no idea why these are sideways
i recently started going all in on the figuarts line ep 4 luke just got a restock on amiami i also grabbed a discounted han for 40 and chewy is on sale for 21 im pretty excited
the box on the tauntaun set is so nice its almost a shame to open it
  goddamn i want zuckus and 4lom so bad
  cut out the picture of the tauntaun and han from the front glue them to a popscicle stick then you can have hantaun adventures everywhere you go
    4lom isnt so bad to get but zuckuss is annoying since you need to buy him from the disney store i paid over 30 dollars i am still bitter about that
  i wish i was a bit more into the clones my barnes and nobles had about 4 or 5 commander wolfes and i had no real desire for them they looked pretty good though why cant i just find a classic stormtrooper somewhere dammit
  i think id rather just open the box
  wolfe really sucks though basically all of them have a fucked up height thing going on
hey guys does kotobukiya have a star wars license i want to get some lightsaber chopsticks for my sister for christmas an kotobukiya makes them seems legit but cost 30 do you think itll be at least a quality product
  ill buy sw toys just to spite you whiny fuck conservatives go pray or some shit about it that should get what you want oh wait no your god doesnt exist    comicautistamateur crybaby can go fuck himself cant wait for trump to get convicted so you fuckers can finally drop your memes because memes are the best you got you wont fight a real war or anything youre no threat    now to go to amazon to make sure i buy them new retail to give disney money no buying used you stupid jizzboy next youll tell me that you believe lucas had the full series planned out from day one despite all the actual evidence to the contrary or that lucas knew what he was doing
  its okay for lucas to shit on everything with a plot hole  retconheavy prequel trilogy and special edition edits  how dare disney make a sequel that doesnt count eu as canon and i cant masturbate to rose this is white genocide    cry moar you brainless fuck its nowhere near the tears youll shed when trump and putin are both out of power
  awesomeness  thats a funny way to spell losers
  s e e t h i n g
  waaahhhhh i hate george lucas and donald drumpf aaa afucking fascists aaahhh the prequels suck lucas had no idea what he was doing hes a hack bwaaaaabhlooo more diversity refugees welcome orange man bad aaaahhhh wahhh  yeesh youre like a fucking parody is there anything worse than a drone that buys disney products
  found the npc
    does anyone know when the preorder goes up for yakface
spitetheright    warning post will trigger miloanon    so i went on amazon to see what sequel toys were decently priced lots of reys in various scales 15 for 6 black isnt too bad but a bit out of my current budget what with focusing on a lot of necessities figuarts is probably better but its triple price and after they made pedophile michael jackson i wont touch their brand that fucker did it    finn is well boring mainly because his stock suit looks like something youd see people wearing casually might get a stormtrooper version at some point    rose didnt get many toys i was tempted by the first order disguise set at 9 which comes with a gun turret and 2 droids real good bargain but im not big on the small scale so i paid the same for the 6 rose looks decently articulated better sculpted than that plain body reuse ml trashwhich in hindsight has been awful since toy biz and doesnt look much better now with more body reuse than mattel    for all the this shit didnt sell talk i still saw piles of listings for potf2 and ep1 toys that noone can get rid of that crap needs to go the landfill too and fuck the revisionists i cant wait for ashens to do this to the altright whiner channels crying wimmin rooened sw  and wanting jarjar back        he likes the new movies better deal with it
    is capable of buying and reviewing modern sw toys criticising them or liking them without turning it into a political agenda    is probably triggering conservatives because he isnt assisting with their narrative    i know of another small channel who actually likes all the sw movies and buys the toys but knowing trumpets if i linked him hed be harassed for it
the only disney era sw figure id actually buy is l337  if she had a 375 figure with proper articulation    unfortunately you can only do pic related with the 6 figure
  i never saw solo not care to but l337s design is pretty neat to me i might just grab the 6 figure this week
tfw after months of looking target finally got in the gguard    i was so stoked i felt like a kid on christmas morning
  where is landos hole
  how does this figure stand does it fall over a lot
  that crap needs to go the landfill too and fuck the revisionists    i agree itd be nice to watch all the sequel toys crushed into mulch and destroyed disneys bullshit will be wiped away and nobody will ever ever care about rey
the vintage collection imperial combat assault tank is on sale for 47 dollars right now on amazon and it has 720 dollars off at chest out when you put it in your cart so its basically 40 dollars plus tax thats a pretty good deal im glad i waited
  he likes the new movies better  so hes a shitty person big surprise
already have retail release tarkin  look at ebay  sinposa has loose black series figures with no accessories  799 free shipping  i guess if anyone needs a no frills tarkin there you go
  
im selling 80 of my collection to a guy on tuesday priced low but saves me from selling on ebay wish me luck its sad to see it go but what the hell was i going to do with it anyway time to let it go and just keep my favorites
  i saw him and passed paint looked terrible now i dont trust online orders because you never know when youll get a crappy one
anyone griping over disney women blacks sjws etc is not a real conservative real conservatives wouldnt indulge in geek culture or buy toys these are like furry conservatives pretend wannabes that real conservatives hate and exclude sw was always liberalleaning from day one anyway
  meme instead of an actual reply    you sure can meme but its all you can do that and get punched in public    memes are as funny as bill hicks but less effort hicks was also a racist conservative who would likely be backing trump if he were alive he lied and claimed another comedian stole his entire routine which never happened because the comedian he targeted said that racism as a mental disorder then he dropped dead which no one with a brain cared because he was a piece of shit fucktard who contributed nothing only stupid people find him funny which is why hes such a big deal with the right
who did this
  oh i just got it     shes called rose because theres rows and rows of her toys still on the shelves
  furry conservatives  god damn youre stupid are you still afraid of furries in 2018
  kys pedophile
  t insecure deviantart furfag autist pervert begging for acceptance
i was gonna pick him up if i had some spare money and i finally did kinda wild though he was peg warming for about a month until i got him i was surprised to see all the tanktroopers go before luke although those were cardback
  i feel bad for this bitch shes an ok actress and didnt deserved to be so hated but that motherfucker ryan johnson had to make the worst sw film in years and have her be the center of all bad things about the movie most other stuff is bad but fuck she doesnt deserve the bullying she cute     i still told her that she was useless on twitter tho
  they aint got my balls yet and dont think itll happen in this regard
the best buy about a half hour away actually had 3 revans in stock for 20 each
i was gonna get aphra but damn if they didnt make her uglier than rose tico
  horrible shit character
  you cant give revan away now they shipped full cases ive seen him on amazon for less than original retail cost
    i like her tvc packaging / artwork so much better
  the damnedest thing the fact that aphra has no real life likeness to get right all they had to do was make a good looking face
    i think the bs figure does a much better job at doing just that
  tvc prototype looks pretty good so who knows how well her bs version will end up being
  did they intentionally design her costume to make her come off as an autistic child
i just returned the walmart tie fighter after regretting it the wings are much too large to fit comfortably on my shelf plus they pop out the sassy black woman at customer service said daaaaaamn this is expensive and she had to double check the receipt she said you kiddin its this expensive i said yeah i regret it thats why im returning it she said what does it do i shrugged and said nothing just a toy i guess she asked what i was thinking i said impluse but wasnt thinking at the time plus lying i thought it was half the price i felt she was a bit judgmental of my hobby but cmon hasbro listen to your walmart employees 80 is much too high for a tie fighter
  that isnt far from what she is shes a mess whos really disconnected from her emotions and what not shes sadistic to a fault and only recently developed some measure of empathy she may very well be on the spectrum somewhere
    it will go on sale just like tvc combat assault tank that is 50  off on amazon right now just wait it out
  plus they pop out  yeah they refuse to stay in the pod its a terrible design flaw
  the 6 is built off the jaina solo body and looks pretty alright      the funny thing here is that none of those images are by salvador larroca who clearly used an asian woman as the model he traced over
  this entire fucking post  no one even mentioned bill hicks you fucking autist not to mention everything you know about him is incorrect
  
  who here remembers when he was a shitty joe madureira clone and not a slightly superior greg land clone
  how is that allowed how does this hack make more money than me
  did you end up getting it thats not a bad deal i want to pick that up myself       question is this tarkin from the black series new      also i picked up leia today
    did you end up getting it    yep i did it will be here tomorrow hopefully its awesome i had to pick a pilot in the jedha revolt 4 pack i really love the combat assault tank and the pilots design        i did enjoy this comic series but i know the artist did get called out for pulling this bs its one thin to make a joke its another to trace something come on man
    shortwave radio fan nice i use  to listen i am also big into number stations
  ive bought from that seller before and wasnt let down it all seems like factory rejects
all i want is a force link quay tolsite that isnt like 4x retail price wtf
  what seller
eh ill wait for them to release a special pack with all the bounty hunters    in 2024 probably
  bruce willis
  i bought one at walmart a couple weeks ago
  walmarts near me havent gotten a shipment of force link figures in months if brickseek numbers are to be believed i was able to get the atdt and black series mimban stormtrooper but other than that its been pretty bad
  bought her today as well with a hoth leia that cost 298 yay for secret target discount
i just picked up the tvc combat assault tank and man is it a thing of beauty i love it so happy i waited until it was 40 dollars the detail is pretty insane now i just need the combat assault tank commander tvc
  i paid 56 or something after targets weird 25 off 100 coupon a few weeks back and im tempted to get a 2nd one at that price i have absolutely no need or room for it but that hasnt stopped me before
    i can see that its a really amazing vehicle i really didnt think it would be this cool but it is that being said why the fuck were they trying to get 80 dollars for it its insane
  disney sw toy bought new at retail to give a sale to disney  mp3 player loaded 100 with downloaded free music  handheld linux game console loaded with emulators and roms  ds flash card loaded with roms  gba flash cart loaded with roms    get triggered miloanon better yet put a gun to your head and pull the trigger    same goes for comicartistpro secrets thequartering world class bullshitters thunderf00t jontron pewdiepie and other stupid people who dont contribute or matter    anyone who believes piracy is affecting the industries needs an ink pen jabbed in their neck them theyll know what an important issue actually feels like for a change
oh and every bit of sw merch you buy gives disney money they own the brand now sticking with ot only action figures isnt cutting them out    you could just buy used but your supply would run out soon you could boycott the brand totally but you aint got the intelligence or the balls to do that no way
  awful late to be playing computer games isnt it sport hit the hay youve got an algebra test tomorrow
  you could just buy used but your supply    youd be buying better figures at least
  actually buying a rose figure just to spite someone they dont know
  we have to do our part to support our favorite progressive megacorporations so they can drag racist amerikkka into the female future resist persist and purchase
        go shitpost somewhere else please
tfw have a bunch of shit like the 2007 gold squadron ywing the 2004 xwing and the 2008 atte plus a bunch of others like the tie interceptor and i think an awing  the vast majority of them have damage  the frame or whatever the fuck it is on the ywings engine came off and is permanently bent  xwing has its weapons bent and im pretty sure the cockpit was snapped off  various parts are missing  god only knows what else i did to the others  do not have the original packaging for any of these anymore  get curious and look the prices of these things up  i wish i could travel back in time and stick a boot up my younger selfs ass for destroying those fucking things holy shit
    just get it loose or buy things you wish cib collectors are on a level of weird collecting that i do not understand the prices get stupidly high on so many things and tvc
hows the bs commander rex   really liked him in tcw but i dont really collect bs
  yeah 80 is ridiculous especially without a packin figure at least the tank is completely new unlike the tie fighter theyre trying to sell for 80
  is that some greg land
  god damn roses booty is bangin
  with brapattack action feature
  its fine if you dont like star wars but why take time out of your actual life to enter this thread and shitpost    if youre bored just do some push ups or something
  ill explain it to you from my perspective  i just dont like used items knowing someone has had their grubby hands on the product and god knows what they could have done with it or put it   yes i admit its crazy and autistic but i really dont like buying used  ive brought a few things loose and had to clean them properly but i still feel odd about them  i know id save money buying used but its worth paying more if its unopened and untouched plus you know it isnt going to damaged or broken   i recently picked up a cloud car from 2010 it was listed as new but when i got it out i am fairly sure it had been out of the box because it was filthy it was brown with dust and smelt i left it on the floor and still havent cleaned it i also saw some auctions for some of the cloud city guys who the seller had glued on the hats      it was fantastic its certainly in the top 5 or 10 bs figures they redid the arms so they could bend more than 45 degrees and could go right by the shoulders so you could get some very good rex like poses from him the face is pretty good as well wolffe was disappointing they used the shitty old arms that cant bend like rexs and wolffe came clean felt very cheap and silly when wolffe was an exclusive and they had the new arms to use     if you like the character and have the money you wont regret buying rexthey are doing the 03 cw microseries obi wan if you look it up and they have teased more tcw figures to come i wouldnt hold off on getting it if you want it because in a few months you wont be able to find him    also i hope they rerelease the 501st trooper because i want a few more
  its a staple of these threads nowadays  just roll with it
  not that it makes that much of a difference but it comes with a tie pilot figure
at last
esb figures are finally coming
holy fuck
  welp looks like im going to get my first meisho movie realization
  well that looks like shit
  at last weve known about this fucking thing for 5 years now at least theyre never going to release it they show off everything and shake their balls around but its not going to get released
  you must have shit in your eyes because this is the same response you give about everything
  guess hasbro forced their hand        for a second i was wondering why ig88 has a goofy fucking hat then was disappointed when i realized it was movie realization
  you must have shit in your eyes because you seem to think that garbage design is actually good im sorry you think fecal matter is a good thing
lmao what a piece of junk
  its like they knew exactly what i wanted hopefully this doesnt take years to come out
  hopefully this doesnt take years to come out  i see youre new to star wars sh figuarts
  looks like a samurai jack robot
  easy pass
  i hope this means and shf or model kit ig88 is a possibility
  no articulation
  whos in the robe on the left
  be honest what articulation could there really be beyond some wrist and head a design such as that is basically statue shit and nothing else       at last he has been shown off before the card states display only inclusion of a cloth cape does seem to indicate they have adapted him with the later releases using cloth instead of hard plastic which feeds into the idea of why do that if they wont release him that said id just expect them to keep him as the ultimate blue balls till near the end
bespin luke im gonna jizz if theres a bespin luke
  thank you lord for answering my prayers    no palpatine release date though
  when is it coming out right now im content with my model kit version
  sort ya nubs out
  is this better
  that is very very cool
    what a failure  looks nothing like her and the paint is too light but that just might be the lighting
noice  very noice
  not bad but too skinny hes supposed to be in winter gear
  statueshit gtfo
  could you show those phase 2 troopers in the background like to see if they improved the helmet
    more like 2020 for esbs 40th
  looks nothing like her  could be sabé 
  looks mournfully at the royal guard with zero articulation why could they just make his clothing cloth its such a awesome striking design and its stuck as a statue
  big improvement over that piece of shit jango they released
  paying 799  baze and chirrut are literally 5 at fivebelow right now
  why dont they use a cloth dress  i get that they have only recently started using fabric for capes but releasing a statue as a figuarts is fucking lame
  wicket
  man i wish theyd hire sculptors that know how to do cloth detail those look so fucking plain
  man i wish theyd hire sculptors that know how to do cloth detail and faces  might as well go all in if youre going to be wishing for things theyre not good at
  same terrible sculpt
cant wait to pose this holding his lightsaber with two hands like he did when he squared off against kylo ren
    while that looks great i am going to be sticking with my mafex boba fett i dont think the esb version can be beat
  day 1 preorder
  lame
  darn still the same shitty helmet really love the phase 2 troopers too guess ill never get the kashyyk clones made in figuarts
is there a articulated version of this awesome droid
  wicket looks great hopefully endor leia isnt far behind lukes cape looks terrible cloth is too thick and weirdly square shoulders at least i already have a better cape to replace it with    that dress is way too complex to do in cloth at this scale     how is carbonite han getting released standalone with boba fett
  medicom needs to get the ball rolling on star wars
    why is the towel not soft goods
  only thing that makes me interested is the articulated pouches im still sticking with the fetts i have
  makes me hope they do a grievous if they do that itll be my first purchase for this line
  uhhh no theres a wind up version that shoots a missile though
i need one of those figuart yodas to hit the market    still not entirely sure on crait luke love that figurebut strongly heartbroken with tlj
  forget it
/pol/ calls for boycott of star wars products  /pol/ then blames sjws exclusively for hasbro sales dropping    dont cry like a cunt when you get your way faggots
  same but i figure thats what eu old luke would look like anyways
     i hated tlj but i still want crait luke seeing how its probably the last and only way to get a older jedi luke
      what the fuck are these things and how do i get r5d4        i get that she bever really had a consistent appearance but couldthey gave at least tried to make the artwork on the card look like the sculpt on the figure
  there are no noticeable boycotts of sw toys theyre just not selling the billion dollar discount store clearance was not because of a /pol/ boycott it was because the movies sucked period hasbro will either renegotiate a much cheaper license agreement with disney or drop star wars in 2020
  never go full retard retard
  anyone who doesnt buy corporate merchandise of ugly women is mentally retarded  vote dnc
cd japan has figuarts mimban trooper for 20 bucks solo chewy and old ben are pretty cheap as well
    mimban trooper for 20 bucks    thanks i already have one but now i am seriously thinking about buying a second one its really a great figure
when south park joke becomes real          
at least its not those different cartoon characters shitting statues that europeans and mexicans collect or the entirety of japan having poop themed absolutely everything
  huh i never knew india was getting their own playdoh set
  wow what a load of shit
  europeans and mexicans collect or the entirety of japan having poop themed absolutely everything    india  amerifats feel embarassed of themselves
  found the indian
  
  stop eating with your shithand
  at least its not those different cartoon characters shitting statues that europeans and mexicans collect  i know thats a spanish thing do mexicans collect those too
  wait what pics ive never seen those things but now i want some
lets sell approximated shit to children  they love it  the jews are laughing at us
ill tell you one thing when i was five i certainly didnt think poop was funny and i was too busy worrying about my mortgage to buy toys
  this is so 4chan lol
  the caganer shitter is a christmas tradition its a figurine that spaniards hide amongst christmas decorations solely for shits and grins
the only mexican shitting figure that ive seen is this memin pingin i dont doubt there are other characters but this is the only one ive seen made un méxico
    shit is this years trend in kids toys
  anonymous  minecraft characters  aralechan  jesus christ how horrifying
  i dont understant poopculture
i saw this yesterday
this shit is getting out of hand
how about the poopsie unicorns
  holy shit   this is like a fake commercial from some movie
  pls make a gif so i can post it in scat threads on /gif/
  make magical unicorn slime with poopsie slime surprise with a little unicorn magic and sparkle you can customize unicorn slime and transform it multiple times when you gotta go store the slime for magical fun anytime poopsie surprise unicorn magically creates slime each time you feed your surprise unicorn and sit her on her glitter potty she creates surprise collectible unicorn slime     this is some poop fetish shit
  looked at a demo vid in an incognito tab and like  most change the baby toys you pretend to just dispose of the waste here you not only feed the unicorn it leaves a slime pile under its ass in a toilet and you play with something that came out of its butt
  jesus that really is some fetish shit i dont know if i really buy into conspiracies but between stuff like this and those weird poop/injection/pregnancy videos on youtube targeted at kids i honestly wonder if theres something there
  each time you feed your surprise unicorn and sit her on her glitter potty she creates surprise collectible unicorn slime    collectible
  their designs are horrible  the eyes looks great boddy is ok but then that weird mix of human/horse face
  can someone explain r2d2 to me
    what the fuck is wrong with society
  they find poop funny its the same kind of people that laugh at fart jokes
  undercooked toast
  they should have called it playdoo
          this woman reviewed both and the whole thing was a shitshow skip to the part she focuses on the doll she got red slime so it looked like the thing had a fucking period
  nothing its completely normal for kids to be interested in bodily functions
  its completely normal for kids to be interested in bodily functions  its completely normal for kids to want to play with shit     i wouldnt buy a kid anything in this thread at best its dumb gross out humor at worst its bordering on fetish material
  yes anon its normal for kids to want to play with shit why do you think they love playing with clay and mud because its a way to sublimate their poop desire
  why do you think they love playing with clay and mud because its a way to sublimate their poop desire    i hope this is bait if not seek help because a kid liking clay has nothing to do with them wanting to play with scat
  get help  any psychologist that knows their shit would agree with me children begin showing interest in messy play mud clay fingerpainting sand at the same time as theyre going through the anal stage of development when theyre learning to hold in and expel their bodily wastes on command this is when children begin having control over their bodies so poop signifies control to them manipulating poop gives children a sense of having control over their environment but since playing with poop isnt socially acceptable they use other malleable pooplike materials instead
  these types of toys generate so much fucking waste i get the surprise factor for kids and innovative packaging but so much is just plastic thats thrown away right after the initial package is opened
  negro cagon  shitting negro nigger  diviertete viendo al negrito haciendo popo jajajajaja  have fun watching the little negro shit hahahahaha    the fuck man how is watching a negro or let alone anyone shitting something fun
  nothing tops lol dolls when it comes to garbage to be fair
moms need to stop buying this crap for their kids so they stop producing this madness
what can you say about it  any qc issues  how does it scale with 1/12 figures
itll depend on how much you have to pay some of the ebay prices are absurd qc wise i dont remember mine having any issues other than the kickstand coming off not sure if i was hamfisted or if the glue let go other than that be on the lookout for windscreen yellowing    obviously all the logos are wrong because they skimped on licensing but your only other options are even more expensive japanese models
  if you have no problem with immigrant sure go ahead
feels good to have the genuine stuff
  it is totally out of scale as far as i know  so it is an easy pass considering the price nowadays
  totally out of scale  sure if you try to put neca or mcburger figures on it works perfect with shf figma revo etc
  i got a loose one recently no issues other than it being caked in dust
    it looks kinda small compared to the original
  it should be longer cause it makes it lool like that irl kaneda bike   it is too small in general i suppose
  saw it at a con swap meet years ago for 25 wish id gotten it then
  citizen watches  immigrant  jesus christ thats some funny shit
  mcfarlane made a deluxe kaneda  bike as well packaged in a box       the deluxe bike is a bit longer and the kaneda is one of the few todd figures that has somewhat ok articulation
i say go for it ive had mine for years the thing that pissed me off the most about the mcfarlane akira line is that the figures have limited poses and kaneda doesnt fit on his own bike for the last decade ive had nothing but gunpla sitting on it right now ive got the origin chars zaku ii on it
  i prefer hold on corrupt immigrant
    the deluxe figure sucks just as much as the original the crotch/hip area is made of rubber and it can hardly hold a pose without going back to the standing position i bought the deluxe set from a show for 8 bucks a few years back sold kaneda for 10 and kept the bike
i love this bike the missing and incorrect details are disappointing but the feel of holding the thing in your hand is heavenly tons of fun with it    i paid 60 for mine but that was with money left over after selling a whole bunch of random toys at fs so in a way it was free     the old asian lady i bought it from was nice too it was normally 70 but i got a small discount for whatever reason another cool thing was that her shop had the 1/6th scale medicom kaneda complete with the chogokin cycle in a custom clear acrylic box     that set was like 1200 i think good times
now i want to dig mine up
  but i want to put kaneda on it not some random schoolgirl and the kaneda theythe japanese company bandai  made is out of scale
  its a cool piece i really like mine aside from the incorrect logos something nobody seems to have mentioned yet is that its pretty hefty the wheels feel like solid rubber or something and they are weighty it makes the bike feel higher quality it works well enough with most 1/12 figures but anything above 6 is pushing it      man that bike looks really uncomfortable the slouchy position would hurt your ass after a while your arms need to be fully extended and it seems like the angle of the seat forces you to crane your neck forward a bit to see straight i got achey just watching that guy ride it
bought mine from some forums years ago for 15 with the terrible kaneda figure still have the gun it came with but sold the figure in a random lot     ive always thought about buying some accurate decals for it otherwise its a really great looking bike to pose your figures with for the prices some of you guys are quoting itt though i wouldnt suggest it its cool but not that cool
ign sucks but this video showing off a custom diorama is amazing the guy used the mcfarlane bike and heavily customized it with new paint and lights looks super rad        i kind of want to take mine apart and repaint it and add lights
whats a cheap and easy way to find acurate decals for it
  
  looks good to me maybe a little small but i dont think its anything to split hairs over
  may as well get the real one its probably cheap
  holy fuck there was a gali/alita figure  who made it
  
  i like the mcfarlane one i already have i just want decals also in my multiverse the chogokin bike doesnt cost as much as a piece of paper unlike yours apparently
just won it on ebay for 40 a couple days ago cant wait for it to get here did i get a good price
  no
  mari
    since that article didnt mention it the sculptor masaki apsy is the same guy behind figma and busou shinki so if the sculpt style looks familiar thats why    its nice that we have a figure of her at all but sadly its inaccurate to any one of her appearances instead going with a sort of weird mashup of all of them at once
  yes look at the other sold listings you made out alright id say
  i look so buffs
    it just got here definitely worth the money this is cool as shit
  choices could be worse
its a great piece really a bit over valued imo though but if you have the mcfarlane kanada figure they both go very well together my only complaint about the bike is that the decals and stickers on it dont match at all whats actually on the bike in the movie
  i mean what can you do it was a licensing issue
  short of making your own not much
so when are we getting a toy tetsuo with a turn into a meat baby gimmick
    is there really no service that can provide that i mentioned it to my friend once and he said that even using acetone to remove the decals would remove the red paint as well
      cant vouch for these guys just putting them out there alternately if youve got a decent printer you can get a testors decal making kit and roll your own the biggest hurdle will be getting good clear logo images to start with if youre not computer art program/artistically inclined     if youre careful you can probably get the original tampo prints off without hurting the paint underneath another thing you can try is masking off the paint around the logos with scotch tape and then using a mr clean dry eraser pad
  this wouldnt be so nervewracking if i just saw someone else do it beforehand because ive never seen anyone attempt it not even a full repaint or anything    i notice there are still other details missing like the bright green neon around the inside of the tire or some missing silver bits    if i go through the effort to redo decals id want to do the whole damn thing because im such a perfectionist ugh
  ps ill go ahead and rasterize these images for anyone that needs it itll be fun for me expect it in maybe a day or two d
  this nigga sent me his asshole
  could do a paint wash to bring out those deails
  ps ill go ahead and rasterize these images  vectorize rasterizing is coverting a vector image to pixels literally the opposite of what you need to do here
  oops thanks
  how much do you think this one costs  
here you guys go i hope someone gets good use out of these        fyi they are vectored images directly traced over pinterest user asshat smurfs bike logos i notice that various logos just didnt line up in various ways either because smurfs tracing was somehow skewed or logos changed since the 80s or maybe the svgs i got where just not perfect d    let me know if i should just make a version with the logos exactly how they are in the hopefully accurate svgs    happy thanksgiving yall
      thanks anon
  awesome stuff thanks anon
lemme know if you guys actually do something with them especially if you put em over a mcfarlane bike
  looks damn nice though is the figure actually good still need to read gunm/battle angel alita incidentally
  goddamnit that diecast skeleton looks gorgeous theres just something wonderful about polished metal
are there any other decent tetsuo shima figures other than the mcfarlane one
  theres 1/6th scale medicom project bm one otherwise i cant think of any other ones
  just the ones that came with the bikes pretty much
  ty i wanted to do something like this so theyll come in handy
  verenice
  ahanon
  noice
  shh dont tell em
only 90 bucks whatcha waiting for
  toes
  the guy is nice
  are those the new happy meal toys
  thats a man man
  im waiting for whoever thought 90 for two 5poa figures was reasonable to hook me up with a double dose of whatever drugs they were on
  whatcha waiting for  for my sides to return from orbit
  only 90 bucks  where
  the sad part is in the future these will be even more expensive
gee i cant imagine why op didnt make a thread bitching about the heman and skeletor figures costing just as much
  i dont know why op didnt just use the thread for bitching about this thats already up
  that sword  compensating for small tits i see    is the one on the left a scrawny girl or a boy that gets plenty of phytoestrogens in his diet
    that hank venture action figure on the right is pretty cool
  5poa  shera has to be 4poa that brick of hair probably wont allow any pivoting at the head
  5poa
  absolutely disgusting on all levels
5poa    lazy just like the show
  gee i dont understand why youre not in the mythic legion thread telling them how much money they waste
i thought this was hyperbole how in the fuck do these cost that much
  90  i dont believe you
  70 for both pieces of shit
  this is why god doesnt talk to us anymore
    neck 2 arms 2 legs and waist  5poa  4poa  man its like you guys failed basic math
  super7 can do no wrong
  my bad on the waist but shera is still going to have difficulty moving her head without her plastic hair obstructing movement at least thats what it looks like  still not worth the price
  so everything that toys can do with their arms is sieg heil salute and marching with their legs neat
  wow one extra point of articulation that is rendered completely irrelevant by the sheer bulk of plastic that makes up their heads but if you want to argue semantics the tail on catra probably rotates and shera clearly has a wrist cut so theyre 7poa
  is the neck even confirmed as a point of articulation if it is then the joint would be crazy narrow and barely usable because of the hair going behind their shoulders
  but if you want to argue semantics    these are basic numbers not semantics
  zhera
  cost 05 each to make by child slave labor in a collapsing building in indonesian  the high sale price is to fund lgbtqpxyz protest marches  facts
  6poa
  i am one of the few people who actually kind of digs some of the nura designs but fuck everything about these figures  i might actually buy them if they werent cynical fauxretroshit
  at this point youre pretty much arguing whether its a piece of shit or a big piece of shit
  fauxretroshit  they nailed that mcdonalds happy meal toy look though
  which era
  the catgirl actually looks cute shera would be ok if she were meant to be a trap but as is she looks tumblr as shit    both those figures are inexcusable for the price though
really hoping they hit clearance bins here
  whatever era you posted i guess
  i dont want to buy figures of little boys
  i just wanna ride my motorcycle
  and i dont want to watch sjw cartoons
  yes because its welldocumented how the profits from most toy sales directly fund political rallies
  i just wanna ride my mooooooootorcycle
  what is corporate giving and company sponsored foundations    you dumb
  making up a conspiracy out of nothing  calls people dumb for not believing it
  how when theyre madetoorder with an obtainability window that was open for only about 72 hours or so
these look like fucking shit    ive seen happy meal toys that are better holy fuck
  why biglots of course
  if these are official then will the happy meal toys be better
  they went up from 50 arevthe people whomlike this show really gonna drop that  also why do the creators insist this is for little girls  no accessories outside a weapon  no brushable hair  no extra costume bits  no sparkles  no playset  no decent articulation to make up for this  barely nicer than the awful voltron paladin figures for this price
  they are 30 each 50 for the set on super7 store still shit but you dont have to lie about the price
  500  5poa    so 5 at biglots in five weeks time for christmas
  the show is for little girls the toys arent i guarantee the reason the show runners got so much leeway with the designs is because mattel isnt planning on making toys unless the show proves immensely popular
just saw the netflix trailer her civilian design looks decent but fuck that out fit looks terrible
  waiting for elbows
  how could we have let ourselves get to this point we should have seen the warnings this could have been prevented
  having seen the show i have my doubts its for actual little girls teens/adults who behave like them more believable
  is right a boy crossdressing as girl
    cultural marxism at work
    calm the fuck down shes a girl but isnt depicted with a tiny waist and big boobs bunch of snowflakes that gnash your teeth at the slightest provocation     i guess youre super mad that glimmer is thicc and bow is black as well
  i guess youre super mad that glimmer is thicc and bow is black as well  huh i dont even know who glimmer or bow is why would i be mad
  no we all masturbate to ben10 in drag
  naw idiot she looks like a girl when shes adora but she literally turns into heman when she transforms     also glimmer  thicccc  you mean fat shes not thicc shes a tree trunk with less features
  nope its not for little girls its for 30 something uggo lesbians with a buffy fetish and who hate normal men so much they dress like caricatured lumberjacks
  shes a girl  dont assume his gender    glimmer is thicc  you need to have at least some breast to be thicc    bow is black  his design is cute also hordak is now a dilf good designs for lewds nucatra is also almost ok
shera having no tits is just bad design that and the shorts make her look like a thor knockoff easily mistaken for a man    this shits more like a jem reboot without the music than it is shera thats largely why its such absolute trash    but it pisses off youtube /pol/ trash by simply existing so hey its good for something not that such a crowd is hard to offend
  nope super7 which is why they cost so much because s7 makes high end collectibles for adults with taste in super limited quantities dont mistake these fuckers for an actual toy company     but really the same price as motuc each is complete bullshit and the fucks at hemanorg who lick this comanys taint should just die of cancer    now watch them break straight out of the packages and brian flynn ignore the complaints/shirk any responsibility for it as he always does
  says a hypocrite who probably owns every season of jem  the jon chu movie on dvd
  the jon chu movie on dvd  fuck that i have it on bluray so i can watch it in 1080p hd
  im super pissed the libshits are ruining such a fucking precious and important part of my childhood  sees characters from every episode and the christmas special  who the fuck are these guys
  dont assume his gender  super troll fail 100
  no they wont    nobody will be collecting these
  figures barely move    wow they are feminist action figures
  youre arguing like this guy is up in arms over this reboot when he just made a joke about shera looking like a boy he may not even give a shit about the series for all we know
  happened for tiny horse show
  the storytelling in the show is mediocre at best the animation quality is bad they try to overcomplicate the movements without putting in the work to make them flow properly i personally do not like most of the character designs the voice acting is mostly decent aside from a few characters
libs this is a redpill show both sides have fine people catra this wall whispering woods to keep out the horde we have to fight to defend ourselves the white savior shera here to save everyone
  hmm so where does ben10 fit into this
  whatcha waiting for  for it to drop into a landfill and forget the woke era ever happened
  wtf that spiderman in the center is perfect looks just like those old cartoon screenshots
  its sad when the original 80s motu toys are better than this at least each of them had some kind of defining fun gimmick like stinkor who had patchouli oil mixed directly into the plastic so that he smelled awful or manefaces who had many faces
  for it to drop into a landfill and forget the woke era ever happened  history will never forget that era because it was the era that began to allow the rest of us to have heroes and idols to look up to as well humanity is beginning to be more fair than ever and it will not stop    deal with it snowflake
  how nihilistic
  imagine being so brainless you can only look up to someone of the same race/gender as you    now thats racist
  the fucks at hemanorg should just die of cancer  ftfy
  im pissed that glimmer used to be a pretty enchantress and now she looks like a lesbian sack of potatoes with a stinky hairy puss
  just look at that character design and tell me it doesnt scream i lube my dildos with fancy feast because then my 12 cats eat me out and i feel less lonely
  patchouli oil mixed in the plastic  were they implying hippies smell bad
this is how you do cute fat chicks
  are you replying to the right post  i feel like you read a completely different comment  i dont think that anon even stated he liked shera    do you need a lie down sweetie
  was the era that began to allow the rest of us to have heroes and idols to look up to as well    do people like this really exist  growing up my favourite idols were optimus prime and nightcrawler from xmen    im neither a robot nor a blue guy but they were really cool to me maybe im not selfcentred enough
  that began to allow the rest of us    youre such a passive subhuman that you have to be fucking allowed to be inspired by something you bring shame to the people who worked to feed clothe and send you to school        this a great many of my childhood idols didnt have my body type nationality biology or in some cases even colour or sex        an ugly womanlet with a hygiene that makes pigs look sophisticated by comparisson at least you posted her earlier outfit
  you need to go back
  90 dollars for happy meal looking things  this is like hasbro asking 15 for their 12 inch action figures who cant be posed or anything and whose only actual play factor is for kids to use them as a blunt weapon
  based
its funny i like thicc/chubby/plump girls like pic related but these shallow attempts at pandering/body positivity are just pathetic not helped by the fact these cartoons usually have ugly as sin designs and aesthetics see 
  lets see  cat girl   meh   ben ten dressed as a girl   funny   overall figures look like hasbro made em
  anime is so much aesthetically superior to cartoons based weebposting btfo ugly amerifat character design
    this is barely even a chubby character though she has big tits and slightly bigger than usual thighs
  anime is so much aesthetically superior to cartoons  depends like 30s60s and 90s early 2000s were top tier too and dont forget anime has its roots in cartoons

  looks like an older version of an ork flashgitz gun from warhammer 40k
i want to say thats from the vacman factory a toy where you can make minions for stretch armstrongs enemy vacman
  i think you can see the gun in this pic

i really want a good cartoon popeye figure not this weird looking grandpa
realistic versions of appealing cartoon/childrens designs are basically normie catnip isnt it
  i dont hate the figure as much as i did in other pics interesting
  maybe mezco will reuse the body and give him a cartoon head and paint job
  they did it almost 20 years ago
                  10/10 i didnt know that they actually bothered detailing popeyes torso like that
  does he have a spotty ass
  this is actually really nice give it some more articulation some accessories and you got a nice popeye
    im honestly hoping that mondo might give a more cartoony styled popeye a go sometime
jesus fucking christ that realistic skin is disgusting
  go back to your street fighter thread subjectanon
  oh shut up
  that isnt subjectanon newfag
                poor hulk never had a chance    this popeye is awesome

  check site  this goblin shark is adorable
  and so are the waterbears
  apu apustaja is basically his own character hes not much like pepe as we know him
really really tempted but i also dont want anymore plushies sitting around my bedroom
  yes you should buy them all in the future there will be a global economic collapse during the us 2020 elections pepe plush will be the new gold standard
    they have a decent amount left 1472 as of this post
i wonder how this looks without a hand in it because its fucking rad
  why not pink
i would buy one but its officially licensed meaning matt furie gets a cut of the profits i aint supporting that twat
  cry some more snowflake
  baaaw he hated our /pol/ meme use of his property and wont support white power    calling him a twat when neonazis are massive pussies go figure
  im not a neonazi though nazis were willing to ally with mudshits admittedly with the admirable goal of wiping out the jews which somewhat downgrades them imo more of an ija guy the absolute carnage they unleashed on the chinks and gooks was spectacular and they still wont apologize for it based
  52usd to get it here    its okay id rather a helper pepe anyway
  hahahaha     remember this     now he wants some shekels

    thanks anon i bought the first 6 sets at full price now everytime i see one in sale i get it
picked these 2 up at walmart tonight they have gotten some halo heroes series 8 in since last time i went there
  the hazmat lab should be added i think
can someone post the amazonca link for the xfiles greys
woah woah why didnt anyone tell me about this exclusive wolf dragon
  finally found more info and a picture his name is thunderoar i dont have torchwing or the water one which i didnt want but eh so i might pick up that three pack
  couldnt find a link to the greys heres the link to mulder and the image description of the greys    
  the wolf head translates pretty well but why did they keep the furry tail    also i just realized my boulder is missing the teal paint on one arm
  they remind me of the late dragons serie years    i miss those toys and the universe in general it was neat shame it died just like pyrates died after that
  mega is still producing the chipped plate carrier
  i actually managed to preorder mulder before 2 although god knows when they will actually show up   no joy on the gray though
  chipped plate carrier
    i cant believe they didnt give makarov a proper suit maybe mulder will get one
remember anons remember how we thought we were going to get a full space theme
  why are we here
  just to suffer goddamn mega i know this were just concept pieces for their beyonder tagline but goddamit
has another wave of the halo blind bags been released since the first one with the buildable ship i need more ships lol
  no next bag serues hasnt been shown yet and it will likely be some months before we get another series     they should do a mini pillar of autumn next series or a covenant capital ship that would be sweet definitely need to use the chief mk5 mold in new colors in the next series
  remember anons remember how we thought we were going to get a full space theme   i knowi was sooo on board with this that i bought the space vehicle immediately it went on sale with the idea that we would be getting more in this line v disappointed but glad i got that vehicle when i did
  i wanted thosei was willing to drop coin on this megawhat the hell
    i wanted these so much   not so much for the bases but for the figures   ditto vikings    if they started appearing on ebay in lots that made me suspect they fell off the back of a truck in china i would still buy em   i bought the knock off motorbike as i have never seen it in the wild
  the figures in that line were actually super bland its one of the few times with mega that the sets far outshined the figures
when do we expect news on the infinity set i want more details on the little ships that the listing had
  nice what fabric is that it looks great
  its the fabric from the recon outpost cut and glued so it holds its shape
  right is chipped and theyve had this problem since the beginning
heres the other part of the fabric i brushed it with super glue
  those are 2 different molds the right is just a molle vest not a plate carrier
  yeah i dont at all understand what this guy is trying to say they are completely different one isnt chipped
    looks like im been wrong this whole time like a fucking idiot anyway thanks for clearing it up
third party parts kind of neat just heads and weapons right now    
  too bad the heads are not painted
series 2
  those look real fucking good love the griffon the demonic griffon and the black wolf especially
  whats the overunder on how long until some aliexpress chinaman knocks off these sculpts      being this much of a spoonfed faggot
got around to building the tmnt sets from 5 below mirrored the 2nd build though i may make some changes when i put it on my other desk display
  if you get the other el building set the two halves of it fit perfectly on the mirrored sets thats what ive got on this shelf
  i have that set but instead of building the other section just mirrored the main patt and used the extra pieces to raise it up
  ah thats great too
  even better than series one the griffons are a must have
  too bad the heads are not painted  doesnt need to be gaming miniatures detailed basic good colour choices no need to over complicate this citadel paints for this i reckon anyone have experience with choosing paints for something like this
  will never be released  joining hellboy in the what couldve been cemetery
  any model paint will work fine i say avoid enamels theyre usually really thick and require thinner while most acrylics can just be watered down a little
  dont you put that evil out there     well get hellboy     we have toright
  yes stores still stock the heroes figures just not any set over 10 serues 3 has started to saturate been spotted all over series 4 will likely release soon but take time to get distributed to saturation
  is it necessary to put a finish over to seal the paint 
  i have motor skills disorders thats why i want them painted
  i have motor skills disorders thats why i want them painted  sorry to hear if i ever get around to painting these and they turn out good i would sell you a bunch
  not a necessity but definitely helps some areas like the shoulder and elbow joint will scrape off no matter how hard you try to preserve it       i literally have parkinsons disease and shake like crazy some days so i can relate but just want to say it is possible if you stop telling yourself you cant do something and start practicing
  not a necessity but definitely helps some areas like the shoulder and elbow joint will scrape off no matter how hard you try to preserve it  any recommendations tia
  i use silver for a worn look or a color that wont show as much when exposed top coats will help quality paint is less likely to chip or peel    also helps if you can pop those parts apart and paint them individually the paint will hold better and you wont risk overpainting the joint and peeling the paint off when moving the joint
  you mean topcoat recommendations right    mr super clear gloss is the best gloss tamiya ts79 is the best semigloss and will give you the closest look to bare plastic if you want the part to fit in with the rest of your collection tamiya ts80 is the best matte    you can likely find cheaper domestic brands at your local hobby shop but they wont look nearly as nice as the above considering were working with such small parts a single rattlecan can go a long way so im of the opinion that you should splurge a little for the good stuff
  thanks anon
anyone have got these ko mega  
  i do that same set not bad not great no real complaints just what youd expect they feel cheaper than official and have worse paint apps good for spare parts and could be worse
  as i suspected thanks today amazon cancelled my order of the care package green building set because they couldnt find a source  anyhow when i saw these i was very tempted to make up for the tearsbut i got over itnow im more resolute than ever to get those green little bastards
  i dont know anything about the dude but i thought for sure it had a real suit too and was gonna try to make a john wick but nope oh well this works too
  even more things to dig out of that stupid slime    why
  sorry bud they have been hitting at walmart lately i bought a 3rd last night picked up 2 a couple months ago so theyre starting to get around    be careful getting the figure out the knee pads tend to tear when removing the figure
  cool thanks for the tipwill be checking the walmartwill be pleasantly surprised if they are available
  about all you would find they have the heroes figs and the care packages if you check the endcaps and back aisle you may find some clearance stuff maybe even in the garden center near the checkouts
  god damn it the kneepad on mine ripped almost as soon as i got it i was so bummed i didnt put any extraordinary stress on it or anything just pop there it went
space rhodesia
  its a defect all 4 of mine busted out of the packaging
     how the hell are you guys taking the fig out of the package i got 3 of these guys and 2 of the air defenders and the all black figures set and no broken kneepads
    the suit turning out to just be the collar painted on the existing button up shirt torso was the biggest disappointment since the templar leak never happening
  i cant confirm but my guess is that theirs got heated too hot during packaging the heat used to treat the blister pack must have dried or damaged the rubber of the kneepads
  the kneepads on mine seemed to stick to the plastic i have one pair because one broke one 2 and the 3rd both broke i dont really mind that much but is a bit of a bummer
hey how to mb/mcs stand up to repeated build/tear downs the plastic is softer than lego so im worried about the longevity of the pieces
  some figures have gotten a little loose but nothing that bad still holds a pose havent had any major breakages hands are my main concer about breaking
  how about bricks
  relax bro the knee pads were already broken inside the package as soon as the blister was removes the knee pads fell off they were not stuck to any thing
  anything from 2015 and on has a better quality it matches lego better than all the off brand ive tried there is an occasional missing piece or a malformed piece but nothing major
  some figures have gotten a little loose but nothing that bad  does that trick with using crazy glue ie adding to the joints whilst moving it around in the socket before it sets in permanently hold true herereferencing some of the hacks i seen on yt about the old gi joes loose joints issue
  the plastic is softer than lego so im worried about the longevity of the pieces  thats a good pointwe all know a lot of plastics will last for ages but given these figsi was wondering how long either the hard material and the more gummy/rubbery material will lastwe like to think our favourite toys will last forever and i seen that first hand with my siblings vintage 12 gig joeskung fu grip hands being the main issue with some of them but the other softer plastic like the head still hold true after 50 yearsanyhow im not totally convinced that the advancements in toy production material will be much better unless someone can convince me otherwise
  about the old gi joes loose joints issue  specifically the 3 3/4
  pretty much this the only clutch issues youll run into on set designs is when a piece is clearly in the way of a joint or just not as reinforced as a legal lego build
  it didnt break while taking it out of the package that went fine it snapped the first time i bent the knee
  that technique is outdated and dangerous nowadays we use pledge floor polish with future shine accomplishes the same thing but without the danger of freezing the joint in place so yes you can use that technique to tighten mega joints but you shouldnt use glue to do it
  that technique is outdated and dangerous nowadays we use pledge floor polish with future shine accomplishes the same thing but without the danger of freezing the joint in place so yes you can use that technique to tighten mega joints but you shouldnt use glue to do i  awesome thanks for that i would assume spraying a bit of pledge into small container and use q tips to apply inside the socket ie to make a layer inside 
  pledge comes in a squeeze bottle with three tiny holes at the top it has a runny almost watery consistency i usually squirt a little into a cup and then apply with a crappy old paintbrush or yes a qtip thing is since pledge is pretty watery you can get it to simply run into joints this is great for toys where you cant disassemble the joints however you will want to wipe up the surfaces of the toy after doing this since pledge doubles as a glosscoat and will make your toy shiny this isnt a huge deal its pretty easily removable but save yourself some work by doing it in advance
  where you got those rifle slings
  thanks again for the tips i am going to file this in my folder much appreciated
  theyre in every other cod set brown ones like in the op are usually in the wwii sets
  theyre included in most sets now particularly troop packs
  a man among men
  im relaxed man i just thought it was odd for the record iva had a couple scarves from the destiny figures break for no reason      the hands are an issue if you use lego or third party accesories i learned that the hard way you can still sand the lego stuff a bit to not force the mega hands      id go as far back as 2013 the moment they started with the new articulation the quality went way up
    oh i thought they were customs and was interested in them for 1/18
  this guy looks really cool
  thanks
  he looks fucking rad where can i find him and do you know the code
  its only in that blue three pack the post right above that one
  i make mega mocs using pieces as old as first wave halo wars stuff it works fine its the 2nd best brick toy after lego after all
  i havent seen that 3 pack anywhere whered you find yours
  apparently its costco exclusive in the us
my friend in the pacific northwest found the train set on the shelf at a freddies proced at 8999 so at least some new product is hitting here in the midwest we dont have freddies so i guess ill wait on amazon to stock it
  its on preorder on amazon mexico with a release date of dec 30th
  you can order it for 30 on amazon
  you can blame the death of tru they were the only retail chain that got the huge sets like that
boys i hate to be the bearer of bad news but hellboy may not launch
  honestly things are just not looking goodpretty much everything is being delayed or outright cancelled it seems
  yall panic every time this happens preorders on amazon rarely ever actually go through this happens every wave of every series and they still get released anyways    stop preordering on amazon
  shit never got cancelled at the frequency it does these days on top of that until tru dived there were always physical retail stores to rely on if they couldnt be found online no physical retailers even carry mega anymore outside of like blindbags and a few pokemon sets    single pack figures probably have a higher chance of being released sure but some sets have been in limbo for a year or more at this point
  preorders on amazon rarely ever actually go through  denial
    this has happens all the time im really getting sick of everyone freaking out over it while tru is a heavy loss there are still avenues to get mega     and is is true that the amazon prelistings are rarely the listings that are fulfilled they dont even have product images
looks like amazon is restocking on a lot of their stuff     call of duty hazmat lab armory and wwii armory are listed for 1299 and 1199 respectively     call of duty urban strike squad and desert air defenders are 1499 you might have to list all buying options to see those prices
  guess ill see if amazon delivers the new mantis to me bext week or not
  talking about preorders whos listings dont have photos  chooses a product thats already been released and has reviews
  they cancelled my original pre order from may didnt have the photo then i guess we will see if amazon get these in stock for 3999 really
  they have  
so went to meijer the other day and found a pretty nice collection of mega sets mostly pokémon and heroes but some of the heroes were hard to find and there were also a couple cod and halo sets also breakout beasts
finally found these
finally found the new halo heroes wave mostly picked clean but still     good thing i can always just make some new guys
aliexpress is currently selling mb halo weapons in bulk
  let us know if they ever do ac stuff  i can only ever find lego knock offs
  looking good five below right they had a fresh box of destiny heroes 3 if anyone still needs them as of this weekend too
im kinda bummed out today     start trading extra figures on instagram   make a pal there   do a few trades all goes ok  send him 70 worth of new figures for a trade   pick up a few things to hol for him  he takes months to send his trade never gets around to it  he died on the 2nd have seen the obituary    im out 70 and lost my main pal i chatted with daily
w
spotted these at ross also saw a few american girl figure 3 packs there for 499 so maybe check there if youre into making anime grils
  sounds like youre more bummed about the 70     hope he haunts you when you jack off
  i happened by a ross and a tjmaxx both had american girl/wellie wisher sets  hoping more is coming
  ollies had the movie garbage truck and sewer lair sets for 1999 i might pick up the lair to addon to the nicktoon one
    so what youre telling me is youre going to go to this guys wake and when no ones paying attention youre going to take 70 worth of mega construx figures from his collection  i think im entitled jerry listen ive bought from this guy before i fulfilled my part of the transaction he wouldve fulfilled his if it wasnt for complications  complications the mans dead george   we arranged this the week he died in some ways me getting these figures was his last wish his last wish jerry
  70 isnt much compared to losing a friend i can replace what i let go in time cant replace a friend       nah im not jewish so i dont pursue debts after death im sure his family has it hard enough as is
  i laughed      sorry for your loss anon
  jesus id kill for either that wow head or bolvars lich king head
  that was an unexpected ending sorry for your loss man that really sucks
  what is that green torso/arms from
where is my kratos reeeee
  did he ever see what you got him or is it still boxed up what did you send him that got him sick 70 worth of funko pops     is that what happened you sick fuck
  damn dude thats a bummer sorry for your loss m8 howd he pass
  thanks      it was unexpected everything seemed to be going good for him       not sure how he passed but he was barely 18       i sent him the new halo heroes wave plus a bunch of loose figures plus still have a box of stuff i was holding for him i hooked him up at cost and liked having someone to help find new stuff     appreciate the people in your life now never know what can happen our community has been shrinking rapidly money can be made back even the most rare figure has a replacement but not so for friends and family    on a lighter note 5 below restocked the drop pods
  im going to guess tmnt
  18 is young as fuck thats truly a shame im assuming you did not contact the family either way condolences anon seems like you were a good friend to the guy  that always freaks me out only in my mid 20s but just people randomly drop of a heart attack a stroke some freak accident like you said man gotta find a way to make the best of the time we have  maybe we should start a mega discord if one doesnt already exist im like the only one of my friend group that gives a shit about toys two casually buy but its not really a hobby with any passion behind it
  that is a shame that friendship cheered him up so thats what matters after all
  im sorry man didnt mean to be a dick my condolences
hey lads where can i find breakout beasts at retail in the us not super sure what the best place to look is
  meijer
  gamestop and target too
  is his collection up for grabs 
      itd be cool if he willed you some of his toys for being such a bro
walked into walmart for pie supplies found wave 2 restocked and finally grabbed a teela so happy
  18 is too young havent tried to contact his family i try to be good to people but im a dick sometimes too ha       i liked having a pal to chat with and got just as excited for what i found at ross as i did       its all good this place is for adult humor and shit       target gamestop best buy heb/kroger/grocery chains       nice my walmarts have had series 3 heroes for a while but i still find some s2 at grocery stores and discounters from time to time
  so i did a wash on this figure it really pops the details mega stuff is really well sculpted
which one of you niggers cleared out ever ross in seattle
    give them a matte spray  thatll make them look even better    everymattespraycomparisonjpg
have all this cool wow weapons  cant use them on any other minis because they are so thicc they even break the wow minis hands
  you could always sand them down
breakout beasts spotted at my local dollar general keep an eye out anons
question for my fellow monster high weirdos do the american girl hairpieces fit the mh heads i always get tempted by the ag sets but i kinda hate their faces
im thankful for being a pokefag because most of the mega stuff thats still left is pokemon    that said the releases for sets are still absolute whack except for the pokeballs ive never seen the volcano rivals set nor that 5 pokemon pack in person but about a month ago i saw an onix set at gamestop that i have never heard of before    by the way if you have the chance to visit mexico come to the walmarts/sorianas/liverpools/etc theyre fucking loaded with mega sets shelves typically have 50/50 lego and mega
  ye welliewishers  barbie hair are also compatible with mh
well shit got an email from amazon completely cancelling my wind raider pre order this sucks bros
  that amazon shit is just a placeholder until the hard release once they physically have something they clear the old placeholder and make a new listing with proper sku and all that shit
    i used krylon leafing pens on a couple figures and had some decent results too bad i can only find them in gold silver and copper
  hell yeah this is a fucking game changer thanks bud
i wish they would just announce if mega construx are done or not if they are id buy a couple of vikings ships as my last sets its the lack of knowing that burns
  thats the thing its not dead but its not alive either its just stuck in this strange undeath
supposedly manatarms and evilyn shipped this month along with the wind raider attack set anyone seen them
  nope still waiting on my preorder of evil lyn and man at arms from bbts and as i mentioned earlier amazon canned my po of the wind raider set and i dont see any real ones popping up
  product is getting designed and produced just stores are not really carrying anything if they do its only stuff below a 10 price point so chances arr most of this stuff will show up at ross in a year
  it also depends a lot on your location the hannibal mantis is showing up at walmart and other stores in mexico as is the destiny dominus ghaul mega is still alive and dandy its just distribution is shittier than usual but stuff is coming out
im having a blast with these pokemon sets    i was initially kind of hesitant about the terrain pieces but once you have more sets you can start to mix the pieces to make a bigger terrarium    i wish there were terrain packs out in the wild actually im pretty sure there are i saw a guy unbox an underwaterthemed set once but i have no idea where he bought it
  try  mega construx inventions aquatic building set booster  on amazon
  this is gold anon gold    anyways anyone got any breakout beasts wave 2 yet according to amazon the two i preordered have shipped
  thanks anon
dollar general has all toys buy 1 get one 75 off this weekend if you were holding out on getting anything from there now is a good time
  what do they have
  thats what i thought last year but ross is empty of bloks this year
  have the cod container bike and drone sets some halo cyclopses few hero figs
  theyve had tmnt and destiny pretty consistently halo and cod showed up quite a bit this year as well
  nice ill have to look i just got the arctic container at walmart for 9 and i kinda want more
  they have a red and silver container but only has 1 figure and not as many pieces as the others for the same price but with the sale it isnt bad you could get 2 for about 15 dollars
  also the walls are a slightly brighter shade of red but top and bottom pieces are the same as the other container
  thats a huge difference
  the only place ive physically seen the terrain sets is at kmart in fact i just saw some yesterday and that was at a shitty tiny kmart so most of them probably have them
  a picture
im loving the ww2 figs
    great pics
  great pics  dittogreat work
        thats an old picture too ive not taken too many lately heres some others from the depths of my phone
thanks guys heres a bside
  fuck man thats like a movie still amazing
love all these pics mega fans are truly the chads of brick building toys
  100 true honestly theyre both my favorite brick and action figure line i just wish we got more fantasy stuff
got my first two eggs from series 2 today    codes   fierceor winged purple wolf 253869tc   brimer black wolf 250867tc
  thanks     one of my favorite part of mega is how chill everyone is on these generals
  nice angle a suggestions if i maysame shot but with lights out and use some xmas lights the battery powered ones as ambient lighting for the back and/or under the flooring i got me some stati lights 10 bulb and been messing with some stuff and thought about sharing this ideasilly as it may sound
  very very jealous did you find them in the wild
  really dig all the outdoor shots reminds of when my older brother was doing the same with his 12inch gijoes
  nope amazon preordered them two weeks ago
  i knew there had to be a use for those mcfarlane sets now i might have to track one down
  i found a walking dead prison tower at ross works well for cod doors are sized right for cod mini figs
  i think my ollies still has a couple of these are they worth it its just the tower though the set they sold at tru had a fence too
  yes just the tower however the parts gray parts are pretty useful if you just want to use them as a wall
  nice post pics
so have all the cod and destiny sets that were recently announced been cancelled its a month till christmas and these sets are no where to be found not a good sign
  i dont know man im hoping mega can rally after the holidays
  who the fuck knows i dont know the situation with the cod sets but the two unreleased destiny sets the thresher gunship and the ghaul set are both still listed on the mega construx site theres no trace of the thresher anywhere else that i am aware of but the ghaul set is on amazon with a supposed release date somewhere in early december
ive been lucky to find some decent deals on destiny sets these past weeks im kind of in a hurry to get whatever i can before the stock goes out and the prices go up iirc theres only like one or two more sets to be released from this line  im still pretty new to mega stuff but i guess it behaves just like with lego
  the ghaul has been released in mexico people who preordered in amazon are receiving it
  people who preordered in amazon are receiving it    preordered it where from amazon in mexico or something because i preordered it the damn day it went up and its been delayed three times at this point
  yeah preordered from amazon mexico
  well its nice seeing that its actually starting to come out somewhere i just hope it isnt like the female dead orbit hunter and the fwc titan armory sets where it practically only comes out in mexico and they cant even give them away because theyre so overabundant meanwhile everyone else is paying 10x retail on ebay because they get distributed nowhere else
  well fellow american mega bros its been real its been fun id even dare to say its been real fun im sorry i got into mega so late but im glad i got to play around with it for as long as i did you will be missed
  yeah it looks like mega is dead that gaul set was probably the last set that was made before they shut it all down and they shipped them to mexico because thats the only place theyd sell    its a damn shame mega had incredible potential oh well at least we have awesome lego sets to look forward to like this shit house on a raft
amazon just charged me for the hannibal mantis so hopefully get that this week     mega isnt dead yet but seems retailers arent carrying it and with toys r us dead we are forced to get it from online really its less mega is dead and more the franchises are dead or in a lul cod halo destiny havent done well lately pokemon is still around all over minions has finally died off battle beasts are coming out and wave 2 just released series 4 of heroes is due any time now     conplain to walmart and target to carry more mega construx on their surveys may do some good instead of bitching here
    that mexican amazon cost  damn thats jewy
  and they shipped them to mexico because thats the only place theyd sell  people really rush to buy this stuff down here for some reason
  it went up for some reason on preorder it was 800 mxn around 40 usd    you guys are being overly melodramatic here mega isnt dead sets are still being released distribution is slightly shittier than usual but for newcomers mega distribution has always been shit always
  there seems to be a lot of mexican adults on youtube making toy hunting and reviewing videos perhaps for whatever reason there are more adult toy collectors in mexico compared to other parts of the world
  there are more adult toy collectors in mexico compared to other parts of the world  that would explain why that store sold around 30 sparrows in less than 2 weeks
  got a quick pic of the pack together
 what are those two hiding in the back
  looks like the fallen walker and the atheon sets
    yes the walker and atheon not pictured is the goliath tank    i just finished bulding the arcadia jumpship and im impressed with the bulding techniques they used
  found some sweet deals on mega down here in mexico last weekend probuilder space walker for roughly 14 usd
putting multiple joints on the cyclops was a terrible idea posing gets really wonky with them
  walmart
anyone heard shit about heroes series 4
  palacio de hierros online shop
so mexicos become the holy nation for mega bloks    mexicans are more based than i thought
plasma dragons or breakout beasts
  not at all im mexican living in mexico we didnt get mcx heroes series 1 or 2 we havent gotten halo heroes series 7 or 8 neither the newest blindbags or series echo we also didnt get the cod hovercraft any of the 3 nuketowns the ww2 plane we havent gotten cod heroes series 3 the hazmat container or the ww2 container we also didnt get the destiny signature cabal harvester or any of the 3 dollar general cod sets    we dont get a lot of stuff anons here just like to exagerate beceause 2 sets showed up here at walmart
is mega ever going to release this wave originally slated for july/august    i just want my hellbuddy
  jesus that whole wave is fantastic fuck
  the wait is suffering anon hell itll probably only see shelves in mexico
  trade you halo series 7 and 8 for series 5
  id actually pay ass rape scalper 3x markup for this troop pack
  i only preordered a t800 and this wait is so fucking stupid
  while the wait sucks id say the total radio silence is what kills me even more
  oh shit     thats gotta be a future thread pic awesome       correct its a movie raph i got him for the oversize harness but i like to use every piece of the carcass
ikoras head looks pretty bad i will probably give her the female viking head
  i only preordered a t800 and this wait is so fucking stupid  btw is this version different to the terminator genisys machines troop pack  i got this troop pack  amazon for 20 can
  i want my kratos maa and evil lyn
  from what i can tell its closer to the t800 with the slight wash in that pack rather than the three straight off the assembly line ones though i dont know if its a third variety either way its a great figure one of my favorite mega bodies
  oooh i like that silver build a lot what sword is that      i just dont understand why they didnt give these guys swivel elbows their arms dont seem so thin that it would be a liability
  what sword is that looks dope man
  the raph body works great for making orcs
  i just dont understand why they didnt give these guys swivel elbows their arms dont seem so thin that it would be a liability  ik it sucks but at least you know it wont loose its tightness
  from what i can tell its closer to the t800 with the slight wash in that pack rather than the three straight off the assembly line ones though i dont know if its a third variety either way its a great figure one of my favorite mega bodies  i got these for customizing my cod figs there is one version with a wash
  wash version head
  i might get around doing an acrylic wash at some point on the plain versions
  i might get around doing an acrylic wash at some point on the plain versions
  orcs orcs orcs
  waaaaaaaaaaaagh
  damn this is pretty cool i might do the same i have a bunch of boring cod guys sitting around gathering dust
  thanks hes one of my favorite builds im considering getting him silver surfers board too and yeah its a weird choice they couldve at least have hinges rather than just a swivel on the forearms the terminator line in general has some of the best stuff theyve done but also some utterly baffling design choices           fuck yeah orcs          those look fantastic all the terminator stuff looks better on the cod scale i wish wed gotten cod size t800s too
  and the sword is from the power rangers samurai battle pack with the translucent deker had to search a while to figure that one out    a bunch of the power rangers figs come with that sword with different paintjobs its very rubbery so you dont have to worry about older mega stuff potentially breaking newer hands either
  that looks amazing but your missing one thing  chrome
  this is an extremely aesthetic picture fags who underestimate the sculpts on these figures btfo    i only own one terminator figure being an ausfag sucks those headsculpts were amazing      your infiltration unit game is on point asf      is it just you making these orcs or a group of anons its genius
  your infiltration unit game is on point asf  thanks  d
  theres at least 2 people making orcs myself and     i havent seen anyone else make orcs yet
  a straight up spec forces teamthis is my bope brazil inspired unit
  when i first collected mega figures i almost got rid of the destiny stuffdont know why i got them in the first place but anyhow they found use when i saw what other collectors were doing with their bashes
  the ghost character in the other pic would have been an ex sas or delta force guy but i digressthe human in this one probably could do with a bit of terminator enhancements
  i havent seen anyone else make orcs yet  note to selfget some orcs to build some units with cod commando and terminator parts
  this is my bope brazil inspired unit  no madsen machine gun from 1916   fake and gay
some post apocalypse bros and a swat officer
    i see this stuff and wonder why mega bloks isnt flying off shelves
  fake and gay  jeez there is always one asshole lol
  it should be in the megabloks isle at toys r us
  it cant fly off the shelves if there is literally no stock in stores my area pretty much never gets new mega stuff anymore ive almost given up on checking    also i think there is very poor brand awareness mega has an awesome product on their hands but theyre not doing much to let people know about it when i talk to my friends who are oldschool lego fans about mega they always scoff at it they probably remember the bad old days of mega or arent willing to give it a shot because lego is so iconic to them
  oh and lastly i think the semirealistic style of the minifigs can take some time to get used to i know it did for me at first i was really weirded out by the human headsculpts by comparison legos simple and iconic minifig appeals to literally everyone its cute its recognizable and its really hard to hate
dont forget to preorder the 5 pack dont pay rape prices for five figures
    even the more reasonable folks at lego general still think mega has 2005 dragons era clutch while they find megas awesome figures and camo bricks to be poor design choices    shit sucks lego gets lamer the more licenses it takes on why cant we live in a world where mega has gotten so big that they have funko pop tier variety of licenses mega bloks kon and patlabor would rock my shit
  well shit i didnt know this was coming i just broke down and overpaid for skeletor and heman    speaking of preordering where would i preorder heroes wave 4 at this point bbts is sold out
kratos when reeeeeee  hellboy when reeeeeeee
  they list it on bbts as being out this month so probably no where for preorder right now they should be out soon thats probably also why the preorder ended youll likely have to pay rape for them
  borderfag here the reason many people rush to buy toys here is because we often get stuff after the us gets it it allows for some window of safety to find recently discontinued sets before having to look for them online toys used to be more expensive here but nowadays this seems to slowly not be the case anymore inciting more buyers    also pic related fucking when
  see i both heavily agree and disagree with the second part of what you said im 110 with you on lego getting lamer with each license it takes reason being im tired of licenses i miss the creative and obscure themes space police agents rock raiders pirates monster hunters galaxy squad ultra agents fantasy era knights now its star wars permanently for space capeshit and overwatch in place of agent/adventure themes fantasy has been kill and with harry potter they wouldnt bring it back to compete whats left ninjago and city in terms of original properties  i feel like as a culture weve gotten less creative and more consumerist if we havent seen it on a screen we dont know what it is and dont want it as much as i love mega i feel like itd be amazing if we could get a revitalization of dragons their pyrates line maybe a unique agent or super hero theme their own space theme but it would never stand a chance with how things are today its depressing as fuck but its how it is i just wish license stuff was kept to a minimum and creativity and unique themes were encouraged but most kids and adult collectors today only want their 75th deadpool and batman and something from the flavor of the month game
on a positive note breakout beasts are at family dollar for 12 the line must be doing good it keeps popping up new places
  blind figure   building set  slime    you know that hits all the marks for retailers
dammit this bastard on the fb group is making have to buy some wow figures off ebay i love these builds
  that goblin bandit  damn thats fucking cool
guys i cant think of a single way for this to possibly be useful but  revoltech joints fit pretty well in mega hands
  true based mega may do licenses more justice than lego ever can but their   attempts at in house themes are the best i still cant believe probuilder didnt evolve into a huge godlike theme incorporating history cities and space colonies
  ausfag here its literally the only mega construx product my big w bothered to stock got them 10 aud each hope this line sells enough to save mega
  if it fits hands itll fit stud holes too make mechs
  buy a shit ton of ko venoms and make flood mocha also do they fit into the arm sockets of mega figs
  they feel cheaper than official and have worse paint apps good for spare parts and could be worse  considering that option for spares the heads from the photos look darn awful only the masked commandoes seem to be ok weapons and accessories from this lot too   alsoi came across magma brickthey do parts for lego fans but the weapon packs appear to be compatible with mega figs anyone here bought their stuff  other 3rd party companies out there doing the same tia
  nice the story is set to unfold who are those 2 girls and what are they doing is the military in on this and what is sporks involvement
  sporks  spocks  damnsporks lol 
  what is sporks involvement  yeah i wanna know what sporks is up to
  i wouldnt trust any third party brick gun maker always make them to legos slightly larger hand size
  while i get where youre coming from im all for more licensed mega strictly because of how astonishingly customizable their minifigs have turned out to be if lego makes a licensed minifig ooh great you might be able to steal its head or accessories there just arent many options there with mega you might get scarves harnesses capes gauntlets body armor etc etc not to mention how customizable the bodies themselves are being that theyre composed of so many pieces and come apart easily any minifig release is a good release since it builds up your parts cache for more customs
mega construx is dead     no but seriously amazon came through
  the dominus ghaul set is now available for preorder on amazon     scheduled release date dec 3rd
  dont give me those feels man

the thread is slow but the last one reached bump limit after 44 fuckin days   post bionicles mocs concept art lore discussion nostalgia bait anything and everything   where the fuck else are you gonna go   thread question   from the rahi/dark hunters/other moc contest books which models were actually good
    old thread
fuck offff
  i liked tahtorak and ancient which won their respective contests it was neat that characters like darkness were cool enough to be incorporated into the dark hunter lore but the real cringe shit are the paragraphs some 4th graders wrote about their figures real donut steel stuff like my character was a former toa who beat five makuta in a fight but got fused with a rakshii now he doesnt speak but hes stronger than the shadowed one x5
  wasnt there one who could copy physical abilities just by watching for a bit pretty fucking cool power but the whole article was the shadowed one wanking him off punctuated with and i keep his girl in the basement so he never finds her and keeps working for me   actually that last bit is kind of a neat idea
  i wonder what percentage of that book was kids submitting their edgelord shit and greg embellishing the kids ideas with his own edgelord shit id be tempted to write the whole thing off as just kids being kids but then you have stuff like gregs serials and ocs which likewise feel like they were thought up by some edgy teen
  im willing to bet it was about half and half     tahtorak was pretty fuckin great really my first kaiju before i knew what kaiju were good times
oh neat i was going to make a thread for mocs only you saved me the trouble ive been experimenting with making weapons out of technic stuff this is supposed to be a smg if you couldnt tell
  needs a stock
  ah thats what it was missing when i first built it i wasnt why it looked funny ill see what i can do
greg is a hax  bionicle post 2001 is mediocre at best  i spent a little fortune in samefag toys with diferent masks and colors  greg is a fucking hax
  not a bad idea desu liking what youve done with the hero factory helmets its oddhf came in the shadow of bionicle which it suffered for but it introduced some real nice parts
  post 2001  so you only like the rahi and the toa mata    ill keep it real with you the people in this thread who bought six identical characters over and over are the same people who buy different variations of star wars troopers or repairs of different spidermen its a collectors mindset
honestly the worst thing that happened for bionicle is greg taking over a major aspect of the creative direction of the series he doesnt understand subtlety  usually equates battles down what the plot demands there is really no need for dozens of pages on character perspective  otherworld journeys nor is there a need for a scientific explanation for the reason every single organism inside of the mu is able to blink their eyes   i dont give a fuck about the league of shadows because they dont ever do anything in the immediate plot i dont give a fuck about helryx  the illuminati because they only appear after the fact makuta was reduced to cartoon villain notsatan is a joke at best for appearing threatening at first but then fucking off  dying whenever later the piraka have difficult to remember names  the personality of the honeycomb mascot the idea of additional makuta is rendered utterly pointless by the predetermined plot the gods making teridax the special makuta  the others just jokes at best    his focus on what is cool  why is not a bad one for a childrens toyline and he has made some good decisions overall like supposedly forcing lego to keep the original toa around but that direction lacks any of the substance really found in the earlier stories the why behind bionicle just becomes increasingly frustrating outside of the animations movies games  non canon material  spoilertldr i feel greg  lego took the biomachines of bionicle a bit too literally instead of figuratively/spoiler
are there any good bionicle discord servers
  no
  
deepest lore is best lore
been thinking about picking it up the neca version has its perks but it looks to mechanized imo not to mention the robo tier paint job it just lacks that bio faded out giger look the mcfarlane model has
  the queen is supposed to look mechanized all xenos are thats a big part of gigers look the neca queen is probably the closest figure to resemble the queen shown in the film if you are looking for accuracy mc farlanes always look lovely though and that set is no exception so if you like it get it it is not accurate to the film at all though
  the robo tier paint job  you mean the paint job the model actually had that they replicated almost perfectly     the mcf is an outdated relic inaccurate as hell and breaks like a motherfucker get the neca its a goddamn thing of beauty it is the queen alien representation for a collectionwithout spending a shitload of cash
  whats the lot of cash alternative i was rather sure the neca queen trumps all in terms of accuracy to original
  i mean youd be getting into things like statues and the like then
  i have both mcf is narrowly my favourite it may be stylized but its still a beauty      dont listen to this fag
  dont listen to this fag  why because im right fuck off
  i always wanted this red one but i could never justify it for having nothing more different than a color change and some tentacles
  the colors are not accurate to the prop or even the promo images ive had my mcf for well over 12 years and never had any breaks     so either you hamhanded yours or never owned one also that red queen is just typical necareuse and isnt accurate itself so its funny youd criticize accuracy
  the colors are not accurate to the prop  why do you insist on being so fucking wrong     and no i do own my mcfarlane queen still but dont bullshit the guy and lie about how fragile it could be
i have the neca my friend has the mcfarlane the neca is the more faithful piece but i think that the mcfarlane captures the idea of the queen better the neca may be accurate to the model but thats also a problem the model was photographed to look intimidating with generous angles and clever camera tricks just seeing it on a shelf makes it lose some presence on the bright side it does photograph well mcfarlane captures an intimidating look very well but of course all you can do with it are variations of that pre sculpted look
i think we are all forgetting the true best queen
  tfw well never get a preggers queen box set
  now there is a hole in my heart that will never be filled
  shes my grail ive loved her since i got her way back when and i just look over sometimes and just gawk and stare
  how sad
  shes a chalky blue with big black strokes of airbrush over her head its okay but in the movie she came across as much darker and the promos had a darker paint job on display    i dont know what you did to your mcfarlane but mine has survived just fine and i know alot of other people have theirs intact as well       im with you she just looks very elegant
neca alien figures are grea snap
  i have it the biggest problem is the lack of a waist stand because that ball joint is a huge weakspot possible breakage    however its a nice looking piece rubber neck and tail are highlights display base is flimsy and unfortunately necessary for the queen to stand up    even if it isnt in my collection the neca version looks like the better option
  youll be fine
 meh the red queen btw looks like garbage horrible sculpt design imo
 yeah she does have that unique bio organic look to her unlike the neca model which has more of a bio mechanized look
  to be fair the design of the comic looks shitty too pic related is a superior design
  shes a chalky blue with big black strokes of airbrush over her head    dumbass thats how shes supposed to look that is literally what the puppet looks like if you dont like it then you are the one with the problem youre using your incorrect thoughts about the movie to blind you
  i looked at mine and thought man todd couldnt get anything right and have had that thing in storage forever the neca figure is just perfect
  hhow dare you his is huh perfect
  muh shitty paint apps match a desiccated and faded old prop    left is what it should have looked like
  your comparison would work a lot better if they were in same pose now i cant form an accurate opinion since you purposefuly made one side look worse
  why the paint apps on the figure looks bad in a picture with flash
  its really not worth it id say get the neca but then i much prefer movie accuracy mcfarlanes was fine for the time but nowadays its a thing
  but it looks to mechanized imo not to mention the robo tier paint job  you seem to like the mcfarlane one better so go for it the tail on mine has popped off and one of the tendons that connects to the face also come off     theres also a revoltech and dont forget the classic kenner get whichever you like dont listen to us argue over aesthetics only quality/durability
  you lack perspective 5 years after we were still getting kenner it was amazing even if it doesnt hold up accuracywise its still a nice sculpts
does anyone have the knockoff version im curious if 1/3rd price is worth it i know knockoff may have stiff joints and poor paint apps but since the neca official version also has stiff joints and poor paint apps i feel like the dices may still be pretty similar 
  you lack perspective    bitch please the kenner queen was more accurate than the mcfarlane figure even
  kenner queen mother set was the more movieaccurate one regular queen was more derived extra set of arms large inaccurate feet short neck royal crest with more points and different shape
    mmuh accuracy    who gives a shit the mcfarlane is a nicer design that doesnt look like a ungainly proportional nightmare
  the mcfarlane is a nicer design
  fact i once rubbed one out to the alien queens feet pretty shamful fap honestly
   i once rubbed one out to the alien queens feet pretty shamful fap honestly
  yeah the neca is a like a long cinderblock with two legs at the absolute corner in nature it would never be able to stand mcf body has a more naturalistic curve that doesnt look completely unbalanced you can tell one is made to look like a movieprop supported by strings and one isnt
  the neca is just better entirely i dont know why anyone would want the mcfarlane mess its like a bad deviantart drawing
  hurrr deviantart    that doesnt seem like an actual response to anything i said
  everything you said is wrong if you really think the movie accurate look is clunky like fucking anything like cinder blocks then youre a despicable person with no sense of what a good design is    you would be the kind of person that ruins a movie because of your shade of preferences
  the alien is a movie creature with acid for blood of course its going to be unnatural
  getting mad and hurling insults    wew this level of sperg hey necanon      normal aliens drones look like they would be able to walk without a puppeteer
  hes right though your comparisons might be some of the stupidest ive seen on this board it also shows you dont have any sort of appreciation for the source material
  oh noes he prefers a stylized version of thing what a bad man who hates the source material     how does it show anything i own both toys id prefer if the neca tried for more of a movie look with darker colors than trying to faithfully recreate a worn down prop
  a worn down prop  how stupid are you it didnt suddenly change colors over time due to age it was blue in the movie and blue on the prop you not paying attention to whats actually on screen doesnt change that
  the autism is strong with this one
      oh would you look at that i take the time to actually be autistic and find images of the og puppet and the neca colors are absolute shit in comparison    btfo btw
  oh look at that it looks like the fucking neca after all just like the pics that already got posted earlier you moron
  btfo btw  i mean yes you are youve just proven the neca figure is accurate and she was blue in the movie congrats on proving nothing new
  oh yeah which ones the colors on the crest dont look anything like the neca like ive been saying this entire thread it ought to have been much darker
  are you actually being serious or can you not differentiate between blue and mostly black with dark blue highlights
  it ought to have been much darker  it absolutely should not have
  are you because that still doesnt change the fact that the neca is the better and more accurate figure
    looks like the neca fig to me especially for a mass market toy or are you really going to keep defending mcfarlanes grey turd
  your mind is locked into some autistic definition of better here i never contested that the mcf was anywhere near as accurate i said that the neca figure is covered in too much paleblue paint and that i preferred the stylization of the mcfarlane       so you gonna argue that pic related is anything like the coloration of  you please do i want to see you tip into full blown denial lmao      what makes it a turd can you provide any well reasoned arguments
  its poorly sculpted its an inaccurate todd mess its made of materials that rot away its mcfarlane torso joint breaks because of the weight of the front and again because its mcfarlane the paint is bland and adds nothing to the figure the only plus that thing has going for it is the hive victim but that whole set is best forgotten at this point    and no theres not too much blue on the figure you really will do anything to defend mcfarlanes past failures wont you
  your pic looks like an excellent recreation of  yes theres no denial involved it sure as hell doesnt look out of place or wrong
  poorly sculpted  poorly opinioned   materiels that rot away  verifably false friend mine has been out of the box for well over a decade  torso joint breaks  did you shake it like a naughty child or something again mine is fine   mcfarlane  known for excellent sculpts and paint only detraction against his toyline is limited articulation      good to know you cant differentiate between the primary color on the movie propblack and the secondary colorblue the neca figure flipped the order of those colors
  i preferred the stylization of the mcfarlane    why didnt you just say you were retarded from the start
  ungh me no can handle opposing taste you retard    btw i have been saying that from the start read more closely before getting buttblasted
  poorly opinioned   i agree you are    verifably false   completely true that rubber they used dries and cracks and tears away its just as bad on all their figures that use the material    mine is fine   oh right im sure youre not lying or anything perfect todd can never do no wrong but no its a common problem with the figure whether you want to admit it or not    known for excellent sculpts and paint  nope it shows with that todd designed queen time was never on their side
  why didnt you just say you were retarded from the start  i have been saying that from the start    i mean there we have it youre retarded
  not anyone in the thread so far but as a fan of the movies you can tell that based on the images here  and here  the neca is too blue    its understandable why people would prefer mcfarlanes as the movies portrayal makes everything look darker    not sure why people are so up in arms over this shit      but he did say so earlier like at least 2 times       do people really get so mad over someone elses opinion that they forget how to read  cant imagine how violent the world would be if you people actually went outside of your basements
  since you brought it up i actually remember back on the spawn forums people were coating the rubber on the queen and sleepy hollow box set with fabric glue to keep it from degrading as fast as it does and that was years and years ago todd was never good about picking good materials for his toys
  t doesnt even own the toy    its funny that you think you are qualified to speak on the its apparent problems took this picture last year still not sure how i got that broken torso to articulate upwards right
  are you subjectanon
  not anyone in thread so far  i dont believe this
  its understandable why people would prefer mcfarlanes    oh absolutely i mean if they have autism or are housebound mentally challenged monstersits totally understandable
  do people really get so mad over someone elses opinion that they forget how to read    pretty sure that this thing is the holy grail for some of buttmad posters in this thread me suggesting that it is less than perfect is a great affront to them
  t doesnt even own the toy  i do very much so i know everything about the figure thats why ive stored it away for so long because its shit compared to the neca release
  kind of like your autism over that trashy mcfarlane toy 
  the only autistic people in this thread are all the angry people who become so blinded by anger they cant read or their short term memory is obliterated because some guy said he likes mcfarlanes more      maybe you should have checked the poster count but whatever you guys like to pretend everyone who disagrees with you is samefag     seriously how hard is it for you guys to not lose your shit over differences of opinions especially when the guy backs his opinion    and i forgot the image i was going to include
  no see i havent resorted to shitting on the neca and throwing insults at anyone who dare prefer it to the alternative like you have been doing for some time    that really speaks to your emotional state bro
  you guys like to pretend everyone who disagrees with you is samefag  because you are you make it very obvious      it has nothing to do with shitting on neca youre trying to lead op into buying a really bad toy and you simply have to be stopped you have shit taste and pushing others into that same shit taste is just bad for the hobby in general
  you are trying to force op to buy a bad toy  you must be stopped  the fate of the entire hobby rests in the balance    holy fuck lmao its a discussion thread stop chimping the fuck out     if op wants muh movie accuracy then he will pickup the neca if he likes the look of the mcfarlane more he will get that it doesnt affect you either way its funny to me that are freaking out at me over this when you are the one trying to push misinformation about the mcfarlane
  chimping the fuck out  it figures youd be a racist makes sense
  lol nice deflection still ignoring my horrific racist expression do try to chill
    everything said about the mcfarlane is true however nobody is spreading misinformation there anyone that has had experiences with todds toys for any period of time know what theyre like and all the problems they have
  claiming that the rubber rots away is false though just like saying that the torso will break if you take care of your toys it will be fine im not even the only person in this thread that posted a picture of a good condition mcfarlane queen
  nah the only obvious thing going on is how autistic people lose their shit when someone doesnt share their opinion  like usual they also believe anyone who disagrees is samefag    and i dont even agree with that guy about his preference for hte mcfarlane figure im just pointing out that people have different opinions and specifically pointing out that the neca figure isnt painted that well because they overdid it on the blue spray apps and created a sloppy mess
  claiming that the rubber rots away is false though  no its very real how can you claim to be a toy collector of any kind and not know this that eras rubber does not last and its kind of disturbing that you would flat out lie like that if you really want the op to make an informed decision thats a big part of it and yes the torso joint is weak by design again not misinformation
  how can you say these things    because its sitting in my room as i type this and has been here for years and years heres another picture from a christmas ago tell me where you see the rotting rubber or broken torso    im sure this anons is fine too    you are trying to force your preconceived notions on a guy who actually has the toy and doesnt have those problems its not gonna work
  my anecdotal view on the matter  anyone elses anecdotal view    as someone who collects a bunch of toylines i dont find mcfarlanes old stuff to be any more susceptible to rot than others that said his figures werent anymore durable than other collector lines at the time so if you only collected hasbro/mattel stuff during that time your opinion on the matter would be highly colored
    this interests me i used to have the mc farlane when i was younger loved it a lot but it did eventually break on me via neck rubber deterioration its head one day just popped off now i will admit that i did try to take advantage of its limited mobility and as i hope we all can agree mcfarlane was not made to be moved did you who own it and have no damage ever try to change its positioning a little what about you guy who had it break
  guy who posted the last pic here i dont mess with either queen very much maybe like two or three times a year just to clean the dust off adjust the pose or move them    any action figure that needs a stand to stay upright is basically a stactionfigure and they are alot less fun and free to pose than those that dont i basically use them as display peices or at the center of other alien toys/diorama
  soft materials will always degrade quicker they are more susceptible to the elements in the air and their environment due to how things work on the atomic level they absorb more of their surroundings by being a softer material
  wow seeing them like this the mcfarlane looks much better
    release date 2003    well its been fine for 15 years and counting anon lots of toys have a shorter lifespan than that well see how the neca is holding up a decade from now
  no they dont    only certain materials degrade quicker like natural rubber and foams but most are dependant on various factors  probably the reason why people seem to break their mcfarlane figures is just because the paint settles over time and with heat it will expand and stick so when they move a joint they break it most toys with hard plastics dont have the paint jobs that mcfarlane toys do so theres usually no issue with the paint being affected by heat/dust    besides if it was the plastic rotting the surface would show visible signs the joints arent as exposed to light air and even heat like the surface will  so there would be cracking leeching blooming etc noticeably all over the figure before a joint would start to rot    see pic in how a joint would get protected simply by being inside and not on the surface
  the neca really benefits from certain angles people who keep citing its accuracy to the prop dont understand that works against it the prop was never filmed at the angle you see in that pic in that lighting
tbf the one neca figure i have has a really nice paint job and the sculpts themselves are often really impressive and makes it worth it regardless
  no they dont  yes they do that is a fact
  the mcfarlane looks much better  hahahahahah youre pathetic but sure keep up your baiting its adorable
  i dont find mcfarlanes old stuff to be any more susceptible to rot than others    i do in fact ive noticed their plastics crumble much easier over time too early wave stuff especially ive gone through a couple poachers to cobble together one thats still intact mcfs materials are garbage they didnt even hold together for the time i remember having to replace my movie maniac ash figure because that figure would break every chance itd get god bless kb toys for still being around at the time though    i loved mcfarlane toys though and i still love my dragons but those things are ticking time bombs if they arent already glued together
 absolute seether up there
  are you the same nut job that thinks clear plastics dont degrade too the one that ruins the dc threads
  sounds like youre just hamhanding that shit if you broke it within days to be able to return it to kb    see   if theres no visible rot then the joint isnt degraded either because thats one of the last places to be affected by degradation     this is a fact
  sounds like youre just a mcfarlane apologist thats trying to ignore every problem theyve ever had for decades theres a reason the joke ran around the spawncom forums that they should just include a tube of super glue with their figures
  read what i said   that said his figures werent anymore durable than other collector lines at the time so if you only collected hasbro/mattel stuff during that time your opinion on the matter would be highly colored    stop pushing your childhood anecdotal evidence as a fact because you already said you broke that shit within days of owning it    again if your toy were degraded the surface of the figure would be showing signs of it everywhere if your toy looked fine and you broke it guess what    be more careful next time tard
  hey fucknut why dont you pull todds balls out of your mouth for a little bit and realize it has nothing to do with hamhanding or whatever bizarre blaem you try to place on those that own the toys its not anecdotal evidence either mcfarlane toys has that reputation and always has for a reason     pegs and arms and legs and wings and rotted rubber its all because of what they used
  wait what are we all going to revise history here mcfarlane toys has always had bad qc are you 15 or something i still have a ton of spawn but lets not kid ourselves here it was general advice in the day to handle them with kid gloves
    not him but you got anything to back up your posts besides spastic hostility so far the only mcfarlane figures posted in this thread have had none of those issues ive already googled mcfarlen queen rubber rot and not found any images or complaints     how about you prove the shit you keep spewing
    oh god can you autists stop getting so angry that you cant read or obliterate your short term memory    everything was said in that post
  oh im sorry did i step on your balls todd poor thing     anyway certainly youre welcome to dig up the spawn forums using the wayback machine and its probably not showing up online because people dont buy this shit anymore so of course its going to be harder to find anyone talking about it and theyre sure not reviewing these figures    the sleepy hollow box set had a lot of problems too the horse reigns tail and especially the horsemans legs that stuff cracked and comes apart even if left in package you have to treat it with fabric glue or else
  i have nothing  yeah i didnt really think so you supposedly own it too but i guess you cant be bothered to show us yours       heres another cool frontal shot edited up by somebody
  you make a lot of claims but theyre nothing but anecdotal half remembered bullshit from your childhood  if people did break their stuff on the spawn forum its still anecdotal if its not anecdotal the issues would be wide spread and seen on nearly everything    a few someones just posted their queen figure that is older than every single post youre talking about and wheres the signs of the plastic rotting    heres a 3 decade old toy made of super rubbery plastic that i took a picture of right now wheres the blooming wheres the pitting the plastic hasnt even discolored    still almost as good as new because youre full of shit very few toys actually age poorly because of new plastic techniques that started being used to prevent bad degradation since the 90s
  its packed away in boxes i have the neca one on display you know because its better
  very few toys actually age poorly  oh now youre the one thats full of shit
  you can see it on the queens mandible tendons quite clearly thats exactly where it starts     theres amazon reviews of the queen talking about how easily she breaks too but right everything that isnt yours is anecdotal the issues were widespread hell theyre still a problem today watch robos fwoosh video on the fortnite figure and he even talks about mcfarlane toys breaking on him
god this brings back memories heres my queen though this is an ancient photo by this point i think i took this just before we were getting ready to move but this was my little area long long ago needed to dust better    anyway good for the time extremely outdated now op i wouldnt bother with it its been done so much better by neca and might i add the opening jaws and interchangable tongue are worth going with the neca all alone youre able to create some really magnificent looks that way people thatre saying she looks like this or that because of the design are nimrods the figure has a surprisingly nice range of motion and you really can get her into some nice poses even with the stand
  oh this also reminds me on the subject of mcfarlane qc the matrix sentinel that thing was a gigantic piece of shit i think every fucking jointed claw on that thing came off right out of the package and one of the arms fuckin hell mcfarlane oh and the apc from the matrix line was another notorious fragile junkheap i think every single thing on that toy broke for people
    still waiting for that proof to show me how universal the issue is    one review on amazon  anecdotal  you basically need to have everyone who owns the toy to have the same problem to say its not anecdotal thats thousands/hundreds of people in one place not just two of you who heard it from someone that saw it long ago    go through ebay and see all the listings of people selling their queens mint in its box  check pic to see something thats actually common and seen as universal and this is while it is still being mint on card
  you can see it on the queens mandible tendons quite clearly thats exactly where it starts     oh yeah which pic       bro its pointles to go down this road because im one google search away from dozens if not hundreds of pictures of broken defective neca figures    necas history of qc is less than stellar
everyone is talking about the queen but here i am wondering how good chest bursting human is if i am a man of means should i get it just for the person
    its a nice little diorama piece theres a lever on the back to push the chestburster in and out and the green slime is actually slightly translucent plenty of sculpt and paint all over    mines dusty as hell
  bro its pointles to go down this road  then post them you stupid faggot you want to turn this into a console war do it i dont give a fuck this has nothing to do with neca other than them making a better figure youre completely batshit if you think mcfarlane is spotless because theyre even worse
im glad everyone hates the mcfarlane model that means i should be able to pick one up for cheap    it looks incredible
  it looks incredible    nah
  weird because you are the one who cant seem to shutup about all these ancedotal memories you have of broken mcfarlane this and rotted mcfarlane that not that youve posted up any actual pictures this entire time       i hope you arent still trying to convince op to go down the right path because its obvious to everyone but you how much of a hissyfit you are throwing i dont resent anyone for preferring the neca queen why are so assblasted when its the other way around
  youre completely batshit if you think mcfarlane is spotless because theyre even worse  youre completely batshit if you think mcfarlane is spotless  implying anyone has said mcfarlane is spotless  sure is batshit insane poster who is making shit up because hes angry someone doesnt agree with him    its pretty clear his insinuation is that people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones not everything is perfect and no one is pretending one or the other is well other than you insane people losing their shit because someone said they like the mcfarlane alien queen more than necas
  id say its more weird to make threats to google up broken toys as if that makes another companys broken toys not exist somehow youre bizarrely defensive about todd mcfarlane toys you would shitpost with that anon back and forth all day long and prove nothing except youre both complete dumbasses youre just waving your dick around and nobody is impressed
  thats pretty darn cute i might just have to pull the trigger now
  threats   lol    youre bizarrely defensive about todd mcfarlane toys  lolx2    all ive done is dispute the assertions made in this thread with actual evidence to back my claims likewise ive asked some posters here to provide proof of their own claims and they have nothing to show for it    i have maybe 5 or 6 mcfarlane toys including my queen i dont really care about them nowadays since ive ascended beyond domestic toys to be an importfag
  if youre talking about me posting something that is genuinely known for breaking by posting that gi joe its to give you a clear example of what anecdotal isnt objective and common place   its extremely common to find that shit and almost everyone who owns the older gi joes has had the rubberbands rotted out    as opposed to the very anecdotal claims that the plastic on mcfarlane is known for rotten yet no proof is offered just stories of what they heard or seen and not even photographic proof of the plastic degrading    theres nothing bizarre to call someone on their bullshit on the internet    if something is common there should be many many examples like this photo showing how the band no longer holds its shape because of the degradation of the rubber
  yeah mines still good at worst there is some dust stuck in the indentions of the crest but otherwise the rubber is a ok
  i agree with you man ultimately what makes a toy worth buying is what you think of it if you want movie accuracy or just something that looks cool to you it shouldnt matter what anyone else thinks    i personally like the mcfarlane stylized look more but i wish it were as posable as the neca
the queen is a shit design and james cameron shat all over giger and scotts work with his shitty vietcong ants movie
  boy the mcfarlane shills are going full force todd must be spending those fortnite bucks to salvage his name
  right there you prove that rubber rots and breaks over time the same happens with mcfarlanes rubber use    a review on the sleepy hollow set from oafe  a skullbearing tree its twisted limbs forming a rear wall for the base is rooted on the right and there are several pegs for the horses hooves scattered about that is actually a good thing since the pegs keep breaking off     weak pegs are not this sets only shortcoming long after supplies were exhausted and the movie was out of theatres fans started to report cases of rot  the pvc used for the horsemans legs was crumbling and falling apart leaving figures with exposed frames for knees everyone was understandably upset even the guys behind the scenes at mctoys
  on the other hand those orings can be easily replaced with stock bands theyre a common size if the specific molded rubber on other toys fails then its gone forever    i dont know about the alien queen but mattels staypuft which is nowhere near as old is already falling apart and the infaceables line is impossible to collect mint new because their faces are long gone
  so you keep on posting anecdotal evidence not even photographic proof and youre talking a specific toy released 3 years before the alien queen  nice  heres a review made 10 years after the oafe review   heres one 3 years lateri n hd   heres one nearly 20 years after the toy came out     want to see my anecdotal evidence of mcfarlane rubber not rotting going into its 3rd decade of existing check out   i have 3 or 2 more where he came from    rubber rots but these arent rubber theyre silicon or some other rubbery plastic that got treated to withstand aging not everything is made the same not even within the same company where plastic formulas can change from year to year and even wave to wave   even then how good or poorly it ages depends on how its stored heat air moisture and other shit will cause shit to age faster and even then shit wont age evenly like some of my 80s joes have snapped while others have not despite being stored in the same plastic tubs but theyll all snap eventually    and that stay puft thats foam right foam is worse than rubber when it comes to aging
  that got treated to withstand aging  yeah too bad they dont withstand aging at all
nig
  i found her way back when in a gamestop reduced bin for 10 shoulda grabbed the second one but only had 15 on me at the time
  my biggest gripe with that thing is the lack of leg articulation that aside shes pretty beautiful and i kinda want her i still want the neca version but the queen is my favourite movie monster ever so i dont mind having more than one figure of her i still want the tiny revoltech as it looks gorgeous despite being out of scale with everything    i will say if their alien turns out like their robocop i would totally splurge for a mafex queen
  nigga wat    giger himself adored the queen and went on record saying that it was pretty much how he would have designed it
  are they still arguing about which one of us is the better queen deborah  it certainly looks that way joanne it certainly does anyway how about some tea  thatd be grand though i might wait until olive and margaret get here they should only be a few minutes
  yeah its missing some joints but considering the stands they both need i dont find it makes a huge difference    im not sure how mafex would really be able to improve better paint maybe if they did a stylized upright queen able to stand on both legslike pic related from avp extinction id be all for it
  in an ideal world a mafex would have slightly more accurate paint necas looks nice but the blue is a smidge pale at least from what photos ive seen better range and build quality on the joints i know the queen is one of the safer neca figs but i still fear for them and possibly a better stand with heavyduty joints rather than a fixed rod also maybe an actual extending inner mouth rather than swappable pieces    what id give my firstborn for though is a proper update to the kenner flying queen if neca made that i dont know if i could resist i still want the mantis but the cheapest i can find him for is like 3540
  but that just sound like a modded neca id prefer something different than more movie accuracy and another figure that cant be left standing on its own just imo of course     btw heres a nice custom i found of someone who fixed necas paint     
  thats pretty cool personally id give the parts a light coat of tamiya clear blue or something similar to darken and also enrich the blue paint
  fixed  there was nothing to fix in the first place thats a terrible custom job anyway
  fuck off necanon the alien queen is a nice looking figure but the blue is too pale its not perfect accept it
  avp extinction  excellent taste
  pc rerelease never 
  the color is nice but i dont like the shine
  piss off with your bullshit nicknames its not too pale and its not perfect but its a shitload better than that
  it is too pale though it should be a lot richer and darker the neca queen looks fantastic and its probably the best queen well get for a while but theres no doubt they got the colour wrong    ironically enough the teeny tiny revoltech probably got closer with the colours than the mcfarlane or the neca
  theres no doubt they got the colour wrong  not him but they didnt really get it wrong so yeah theres doubt
  thats just because you are willfully ignoring the evidence its already been proven that the movie queen was much darker
ayy look what just showed up
  best figure posted itt
  no retard its been proven that it was blue and you were wrong this whole time
so in conclusion neca queen is the best and mcfarlane one sucks
  look at the photos showing the prop pieces  the alien queen is blue but necas is heavy handed in how much blue it got hence looking lighter than the prop pieces
  so are you really that autistic
  anon its got more black than blue just let it go
  if you follow necanons advice sure just get the one that you prefer
nuke this thread from orbit
  this looks like fucking star craft zergs  stop ruining what was not broken fucking christ
  why
  its the only way to be sure
  then theres no other answer than the neca one thats just the fact of the matter mcfartards are the worst
  youve shown yourself to be the worst with the sheer amount of seething and asspain in this thread all over somebody preferring a different figure
cool
woah
  i personally prefer the mcfarlane queen looks more believable the queen in the movie looks the way it does in order to get it to move if they could have made it look more organic they probably would have but were constrained by the tech at the time the mcfarlane has the believability factor neca is based on the film which had a spotty torso design from the beginning
  you dont even like the movie do you god you people suck
  cant comprehend others points of view   calls other people autistic
  youre showing your burning autism by bitching about an old post someone made
just end this thread its purpose was completed by the first few replies there is no need to talk further
  who cares if its old im not even bitching just pointing out the clear lack of selfawareness in that post
  no youre picking fights because thats all you know how to do
  what exactly do you think youre doing now
    you two deserve covenant
  youre embarrassing yourself
  look at you picking fights because its all you know how to do
  doesnt work when youre the instigator
  responding to someone slinging insults makes you the instigator
  mccfarlane version is sculpted wrong and painted wrong mcfarlane version has hands that are posed in such a way that it only works in 34 diferent poses necas feet are more poseable and look better in a wider range of poses as are the legs the neca is also much glossier which makes it show up even in the darkest corners of your toy shelves wheras the mcfarlane just sortve disappears unless brightly lit the vestigial arms are nicer on the mcfarlane but thats about it
  yes youre correct one was made movie accurate in paint and sculpt one was just the macfarlane team just making another monster they didnt care enough about to keep true to source by all mean buy whichever one you like but its obvious that you dont like the authentic alien queen design so buy the macfarlane one but the points youre raising are utter nonsense and all stem from i dont like the source material so stop arguing that the source material is bad and go buy your 400 spawn toy loosely based on the alien queen and shut up about it
  reeee how dare you prefer something else you must hate the source materiel    cool strawman spazo but we been through this dumb shit already
mcfarlane master race reporting in
  ive looked at the neca a few times but just seems awkward somehow
  because youre full blown retarded its not awkward it can actually pose unlike the mcfarlane mess
  it looks skinny as fuck earier posters were right its too accurate watch the making of docs the crew were all shitting themselves it looked bollocks til they saw all camerons smoke  mirror tricks to make it work
  its too accurate  kek holy fuck youre absolutely mental i didnt think it was possible to be this stupid
  this post
    nice arguments  same fagging look im sorry youre butt hurt you wasted your money
  also the fucking pole looks shite
  wasted your money  no thats you buying mcfarlane toys im afraid theres no reason for an argument even the fact is that the neca figure is better      aw boo hoooo id rather have a pole than having that shitty warped base on the mcfarlane at least the neca queen can stand on her own too
  no thats you buying neca toys im afraid theres no reason for an argument even the fact is that the mcfarlane figure is better
   thats you buying mcfarlane toys im afraid theres no reason for an argument even the fact is that the neca figure is better  ftfy
  no thats you buying neca toys  being a total faggot im afraid theres no reason for an argument even the fact is that the mcfarlane figure is better  that you are a total faggot  ftfy
      this is truly amazing to think that one person is capable of arguing with himself this long
  nah it was real just thought it was funny to keep it going he quit to easily   fact kekekek
  why would you admit to the fact that youre a total fucking retard

so you guys smoke a lot of weed then post about glyos got it
  dude thats a breakthrough    i gotta start getting high before i build
    i wish more people in glyos/adult collectible community smoked    building shit and posing is incredibly fun high
  which is better than anywhere else including facebook or the official forums because those are basically  dont smoke weed  dont post about glyos  this is the only place that consistently has people talking even if half of that talk is nonsense    i post on fb instagram and check the forum and this place definitely is the front runner for activity anytime we dont have a drop within the next few days insta is best for photos but useless for discussion facebook has occasional bouts of usage but is mostly a quiet wasteland and the forum is a ghost town     so here we are even if youre opposed to the gary shitposting and the complete hatred of knights of the slice and the weird robo sexual builds that have been increasing lately which really why would you be dont be afraid of those confusing boners this is the best option

  best drop of all time coming through
  this is a fucking rad build makes me want to go break out my weaponeers again

  thats a shitton of figures for collecting just a few months respect damn just those villsers would blow my budget
can someone explain how a spikesaurians horns work my autism wont let me like the sculpt until i understand

  i made myself curious and looked up actual dates i made my first purchase pharoid godbeast on july 10th so ive been collecting a little over 4 months now its been fun so far man has it been rough getting stuff from the older waves though but then again i suppose hunting grails is half the fun

  im not done yet but that was a great suggestion
       i really like that deco definitely gonna be on the button when they put them up on the store
  very nice
does bt vampire gray match wow nightstalker gray
clawbber preview
  yes
more clawbber looks incredible desu senpai wow continues to be awesome
    cobra head  if we dont get a dino riders homage im rioting     but seriously this looks great
  clawbber snake helmet what fourth head
  penis
for some reason the battle tribes and wow generate only a little bit of interest from me the heads are cool but i just cant bring myself to buy any maybe because they remind me so much of the old 5 poa motu figures that super7 has started to puke out    no mention of the glyos homages wolverine slash from tmnt and deadpool callgrim for dcon whens the last time callgrim got released
  the first callgrim release after like 4 years is a reddit level homage  im still hoping he doesnt sell out because i want a callgrim and i hear the callgrim shop is hit or miss
  i actually bought a few callgrims from him in the summer    i kept trying to add stuff to the cart and most of it was sorry were out of that but finally i managed to snag a couple and a bunch of warp gears    if hes back then i hope hes got some warp bikes because god damn do i want some chonky vinyl already
  theres another human trooper head    clawbberfull face  trooper half mask think dredd  trooper full mask doom guy esque  dino riders cobra
morning you fucks
  new halkenn n what clawbber cost
now that 4chan is about to be kill where will you go for glyos discussion
  what    several places
so it looks like the following clawbber colors are coming  dark skin  pale skin  gol warrior blue  azure pterosaurian blue  nightstalker gray
  dude your collection is fucking dope  ive been collecting for 3 years and have no where near as much shit as you do
  not bad
  w8 why are we all saying 4chan is kill i saw people saying the same shit on /mu/ and /tv/
      hiro is moving all sfw parts of 4chan to a new domain called 4channel to attract advertisers the only way to make sure 4channel stays whitelisted is tougher moderation and even so people are already planning to raid 4channel in an attempt to get in blacklisted and ruin hiros plans troubled times ahead lads

  fucking regretting not getting in on that colorway       i should a been stocking up on silver since ages ago
  can we still say swears like shucks and hootenanny
  yer darn tootin
    hoiw long has it been since callgrim has been dropped we were getting them at a pretty decent pace there for a few years it seems the custom corps were pretty great
  dcon 2015 flesh callgrim
hello and welcome to i am bad at photography chapter 293
  marty released one in light metallic green not too long ago
  march 2017
and so it begins
  hm so they decided not to pack in the extra pheyden head
  which is bs
  the whole company is bullshit at this point fuck 1000toys kinda glad i only ever invested in two figures from that line
the 1000 toys glyos figs will be coming to the actut glyos store later down the line dont panic or pay scalper prices at least not yet after they show up and sell out though then youre fucked
yeah i thought matt said hed try to get them on his own site too kinda of like the crossover with mori
what has 1000 toys put out aside from the pizza dudes and the asymmetrical head guys that were released around the same time
    any source on this
  okay just got back from dcon and talking with 1000toys as  says the glyos molds will be sold online later its only the colors that are exclusive to the con that means the red buildman is for sure gone since it sold out today pheyden was already gone by the time i got there but yeah you can stop the 1000toys hate or whatever the molds will be reused for normal online releases    onell booth was selling a noboto painted up like slash from tmnt colors possibly sourced from idw he is sort of an olivebrown with black bandana and brown pads iirc def not homaging the 80s or 2k12 appearances also a qualleran homaging classic brown suit wolverine and amazingly a callgrim homaging deadpool i was shocked to see that mold come back at this point hopefully it opens the door to more people using it in the future sorry i didnt get pics i had figured someone would have uploaded them by now i was kind of eh on the qualleran and noboto but deadpoolcallgrim actually legitimately looked pretty good
  are you just talking about nusynths or do you mean 1000toys as a whole cause for a relatively new company theyve done quite a bit for nusynths they have knights of the slice rxh glyos punk drunkers and supposedly more in the future aside from nusynths theyve done a lot more toys in both 1/6 and 1/12 scale a lot of their figures are based around their synthetic humanoid using it like a skeleton or base body
  thats what he told us last year i didnt go this year couldve changed     were they only allowed one of the glysynths everyone i see pics from or heard from either has only buildman or pheyden not both
looking forward to these in this colorway
  oh shit thats nice do they come with both heads
apparently orange hlaken/hub are a bitfigs site exclusive
  i wish seperate releases
  he is sort of an olivebrown with black bandana and brown pads iirc    archie comics slash
sculpt a male knight  call it a girl  why is this allowed
  stop the 1000toys hate  until they confirm this themselves theyre still shitlords plus if the realxhead and knights figures stated convention exclusives what reason do we have to believe these will be any different  all im saying is they could have easily made that claim out of damage control mode as someone who collects 1000toys synths this shit is getting real old theres been way too many exclusives compared to general releases this year alone weve seen almost an equal amount of exclusive figures compared to general releases and a lot of us are getting sick of it the glyos one just burns the most because i havehad a lot of investment/respect in both companies and for them to make pheyden of all figures an exclusive  im not knocking onell i feel like this wasnt matts call and i doubt he had much say in it at least thats my hope for all we know the general release will be the shit glyninja and the pheyden and buildman will stay gouged by scalpers  its funny how at the peak of consumerism companies are less consumer friendly than ever
  stayed convention exclusives not stated oops
the red buildman is sold out at the show but some others exist the number i heard tossed around was 80
  glyosynth pheyden and buildman will be available in limited quantities at the following international events    designercon 2018 anaheim california usa  november 16 18 2018   tokyo comic con makuhari messe japan  november 30  december 2 2018   toy soul 2018 hong kong  december 14  16 2018
time    for skull
  january with 4 figures using colors from the new poster
so how the fuck did cappy go from being otfs resident crayboth autismo to now having a store that will sell exclusive colorways of his own design
  be friends with ppl  paid for colorways/design  most will consider it if your frontin cost
matts still the nicest dude alive and has reasons for everything that he does with the line  marty snuck me into the show 5 hours early and screenshots half the shit posted here  everyone in the glyos community knows of stickerfag kent probably does not approve    bought a flocked head mushi ama
  marty get 4ch is to blow off steam or takes it serious
  laughs about 99 of it but pls no bully his kids
  yeah that looks about right i couldnt remember what slash looked like in the archie comics so i took a stab in the dark with idw      i mean you dont have to believe me but i heard it straight from the mouth of one of the employees at their booth i guess i coulda filmed myself talking to him or something but didnt think id have to prove this online later i understand your skepticism due to how things have gone in the past but i made sure to ask him twice just to 100 confirm that the molds would be sold online later and both times he reassured me that they would    i didnt get to speak to matt to ask him about the exclusivity he was absent every time i stopped by the onell booth
  this is rad as fuck i never thought of that chest pattern as a skull but it works perfectly and i love it nice job dude at first i wasnt into the patchy grey but now i think it gives it character
  its funny how at the peak of consumerism companies are less consumer friendly than ever  speaking of not being consumer friendly  do these high end posable figures for collectors really come on fucking card backs  the kind that you have to fucking destroy to get the figure out  because that is what it looks like and that is the dumbest shit
  i like a nice box you can put your toy back into as much as the next guy but a cardback fits the fun goofy appeal of glyos and punkdrunkers moreso than the sleek stylish boxes standard synths come in    either way this is kind of a dumb thing to get so bent out of shape over man at the end of the day are you interested in the toy or the package it comes in
  muhmuh i cant hot glue my toy and resell it for stupid money the same week the post
  marty has almost certainly seen this image  amazing
  tell marty not to sell all his shit i wanted to buy 2 reverse gendrone mushis and maybe some rock beetorians and a villser infection one
  hey thanks paint markers do a lot to counter my stupid hands and they cover evenly the first time they wear off easily in handling but im hesitant to glaze this one in spray varnish until i know how well it covers
  hey glyos folks if im able to id like to get the new 1000toys glyosynth figures and though im not really familiar with anything glyos id rather give them glyos equipment rather than regular accessories i like both pheyden and buildman but dont like that they both have the same arm cannon and would like to give one of them a hand gun of some sort id also like to give glyninja some more ninja like accessories like swords rather than guns any ideas if there are any glyos items that would work for these 1/12 figures
  glyninja will include guns      or you could buys accessories to build new weapons    like these      or build something bulk like robo force which can be reassembled into big weapons    
  well alright thats some good inspiration and potential prospects the idea of building exactly what id like is interesting rather than just buying it i guess ill have to take a closer look at the various parts i could buy is there a best place to buy glyos parts or are the official sources ideal
  current stock of all glyos stores      official builds        inspiration  
barsoomian bt homages when        do glyosynth phey/buildman even have hands that can hold things
    sometimes i want to hang it on on the wall and sometimes i want to display it on a shelf  i also dont like having to destroy the art on the card  this just feels like an annoying step backwards to me and i wish they would given it a slide off front like a mythic legions or something
its a cheap fucking card back it looks like shit and is barely even attached i opened mine from the bottom and the entire thing came off in a second with almost no force and barely scratched the card
  huh good question ive not gotten a good look at the boxes other than some fuzzy ig pics but they seem to have a total of 6 hands and one set appears to look like mostly clenched fists which i assume are gripping hands    nice hamburger and ceratopsian btw
  mars needs women    angry red women
  onell booth was selling a noboto painted up like slash from tmnt colors possibly sourced from idw he is sort of an olivebrown with black bandana and brown pads iirc def not homaging the 80s or 2k12 appearances    isnt the scarabite color scheme based on 80s /2012 slash
  yep
  thought it was a 90s windbreaker that was in bens closet
  shut it down boys glyos is over this anon has won
  it was
is there a full list of dcon exclusives from stores
say something nice to armodocchan
  do you mean like all of them or just glyos related
  my dick is confused
  lololol ben
just curious  why does jesse distasio get so much hate here
  i cant speak for everyone but i dont notice a ton of hateno more than anyone else anyway just that knights of the ass look like crap riftkiller is cool though and so is some of the upcoming stuff and i already see a lot of people coming round to it that havent before because the toys are getting better ive never watched toypizza or whatever they have going on but im pretty sure any hate is directed at the toys and not the guy its like the exact opposite of kent and roboforce
  ok i met him at dcon this weekend and he was a very nice guy seems genuine and enjoys toys and what he does plus hes done a lot for the glyos family like getting toys into national retail chains and helping to get the ball rolling on the nusynth stuff
  now im really curious about why the glyos community doesnt like kent not here to white knight for him im just interested in the discourse if there is any
  stickerfag hates kent n someone copies him    some are annoyed about sellouts maxx hundred knight of darkness but sellout is better then sentinel around years later kent said maxx will come back but costs went up ultimate maxx would be well over 50 now cause risin costs so kent keeps workin one that will make ppl happy and not costs a fortune    than theres the new figure some are unhappy it hasnt been a classic character yet kent posted a new drop is lookin at december with a sota pic so its time is near
  t kent pushing fake news      we remember when he acted like a cockhorse when he was a mod on otf and he was the first major glyos producer barring 4h to try money gouging schemes like club zeton
  money gouging schemes like club zeton    t stickerfag
stickerfag going nuclear is hilarious but at the end of the day kent advertised a club with a bunch of perks and options and in the end it was basically just a subscription to a handful random figures blindly with none of the promised perks including the stickers lol ever coming to pass the only part of the club that i enjoyed was the maxx modules and those took forever and you had to send him your address like 3 separate times because he lost them i understand why people wouldnt trust him with money and promises    all that said the toys are great and hes always been cool with me i think its unfortunate that he has this kind of bad rep but i can at least understand where it comes from
  i think the math works out in favor of the club seton deal 25 for the gold maxx 12 apiece for callgrim and skeleden 49 so far another 12 for the crayola maxx 61 a test shot zeroid 10 so 71 multiple mailings more than exceed the 4 left over   i got a little sticker on one of the packages have no idea where it is now     early access to drops i guess theres value there   a 10 break in price if you ordered the cruel/brutal pupu platter i dont know if this was available to everyone whether the price was worth the product is another discussion     so what didnt we get something about panel lining i think and the stickers maybe     can totally see him being a moderator from hell though ive talked with him a few times and can tell he might get a little eager with that sort of power     not sure where the dog fucking thing comes from thats just weird
  basically just a subscription to a handful random figures blindly with none of the promised perks including the stickers lol ever coming to pass    imperious maxx  check    mystery maxx modules  check    lenticular stickers  nope cause company makin them went under    mystery onell and rawshark item  check    one tied to manglors that kent has n onell drop other was random as fuck yet popular colorway so win    test shot  check    membership packet  nope    ultimate with or without lines  offered few did it    plus thermal stickers sent out early on n early orderin before public for 3 years now for 75 n free shippin each item or packed with an order
  money gouging schemes like club zeton    club zeton was a great value like  says he still gives club members first dibs on new drops like the white mechabon
i never got stickers of any kind lenticular thermal or otherwise     there was never any voting on characters     there was never the ability to choose detail line/basic/unpainted on every release they did it for one single release kind of did it for a second and that was it and it was always available to everyone     never any packet or whatever     the random figures did add up to it not being a complete rip off sure but i didnt care for much of them and never signed up because of the promise of the figures i signed up for the promise of the options and that lasted for one whole release and i didnt even need to sign up for that
      stickerfag stickerfag stickerfag  fuck off kent you opened the door for crap like martys 35 custom corps  you were a powermad cunt on otf and the only reason anyone tolerated you is because you were friends with matt you always played favorites with users like warning luka for language while letting iass spew shit all over every thread and your shutdown of the trading forum was totally retarded and damaged the community
   but he banned iass when he was glyog
  years later and only because he attacked tgb the robberbaron of the glyos community
  tgb the robberbaron of the glyos community
  there was voting its how cruel got bumped to the front of the line classiccharacter wise
  envy  of a hack who adds 2 of material to a 12 toy and passes it off as a 35 custom
  robberbaron  robber baron is a derogatory metaphor of social criticism originally applied to certain late 19thcentury american businessmen who were accused of using unscrupulous methods to get rich or expand their wealth  you want con artist for attempting to trick ppl to spend more than the actual value presented  a person who cheats or tricks others by persuading them to believe something that is not true
how bout them glyos
  tgb has the decency to show you a picture of what youre buying and not hide behind a fucking kickstarter
  good classic builds i am liking the food heads more as a funny novelty but would never feel the need to own them
so i was looking through the onell blog and have noticed a lot of builds that arent listed on the contained/unlimited wiki posting some of the interesting ones
  it appears the idea for the mechabon juggernaut came from this build
  what a great color combo nice
  thats all for now ill post more if i find any that are interesting while i comb the archive
    thats interesting thanks for the responses also those are some killer builds in the past few posts
  back in the days when only the beanbot mold existed these guys were the phaseons      i miss detail lines
i cant wait to purchase this excellent sculpt
  ugh im torn between wanting more options for glyos tiddies beyond osm but this sculpt is just meh that and these tiddies will never appear unclothed
  ah the beanbots i forgot about them so these guys were the phaseons then interesting
all these old build pics have brought a rush of nostalgia i miss when matt would post stuff like this you could really feel the fun he was having and it was infectious we still get build pics with a drop now and then sure but the days of goofy little customs from the man himself is long gone    it must have been wondrous to be matt back then to see your own building system come to life and then have a huge array of colors to pick from to build as you please
  8 armory sets
this guy phases into your dimension and slaps your gobons exhaust panel    what do you do
  metal legs   hope he doesnt upsmash my ass
  another find a sort of protominiborg i wonder why it was abandoned
  its very awkward barely poseable and prone to falling
i dont really know much about glyos but i like 1000toys so i picked up a glyo synth at dcon can someone help me pick up some glyo compatible parts i can use to attach to the arms  would really appreciate it     dumpstersextinggmailcom
  the clean paintjob  the color separation on individual parts divided by clean panel lines  the build using the colors to its absolute advantage and looking incredibly fresh for what effectively amounts to gobon new arms    mfw i will never ever find a way to procure this
  not buying those spy monkey armory sets was one of the dumbest decisions of my life i just couldnt see the build potential when they were put together as motu weapons
custom corps 4 was the high watermark of aesthetics for glyos as a whole     part of me would love to private commission hellopike with several thousand dollars and dump 20 pounds of parts at his house and tell him to make whatever
  mfw seen the armory sets drop down to 5 click to buy 15 but only had 11 left bought them all and would figure out what to do with them later one of the best decisions of my life       seeing all those clear builds makes me miss the clear buildstation parts vs the solid color ones
finally seeing reviews of the 1000toys nusynth glyos figs pop up some of these fucks have no idea who pheyden or buildman is
  mfw i see someone on ig talking about kots or bt and they dont know what switch pins are
    i wouldve loved to get in on the glyos junk shop 3 mismatched figs for 10 bucks god damn id have jumped on that in a heartbeat
  some of these fucks have no idea who pheyden or buildman is  aint even that hard to google to know
  i made some fun original characters when they had that
  action figure of the month club kickstarter    96mins left
  the only thing id want from that kickstarter would be matts head and a nude cyber mamas torso
  did sjws kill it
  the fact that its kots killed it
  bid 1 to access backerstore
  where does it say that
  nowhere its just jesse trying to trick people itt
  you literally cannot pledge 1 it has to be 5 minimum fuck i dont know should i pledge guys
  yes you can
meh i pledged minimum just in case the planets align and a super secret topless colorway will be offered in the backer store
  what is backer store
  i dont have the cash after several drops all the shit they had at dcon black friday deals etc i pledged the 25 just to get on the backer kit for more additions later hopefully he has it running for a while
  junk shop was so goddamn exciting you never knew what you were gonna get mind you the junk shop was a way to offload defective parts so youd sometimes get really wonky stuff like pieces that connected crooked or pieces with incomplete panel lines or slopped paint apps but it was all cool the price was unbeatable and there was always a chance of scoring some rare parts youd missed out on
  my thoughts exactly ill amass an army of matt heads to bastardize my glyos colonies all over the room
i saw a good amount of upcoming kots figures in person at dcon and they are honestly at the point where the figures are great if you like the style matt has been working with them to constantly improve what theyre doing im not a big fan of the era or style of figure that kots is in the first place but the sculpts fits and accessories are all really on point now they were selling some of the nude knight cyber mamas at the show on cardbacks and she looked great and the red knight figure is unironically fantastic dont remember seeing some of the questionable looking protos from the ks like the regular cyber mama or matts head but everything they did have up or that i was able to sneak a peak at was really fantastic
soon
  any one got a link
  
designer con leftovers will be available at noon tomorrow 11/23 9am pst sale includes the ultra dx gol amazonis a battletribeswrestling crossover and the keshi flesh colored bognar battle builder
nemo is working on a new figure with builtin swing and axis joints  what an absolute maniac
  honestly its what i thought third party glyos producers should have been doing all along matt gave us some wonderful tools to work with why is everyone still so stuck on plain ol swivel joints everywhere
  whats your fucking problem i repost someones image as a joke to them and you kicked me thats fucking wack man
  dog fucking comment comes from seeing pics of his wife    he was terrible as a moderator he would always post about how he has inside info on some new mold/figure etc but wouldnt actually share any details it was more like look i have access to matt and you fuckers dont and that got old year after year and he would make up all sorts of weird rules on the fly and just delete entire sections of the forum or change everything but anyone that questioned him about it was the assum no kent is the ass and always will be
  which shop
  kents fuckery runs even deeper ask godbeast or that nezumiiro guy about the time they basically had to have an intervention for him right before the ot toys forum exploded
  so basically he was the harry kim of moderators gotcha curious about the intervention but im sure thatll dribble out in time   on the few occasions ive met or otherwise talked to him he seemed unable to discuss anything other than toys with one exception that still tied into toys   with matt i was able to discuss other things i like matt kent seems skeezy
  its wor so 
zullen are a little plain on their own but right now matts store still has axis and blasters in the same orange just in case you were on the fence
  theyre up
  kent is fan of horror n history of toys toyfinity used be a toy database archive of lots lines
  feel how you want about kent leave his family out of it i know its funny to say outrageous things but saying shit about peoples significant others or kids or whatever just makes you a straight up bad person  your parents would be very disappointed in you for taking like that and would probably think twice about bringing your mountain dew and cheetos down to the basement if they knew you were acting like that on their computer
  cringe and 4channelpilled

this one isnt chipped though
in glyos canon which is more dangerous the villser virus or the nemesis infection
    i built so many figures i missed out on there were a few pieces that were new at the time that slipped in there so many gobon balls though so many        i think the villser virus
  nice      nemesis infection  you what now

  id buy pretty much any osm that i had interest in from him if they were 2x what they originally cost but 10x hahahahahahahahaha
  idiotim just explaining the origin of the comment for the person who asked gfy
  i was actually wondering what glyos i was going to buy next and there we go monday night is now checked on my calendar
do the kabuto mushi not use glyaxian axis and phase technology ive not seen a single official instance of them being hubgraded or such
  i think its more of an issue of every one of tgbs clique minus zullen being a shit builder
        in lore mushi are outside of glyos system so lack of access to axis etc tgb doesnt write much lore sister companys can ask to make main accessories but few do
    this guy comes with two axis sets tgb has featured a few different builds that include axis joints whether theyre worth a damn is in the eye of the beholder but they exist
  in my experience building with mushis is line building with armorvors there are a few extra parts on the mushi so builds tend to look very segmented and dare i say insectlike im usually not thrilled with the results but the potential is certainly there     lorewise theres really fuckall evidence that mushi care about any glyos tech
  not pictured the axis joints that come with that set    if i remember right theyre a muddy red that isnt close to the mushis red
  why didnt tgb ever make the limited edition resin blasters a standard part of the mushi moulds or the wings and swords
  came later    tgb hinted somethin in dec maybe 1 of them  
  no the item that wasnt ready was a new style of cape
  cause why do something ppl ask for all the time
  the joints were a different color than the red because it was a masters of the universe modulok homage    he did a skeletor hordak buzzoff and webstor in previous drops
has anyone else realized that we can obsolete osm boobs entirely by just making polynian figures glyoscompatible
  tell me about the titty robots    is it like gunpla where you gotta do a lot of painting and deflashing before it looks good or does it come out of the box like that
  theyre competed figures they come out of the box like that qc is rough on some of the older figured but the majority are fine aftermarket prices get scary though
  and im guessing those joints are soft plastic and pop right out for part swapping
  the joints are hard plastic the body parts are a softer plastic partswapping is really easy between figures pic related my chimerahybrid of 4 figures im pretty sure the joints are the same size as revoltech joints too
  dont get me wrong i love polynians too but this is such a weirdly random/out of left field post why not revoltech or figma or sas they are all equally as incompatible with glyos as polynians are and none of these lines have any easy compatibility tricks like coincidentally correctly sized pegholes or anything
  do they have the titty robots
titty robots
where can i find some lowpriced titty robots that will get the job done
                    try getting laid instead of perversing with toys
  he has no problem with   but titty robots are beyond the pale
onell drop this thursday    gotta get me that deadpool callgrimm
  as much as id love those parts im not a fan of homages
  that sneaky merc appearing in jesses store at a later date
how the fucking fuck do you remove the little ball pegs in the mushis backs i absolutely cannot remove them and fear i might rip the pvc trying to
  slowly and painfully
  hair dryer
  i might just get that deadpool callgrim is quite possibly my favorite glyos mold and this is a good looking homage      did you try your teeth thats how i got mine out
battle tribes collection went from 2 to 3 and by next week will be 7  moms gonna freak
    deadgrim looks a lot better than i thought he would though i could do without the brown
  use a tiny flat blade screw driver prying gently from under the ball edge    keep your thumb over it or it will launch out and youll loose it
  lol virgin
  this works great as a separator also the boosters are glyos compatible
oh hey its been a couple years since ive looked lets see if glyos is good again      more homage paints  nope it isnt
  those ones were for a convention    dont get me wrong though theres still a shit ton of homage releases
  in general glyos is much better than it was a couple of years ago with lots of great new things recently released or coming soon homage lines are trash but this is the first time in a while weve had blatant ones
tools for glyos building   spoon    linemans pliers
  your teeth
  makes me think now about all the secondhand glyos i have and how its been in someones mouth ehhh
who the fuck doesnt just use a spudger and cloth/pliers
is anyone else hype of fuck for the new warlords of wor guy dope metal claws finally a fucking glyos gun combat knife spaceman helmets cobra head giant robot fists sign me the fuck up its funny the group that is just using the battle tribes body has released more new game changer molds than the guys behind battle tribes themselves thefuck were they thinking with the food wrestlers  the only problem i have is all the high tech gear guys are gonna look kinda weird by the normal barbarians but if wor keeps putting out the kinda scifi figures and battle tribes finally gives us some good new medieval shit itll be a nice balance
  i think they look like assyou could find those in a bin of sticky shit from the 80s and not know what it is
  shut the fuck up marty
  the deadpool homage is fucking lame but i still might pick it up could be a fucking rick and morty homage for all i care but its cool to see callgrim back
  i put mine in my ass      i have one from dcon and its fucking awesome ive been saying the warlords is the most exciting newer mold and this doubles down on it
  where are pictures of the new stuff
  on the internet
  axis jointsanal beads   i can see the confusion
tried painting up one of my battle builder heads
one port no problem
  wait since when did glyos look cool
wait since when did glyos look cool
  since 2011 at least
  i dunno since its inception most likely havent been around since the start but definitely get why its still around
couple of older pictures but the whole since when was this neato thing irked me so old pics seem appropriate
i have hundreds more pics but really these are fun toys and if they werent we wouldnt be here enjoying them with each other
i miss wom and armory sets
  the armory sets were the perfect bauble assortment i miss them too
most of my favorite builds wouldnt be plausible without the armories
my most recent haul fuck ive wanted to do a mutant beetorian for a while now glad marty had a few mushi left in that colorway to make one and just because i didnt want it to suffer the indignity of falling prey to the villser i also picked up a mecha mushi to put him down
  nice phaseon collection there that metallic black one is damn slick
pictures when
  all those metallics are quite underrated and are so great for building    that double kabuto build is neat did u come up with that
gol amazonisships with the btw belt on  pop it off  paint scrapes off of three places on the trunks  yikes
  you put it on upside down     thats on you
  its my fault that some chinaman put the belt on wrong  brainlet
new thread      
hey /toy/ how about a cyberpunk type of thread  any scale any property stuff that just has that kind of feel retail custom whatever you got
  got the blackbox toys officer k when it came out ok for the price got the supermad toys one on pre order though also got their deckard figure on pre order too
love cyberpunk love toys i need this thread
  find some cool pics and get in here
finally the best thread i have these 4 i will buy everything from neca br2049 including spinners but the first one will always be my waifu luv i bought two one for her white office suit nier is cyberpunk for me so i include it project fiora is total cyberpunk and finally legends domino has a cyberpunk assassin aesthetic blade runner needs more merchandise and i totally disappoint that neca does not produce figures of roy rachael pris deckard gaff and even joi i prefer a joi to a wallace without accessories i lose hope that one day we will have blade runner figures 2019 and more than 2049 in scale 7  producing only 4 figures is a total fucking waste
  1000toys and figma gits
mcfarlane did a line of akira figures back in the 90s someone really should give this another go with modern articulation
  this would be a pretty cool collection if they werent in boxes i mean you do you but itd just look cool to see them together as figures
  didnt someone else do a line of akira figures more recently
are any of the recent blade runner figures from neca any decent
  yes there were 1/6 figures i dont know from whom
  only thing worth keeping in the box is 2b he types like an autismo though so theres that
  new bgc figures are high on my wishlist    id really like a k that doesnt look like shit too
blade runner 2049 spoilers sorry spoiler doesnt work on /toy/            why didnt neca make a figure of rachael  shes in the movie plus you get original blade runner fans to buy it plus you test the waters to see what sales would be like for 1982 movie characters did they really think people would rather have a figure of jared leto
  odds are neca figured she wouldnt sell well plus sean young is kind of batshit insane now and probably wouldnt give up her likeness
      medicom real action heroes
  id kill for that bike on 1/12 scale
  yes thats it i wonder how they managed to get the accurate brand name stickers while mcfarlane couldnt they just paid what canon etc were asking while mcfarlane couldnt or wouldnt
  ive seen dfferent stickers setup on pictures around while the one you posted is true to the manga i can remember citizen without doubt maybe they did use a different source
  were lucky we got the second wave at all wave 1 sales looked pretty abysmal
  yeah thats probably the case i looked into getting those figures about a year ago but theyre just too rich for my blood they are bloody perfect though
  maybe but if she gave up her likeness for the film i gotta think they could have worked it out and i cant imagine they thought itd sell worse than creepy jared leto
    i dont think theres a source for the mcfarlane stickers they just changed the brand names citizen canon and shoei to random words like immigrant  corrupt and hold on to avoid having to pay those companies   they could have used the movie poster as a source since that also has different stickers metal monstar but they didnt for whatever reason
i just remembered this spider jerusalem figure exists
  these old ones arent half bad if you are just interested in the hard suits
  hopefully goodsmile doesnt chicken out on the motoslave/priss figma
  always wanted that  it used to be super expensive but quick search of ebay shows its a little more reasonable now
wow cool nice
who are some cool cyberpunk character designs from noncyberpunk properties
    ive heard it was changed to just the motoslave also  that crash cover in the background  anyway the face sculpts are actually pretty good for these still looking for a cib priss and sylia myself
  what company made this deckard
no one has mentioned the shadowrun figures    fucking newfags
  why would they do such a thing the motoslave is cool but without her its almost worthless oh well maybe it will happen to scale well with what i already have  face sculpts   idk if i would call them good they are recognizable at least
  yeah i mean i dont tend to have super high expectations to begin with barring statues but im glad we even have the option    why  i dunno keep in mind this is all hearsay i picked up a couple months back somewhere on here
  that looks kinda great i never played any kind of shadowrun though i know its a major cyberpunk franchise
recently picked up this roy i like him way more than the recent redman toys version he could use a new body though i also have the 1/12 die cast tokyo bike show stickerless version of the kanedas bike
  i found it boxed at a second hand store for cheap as dont remember exactly but i remember checking ebay and it was less than half of what it was going for there  its a pretty crap figure but i guess thats to be expected for these kinds of things and short of a revival id guess thats all well ever get
  sorry its a custom  
  excellent lighting and environment but the poses seem pretty lifeless
  what are those bent over ones with the spines
    blame safeguard by 1000toys
  its edward scissorhands
  those look pretty good i wouldnt mind a figuarts/figma set of knight sabres but those do look nice on a shelf how much do they go for    also figma leona ozaki with 112 boneparte when
  if you can find it them for sale its usually between 150250 depending on character the line is atelier sai for old2005 anime toys they have pretty good articulation and look absolutely amazing
  oof thats pricey thanks though i may try and track em down anyway depending on whether we get anything else
  t boomer
  tfw thought you meant boomer as in the robots from bubblegum crisis for a moment  memes memes have changed
  be three years ago  want this  watching the auction for days and accidentally took a nap 15 min before it ended   tfw sold for 36 shipped     still haunts me
  upon closer inspection it was a different figure of this character but the sentiment remains
  you were probably looking at the 1/15 scale yamato version that comes with a transformable motoslave dont worry you still missed out bigtime as they go for the same amount as the atelier if not more now im very sorry    thought the same thing there is a boomer figure made to go with the yamatos but its super hard to acquire and very expensive for such a small figure also comes with two ad police
there were a few lain figures made but the seem kind of lame be cool if somebody made a few more in better quality
  that sounds spooky
  what does the synopsis of lain youve never seen it
  ye
  no modern figures of lain
  maybe you should check it out it was pretty neat      sucks haibane renmei figs would be cool too
  i have most of these theyre kinda fantastic mid2000s articulation aside
  i managed to get a complete set on ebay for not too pricey a few years back they were out of box though and the different hands and things are pretty loose still happy with them though    its nice to see the faces are coloured like that when new too i thought mines had faded in the sun before i got them or something
i wouldnt normally buy a 9 tall figure with shitty articulation but silicon creatures in the blame manga kind of look like borg and killy has gone up against opponents this big before besides all of this star trek first contact merchandise is 22 years old and their boxes are starting to fall apart so i may as well put them to some use
does anyone know where a britbong might find the dominion tank police bonaparte model kit they made i loved dtp and itd be great to have that model
  le transmetropolitan
  that borg is actually pretty damn cool looking considering its stylized it seems like its can blend in with other lines more easily
i dont even know what toyline this is
    right is threea
when the assemble borg armoroid originally came out i thought its flat head made it look a bit like the bu12b battle boomer from bubblegum crisis but unfortunately the armoroid is pretty short compared to the atelier sai hardsuits so when selvaroid bullet green was released recently i bought two of them so that i could try combining them together with the armoroid into a figure that would be at least 7 tall this was the result    the silver trim from the armoroid is a little distracting but i didnt want to waste the armoroid i already had or buy a third selvaroid the wide chest and spindly limbs of the combined figure makes it look rather like robocop 2 and perhaps if i had three silver armoroids instead i could have made a more convincing recreation of robocop 2
  some more views
  i want that good boy
  i know thats arise motoko but whats the helmet and effect part from
spawn nitro riders these things were my jam when they came outactuallya lot of the spawn stuff from that time were cool cyberpunk monsters
  fuck wrong image im retarded
  arise motokos body sac motokos head the vr visor comes from this 7 figure its not a statue it has 3 points of articulation and the effect part is the blue variant of its base
  thanks anon how much did you have to modify to get the visor on the sac head
  close enough
  a for effort but it just doesnt look right to me too skinny i think
  all i had to do was stick it to her bangs with earthquake putty
maximum hype
  it certainly looks big i was worried that it wouldnt properly be 1/12 scale like the aoshima model the question is with the engineering to make it transformable will it cost as much as void
  im assuming the motoslave will be transformable due to it being advertised originally as motoslave not priss for me the price could be anything and id buy it im imagining it will be over the predator though so that will undoubtedly hurt
  ah i misread what you were saying sorry im very hyped
for the guys that bought the venom snkae 1/6 good news its going to ship this week
  yeah i know assemble borgs dont have very many snapon armor parts available to bulk them up and the ones they do have are transparent
  i wonder if this will cause the older ones to drop in price
  which older ones do you mean the problem is theres no evidence that freeing is ever going to produce any of the other sabers or their motoslaves besides priss unless maybe if priss turns out to be massive hit atelier sai made all of the 2nd generation hardsuits in 1/12 scale and yamato made all of the 1st gen suits together with motoslaves in 1/15 scale the only thing that this figma is truly competitive against is the aoshima model kit which was only of priss and which claimed to be 1/12 but was actually 1/14
  atelier sai probably wouldnt drop as like you mentioned they are the suits used for episode 8 i was more questioning the yamato 1/18 as figma priss has the same gimmick and is much larger
  dang this probably looks pretty slick in person  and i thought my setup was nice
  better question why didnt they do my wife
nene with her transformed motoslave thats something weve never seen in canon
  that picture of the guy taking a mirror selfie while grabbing his fat cat by the crotch and the cat isnt happyjpg
  lewd
is this biopunk
anyone got this
  same bro figure looks great
  i guess      what is it
  oh so theyre 95 statues theyre ok to post here because theyre western but even so not many people are going to be interested in them
  who made these
  its a blindbox set that hot toys released unusually for them in 1/20 scale 10 years ago
  theyre ok to post here because theyre western    western or not theyre still not toys and therefore not /toy/ appropriate
  i dont care how much this ends up costing i needs it
  jesus get a life or report him
  blame the rules for that loophole bitch about it to hiro if it bothers you that much
  damn when did guile join skynet
  those are super cool but that 1/20th scale makes me less happy
  my nigga strohiem
  not definite but left looks like something from killzone
    texhnolyze figures never ever
   unreleased 1
  other side
  other side
  lol
  this would be cooler without the feathers
  its shadowrun so its always going to be cyberpunk with fantasy and native american influences
the tron franchise is cyberpunk too
  just put killys head in a toy with a hoodie ichises pretty much killy as a boxer    as much as i like aposimz i guess its biopunk but then again isnt biopunk a subgenre of cyberpunk    trips  also as much as i like the aesthetic of shadowrun the whole magic thing just doesnt click with me  and this comes from a guy who enjoys the hell out of dorohedoro
you won okay its just a game
cyberwaifu just came in the mail today so i thought id share
  does anyone know if there is a sanakan or a killy in this line i could only find cibo and not even any other information other than this cibo existing seems weird to only make one character  is there even any sanakan figure at all from any line
    does this move
  only when i wave it around in the air making airplane noises
  how tall is she is she in scale with the 1000toys killy ive been thinking about making a custom cibo using a megami device wism sniper
  i dont yet have a killy so i cant actually say if the scale is right
  taller than i expected but she is supposed to be taller than killy
  i just ordered a 1000toys killy ill post a side by side when it gets here
          it hurts that well never get these the shadowrun figures were fantastic for the time
about bladerunner 1/6 scale figuresis it to do with licensing that hot toys hasnt done a set with all the main characters
  there was a bear suit one i only ever got the regular uniform ons
  oh fuck  how did i kiss an articulated killy
  you got drunk  the moment was right
  killy is made by 1000toys and he is still available  plus their etherow has been released recently
  but etherows exclusive version head is kinda meh
  any good gbe effect pieces
  is this 1/12 scale
  its a figma so close to that scale yes   also  for those wanting to complete their atelier sai collection priss and nene are on ebay at the moment
  the figma priss looks encouragingly close to 1/12 scale in the photo but well have to wait for the preorder announcement to find out whether its actually 15 cm tall and do they mean the height to the top of the helmet or the top of the antennae we wont know definitively until someone gets it in hand and compares it to the atelier sai
  or you could just compare it to the figma stands in the background
  theres still too much uncertainty for people like me who want to know whether the atelier sai hardsuit can fit into this motoslave
  i like the idea here but based on my experiences with figma product there is a 99 chance it will be too small
  that obvious shill bidding by cv with 0 rep  unless that was one of us but i was watching this auction just to see ai got fucking duped
    killy confirmed for manlet
  other members of cibos race can be that tall compared to killy so you may be able to get away with it
  i just checked the results that poor guy
this figure is pretty shway
  shway
    where did you get these backgrounds
  all those unnecessary lines especially the superdeep ones etched into the cowl    its schwarbage
  theyre by extreme sets available at extremesetscom bbts or amazon
can we ever expect more neca 2049 stuff id love a joi or a mariette
  its always irked me how dc felt compelled to utterly ruin terry and the world he inhabited beyond the run of the original series every consecutive comic has redesigned terrys batsuit again and again and it never looks good i wish theyd just write up a proper continuation to the series and keep terrys suit untouched
  figma is making some no idea on release schedule they showed prototypes over the summer
  did you not bother to look through the thread
so a friend of mine decided to surprise me with this a while back i had never heard of this company but the quality of the blocks is very comparable to official lego bricks the engineering on this thing is incredible although parts of the build are a little sketchy and would never be approved by lego if this thing was officially licensed but then again i like all the risks they took with the build
  it came in a shit load of bags i didnt count the pieces but it has to be over 1000
  mp bumblebee for scale for those wondering it can comfortably seat a play arts kai figure whatever scale that is not quite 1/6 scale i think also heres the ebay listing it says the set has 1134 pieces which sounds about right i marathon built this thing in about 5 and half hours and had a blast highly recommend    
      looks cool the bootlego thread would probably like to see this too 
      hey thanks anon that looks really cool and fun to build might be a little big for most of my figures but i reckon apollo might be able to ride it
    thanks anons
  damn this is wild
      both right theyre both threea figures left is killzone right is adventurekartel or one of ashley woods properties
  dope shot but i would have made it just slightly brighter in post or had just a little more light in your scene its so dark that your great looking background doesnt get to shine and the synth doesnt pop as much as it could    also you have kind of a white border on the bottom maybe crop that out
  neat love the head not a fan of the colors making a similar looking head for my botsniper fig     these things are slick wish redboy was 1/6th
any good techwear or gothninja figs i really like the details on lana torabishi but    kickstarter limited run  statue  hilariously static pose at that  scalpers taking 300
i just want a 112 jensen
  me either  but squenix are fags
    mcfarlane made a deluxe version in a box that is slightly longer than the blister pack version i saw that the blister pack version fits figma    the kaneda that comes with the bike has more articulation as well  
  theyre actually 117 or 116 scale  happy now
  no
never getting a joi figure
started watching key the metal idol last night 2 eps in and im loving it are there any good figures of key shes too cute for words
pretty unlikely but does anyone have one of those tomenosuke blade runner blasters worth it    thinking about getting one of the 2049 rereleases
  key the metal idol was one of the last big ova series of the 90s it ended right when japans economy started collapsing the only figure of key that was ever made seems to be this nude resin statue  
  i didnt know japans economy collapsed in the late 90s very interesting
  fuck thats a shame oh well still iirc it was pretty well received so maybe theres a chance shell get a modern figure someday priss is getting one after all though granted bubblegum crisis is an absolute cult classic in japan whilst im not sure how popular ktmi was
  great time if you were into importing games n shit     im old
  what a fun toy from a terrible movie
  i dont know if youre talking about ghost in the shell 1995 ghost in the shell 2017 or the matrix
  hes just being a contrarian
  or it was just a bad movie the idea was nice and the art was beautiful but plot was executed terribly and none of the characters grew on me at all ive heard stand alone complex is better
  you have heard wrong from shit taste plebs  you would probably like it though
  ghost in the shell 1995 probably assumes that youre familiar with the original manga and the rest of mamoru oshiis movies before you watch it
  besides i cant really see how you can call a mcfarlane figure fun because even though its got better articulation than the average mcfarlane figure its clearly intended to be put into only one pose this one
  maybe that was the problem there was so little character development i never even got a clear understanding of anyone motives for their actions    because it looks nice mcfarlanes always have a lot of nice detail and are entertaining to look at
i prefer the original tags from the movie
  but the scale is kinda off dude plus the 1/12 one is more available and will fit in nicely with many figures
  have you got this im still waiting for mine to arrive
  cool pic
not necessarily cyberpunk but any thoughts on these space dudes how do they scale up with neca stuff
  arent those 1/12 scale neca is 1/10
  as far as kubrick movies are concerned a clockwork orange is closer to cyberpunk than 2001
  that looks like bane before the venom kicks in
  holy shit i used to have that terminator salvation fig such a shitty toy haha
post your gi joes acid rain marauders boss fight hacks hiya shodo pte bbi and compatible figures vehicles playsets and any dioramas/backgrounds/customs youve made    news  marauder preparing to ship k9 dog unit exo suit contract ops  gi joe club has the final 12 ninja force zartan and night stalkers 3pack up for preorder  locker toys has shipped most of the zombie lab figures to the ks supporters      previous thread 
first for oiling up
  remind me again about what the final gi joe club figures are again
  the only ones i remember was captain gridiron and a second granted nonaccurate blizzard figure
  
  claymore and clutch are getting sold the rest are pretty good
well got my zombie lab civilians in did not get any of the zombies as i have plenty of zombie vipers i like em but they are definitely not up to bfs standards my biggest gripe is the skin being painted over the flesh color plastic it made the joints stick and the colors didnt match very well
  yeah im pretty much keeping most of them i skipped the last 2 fss but this one is pretty solid
  6 and 7 were pretty good but yeah if it wasnt for the fact id end up paying 4 times the amount for the ones i want id pass on them
just got my first acid rain figure these guys are cool wish they where more widely available why exactly arent they
so those zombie lab figures is the only way to get them now just by preordering on bbts
  theyre a lowproduction boutique figure line by a tiny company
  you can order them directly from  
  they also have the final 12 but they are not worth getting at all as they are just repaints and figures no one really asked for there is nf zartan and the 3 pack of female cobra troopers in black i preordered zartan as im a big ninja force fan
one thing they did a great job on was the mele weapons they look look great very realistic and gritty looking the guns on the other hand lack the detail the melee weapons have they just look cheap and very soft i will be using marauders instead of these
  it almost looks like they copied rather poorly the firearms from various extant 118 guns
  here is a clearer pic
    theyre all pretty much made by one guy who doesnt produce too many to begin with like a couple hundred or a few thousand per run which is why the aftermarket is crazy     if you miss a release expect to pay at least double you may find a deal on a fb group called nuclear storm but you can forget about finding bob or steel and the marine was going for upwards of 150300 each up until they announced the reissue coming out this december     my advice if youre into them then preorder on bbts and get an extra or two to scalp later
just a heads up amazon has the star wars vc imperial tank for 41 its a good deal if you collect sw or looking for a cool sci fi vehicle its really well made and they really crammed a ton of details in the thing the cockpit is pretty impressive ill take some pics at some point
  thanks for the heads up was looking for a sale
planet green valley update figures entering mass production this week should take two months not going on sale until theyre produced    here are some factory color samples
      finally
                do fucking want
    cant fucking wait
   i second this great to see that they are actually getting produced anyone know what are the estimated prices    i finally finished the flying fox fortress vehicle here are some pics
  no but im preparing myself for something in the neighborhood of acid rain pricing
do you guys know when and if the marauder k9s would be available to the public i missed out on the ks campaign i just really want a couple of grey doggos as wolves
  i second this question and want to add the exo suits into the equation
is it normal for the paint to chip off on the acid rain figures hands cuz the one i just got his right hand already is showing the white plastic in the palm area and the fingers also on the ear pieces under the helmet
  anyone know what are the estimated prices  hes said 2025 but i think theyll be higher once you factor in shipping
  no kickstarter  straight up normal toyline  bless this slow asshole     painted guns with weathering  on shit this is going to be an expensive line huh      ive been prepared for acid rain prices so if theyr less ill buy more
    they wont be available until after they ship all the ks supporters packages they said they wanted all ks packaged shipped by end of november but i havent heard anyone receive anything yet so i would guess spring 2019 as to when they will be available at the store its just a guess though
    it is in my experience
    yup especially the reissued ones the original ones would chip over time but a common complaint about the reissued ones is that the hands would chip as soon right out of the box as soon as you start messing with it
      they said january for the new items in the store theyve been preparing the kickstarter packages while waiting on the remaining items so shipping out should be fairly quick once they receive their last shipments
  yay cant wait to burn money on this
    already received it thanks again going to use it with my marauders stuff
  youre welcome i ordered mine on monday and got tuesday im glad i waited till it went on sale
potentially the hottest action figure of this christmas is gonna be 1/18
  but they will be in store its not a ks or bust type deal
  no marauders always makes more than the kickstarter orders they have to stock their web store which is their main business the kickstarter is just to fund the molds and the benefit for backing their kickstarters is you get things earlier and they cost less they may have had kickstarter exclusive items but i dont remember any
  that is fantastic news
  the line has a ton of potential itll definitely be a hot seller im worried they may have priced themselves out of canada though 2499 for a 1/18 figure with one accessory and a small dio piece isnt exactly much value
just saw this on instagram not sure where to pre order though
      i mean judging from this picture theyve got a ball and swivel neck ffs on a retail 4inch figure havent seen those since marvel universe died
  does it come with the trailer because if so i want it
  and ankle pivots too as well as a mid torso ball peg very solid articulation scheme theyre definitely above anything else 1/18 at current retail and right up there with mu at its best
  its a shame the designs are literal retard tier
  i assume not since that isnt in color or in more than one picture      does anyone know where the soppsed pre order is i want to see the price
  sure you can think that but theres a lot of variety so certainly theres something for just about anyone to like even just as a one off
  im digging that 4pack dat cuddles omega and raptor single pack and the treasure chest where is thicc girl tho
i feel like i killed the last thread but just in case it was coincidence
  
  thread was kill already pictures are always welcomed keep em coming
  i second this
so a couple of the boss fight guys continue to be unprofessional they literally cheered the end of the gijoe club the people who hired them during the dark times probably were very friendly withduring their hasbro days maybe friends even oh well they make good stuff
  the club was shit though
    well the club went with someone else for the head sculpts after we got stuff like the ffs3 glorious wave head sculpts and the figures suffered for their loss
  look the club isnt the best but the fact is they still employed bfs before and during the split with hasbro commenting that they were glad the people who helped got them on their feet are going to be gone is still bad form and following how they treated fans in the past doesnt make them look any better    other way around club asked boss fight boss fight turned them down forcing the club to turn to 4horsemen
  chur for the correction
  yeah man that corporation totally needs bfs pity
what are they saying about the club    personally the club stuff was totally skippable aside from one or two figures because they were horrible frankensteins with horrible heads that didnt match the bodies or just stupid redecos
   didnt they put out a heartwrencher   that would have been one of the only things i would have wanted and getting a single figure with no interest in the others and you are still paying rape dollars
pretty nice little toy exceptional articulation glaring problem being his very limited elbows which dont even get to 90 degrees and which i cant for the life of me get to hold a 2handed weapon like an assault riflegot one of the loot chests with bonus guns too sculpts are really nice
  where is this guy from 
  where did u find him they had the llama pinata at walmart but didnt see any of the 4 packs or singles      lurk moar
  target they didnt have bandolier drift or any loot chests though i got the loot chest from a local gamestop which didnt have any single packed figures but had everything else
  why cant you just hello the guy out instead of trying to be some kind of gate keeping elitist because he hasnt seen every single post     i mean i watch these threads and i dont even know that it is unless its one of the fortnight figures but i dont think its that
    it is raptor from fortnite
  bummer to hear the elbows suck so hard
  i wonder how easy it would be to pop that torso off those legs those would be perfect pants for a custom im doing
  there is literally info and a pic of this figure a few posts above the dude asking about it
  none of those fortnight figures are the same as the one posted on top of that that one looks cheaper like a lanard type line or something
  you can only see the figure partially on the left side of the image here  so i can see why youd have missed it
  thanks
  shit too busy to hit any stores this weekend hopefully i can find them on monday    that raptor reminds me of a goofy firefly
  goofy firefly    so beachead
anybody have the upc code for the jazwares fortnight
  this is an alternative color scheme for the skin in game so yeah
the flak bike has arrived  i need you all to convince me to get this because i want it but my wallet is in the icu after all the fucking shopping for christmas
      get it and as soon as it sells out youll be able to scalp it for twice as much as you bought it
  doesnt acid rain reproduce stuff all the time though  doesnt really increase the price now that theyre doing that
    no theyve only just now reissued their first 3 figures and it took fiveish years none of the vehicles or dio sets have gotten reissued
  made it to walmart this morning and they had everything in stock minus the loot chest and the builder playset picked up one of everything minus 3 single figures that i did not like the design amazon prime has the builder set for 3999 so snagged that i think im good for now might grab a 2nd 4 pack to have for customs     i opened a few figures and they feel very stiff so im going dip em in hot water to loosen them up and straighten some of the limbs
  were they in the action figure aisle or the fortnite aisle display near the electronics section
  they were in the electronics section on the fortnite bus display i saw that display on friday but it did not have the 4inch figures only shirts the 6inch figures and some small collectibles
  thats good to know thanks i saw the same thing on friday and was worried they were gone
    i know the feeling bro
the turbo builder set from fortnite actually looks like a lot of fun i dont care about any figures i just want the building pieces         so its not ori toy making this does that mean the quality/feel will be any different
  i highly recommend the llama pinata if you snag several single packs the pinata comes with 8 walls pieces 4 backpacks and lots of weapons plus rustlord its a good deal for 2499 the single figures come with no weapons or backpacks     also after i gave them a hot water bath all the joints loosened up and was able to avoid breaking any joints
i finally figured what are they doing while we sleep    
nigga you should post the whole picture here instead
  meeeeeeeeeeeme
  its ok op i found bigger faggot than you

first for ecotron
first for gaytron
made this dapper samurai robot which sets should i pick up to bigger variety of aesthetic bricks
  seems more like why my bricks hurttron
dont mind me guys just here spyi appreciating your cool mocs
evil as fuck colour scheme  set names that allude to nsa tier spying  uses brutal laser bars to imprison innocent blacktron astronauts  daily reminder that space police were always the bad guys
  spies weve got spies
  but real men real men also do
  set names that allude to nsa tier spying  you mean like the message intercept base    oh wait that was blacktron    but for serious i wish they hadnt gone with the plebtier blacktron need to be the villains for our new wave of space police and kept it as the futuron offshoot with a heavy focus on stealth and secrecy as they were originally presented
  message decoder  spytrak i
  thats just a harmless surveillance van where hard working honorable space police can enjoy a donut and a hot cuppa
  why would a law enforcement organization not want to track spies
    so it was mtron vs blacktron but who were the space police who did they work for were blacktron and mtron just companies armies nations
calls buyers manchildren what a dumb fucking picture lol
  the space police are funded by imperial taxes and recruited from the worlds of imperial citizens which comprise the region of the universe inhabited by the races of man which was once known as the arc of nations the mtron are a nomadic race of polygynous miners which tend to purposefully remain beyond on the fringes of imperial space unless forced to interact which means they are often preyed upon by those who would otherwise fear the space police    the blacktrons were once a valued member of the arc of nations but now theyre an expansionist military empire that takes no prisoners and vanish when killed so nobody is really sure whats going on with them
  my interpretation is that space police are from a un type group that seeks to enforce a universal galactic law  mtron are a mining company of sorts  blacktron i started off as a anarchist crime syndicate/movement before forming into a space empire with blacktron ii that opposes space police imperialism
  cope harder
  the space police were our last best hope for peace    they failed    but in the year of the klocki krisis they became something greater our last best hope  for victory    the year is 22xx the place brickylon 5
gonna be one of those threads i see
  minifigs and minidolls wrapped in two million five hundred thousand pcs of spinning bricks    ages/edades 512
  anon be a funtron not a bumtron if you dont like the topic then post something brick related you want to talk about or some cool mocs youve made
  be a funtron not a bumtron  im laughing a lot harder than i expected      yes  yes  yes    ages/edades 512  my sides are made of reddishbrown cheese slopes      which sets should i pick up to bigger variety of aesthetic bricks  basically any minidoll set might want to look into that light blue robot that came out last year
  cute
  my favorite part is how he took the time to flip the arms around
  funtron  bumtron  i kind of wish i had more sad clowns to swap them into space suits and make my own glumtron faction
  and shattered the poor vintage plastic body in the process rip major tom your spaceship will always know the way to klockhalla
anyone know how much these bad boys are worth and who they are individually
the blacktron droid was lameass
  do you know what theme it is   brinkset is good for prices   if you know subtheme you can search for minifigs
  mismatched pieces belonging to lotr capeshit sw prince of persia and what appears to be the cmf heroic knight    maybe 15 if you get everything sorted out properly
  cry not little one big brother is here to wreck mtron shit
    they both lived a hard life
  blacktron did nothing wrong    with that said i think the space police were formed by futron in some weak attempt at authority over a universe gone mad mtron was the becametheirownfaction reds that didnt like how things were being run and formed up allowing them to take futron tech and info with them becoming a defacto nation overnight they then created another mining group with experimental technology of their own that became the ice planet 2002 blacktrons that had a hardon for valuable profitable information became spyrius etc etc    roboforce though is still a work in progress
  why do you keep posting this beat to shit figure
  nta but i like him and his backstory
  its my sigfig
  the hell is a sigfig
    were bad    well maybe a little
  its a hitler thing youyou wouldnt understand
  where the heck is this google at anyway    but seriously a sigfig is an idealized or caricatural version of yourself in minifig form some people make sigfigs and take pictures of them on vacation some people put them in with the rest of their lego town or whatever      lol
  cope with idiots agreed but its awfully hard to do
  shouldnt that be jangoism
hey three hogwarts express guy or train guys in general i motorised mine putting the motor below the tender with the battery on top worked fine on just a circle although nowhere as smooth as my passenger train when i added switches however it often derails over them i think its the front tiny wheels being not heavy enough but im not sure anyone got the same problem/a solution pic related
post sigfigs
  that half australian monstrosity and did he paint stubble dots on his face
    no
after realizing that i had four pink tutus i suddenly found myself in the middle of making a ballerina company complete with coach its not as cozy as anons dance studio because francís says comfort is for losers and he doesnt coach losers
  post a classic / retro space moc    best thread challenge
sigfig and two favorite figs
  cute
  actual last thread  
any anons here could help me with a non lego related thing  my browser says the connection here isnt secure its been like this fo ra few weeks and my 4chan pass fuck captcha shit doesnt work either   no idea what i can do ive tried to fix it myself but to no avail
  he bought a pass  but really its likely due to the chan/channel split
  sounds like you need to delete all your cookies and saved data on your browser and then try your pass again with a fresh cookie on the new 4channel server
i finished building this last night it was so much fun its my favourite set of all time now i wish i had multiples of them theres just something about it more than the christmas theme and its neat concept but all the little details and such that they manage to fit in its incredible       comfy
hey anon what would you do if you had a time machine stop wars bring enlightenment to humanity in the far past visit the far future    fuck that noise id go back and get me some goddamn classics all the glorious bricks back from my errant childhood id be a god i tell you a god
    its weird how ive spent so much time on the internet over so many years and yet im still so dumb when it comes to stuff like this thank you anons   and yes i bought a pass fucking captchas make me want to step on klocki and make other people step on klocki
  it represents dreams my friend the fantasy that all those sets youre getting for christmas are all living their own fantastic lives inside the packages youve yet to open its the lego movie holiday special in your heart    its beautiful
  add 4chanx now capable with channel and check the box for classic capcha its not worth spending money on this site even though ive been here daily since september 2006
  i received one when i bought the detectives office havent put either together yet im still waiting for december even if its selfenforced im enjoying the buildup of anticipation glad to hear its a fun set though
this was a good project not fully complete but vast majority finished
  no pic  good job me
10 was always the goal i could make more i have the bricks but polishing these up is plenty
  mismatched pieces belonging to lotr capeshit sw prince of persia and what appears to be the cmf heroic knight  no capeshit and only the horse is pop the minifig pieces are mosly lotr with a tiny bit of sw and random knights mixed in
  add 4chanx now capable with channel and check the box for classic capcha  this it just gives you the oldstyle captchas where you just have to click three or four boxes instead of the endless next or the sloooooooooow fades
  still has shittier themes you need to get lost
  yeah i realized after posting that the green female torso is probably lotr
i really wish i kept a build journal    the sls was first  then blue mustang  the gt and gt40  widened the blue stang  widened gt40  disassembled the gt  got the vette  disassembled vette and sls  made the blue stang an obnoxious stance car  gave blue stang an engine  then interior  opening doors  burn out  gt40 gets an engine  buy focus and widen it with engine  unstance blue stang  buy og stang and widen add engine  fall in love with stickers  buy 488 widen  buy 917 make it slantnose 930  resurrect sls widen  resurrect vette widen  buy 2 911s only make sublime 930  build 911 engines  sls engine   vette engine  anime sublime 911  cyberpunk vette  488 engine  buy another 488 build it as 812ish  812 engine    damn didnt think id ever recapture the magic of lego
  pop gave us the ostrich which is the largest bird in my bird bag
  now you need to build a lego city for their drivers to enact illegal street races in
  neat never was into cars but i like these
  i love that weeby 911
if the anon who posted the brickbuilt aks is around can you please repost them
  even worse i heresyd pic related using the handy guide thats been posted here before
any word on the 2019 modular
  my battery box is tied up in my monorail 
  now set it up for multitrack drifting a single minifig on one track a bunch of minidolls on another a metaphor for every thread
  nevermind watched a couple of youtube videos and someone mentioned making the couplings between trains four wide rather than 3 so i used some extra magnet bumpers i had i redesigned the whole thing as well works much better now although you still cant go to higher speeds without risking derailment at switches
  i need to find my pic of my old train i have multi track drifting
  arcade
  more like nktron
my city is growing and growing   i stoped at the moment as i have no more place   i want to build two more things the most arcade and burger bar    im starting to work on my orc city next
friends get two great sets next year  this lovely comfy house
  comfy
  and this minimodular not much to see on the other side but i think it looks lovely
  whats the extra hair for
  so you could make a boy child
  amazing
  im going to miss making jokes about mia being a feral child raised by a pack of animals    on the other hand this is easily the best house in the whole friends line
  after few minutes in paintnet  this looks way better
  you are a god i need to make me some 8 wides too so my megabloks can zip around in style
the train pulled to a halt the foreman asked the driver why they had stopped we have something on the line said the driver
its your job to move it dave said the driver dave looked out into the cold dark night he only had the trains lanterns to light his way
in the lamp light dave saw a fallen tree on the tracks it must have fell in the snow storm which had only just come to an end that morning it was too heavy to lift for just one man
thankfully everyone on the train had come out to help dave as they felt sorry for him even the driver they moved the tree in no time and were on their way
  how come lego released power miners under their own theme name instead of rereasing rock raiders     i know theres some story differences between the two sets like the power miners taking place in beneath earth instead of beneath an alien world but come on its basically the same theme with a new lick of paint did they lose the right somehow or get uncomfortable with the use of the word raider
red pill me on angry clone face jang is moping about it
    the lego company uses the same face print for nearly every imperial or first order stormtrooper they manufacture in addition to resembling the print they used for the clone troopers the design itself is getting a bit repetitive by its overuse for the imperialera soldiers alone     i personally dont mind as the soldiers have helmets on for so much of the time that they may as well have the black heads lego used in the past to represent the troops visors but others may dislike not having much variety
  its overused in everything not just clones
hi here is my first japanese learning video i made hope ur enjoyed it and what is your opinion about that type of education when you can just do your hobby things and learn everything about the world   
for xmas im going to give my niece a lego set of harry potter 75954 but the ones whose cost is less than 100 are all unavaible in my countryitaly  should i wait for amazon to restock or i should give up and buy one for 130    and yes i this is the only set i can give to her thanks to a previous discussion with her mother
    the worst thing is that while you cant see the face you still have to ignore fleshy neck on the back under the helmet     black heads worked so much better
  i think its just more convenient not to have to deal with rock raiders 2 when dealing with the history of themes in addition to rock raiders not having the same generic appeal as space police or knights kingdom
  i would wait at least until the end of next week if its not restocked or until then go for the expensive one assuming its well stocked enough that they dont run out before then
does anyone have pics of the upcoming overwatch cyborg ninja and the big dude with the hammer
    they look fantastic anon
  anon i love the three buildings in the corner theyre gorgeous thats a wonderful lil city     i picked up brick bank for a pretty good bargain last week adn it arrived today i have the parisian restaurant set which arrived last month and also the joker manor set arrived last month ive built the joker manor which was fun going to build the parisian restaurant and brick bank in december ive not had my own lego city/town before so its gonna be fun doing all that
  thx anon  hav a comfy day
han solo landspeeder set is 29 aud tomorrow at target far out im very tempted     indoraptor estate will be 149 aud
im hoping the lego christmas carousel promo set will appear soon on the aussie lego store i really want it
  any pictures
  i always end up missing these promos wouldve really liked to get the gingerbread house a few years ago maybe this year we can expect more double points events before the end of the year yes
  im really not sure if we will get double points again it wouldnt surprise me it would be nice for sure but im still quite new to the promo stuff the christmas present box is my second promo the first was the minifig display stand
  damn thats a lot of good pieces
  i agree
  id buy the shit out of futuron and blacktron ii
  i love christmas klocki its just so comfy
  thank you so much for feedback  i decided i will just build my own modulars instead of buying one  roofs are pain in the ass  i hope i will build like pic related one day
  wait how are the hexagons done
  its in layers the top shield overlapping the bottom
  oh i see it now couldnt wrap my head around it for a while
  yeah the lighting makes it look really flat my first thought was bootlego parts
  i cant defend star wars but those other themes had ostriches helms deep and those hooked orc swords    would settle down and raise a family in/10
  she may as well be just look at those absentee homo parents of hers
  レゴを使ってその授業をつくった
  tricked me too at first but then i saw the top row
    wow looks great
  thank you anon im not used to ordering online lego sets i always bought mine at my local store
hey legofags anyone here into brikwars    played a small game with my nephew this thanksgiving goblins of the spiderruins vs captain buck swashlers privateers i wont lie i stacked the pirates with a few more points than the goblins to give him a little advantage but he did pretty good even when we swapped armys and played again    who else plays whats your army anyone want a battle report
lets see if you can guess which set i used this time to turn it into a mech
  homo parents  its time to put down the internet for a while anon
  set 76083  looks really cool and i definitely get the gjallarhorn vibe
  why is that the only set you can give her seems like there is a strange heterosexual story there
    what exactly was causing the derailments was everything too closely coupled and thats it or was it something to do with the engine specifically
      beware the vulture
  owo  nice loincloth

  what noooo its so you can make a tomboy far superior
  holy cow someone posted my castle d
  i do never played his game though
  no love for this photo story i dig it anon especially like the lighting in   start coming up with snappy filenames and youll fit right in
nexo knights is objectively better than ninjago and legos over saturation of ninjago advertisement is what screwed it over and caused it to get cancelled change my mind
  no sir that is the opposite of comfy we get her secret pet surgery center in the attic but we dont get the unmarked gravesite where she dumps the corpses fie i say fie stuff and nonsense
    i played the shit out of this game but i wasnt good at it  shame we never got an official fig
  who was phone
  dont insult me i dont need the internet to make up alex jonestier idiotic obscene backstories for all my favorite friends ladies    ninjago has pantsdown superior buildings and bad guys lego cancelled nexo because they actively monitor these threads and got sick of all the bitching about muh real castle
  ninjago has buildings  ftfy
    i remember playing this what was the game called though
  junkbot
  junkbot
  holy shit amazing
  shame we never got an official fig  i know it hurts  chima had 2 characters one very important and they never got the figs of them  one was cragger mom while other was amazing crow/eagle hybrid
  posr more pictures or else
  and i just noticed that the clip of the 1x2 brick on the toe is broken  fucking hell until now the piece only held that one half of the rifle on the original van model which was left pretty much untouched or played with  how could that break
  nice those tutu pieces are awesome  while our local dance meastro might look a lot more laid back he still pushes his students very hard   a bit too hard    spoileri built a few more of my characters alternate ballerina outfits as well as aerobics outfits now/spoiler      nice crew fellow nostalgiafag would play legoracers with
  cute    and this is a very nice photo
  different anon probably but heres one    works better with an ice cream cone piece instead of the telescope but im too lazy to take a new pic
psa 
finally got this together i received some good feedback from a /lg/ some months ago having utilized that i think im now finally getting pretty close to completing this thing
  im afraid those 2x2 dish pieces dont fit within those rims you can put a stud on the inside of a speedchamps wheel
  a ha tbh i was wondering why that hadnt been done before in the official sc sets weird that studio let me do that will fix them among other minor changes thanks
  thats beautiful but has a 70s feel into it    have you tried to create something modern
  durr i meant if you put the dish on top of a studs and then connect it to the sc rim it will work by resting on the ridge but it will be bulkier    looks good i like the shaping and colour surfaces on the side
  yes though admittedly i havent played for years professionally however with a true ragnablok coming up ive been revamping my armies and not doing the generic thing by having lore armies immortals usssr brittania whatever thefuckwarshardsareuptonow bullshit im actually looking forward to it
    thanks anons        i still dont know exactly youve got a long rigid set of wheels preceded by some very light bogie wheels and when they kick up the whole lot falls off
  i see yes it will probably be a bit too bulky i think ill settle with with just studs like in the mustang fastback      thank you its actually based on a late 50s car pic related my car was originally even more caricaturelike think of donald ducks car its still roundish and stylized but still more downtoearth than before im personally more interested in vintage cars rather than new ones not really thinking of doing modern stuff
  two goggles
  pocket sand
  okay that gun design is coming with me minus the cannibalistic sights eww
  im not pleased with this improper connection
  its okay its a bootlego hand they come with extras    spoilernot sure if thats better or worse/no
  i see thats pretty cool
  youve poisoned your pure bricks with chinese cancer causing plastics of course its worse
  changed the sides and also the rims i think it looks faster now
  please find me a place that has this working with saveable progress
  lego based tabletop strategy war game literally any theme and anything you can build can get stats made for it      wojtus      im still rebuilding my lego collection but would really like to get more castle and pirate stuff for gaming
  lmao i used to have a sigfig not gonna lie
youve got it all wrong anons    futuron were civilian explorers  original space police were futuron volunteers  second space police were more militarized due to growing blacktron threat  second blacktron were more militant and organised than before  spyrius were secretive hackers and spies that pioneered ai technology    futuron space police mtron ice planet 2002 and exploriens are all affiliated with the galactic council  blacktron and spyrius are separate criminal factions
  hey now spyrius are just in it for the lols not harm who else do you think gives us all those pics of lego celebrities in compromising positions
  spyrius are just in it for the lols  are spyrius a space 4chan
tfw forgot to buy the old fishing store and now its sold out everywhere  god fucking dammit
  wait for real
  tfw bought it like a month ago
  huh youre not kidding though you could always check bricklink
  i mean the set ive been eyeing up would get me double points anyway so i should just wait for a promo i like and pull the trigger and hope the website works this time
  are you canadian i saw one in a mastermind toys last week
damn it walmart had the hogwarts express for 65 and i thought it would go down or at least stay that low and now its back to full price
advice on what to feel for to find newt from the fantastic beast minifigure series
  wojtus  you know those little pests that always infest your lego town knocking over mailboxes and going for joyrides in your highperformance sports cars
  dust your set before taking a highres upclose picture lol
they come in all shapes and sizes these days
  its not really that hi res but yeah i need to get around to cleaning my sets sometime
  but its an old fishing house its supposed to be dusty
  tfw the old fishing store was sold out on the lego shop even before they dropped the price for black friday  it was like 50 bucks off but i couldnt buy it anyway
has anyone ever made a lego gingerbread house    asking for a friend that would make a good christmas set
  has anyone ever made a lego gingerbread house    i made a gingerbread neighborhood once
  i agree anon c
  hey i made a lego fig just liek this one back when i was like 10 and it was my favourite fig
  far out thats fantastic anon
  wow thats amazing very inspirational
    thanks the roofs are easy to slope with this piece  
  there was a gingerbread house promo a couple years ago but nothing minifig scale
  oh wow ive never seen that piece before thank you anon ill have to look into making a little order for some of them id like to have a cottage with a forest one day
  it was only produced for a couple years in a few sets despite being an extremely useful piece one of the numerous specialized parts that lego churned out as it was nosediving toward bankruptcy in the 1990s
  see if you can find a way to use this 1x2 mod slope for the side might require some rebuilding but youll get a smoother look
  so crazy how it was going bankrupt in the 90s and now is one of the strongest/successful/globally distributed thing so gnarly  and yeah i just looked up bricklink info on the piece im aussie theres a teeny tiny amount of these pieces available im now lookin around ebay and gumtree to see if i can catch any sets that have 4 of the piece in them at a good price i enjoy the hunt
  sticker over multiple parts    you monster
  oh my these pieces are so nostalgic i had an eye that was part of my first lego set    it came bundled with a toothpaste it was called lego basic had 14 pieces and came with a polybag it had one of these eye pieces    i regret so much giving away my lego
lads  this guy is selling a lot of older lego sets  which set would you buy  
  it was this one
  does the link work for you guys  i dont know shit about vintage lego  but this guy seems to have a fair amount and in good condition
  im not terribly familiar with ozbucks but checking bricklink for the first few sets hes got listed the prices hes selling them for are around what youd pay on cracklink however almost all of the sets i checked arent even being sold by australian bricklink stores you will probably get raped by shipping if you try to buy them from elsewhere i would suggest making a list of the sets that youre interested in then checking bricklink to see if theyre available in australia and what theyre selling for elsewhere bricklink sellers will give you shipping quotes if you ask them so id check bricklink first just in case but the fact that hes in australia and the shipping will be cheaper should also factor into your decision
  this cats butthole reminds me of the sea  brown and smelly
  ill do that thanks anon
  and always in me face
any guesses on how the chargers grille is put together
  i do too my ninjago city has only been out for about 3 months and is already dusty
  that big engine is a bit iffy uh just cause of how disproportionate it is but still kinda cool  but i always hate when they make the headlights out of stickers
classic space becomes futuron  whites become space police  blues become ice planet  black group becomes blacktron  reds become mtron  what happened to the yellows then        seconded ive thought about it many times id have to get old dollar bills though since the new ones with the huge goofy faces would have the cashier going what kind of joke is this          these are great the house is a nice full build instead of the rooms being two studs deep too        christmas town quest when bonus points if some characters from halloween high show up as cameos
  explorien i know the suits were more gray their builds mostly white with trans blue elements but their logo has prominent yellow theyre the most logical i can think of from what there is left to choose from
    i like this one even though its so rinky dinky ive only ever used it prominently in a display for halloween as a joke looks sweet and innocent so i placed a witch inside and behind a couldron over flames inside a kid fig w/ crying face and a bunch of skulls piled nearby
  i actually built the town with the intention of it being a sunnydale heights episode but it didnt pan out i kinda want to rebuild it now though
  gotta have that blower power
  what happened to the yellows then  unitron
  any guesses on how the chargers grille is put together    no thats gonna bug me    it totally doesnt give me engine envy though i sometimes think my engine is to big so yeah im super not jelly super
  oh yeah i forgot about them thats a perfect fit
so what was your favorite 2018 set that youve bought and built mines pic related
  this set
  i think that every set i bought this year is from a different year
  my downtown diner not many 2018 sets this year for me anyways besides the lego store and han solos speeder i think thors weapon quest is 2018 too been trying to find the speed champions porsche set at a good rice
    how big are the brats at your penis diner
  saturn v
  something like this
  take 2 this is the grille but i cant identify the 2 trans orange pieces under the front
  dodge challenger   its official speed champions is the best lego theme ever
  is that an unnatural bastard of /lg/ and /pol/
  will try        fuck yeah been waiting for this
    took a stab at finishing it out
  cuz its the one she wants the most my aunt says so why not and i would love to make her happy
  looks to be pretty close but that light bley circular part seems to be a bit higher in the official model impressive work still
  ohhh i see it now nice job
  they are using a different wheel piece couldnt find it in studio thats what makes it look lower
  the rear end is kinda boxy right now not sure how i feel about it ive tried a few combos but this was the one i settled on for now    i chose not to go 1x2 brackets so i could have the 1x1 brackets  fall over  the slopes to try to simulate the bumper bend and license plate fold around   ps sorry about the black from the render it is what it is
  those are just orange studs
  dragon pit and the suitcase gave me hope for more awesome unuusal lego sets
    this fellow nword knows whats up i honestly dont expect to see a new set thats this damn good anytime soon
  nice one thanks legend
  diggingupthemarrowjpg
im quite excited for this set im glad its available for me to get as im aussie the price per piece may be not so good im not sure yet i guess some anons here could make a guestimate based on the pictures but i am not too fussed as i have some lego points to use    80101 chinese new years eve dinner  8999 aud
  
80102 dragon dance 7999 aud
  teal brick separator
  
  i love it when cmfs show up in sets
  i think i do too in this case
              chinese market  yellow figs    i get it
  anon pls
  charger seems to be a lot less detailed than the rest of sc
  you saying they should have used fleshies    they are
  those prints    those scorpion frog and sausage colours  fuck lego for making these limited to asia at least let me buy them through your shop and pay extra shipping damn it
 i need this
moc time
  theatre  embassy of the insectoid empire of alpha centauri  apartments    i love this city windmill looks a little out of place tho
  that corner building looks really weird and unusual i love it      windmill looks a little out of place tho  its part of the moulin rouge
  overlapped nexo knights shield tiles
  seen this irl its surprisingly massive
  oh thats my new cat i call him butthole  why did you name him butthole  lifts tail  oh
  oh i didnt know you had a pet cat  i dont thats my new coffee machine
  that looks amazing the red windmill is a nice touch too
    why cant i into posting today wtf
  thats an amazing moc of an even more amazing piece of architecture
  gorgeous can anyone tell what the moustache is made out of
  its unikitty tails
  teal separator  i neeeeeeeed it
  random pig guy
  castle mocs seem to mostly be about size more than anything you dont see a lot of advanced techniques like you see in space or other themed mocs
  that looks great i think theyll sell it everywhere
  the bionicle playset weapons as lightningrods  mantax heads like gargoyles  various shields and blades as window frames  the mini treads for the apartment balcony on the right  the skeleton body used as a car grill  there are so many creative details going on but i am especially appreciate of the creative usage of bionicle bits thats really quite something
  its because youre stealing all my waifigs
  yeah but then you get to all the dodgy connections like the side mirrors on the leftmost car
  stop making me want to fuck bricks
      am i naive for hoping that lego may eventually make these available in the rest of the world through their online store
  maybe we are coming up on the year of the pig in the chinese zodiac
  i think a big contributing factor to that is that theres more place for new looks in space no one knows how a spaceship could look but there are pretty clear restrictions in how castles look  theres still some really impressive techniques for stone walls wooden walls and roofs but they all try to achieve the same look whereas many futuristic mocs try to achieve something unique
  that is such a good use the lessthanaplatewidth brick family    ive been having hood clearance issues the only way to identify it was a cutaway
the latest update of my library fuck you wallet
  very nice collection anon    your last picture made me feel inadequate about my own libary
  looks bretty gud
  no
  thanks i like what you did also
christmas carousel is now live in australia
lego movie 1  let your kids play with your stuff    lego movie 2  oops your kids ruined your stuff and now its in ruins lol
theres also this when you spend 85 aud on star wars lego in the store
  this has 251 pieces in it btw
  those casters are pretty neat
  what absolute garbage
  id like to know how its 22 pieces are there a bunch of 1x1 plates hidden in the middle of the stand      lego movie 1  let your kids play with your stuff    lego movie 2  your kids can now build sickass fury road mocs
  how come its garbage      im curious about that too
im surprised literally no one in this thread has ever mentioned the lego jurassic world cartoon the second episode is on nbc right now     doesnt seem very funny though
  lmfao its free lego nerd
got my ninjago box today didnt even think about what the head would be under the oni motorcycle visor so that was a neat surprise    the thing that sold me on this was the metal bat though im gonna have to get some of this guys warboy friends because he is just too cute
  thats really neat
also in the last three days i tripled my fan collection
turning now to other news i expanded my stable of unicorn knights thanks to having a box of cmfs at the dollar general across town next up a second cat costume lady to heresy away the furry shit and make a nice pair of white boots and a black torso with lady curves pattern
somewhere along the way i lost my creativity i used to have a massive bucket of legos an i would build how the parts called to me and came together then some years ago i sold the bucket and started over buying lego city sets to build my own town then i started playing lego worlds and realized cities were boring and started doing other things now i want to buy the lego classic random boxes and learn to build like a kid again    anyone else know the feeling
  my advice is to organize all your pieces by type because even though it may seem counterintuitive it will help when you get in the creative zone and you dont want to lose the magic because you had to spend ten minutes raking through the bucket looking for a piece    at first youll just build standard things but then youll get a little more comfortable and youll start being able to envision crazier stuff
any guesses on when a new castle flavored theme will be announced
  organize all your pieces by type because even though it may seem counterintuitive it will help when you get in the creative zone   thats one way and it works for some i disagree    being forced to use a limited amount of random bricks requires ingenuity finding compromises to use what you have instead of what you need helps the creative process    whatever school of thought is right for you  it should be hard with many failures no learning process starts with immediate success
  thanks to having a box of cmfs at the dollar general  damn son wish i could have that luck ive got a few in town seriously how many fucking dollar stores does a single community even need but all they ever seem to have is random kreo crap and a few other off brands rarely any lego
  you should check again because the one in my town and the one in the small town i work in both started carrying lego a week ago and another anon here in the /lg/ says his dollar general has a small section of it all of a sudden its some new distribution deal they have that they brought in for christmas you should check the entire toy section because at both the dgs ive been to the legos were on the opposite side of the aisle as the my blox etc
  some new distribution deal they have that they brought in for christmas    oh thats neat  ive seen cmfs at the register at my local one but thats about it so far
    i was right    
  will do anon thanks for the tip      ah right ill have to check the registers too
    mandatory racing stripe added the orange studs added to
  a touch up on the back cuz i wasnt satisfied the chrome was being represented enough
hey canadian bros
  stripe around the nose was a camaro thing charger had the tail stripe
  as i was googling the rear end last night saw a few different stripe combos front back hoods/roofs i havent tried it on the back yet ill give it a look a bit later
  for you mate itll need a sticker to finish the 1x3 side plate
just noticed that the kabuki nya torso has the same style of wrap as the cmf kimono girl
  can you fit a bigger wheel and tire at the rear     looks great btw
  possibly the mudguard could raise up one more plate so i guess with a bit of reworking you could get bigger fatter tires on it without losing the body
  why you gotta fursecute anon
while  is certainly better  is probably far cheaper so really it just depends on how detailed you want your moc to be cause they are both good in their own ways
    front render for you with rear stripe
  regret at being responsible adult and budgeting only for lego ian malcolm and not rando lego people for cool white head fan chick intensifies
  i think shes only like ten or twelve bucks on cracklink
  what happens next anon
  anon this is really neat  how much did it cost overall  it looks wonderful
just as a heads up target is selling this guy for 3 and free 2 day shipping deal ends on saturday so hurry up   does anyone know if target is still doing the spend 50 on lego and get a 10 gift card promotion still   i wanna get han solos landspeeder the porsche sc set and the fastback mustang all 24 23 and 12 respectively
  the very budget that got me in this situation is the same reason ive avoided getting a bricklink account     toyleri must fight becoming a baseplatefiller as long as i can/toyler    on the other hand think of all the obscure purist figures i could make
  thanks im at about 70 usd so far not counting sets and tote buys roughly 10 books i need three times as many for what i have in mind
oi lads i downloaded studio to try out some ideas i had for a roller coaster theyve got all the track parts but i cant seem to find the carriages themselves am i being retarded and blind or do they just not have the roller coaster carriage pieces
  never tried or looked but if you know the element id you can put that in the search bar otherwise cuz studio is still kind of new it might not have that piece yet
  aye i tried that and nothing came up weird that theyd put in the rails but no carriages for them
the first thing i built after almost 10 years i hope that the fact that i ran out of steam and bricks towards the end isnt noticable  i also managed to fix my old electric motor and i want to build something with it but im not sure what  the obvious answer would be a car since thats what its designed for but i dont feel like it and i dont have many technic parts to build some machine  im talking about this old 90s motor 
what are some cool superhero sets to pick up /lg/ and i mean as sets not just this is worth it for the minifigs    in before none
  looks good anon at most might need a few more bricks on the back so its not quite so level but in all a very nice build
  quantum realm explorers  antman final battle  milano spaceship rescue  sanctum sanctorum first one  hulkbuster smash  ghost rider teamup  kryptonite interception  superman  krypto teamup
  spiderman bridge battle is a pretty good build dont know if its still sold though  the sanctum showdown is also ok but its a little small on the inside of the 2 buildings its easily mocable though im planning out a modular version right now  most other sets are just ships or cars with figures dont know anything about dc sets or batman sets
  i think he meant 76060 thus why he mentioned the first one
  superman  krypto teamup    i can add attack of the talons i think thats the name which is a pretty good cheap batman set
  both are ok i just prefer structures over dioramas
lego creator summer sets listthis list is from an company insider thats it    sowe get  a ufo/flying saucer set that comes with an alienuses an old mold in new colors  farm set  hotel modular  viking ship  summer house  monster truck  story set  castle/fortress set

    you guys can see it in this pic its nice that the shuttle set references the futuristic flyer set might tease a ufo set then
i know its vidya but i know /v/ wont know what im even talking about or care so posting here    anyone own the old galidor pc game i just bought it for like 4 bucks out of curiosity apparently it was unfinished but the studio that made it sold the rights to someone else and they ended up actually publishing the game in multiple 2 and 4 packs with other lego titles ive never seen a 100 walkthrough online and i wonder if the new owners ever finished it or if it just reaches a point where its unplayable
  while were on the subject of galidor anybody have scans of the galidor comics i would be very interested in reading them
  ufo  viking ship  castle

  bullshit
who killed this threadwith a wrench
    someone mentioned unikitty so you know weve all been involved in some serious masturbating dont worry those of us who survive will be back soon or for the new thread
why dont you guys post some mocs instead of complaining that nobody else is posting
  because were too busy working on our mocs to post anon why dont you post some of your mocs instead of complaining about people complaining

im working on gate set for my elves village
  new 4chan sucks
        very cute makes me want to do a brave engineer retelling with my toy story 440
  this is the other elves build i finished few months ago

this is the only disney set i will buy the rest are boring or over priced
is the elves stuff the closest well see to castle theme for a while
fyi my dollar general is having a 20 off all city and creator sets 10 and up that ends tomorrow night
tfw finally managed to nab a classic police officer    fuck this is probably one of the cutest blind bag minifigs in a while a pity its being scalped to absolute hell
   ufo/flying saucer set that comes with an alienuses an old mold in new colors    xcom    those poor sets they dont know theyre out of time toylerunits/toyler
  why is it crime to enjoy fantasy mocs
    
  well that sounds like a personal problem
city sky police
  for a sec i thought its a tbc meme
    poll timw
  when you post in the dead thread
  
  i was talking about the arrow in the corner
post your brickwaifu
why did the thread die  on another note i ordered ninjago city yesterday wanted to get it before it retires i found it on sale and bought as a christmas gift for myself
so sold as seen means its damaged but they dont want to admit to it
this is exactly what you are getting  posts hundreds of pictures including pictures specifically dedicated where a product is damaged  yyyyyou trix me  some people are just shit buyers
  who hurt you op
  some sellers are shit sellers
  some posters are just shitposters
itt awful awful toy faces
the star wars line has had its share of terrible faces but nothing can beat monkey face leia
  isnt that luke one of those figures that actually has good sculpting but lazy paintjob like people repaint them and they just look fine
  i thought benicio del toro played a different character in that movie
  classic in that light she looks like a cross between nick nolte and gary busey
half of the faces in this bread arent even that bad
  her and the revo psylocke look terrible      no its also narrow and sunken looking ive seen people call it meth addict luke
  but thats a perfect god tier hasbro sculpt
  its perfect kris kelvin for mini solaris
  jesus
  literally nothing wrong with that
  this one itself wouldnt have been bad if it werent ridiculously tiny
  that one actually looks ok not brilliant but hardly on par with some of the faces in this thread for sheer dreadfulness
  if you like horrifyingly ugly faces i guess not
  your parents kept you after all
  aside from looking older than the character did and nothing like what people wanted which was how she looked in her own run
  do we need another hasbro thread
  except it doesnt and youve been proven wrong over and over and over again but youre still trying to push your stupidity    nothing like what people wanted  it looks like the art youre a bitch please kill yourself
  thats just lukes not bad face
  youre a moron
  it doesnt look like the art from her book you should read the whole sentence before flying off like a sperg
  you mean like this book    shes had a lot of books and her creators art isnt all that different from the figures style
  thats supposed to be a she
  all those marvel waifus  and not one of them is cute
  cant help himself  just resist once in a while sa please
  no your gwenpool meme is old and needs to be shut down now you dont get to ruin four different threads with your bullshit
  lol not even the same guy dipshit
  you know very well he means the main book the one the maf x figure actually based itself off of
  lol then youre still a moron for sticking your nose where it doesnt belong dipshit
  where it doesnt belong  im the op you absolute mong
  subjectanon does this every time he knows exactly what people are talking about but pretends that isnt it
  then fuck you for starting a thread like this
  fuck you for starting a thread about something i dont like  you need to go back
  and you know exactly what hes talking about but you pretend your mafex bullshit is infallible anyway
    it literally doesnt matter that this artstyle is legitimate or canon    shes still hideous just look how gross she is on the cover that was posted
  shes still hideous  shes not
  just mentioning a non hasbro line regardless of context sets you off wow
  found the pedophile
  not wanting a toy that looks like a crackwhore in cosplay makes you a pedophile  nani
  people liking a marvel legend regardless of context sets you off wow
  lol yeah she is look at that weird ass mustard skin and the deformed creases in her legs not to mention she has no curves and what the fuck is that skin flap across her armpit      found the crackwhore fetishist
  sorry you already made this post in the mafex thread youve just confirmed youre a shithead troll
  i mean its true the ml looks fucking awful
  mustard skin   so you just lie and make things up for free or is someone paying you to be this stupid
  it looks very good actually
  you dont get to ruin four different threads with your bullshit  holy fuck the irony
  why do you need to lie to yourself
  so are you colorblind or can you not see the freakish yellow skintone 
  wrong
  are you really that retarded
  what is the point of such a low quality post you do this all the time at least make some sort of counterpoint instead
this whole thread was blatant subjectanon bait from the start and he walked right into it
  please explain it then brainiac
  hes right though theres nothing wrong with the ml
  its not kawai like the japanese art and has ugly american red lips
    i know what he means but hes wrong considering the book itself is made by different artists as well    but please keep on talking about shit you know nothing about
  then you have shit taste
  wow that looks like a man absolutely nothing feminine going on at all
  is this real or is that photoshopped like the heddie brock/crackwhore chunli to piss off subjectautist    because it looks worse than either of those exagerrated photoshops did
  i think everyone who owns a gwenpool would rather own a bootleg of the mafex than an ugly american bootleg
  wow you almost managed to make a convincing post there but youre still being way too obvious with your trolling
  i think youre full of shit
  the fact you think all these posts are coming from the same person is almost as delusional as your opinions on toys
  aunt may likes to eat ass
  the fact that you think that post had anything to do with thinking its all one person makes you the most delusional one in the thread
  legitimate question i dont follow capeshit and cant believe theyd actually put a neck like that on a figure but the ultra defensive replies here suggest otherwise
  yeah youre fucking pathetic
  t extremely mad over a cheap toy
  pretty funny coming from the tard shitposting in four threads over it youre the new subjectanon
  nah dude i cant be the new you because i dont obsess over anybody making fun of hasbro toys    i dont even go on spergrampages when they toys i like do get trashed here
mods for fuck sake do your jobs already if you ever actually come to this board then you see the shit subjectautist is constantly doing but you fuckers still havent done anything about it you banned virt for doing less in a shorter amount of time than subjectautist has been around which one of you is getting your dick sucked by him
  give me a break you blame fucking everyone else but yourself for this shit its all on you that this garbage happens you keep it going
  those cellulite legs
  literally nothing wrong here
  t regular crackwhore client
    you are correct there is nothing wrong with that sculpt but theres always some retard shitposting about it every street fighter thread
the classic
  the proportions on the whole thing are weird poor woman
  tfw these became a collectable in their own right  theres something magical about a bootleg that gets bootlegs made of it
  that looks bad and you should feel bad
    it maybe be accurate but its still ugly and not totemo kawaii at all
  michelle obama has an action figure
  you gotta be a loser to think that looks bad
  nothing wrong with the ml    except sloppy paint ugly seams ugly joints the weird r1 and l2 stamped on the elbows the lack of sculpting on the costume due to the reused torso the plastic quality and the poor range of motion in the articulation thats before you get into whether or not you like the style of the headsculpts
neckbeard akuma really didnt translate into toy form very well probably just because it cant clip into his body like it does in the game
  except sloppy paint ugly seams ugly joints the weird r1 and l2 stamped on the elbows the lack of sculpting on the costume due to the reused torso    and youre wrong about everything youve said the weird r1 and l2 things are common on every toy ever but youre a retard so of course youll bitch about that theres nothing wrong with the plastic quality nothing wrong with the range of motion and articulation and nothing wrong with the head sculpts at all its a solid figure
ignore the bait or youre a fag
so this is on the faq section of the hasbrotoyshop sounds like the days of getting stuff on their site are numbered
those lower case is are pissing me off
as soon as mattel killed its webshop hasbro probably decided to nuke its one
  so much for easily buying sdcc exclusives
  what do they even have that i cant get at a local store you guys keep saying walkin shopping is dead but many online stores are just as bad
  what do they even have that i cant get at a local store  coupon codes and free shipping over a certain amount or they did until they started adding shitty exclusions to newlystocked items    ive gotten some really good deals from there in the past but the site went to hell after that buggy redesign a while back i wont miss its current state
  theyd been very good about carrying con exclusives the past five years or so
  they get their stuff in before the stores do almost always
so much for that guy who was bullshitting that the hts was some official third party vendor
  i stopped using them around the time reveal the shield transformers came out too much stuff selling out on post date and never getting restock
false alarm    
whats yall opinion on beyblades more so specifically the new burst toys    ive got a friend whose pretty into it and while i hold nostalgia for it the quality of the toy doesnt seem worth the price and every time i google one of them its about how the western version is a cheap piece of crap
i loved them when i was younger  we would have neighborhood beyblade tournaments  we ripped our battle arenas to shreds  the coolest part was customizing the beyblades with parts from other sets to see if we could make the ultimate one  we even banned those heavy lights and sounds blades from the tournaments because you were a cheating bastard if you used them    they also came with little model kits i believe which were a lot of fun to put together
  i actually bought a bunch of the new ones today the designs are fucking great now and the customization is really fun looking up stats on the app and making a good beyblade is fun
  hasbro ruined super z
  hasbro beys could never really compete with tt anyway it doesnt matter    hasbros target demographic 6 years old children doesnt care and msot people who do just buy the japanese tt version anyway
  thats actually the one i bought recently as my first dip into beyblades ive switched jobs away from anyone who would remotely be interested and the new hasbro ones look disappointing compared to the tt ones so i may just order some online and stew in my loneliness
name a bey that lasted more in its generations meta
  well done what i can only assume is named stone age leo    and man they really upped their design game since then
theres not a single chouz design i dont like every single one of them is sexy as fuck hasbro fucking it up with a shitty gimmick is sad especially considering importing is expensive since im a third world shitter  the anime has no subs past like episode 26 of god and some episodes of chouz though and thats sad since i really enjoy it
  this is one of my favorites but i really like this terrible one in pic related
  was it actually bad i remember it and bump king doing decently well in battle
  i thought it did great too but its not very very good i guess in the world of competitive whooping all the school kids asses doesnt matter lol
  its called bistool
  i how hasbro does a hyperblades version of th chouz beys with the metal layers that they were suppose to have
  pretty neat  while i skipped the first gen remember liking the metal generation beyblade designs and buying a good deal of them from the looks of it theyve gone all out with the burst designs  spoilerhows the anime/spoiler
  wolborg ms
  wasnt wolborg counted as plastic generation  weird because there was nothing in common between hms and previous beyblades
  the anime treats the two as the same but i dont think takara held mixed formats tournaments during hms short life the toys are obviously not interchangeable and theres a big performance gap between the two
  if you liked season one of the original series you might enjoy it
bought a bunch of tt burst beys last year because i thought they were cool  didnt even use them just liked thinking of cool combinations and parts  got kind of addicted of watching youtube videos of battles  after a month or two i got tired of it  now have a bunch of shit collecting dust  with the new choz line i dont even know of those god parts are even worth selling    plastics are addicting
personally i find the designs of burst beys to be way over designed but the gimmick and functionality of them works like a charm and the four plastic gen molds resolve my issue with the messy god bey aesthetics
  haha same    i wish i had people to play with
  there are a few gems in the burst line up that i really like like shelter regulus its just too bad that it bursts too easily though the new dash drivers help it out a lot
  ive heard hasbros regulus is better
  theres not a single chouz design i dont like  theyre all so bulky

welcome and join us in discussing the greatest and most customizable toyline of all current theme is orks orks orks military monster girls and more orks     no bricklink for mega though    previous thread 
  awwa man i just moved from aus to nz and got them here for 18 each at the warehouse was 10 their sale price or regular price
bashing cod with some destiny
the goblank cometh
  i cant believe you done this
  12 aud regular price whats with nz and expensive mega
  dat wall    you mexican anon
the gobling      nope just experimenting with backdrops for pics
  forgot pic
  awwa man what have i done oh well hopefully the money i save on rent by moving here can compensate for the increased price on mega
  you definitely will save in the long run fuck australian property prices zoomers are absolutely doomed    its not like australia usually has mega to buy anyways heres hoping nz actually stocks shit
so were getting another tank motherfuckers
  and a new cod armory
    where are you finding this
  a guy on the mexican mega fanpage in fb contacted mega to see what they would release in mexico in 2019 usually the person handling megas fb page doesnt know shit but this time they replied with these images from what looks like a catalog
this is awesome but does this mean mega is officially not being distributed in america
  not necessarily the catalogue is in spanish so they probably have different versions for different markets this might mean these wont be released in other spanish speaking countries though
  i recognize the care packages from older threads and online but not seen the 1st one on the bottom row
  most of the stuff in that catalog is old and not available in mexico before
  depends everything on here  except for the new armory is available
  its not been seen before looks like a yuri/juggernaut maybe theyll release that one in the near future they seem to sell pretty well
are unopened xenomorphs and bloodied xenomorphs worth anything now
  yes and not really on the bloody ones but they still sell for 10 to 15
  the original xeno is still sought after you could get 1015 for it bloodied one nah its become pretty common because that wave is showing up in a lot of walmarts recently you can also still get it for retail price at bbts
fyi amazon mexico has the ghaul set once again available for preorder
this just showed up at my walmart in mexico for around 33 usd i know what im building tonight hopefully it will show up soon for anons in usa
  whoa didnt know they made shipping containers     pretty neato
been building up a little base full of all kinds of customized and repainted figures havent taken an updated picture in forever
  rainbow flag
  i like my seedy businessman selling missiles
      celebrated my state being the 13th to strike down the same sex marriage ban years ago
  lots of repainted little guys and cobbled together parts post apoc ninja turtles hanging out with the terminator 40k space marine discussing big guys with my gattling trooper
  tried to pose them all so they look busy or interacting with each other
  these guys just chilling out
  debating swapping out middle guys head looks kinda like chris redfield with it
  last pic fucking randy just hanging out i hate this guy
awesome setup anon
  thanks a lot of little custom buddies ive made for my board base might get a second lego board to expand it and reorganize
  dust your bricks anon a little compressed air can do wonders
  missiles    why buy those when you can get a tank from good ole honest spock   le greedy vulcan
utterly perplexed my gfs dad while i was taking these    he was high as balls and just goggled
  do these look like the kind of boys you should trust with a tank
    chris redfield    i see you got a leon kennedy too
  sweet im gonna copy you if you dont mind and make a rainbow flag for my base
i hope we get more third party mega parts in the future like that one group doing the heads and weapons there are so many existing custom recipes that are just a part or two away from looking perfect if someone started making those id be so hyped
  tried to sculpt hair on to make him look like me also did a little dry brush on the armor to help with depth fine tip sharpies are good for dotting eyes back in
  a sig fig    think this is my first time encountering a mega sigfig gotta say thats awesome unlike lame lego sigfigs
  him and my alien security officer are maybe my favorites though its hard to choose from all of them even made a little fallout power armor guy
  thats fucking awesome post that in the photography thread too
  thanks   i had a bunch of shit on the inside of my lens and on the sensor and this was one of the last pics i took before i got it fixed
  heres one with the guy in the back in a bit more focus
because i get bored and the lighting is good heres my favorites ive repainted and customized from left to right    garth the alien security chief  a little spartan of me  big friendly the slow but effective heavy  t800 with some tweaks to make him cooler  colonial marine with better body  juggernaut heavy or fallout power armor
  is this some cod vs halo thing going on      heh awesome really wish i had a dozen of the big cabal guys to play with  chad cod body for the colonial marine right
  combo of that and a halo body
visited my local liquidation centre and they had quite a bit of mega stuff for once previously theyd only ever had a pile of the halo ghost with jul mdama this time there was some tmnt a few dinotrux sets that i was barely aware of and then pics related
  these latter two images are what really got me never saw any of the terminator line in stores around here heard they appeared in dollarama once but that was it now suddenly theres a wall of the single figs
  and all these the asscreed army builders were an interesting bunch didnt realize until i got home that they had a mix of four and fivepack versions of some ended up with one of each of the french soldiers set
  im kinda jealous id buy the terminator stuff up like crazy what store was that    bought a collection off a local dude earlier been sorting through it all trying to figure out what to sell and what to keep
  gimme those series 8 figs lol bianca amors a liquidation centre chain that has stores across western canada theyve been my regular source of chinese legos for a couple years now
  im far away from canada     one of the boxes of vehicles also have 3 other smaller boxes of stuff lol
  i see the odst scorpion nice score missing out on that set is probably my biggest mega regret alongside the halo wars elephant and the mammoth
  yeah it has a few gems in it mostly older figures but those are new to me     its hard to part with any of it i have mostly newer figs and vehicles but the old ones have some charm to them
  yeah the pieces are a cyclops      holy shit thats an amazing store i would buy half a dozen of those terminator troop packs
  its ironic how mega treated the grunts as badly as the covenant in those first few years heck the first wave of sets didnt even include any weapons for them and on later occasions they were lucky if they got a pair of plasma grenades to go full kamikaze      only bought one myself already had one off of amazon caved earlier this year when the price dipped slightly got the t1000 at the same time for nearly four times the liquidation centre price its tempting to go back for more but i cant really see much use for so many in my collection
  you could set up a cotton farm anon    and gear up for a crusade      holy fuck id buy ten of those terminators with that many you could even build a laser death camp with the terrain parts    french soldiers are cool too i wish i had one for the flag to mount on french armoured car customs
  some of those have sweet paint apps custom painted
  yeah he had painted a grunt rookie and caboose
  nice i really like the detail
  damn that collector pretty dank ive also finally solved my unarmed grunts issue thanks to the newer stuff packing covenant weapons with spartans
also had a couple sealed sets ill likely build this or the new mantis next time i have free time and some motivation       id trade series 8 figs for termiantor sets but yeah shipping wouldnt make it that affordable
  i want moar nmpd
  i like nmpd but it did not sell so sadly we likely wont ever see more nmpd
  what grunt did you use in the base here and what color paint im dying to update my squads
  id have to ask the seller what paint he used it was a grunt from the new bag series     he did a better job than the ones i did for sure i used vallejo mecha paint on those orange and mixed in a drop of gold the grunts got dipped in some rit dyemore graphite
1/5
  2/5
  3/5
  4/5
  5/5
  oh its from a seller do they have an ebay
  great shots bro  still needing to get that figuredamn amazon scalpers 
    damn id love some knights and pirates  hell some silver dudes  robopacks as well  where is this place and would you middleman
  no
  i bought a collection from a local instagram user he had painted a few customs so i dont think he is doing any commisions or anything seeing as he sold his collection     so far ive been sorting it and piecing together vehicles
  reminds me to check out the local dollarama heredamn thats a nice find  fyisaveonfoodsof all placesi got that river boat cod boat with the the 2figs set for under 20bucks
stopped in a dollar general for milk found tmnt series 6 blind bags
  nice how much are they going for there    also any other sightings anywhere else anybody im not seeing anything new or notable besides american girl stuff at ross and tuesday morning marshalls and tj maxx never have anything mega either
  never even saw series 5 anywhere wtf
  about tree fiddy       have seen series 5 at dollar general about the only place walmart had them by their registers but sold them on clearance long ago
  oh fuck i need that donny
  who is the secret fig also need that skullface donny to match my playmates fig
  i stopped by a dg and didnt see these but did find a cod outrider and the motorbike raid sets that ive been looking for
  but did find a cod outrider and the motorbike raid sets  score
  forgot to askhow u pay 
  cash
  credit card    the bike was 1050 and the outrider was 550
ghaul preorder arrived to work  one hour after i left the office    welp at least i will surely build it tomorrow
  are you american
  looked like they had just put out the box at mine so maybe check in a week or whenever they stock here is the code that april had so may want to avoid her if you dont like reduced articulation     i picked up an orange hazmat guy today too good army builder
  classic colors bebop  i might have a donny let me check     when i picked them up i think they had different serials but the first digits were  april 15  bebop 12  elite ninja 14  fishface 13
  i generally adore the 2k12 figures just wish they had given them elbow joints its a weird omission i wonder if they had to cut costs since the figures are so bulky compared to typical mega stuff
id never heard of gabes before walking into one the other day but its a ross/marhalls type of place and i am very pleased now
    not too bad for mcfarlane
even the head has good articulation theres a dumbbell joint inside and a balljoint where neck and chest meet
  while the articulation is nice those are the same joints they have been using since the walking dead  theyre super brittle turn white and snap easily the 1 issue with mcfarlane was the articulation for sure but closely following that was the joints that broke  i dont give a shit about fortnite either but i thought this would be a good chance to give mcfarlane another chance and nah not for 25 bucks
  holy shit they even have toe joints this is mcfarlane
  no kidding how did this get past his worldfamous antiarticulation autism
  have you actually bought the figure tested the articulation and witness it break perhaps if they threw that much effort into articulation they may have updated the plastic quality since then
  mcfarlane  doing anything good    the dude loves to cut corners almost as much as the chinese    its a damn shame he has a license i really wanted to get some decent fortnite toys for my younger cousins for christmas
  have you actually bought the figure  no    have you actually watched the video in op  the dude reviewing it goes over the fact that the wrist and ankles feel like theyre going to be the first things to go  dont be blindsided that you actually have articulation this time around its still the same cheap plastic
  a lot of reviewers say the same thing about figuarts wrist joints just because the joints are thin doesnt mean theyll break and if anything robo usually says that as a caution not because itll break he did say the ankle felt weird but that might be because the peg is too thick and if its a clearance issue some eat would get them moving properly ill definitely give these a try i think they have definite potential
every single american company btfo
those knees and elbows are real ugly but i guess theyre effective
  these look like the polar opposite of the walking dead figures though
my god this shit is good after all they are very well painted and those butterfly joints killed welcome to 2020 mcfarlane
okay now give me a clubfoot spawn with this articulation
  do they still make many spawn figures rarely see the series talked about these days
  mcfarlanes halo figures had toe joints too     probably the only new thing in these figures are the double jointed elbows and the lower torso joint everything else his other figures featured or had an equivalent of at one time or another everything together nice
  yes a few months before tru went under tru actually had a pretty good handful of them for sale i think they were exclusives had like 3 or 4 poa though and were all stupid cut joints
  sh figuarts neck shoulders torso waist hips wrists ankles toes  marvel legends/dc icons elbows and knees  it all works perfectly    did did someone kill todd and take his place
  not at all
  all new sculpt  35 poa  fully painted   multiple accessories   25 usd    thats a pretty big btfo buddy
    mcfarlane was always a bro as fuck toy company giving way more value with his toys than most other ones their halo line was absolutely nuts with all the articulation and paint they had and they were inexpensive too even for their size  only toy biz was broer    it just shows how much other companies overcharge for their wares its also crazy and people believe that having drop down hips two double joints at the neck and inner socket shoulder joints should even increase the costs to 50
  its also crazy and people believe that having drop down hips two double joints at the neck and inner socket shoulder joints should even increase the costs to 50    a lot of pricing comes down to the size of the production run affecting the price per unit the last shf goku is like 30 because they made and will continue to make a ton     well have to wait and see how well these fortnite figures hold up but the halo figures i happened to pick up over the years have been great
  it really does come down to this   halo line you mentioned had almost no limit for reuse of molds for spartans so they can afford going the extra with them    the expensive japanese stuff they are almost all aimed at a niche market you can even think the other way around to a degree because you are selling to a small group you have to charge more per figure no matter how simple or complicated they may be if you have to charge that much you might as well make them seem like they are worth the price so there you get all the parts paints and size manipulation because to a certain point it doesnt matter if you can only sell so little of them   thats the downside to making ips thats not mainstream loved by the masses
    this implies that mcfarlane has a large amount of orders but they are way more limited than back in the halo days  and these are all brand new molds especially this pink bear thing that probably wont be reused except for maybe some cheap redeco    while its true that the us market is a couple of times larger than the japanese market it does show the true cost of these things especially when us stuff is sold in japan for the same price as here whereas the price doesnt change when they bring their toys here despite their popularity in the us like video game properties
  mcfarlane might be thinking the tremendous popularity of the game means massive sale numbers so they went ambitious with it for the first wave at least it might dwindle if they underperform video game toys are tricky with hit or miss
i thinkt he reason this and the halo figures have more articulation is because theyre based off game models designed to move not drawn art or sculpts that mcfarlane wanted to remain faithful to since these game models are made to move the design philosophy is different
  i think that much is obvious as the articulation is more than their destiny borderland and cod figures but these are more expensive than the other lines  so for five more bucks you get an extra waist joint another neck joint inner shoulder joints pull down hips and a toe hinge    five bucks for five extra joints not sure if the double hinged elbows and knees count as extra as theyre normally just revoltechtype joints
ill buy when back bling and weapon packs come outi dont have any of the released 4 skins ingame at all
  each figure does come with their own back bling and one weapon each plus their pickaxe youd think theyd have to make accessory packs at some point though
i want the raptor bc he looks likea gijoe
why are they all left handed
  its time for some representation in a right handed world
  i guess they made the pickaxes the main weapons because youve got one of them all the time whereas the other weapons need to be picked up  its a bit odd though
  would be nice to get either a second set of hands or just some variety once in a while some variety in how they hold their guns would be good
just got skull trooper from my local gamestop today comparing cayde side by side skull definitely takes the cake happy with my purchase and forward seeing more of them soon
  i wish my gamestop would get their shit together theyre backed up on product and not putting stuff out cause they dont have time and spaceits annoying
  sounds like they wont be your gamestop for much longer if theyre not selling shit    wheres your next nearest one
  still waiting for a review of consthicctor
  i refuse to buy anything at my gamestop because of their retarded prices i saw they had the dota archer figma on sale on sale meant being reduced to 90 down from 140
  i mean its just a convenience charge if anything if you find what youre after and there arent a lot of choices unless you want to pay shippingso you either grab it or you dont or wait and see if it goes on clearance
mcfarlane finally makes good toys  theyre for fortnite
  well no shit thats where all the money is they finally acquired a license to something thats mega popular would make good toys and appeals to a mass audience thatd actually buy toys children
  isnt there ninja or samurai skins itll be cool to get those
  the next eave has a cyber ninja i think im personally hoping for the black hooded skin and the frost viking
  next wave
reporting from tru canada these are selling like hot cakes 8 skull troopers sold out and 3 hug team leaders out of 8 sold in around 3 hours from open these are off to a great start    also saw the jazwares 4 line though theyre street dated for dec 1st theyre priced at 2499 5 dollars less than the mcfarlane ones they come with a pickaxe and a piece of a wall they have lootboxes sold separately with weapons and other gear theyre quite well articulated theres 5 in the first wave
  mcfarlanes halo line was better  28 poa  tons of figures that was so expansive that it rivaled gi joe  vehicles  true to scale giant figures
  tfw mcfarlanes falcon will never become reality
  28 poa  and each and every one of those points blocked by the sculpting
  yeah this was why i never liked mcfarlane the jointing schemes were good but his muh sculpt autism and refusal to cut away sculpting to allow for decent range of motion made a lot of potentially great toys just ok instead
  well it looks like that wont be as much of an issue for the fortnite figures outside of a few bits that hit up against each other that can be avoided with some finesse they dont run into clearance issues
  yeah they do look decent shame its fucking fortnite of all things overwatch i might have bitten on but fortnite just does not interest me at all
fortnite really is the best thing to happen to humanity in decades
      
  that rust lord guy looks cool hopefully mcfarlane makes that too might get one for when we finally get junkrat and roadhog figures
how is it these are out but we dont have any good in hand pics of them yet
  i dont give a hoot about fortnite but this seems like go custom fodder
  a total of one of the four game stops in my immediate area have them so while theyre out they arent everywhere yet im kind of curious who else is going to carry them or if game stop is gonna be the only brick and mortar option    could always watch one of the youtube reviews in the meantime
well i got this thing anyone interested in some pics
  comparison pictures with other lines would be nice
  yes show us kind anon
late reply guys this is one of the best burger boi toys that i have ever bought
any recommendations of figures for scale i mostly have 1/12 and 118
cuddle team leader and neca lich king
its got an ok butt if anyone wants fan service
    and of course it is an absolutely towering monstrosity
i can honestly overlook the scale
  love them paint apps    is the joint at the ankles a revoltechtype and is it moldedi n metallic pink or is it painted if its painted has the paint scratched off      also do you have any mls or mezco figures to show scale with other 112 lines
where is the penny figure i need her fat ass sitting on my desk like now
  its a ratchet joint thank god the metallic parts are just painted unfortunately the paint on the stomach does rub alittle and i have had paint get scuffed
  i dont own any ml or mezco i do have a mafax gwenpool sitting around waiting to be opened
i feel like this thing is going to get retarded expensive when the zoomers and /v/ start picking them up and paying scalper level prices i have seen it before
  it looks decent for 20 bucks cant wait to see if it gets scalped or shelf warms
mcfarlane finally works out how articulation works  they use it on a shit license at a retarded scale
  i dont see how this is a bad thing they will get other licenses eventually
  it literally scales with nothing its far too huge for 6 scale figures and too small for 12/16 stuff literally the only shit it looks not completely retarded with is pak and thats not exactly a great selling point    i dont know why im surprised this is mcfarlane their incompetence is the stuff of legend
  heh mcfarlanes lines dont even scale with each other most of the time kind of surprised that its even bigger than necas stuff
  so we should take advantage of this and scalp to profit off of zoombers
  scales with nothing  not wanting an amazon to bully your figures and give them death by snusnu
  yes god speed
  hard to take seriously as an amazon when shes wearing a gigant pink teddy bear mask
  maybe people are just hamfisting their figs    i read a lot of shit online about people breaking their figs just by touching/swapping accessories figmas revoltechs play arts you name it theyve broken it yet none of mine ever break and i play with them constantly
  oh that size is disappointing i was thinking of maybe buying some of the skull troops and the yellow balaclava guy as random mooks but in this scale that really doesnt work might still go for the cyberninja though
  judging by the s ize with the warhammer figure it looks like itll scale with most of necas stuff which means its also in scale with dcc and diamond select figures  7 or 1/10 scale    or you can pretend shes just a tall chick  the warhammer figures are actually pretty small
  thay isnt a warhammer figure its star craft
  yeah i can definitely agree that theyre hamhanding their shit because you really need to try to break mcfarlanes stuff    since i use a lot of mcfarlanes stuff for customs im constantly pulling shit off to use     also to try and get extra range from the joints im also forcing the joints with a lot of pressure and tugging the joints off to cut away at hte sculpt to extend that range  id say theyre slightly less durable than a hasbro figure
  why the fuck are you not using a mythic legion
  he probably didnt want to wait 2 years to get his figures because he heard about the poor qc and now that the wave is out 4h doesnt have any stock to sell him    and who wants to pay scalper fees especially when the mythic legion figures have less articulation than mcfarlanes normal figures
have we hooked subjectanon we hooked subjectanon didnt we    oh well we had a good run
  what there arnt any warhammer figures my dude
  what are you getting at
  a rip off is same shit    for the guy who wants to know how itll compare with his mythic legions heres a he man figure compared with it
  he probably doesnt like his opinion to be contradicted by anyone who actually owns the figures
  so im just going to say that she will tower over these she is taller then the lich king kneeling she most likely want fit with any scale just get it as a stand alone figure
  defends blatant shit because muh brand  thinks mcfarlane is good  uses topical filenames  i mean its just a hunch but im usually right when i smell subjectanon
  the gun fits well in 1/12 its actually under scaled for the cuddle team leader
  show me who subject anon is because i think you are full of shit
  see  
  wrong my friend 
  its either subjectanon or someone very similar to him
  wanting to shit up a thread because someone showed a comparison between the figures to show how the fortnite figure will scale with mls  you trolls need to just fuck off
  you know what you did dont play dumb
  a picture showing a comparison and text accompanying it to explain how other lines compare to the lich king    just fuck off if you got triggered by any of that troll
this is some really strange trolling because i have no clue why everyone is mad
  he doesnt know  youre either lying or stupid
  its sounds like it just a troll who doesnt like that various lines are in scale with the mcfarlane figure and is closer to mls size than one would assume based on teh under scale examples so far
  yea jazzwares is making four inch toys he should wait for those
here is a 1/6 3a figure
warhammer vs lich king
is anyone upset yet
    good grief shes fuckhueg literally why
  thats a nice custom    acid rain figure as a base
i want to post comparisons too
  mcfarlane is charging extra for it because of the license and the amount of articulation hes putting in to it in order to give you more value to the toy  basically the same shit when a collector company uses diecast to a toy people will feel like something is more fairly priced if its larger or weighs more despite the size and diecast not really increasing the cost of production in the case of diecast costs go downs more than if they had used just plastic    this is why neca mezco dc collectibles and other collector companies are usually in 110 scale too the scale difference is almost negligible in terms of production costs
  diecast used well can actually objectively improve a toy though especially with regards to stability and durability making it bigger is only an improvement if you want a big toy
  diecast can be fragile and the paint scraps off easily  diecast is seriously shit because the paint can be rubbed away not just scratched off    only thing diecast is good for is for vehicles and armor because at least if the paint wears away itll be sorta realistic in that fashion    if they seriously need the weight just stick iron ingots or some other heavy metal into the soles of hollow feet or into the torso if it needs balance which is moot in a world where stands are given away for free diecast is a pain
  nice comparison dude
  funny considering that the toy in my collection with the highest diecast content the soc spec eva 01 is also one of the best toys ive ever handled ill be willing to wager youve never handled a highend diecast figure in your life
toy when
  stability and durability are both questionable diecast pieces get more chips than a bag of lays and its only really stable when used in the legs too many companies overuse it and slap it in joints and upper body thinking weight is better and it results in bad balance or joints that arent easily fixed
  diecast pieces get more chips than a bag of lays  people keep saying this and im honestly kind of puzzled i treat my toys ok but im not particularly super careful with themand none of my diecast toys have chips or flaking thats all my shfs with diecast feet of which i own many my srcs my socs my sentinel stuff etc i mean im sure it happens as ive seen photos but it just doesnt seem that easy to chip to me
everyone needs to shut the fuck up and post the skin they want to see the most
  that looks pretty sweet i dont know most skins but id love to see pic related
  i want jonesy
    aim has become a top want   i want rust devil too but jazzwares is doing him in tiny gi joe scale almost
lol
i love you guys
  fuck scarlet rain is such a cool looking figma ive not watched accel world but i kinda want her
  dude its one of my favorite figures unfortunately she comes with so many small clear bits its the only figure that i own that isnt complete i think they run pretty cheap you should get one
    the 4 line from jazwares including teasers of whats next they actually look really good for jazwares       ragnarok is on the way from jazwares at least alongside another favourite in raven
  no consthicctor again  jesus what the fuck does it take for them to make one is she actually the least popular ingame
  no one except this place cares about her and shes too different from the others and has no cool factor like the ninjas or evil vikings to be worth making the target audience is still technically little boys and i dont think a fat woman would be of very much interest
  nobody plays stw if she ever makes it into br then maybe
  ragnarok is on the way from jazwares at least alongside another favourite in raven  nice of the ones i know those are my favourites
  thats a really good idea they had packing a figure in with loads of accesories like that what with how popular all the blind boxes are where you have to unpack loads of shit   these are gonna sell ridiculously well no wonder theyre already coming out this saturday
  the figures themselves only come with a pickaxe or it seems like a gun with omega based on those tni pics theyre also selling lootboxes that come with various accessories they list out what comes inside but idk if theyre all the same
  never seen accel world but i always headcannoned scarlet rain was a relative of drossels ala scrappy doo
  no mcfarlane uses this stiff plastic thats extra fragile i only displayed 10th anniversary spawn and still somehow snapped an ankle peg i had to replace with a small screw
mexico  diecast  bloomf  jin  hasbloob    yes thats nice can we talk about mcfarlane and fortnite please
  do we know if the figures come with backpacks too from what ive seen it seems like the backpacks were designed to fit with skins stylistically is that a thing ingame
  diecast anon diecast
  oh right sorry forgot to add to my post      diecast sux xd
ah stuck behind a 4pack but damn i have to say im really impressed with jazwares this is way beyond what they normally do just like mcfarlanes are way beyond what they normally do if nothing else all these companies that are working on fortnite have stepped up their game big time really impressed with the efforts of both these companies
  but does it have diecast
    someone found them in stores
  damn thats annoying but i really want ragnarok as an enemy for my fantasy hacks  ive even got the perfect mount for him  im actually really happy that jazzwares is doing figures too at least theirs scale with some other lines
  where are these being sold    looking to check em out before purchasing them
  how do two companies have rights to make action figures of one property does the scale difference act as a loophole    usually its one company makes action figures while others make candy/shampoo bottle toys
  different scales  different markets that theyre being sold to    by splitting up the license like this they make more money because more companies are willing to pay up for a smaller peice than they would a larger chunk   so instead of paying to make all toys in america theyre paying just for that specific size which splits up the cost of the license so only major companies like mattel or hasbro can pay up to produce both 118 and 112 scale figures  or like buying a condo where only a millionaire can afford to own the apartment building but a bunch of different people of modest income can own an apartment on each floor    having different companies making different toys is good for the toy community too like what if some toy company got the entire license to only made 6 diecast figures and charged 125 for them because a couple of collectors will pay high prices for cheapshit material as long as it feels heavy  by splitting the license you get more options you have different companies being able to actually target consumers who enjoy different scales or higher end plastic injection molded figures that dont need to cost over 30 because of gullible collectors
   thighs  more like t h i c c team leader
  i have the original mcfarlane monsters series from the late 90s they basically just begin to disintegrate
 more 4inch stuff jazware going all out
  they really are and im actually quite excited ive seen the figures in person they were put out accidentally and they look quite good with pretty nice paint and good articulation the price i saw at tru in canada was 2499 though which definitely prices me out if thats the case id say 1499 is probably the sweet spot but it is what it is well see come dec 1st i guess
saw the mcfarlane cuddle team leader and skull trooper at walmart yesterday have to say that they appear to have turned out pretty well
  why are they only releasing those two it seems like
not sure what the deal with the other two is
  my walmart has shit   the other walmart i go to also has shit    wehre the hell is the section i can buy these toys at last time theywere in the electyronics section but all the destiny shit was taken down along with everything else and two months later found on clearance along with cod figures that never appeared anywhere    the walmart closest to me is a normal walmart and the other is a super walmart or whatever those are called
  the local super walmart had them in a large bus display in the book section
      the others will be out in december i believe maybe they didnt have them all ready right away so just released the first 2 first as a kind of teaser
  try jamestop
  yep gamestop here had omega and the fort starter set out already
  show me his gun
  gamestop right now walmart will probably come later if they ever carry anything that isnt stranger things and some basketball fucks
black knight and raptor are set for december 15th at gamestops    also jazwares has a site up for their figures lots of pics 
  walmart got a big train of pallets of fortnite stuff that looks like the stupid bus the figures are on there should be out already
  i just did a google and apparently for any uk guys here they should be out in asda and smyths this weekend   however the fact that i only live close to one asda i dont really like my chances of beating every kid/mother to these figures if these arent well stocked theyll be a nightmare to get
the real questions are how do the weapons go with other figure lines
  when the skin actually comes out
  not stage 1 calamity with jiggly tits
  well ok theyre released now in canada the treasure chests are 1799 the single figures are 2499 the omega figure with some bonus accessories is 3999 the 4 pack the only pack with some measure of non absurd price but maybe a bit high is 6999 and the playset pack is 8499 no sign of the rust lord pack on the tru website
  that looks fucking awesome  mcfarlane get on that
  this
  rust lord comes in the llama pinata that comes with 23 accessories
  thanks i know what it is i just meant price though if the omega set is anything to go by im picturing something like 49995999 at least
just found the jazz o e in us gamestop    19 for a joe scale figure    is it gamestop being batshit or epic    also they only had genji in the singles    also had pinata build pack and chest     all seem bizarrely priced
  genji as you call him has quite a few more accessories than normal thats why hes 1999 the normal ones that just come with one dio piece and a pickaxe cost 1299    as the other anon said if you think these prices are bad genji/omega costs 40 in canada and the regular single figures cost 25
  ah 12 sounds a bit more reasonable still theyre valuing those shitily painted accessories quite a bit now arnt they
  wait the regular ones dont even come with one gun     how pitiful
  i know and just because im mad about the prices in canada for 2999 you get mcfarlanes figures come with a gun back bling and pickaxe while for 2499 you get jazwares figures with a pickaxe and wall piece someone was definitely a bit loopy when they made this decision im pretty sure this would price out many potential customers i guess ill stick with my original plan of just picking and choosing what i like from the mcfarlane line
  and chest  how much is the little weapons pack chest
ps skins when
  ten bucks but its a little bigger than you might think you could def fit one of the figures inside
  just saw that at my walmart too
  local wm put it out on bf  all the pinatas are gone  tons of mcfarlane left
  well i was wrong about pricing themselves out passed by a walmart and i dont know how much they had but they were cleaned out 25 apiece the profit margins must be quite high
  i wonder if the lack of variety from mcfarlane at the moment is hurting them jazwares going all out from the get go with a ton of figures was probably a good idea like was mentioned both of these companies have really stepped it up for this license
  just got this guy and the loot chest
i got myself a llama and a 4 pack since it seems theyre supposed to go in tandem     i gotta say the quality is way higher than i thought it would be    its just my rust lords arm was broken in package i hope jazwares cs isnt terrible
for those wondering skull trooper is damn nice and solid
  and for this guy     it still bothers me a lot that the trigger hands are left
  and the fingers are hard plastic right i think i recall hearing that otherwise it would be possible to just cut the finger free and give it a light stretch
  detail looks alright but compared to mcfarlanes it looks pretty mattel  detail actually looks less than your average gi joe
  youre a fucking idiot
  what a bummer they might have a customer support email or something
damn these actually look decent they might make good customs fodder given they seem to be cheap and relatively well made    also i cant be the only one annoyed that mcfarlane and jazzwares finally learned to make good figures and wasted it on fortnite right
  also i cant be the only one annoyed that mcfarlane and jazzwares finally learned to make good figures and wasted it on fortnite right  i look at my mk and sf figs n spit
  well if they can extend these skills in future properties thatd be great but im pretty sure these will be an outlier for example one of the main reason for mcfarlane to have them be so articulated was for emote posing
  mk    not the best track record
  somehow my pic didnt go through
  implying toy companies wont step up their game to try and make action figures integrate meme posing functions
  seems he got the president skroob treatment
    fore jazwares the figure construction started on the short lived assassins creed line which only saw limited release of 3 figures
  indeed so it seems like they hired a new sculptor to do these so perhaps thats why theyre starkly different       wasnt the implication that they would do it those dances and emotes and what not are a big part of fortnites popularity and in the product description of mcfarlanes figures it explicitly states their ability to pose in such ways
  the gamestars versions never released right i cant remember how many lines they got out before they went belly up
  why are there people like this what a waste of time
  i enjoy his content 
  a rising tide raises all ships only the surefire appeal of a bankable property like fortnite could get these companies to invest the time money and resources to drastically improve the quality of their figures now well probably see that quality spill over to other properties as well
  i couldnt get my jazwares raptor to dab /
  gamestars from the now dead unimax got 3 waves of 6 figures each each wave a different game from crysis 2 the 4th red faction game and assassins creed brotherhood
  but he just threw the figures on the ground accidentally took them apart as he pulled them out then it was finished after he was done throwing the whole thing around genuinely curious what do you like about this i know its sometimes done for comedy but if you disrespect the product youre looking at why bother at all and if you have criticisms then outline them so we can know why you dont like it i guess i expect reviews to be informative and to show what i want to see out of the product like range of motion accessories etc
  did you not watch the video clearly these figures suffer from loose joints if the torso is so easily torn apart children take it out of the box like that in this day and age
  hes just upset nobody told him his ass was so big
  i left a message for customer support last night but im going to call em again tomorrow morning
are the mcfarlane figures hard to find had a couple assumed scalpers buying a ton of them plus limited lol balls only have like 3 cuddle leaders left on the pallet train
  skull trooper actually seems like hes selling very well with cuddle doing quite well too its too early to assume if theyll be rare or if mcfarlane will keep supplying them
  this ones way better imo
  would certainly make for a better figure considering how much the other ones design will interfere with articulation i wonder how theyre going to pull of drift
  oh nvm i took a look at the one they were going to make based on that placard at nycc and theyre doing the one with the vest so i guess theyve set a precedent that they wont always be going straight for the final version of a skin
  pic
  this pic they recently officially announced drift only indication of which is this pic so far and rex
    how well do the weapons scale with other figure properties
  wave 2 looks solid excited to hopefully see more at toy fair or sooner i think im just going to stick with mcfarlane on these the jazwares are overpriced in canada at least and i think mcfarlanes look like the better figures overall at their prices in the us though itd be fun to collect a whole bunch and have a whole diorama with the piece set up
caught a glimpse of a llama in a box about to be unloaded at target      didnt want to hang around like a total neckbeard ill check back tomorrow      frankly the final outfits tend to look way worse hoodie drift is ideal drift  that fuckking coat is ridiculous
  i guess cause they start to get over designed     that said any skin with masks id prefer if they had that and if the design isnt too obtrusive to articulation id prefer that the exception is ragnarok his final form is the way to go     im glad theyre going with the final omega and hopefully they do the same with carbide
  i thought there were 6 single packs and two 2 packs
  oh you sweet summer child you really dont understand how things work do you
  i think its safe to say that mcfarlane will treat their properties differently on a case by case basis as well as what their licenses allow     for jazwares i think this little improvement of theirs might be sometimes theyre trying to keep up i say this since their assassins creed figures are what set the precedent for this level of articulation for their figures unlike fortnite for mcfarlane so maybe given the property could utilize the quality they had those rwby figures that never saw the light of day who knows if thats still a thing theyd probably do it
target is getting in on the fortniteyness too
  trust me youre way off the mark on your assessment i work for jazwares ama
  i dont know shit about fortnite but i hope these sell well enough to get to wave 2 that fox mask dude looks neat
  ok then well then what did i get wrong talk to us a bit about the future of this line and other jazwares lines     based on the jazwares website they seem to have at least some intent in trying to improve things
  it always comes down to a few key figures in the company namely the ceo and his wife the reason that fornite figures came out looking good comes down to the fact that they spared no expense when it came to the brand which they only did based on the expectation that the brand would sell well   this wont apply to other properties unless they expect it to do exceptionally well in terms of sales  their push to change their public image is part of a greater plan to sell directly to the consumer and expand specialty sales   12 inch fornite figures will be coming out next year all part of their intent to expand to specialty markets
  how big is the jazzwares stuff joe scale im more into 6 than anything but if neither line is gonna match that id rather go with the 375 one
  ranging from 365 for female characters to 41 for characters with horns or helmets
  cool i cant believe im actually excited to look for jazzwares stuff but here we are
  i dont know the percent chance but the survival packs are a good source of weapons specially since some of them are modelled after real guns they can make good customs with the right paint job  anyways im glad youre hyped hope you have luck
  the tickle me elmo of 2018
are the mcfarlane ones getting even distribution i went to a target and gamestop on my way home and both of them had a bunch of the skull guy and no cuddle teams    also are people actually finding the jazzware ones yet amazon says january 5th for the single ones which is nuts and ebay has them for like a hundreds dollars for a set
  furries ruin everything
  the mcfarlane figures are in solid cases of 4 each so if youre only seeing skull trooper either they sold out of their stock of cuddles or they didnt put it out or ordered more skull without cuddles something like that skull trooper seems to be selling at least a bit better than cuddle team leader    and for jazwares the official release date is december 1st so yes they should be showing up
  so what else can you tell us any interesting tidbits about jazwaress fortnite figures     anything else jazwares in general is that rwby action figure series still a thing or has that been shelved
  rwby is dead i think the license is about to expire and the action figures have been dead in the water since the last year they didnt sell well there was someone who wanted to make some collectible 6 inch posable figures but thats just a hope i doubt the idea will get off the groundthe vinyls will probably be the last of the rwby line
  picked up the painter and a chest    ankles suck cause theyre painted over     elbows only bend to 110 degrees so they cant hold a gun two handed     backbling is too large and kinda gets in the way     other than that theyre ok
well goddamn finally saw these at my walmart and very nearly pulled the trigger for the skelly dude paint app was great with no smudging or scuffs and the accessories look neat enough to use for other figures but dammit i dont want to get into another franchise also dammit for making me want the drift one in wave 2
  does toy guru from matty collector still work there
  vehicles too
last thread     new toys everywhere preorders and imports and retail oh my
  that looks disappointing
  looks good to me
    that is a disappointing lilandra head sculpt
  lilandra head isnt great and i hate both of those guns but that rogue head looks great and i cant wait to put it on my real rogue
  im wondering if it was the same as the original they had tooled up
  negative
  duhhh how do i rule world
  virgin lilandra and chad gladiator
  what line is this from
  its from way back when hasbro had just restarted the line they were doing votes on what figures fans wanted to see     seeing them now its really amazing how far weve come
  wish they would have included a sexy mystique head instead of a half painted blue rogue head also some better guns for mystique
  i woulnt have minded a sexy face too yeah
  still no classic storm
  lilandra head    oh fuck you hasbro what are you playing at
  i like it but honestly could get her loose and wouldnt miss any of the extras
whats the best figure of classic iron man preferably like the model 3 or model 4 currently eyeing down the series 1 toybiz but if theres a better one let me know
  other than the toybiz figure i can only think of the hasbro and mezco figures the hasbro one doesnt look bad but its a little smaller than the toybiz one and doesnt have a moving face plate im not sure about the mezco figure though its been delayed for like six months now
  yeah i was tempted to put an order in but wasnt there a variant released early where the faceplates were all fucked like no magnet or something
what do you guys want toy wise with the infinity war 2 movie
  armored thanos war machine outrider and cull obsidian preferably marvel select maybe wong
  some of them or maybe even all of them were missing the magnets and had stuck face plates    really hoping shf gives us a decent captain america for once especially if hes in a more traditional outfit
  a captain america figure with an unmasked facesculpt that actually looks like chris evans    thats literally the one thing i want
  is that wm from a3 or a4 i honestly cant really tell anymore      i mean considering the only people to have done that are hot toys i wouldnt hold my breath chris evanss face is cursed
  its a4 concept art
whats the lilandra head about though and why the rogue head for a super expensive old figure
  some say it may be a baf lilandra but i think its hasbro catering to customizers you could stick her head on a basic body do a fairly simple paint job give her a cape and you get  i think hasbro knows they will never do a lilandra or madcap from that deadpool figure so why not at least pack in their head
i wouldnt mind a thane
was anyone bored by this  the movie was loaded with cool stuff and the toy was boredom
  bandai making you buy an entire new figure for the new parts is disappointing but i cant really say im shocked hasbro doing nothing at all not even in a 2pack or something is just surprising
  yeah i the im/strange/thanos 3 pack would have been great if it had nano tech parts
    the figuarts 50 is hands down the best not saying much its a masterpiece
has anybody fixed the ghost rider overbite here
  also some better guns for mystique    actually she has used a luger pistol in the comics before so its accurate to her character the rifle though is garbage i hate that gun     the lilandra head sculpt just seems so odd i would have preferred more weapons hands or a nonphasing head that you could use on another figure
  thats nack furrys needle gun everyone gets the needle gun
legends when he might be my 2 want now behind a comic hulk
  watcher eye in the chest or out
  the rifle is a gi joe gimmick gun from the second movie that got upscaled    kinda want the launcher
  the design itself is boring the armor is more human than robot anymore
  did i miss the thing none of the walgreens near me had him in stock despite them saying they had 25 available
    18 inch giant man    honestly thats kind of it
looks like d amazing and daredevil 19 have revoltech please reviews up
  toy spoils movie    incase anyone didnt know jessica chastain lilandra is actually mystique in disguise everyone was saying shes a skrull cause she can shapeshift idk how no one figured this out
  despite having different sku/item numbers not the upc the companys internal numbers from the other similar walgreens exclusives things is grouped together in wgs point of sale system with them so when the site says a store has 25 available its most often than not aint thing but their other exclusives sue reed johnny silver surfer medusa    i think this was the same before they started doing ffrelated characters yellow dd was in ml spidermans sku group black ant was in ml avengers etc think ff started getting their own group with namor but i never saw him on the site same with punisher though frank was probably grouped in ml spiderman i think only agent venom had his own sku cause he was the very first i remember looking up store locations on the site for him and every store that said he was available there actually had him
  then should i be worried that the walgreens link is inaccessible
  huh yeah the thing doesnt even show up in walgreens search results for marvel legends anymore so it looks like they removed it from the site altogether    damn i shouldve taken a mobile screen shot of his page before they took it down to ask around at stores ah well
  definitive mcu cap
  dunno if shell show up in avengers 4 but valkyriorarmored valkyrie from ragnarok    well of course get new costumes of existing characters in a4 but i doubt well get new characters outside of captain marvel
  what is this a dark phoenix spoiler man that movie is going to suck so much dick
think theyd do an shf rocket and groot iw 2 pack    those two figures by themselves just seem a little lacking
how does monster venom fare next to the revoltech figures whenever i see the revoltech version paired up with mls it looks like a beefy manlet
 hopefully a fraction of these get made    a4 movie   my man  wong  armored thanos  suped up war machine  rescue/armored pepper  outrider  chitauri 2 pack  hawkeye/ronin  black widow  armored hulk  shaved cap  iron man w/bfc big fucking cannon  odinforce thor  stan lee    comic   thane would be sweet  cosmo  quasar male  female  moondragon  jack flagg  star fox  champion of the universe  collector  grandmaster  gardner  runner  annihilus  lady death  super skrull  ronan  dr doom  kang  heimdall  skurge  warriors three  balder  red widow  ursa major  jarvis  quicksilver  jocasta
  i saw three of them a couple of days ago when i picked up magik here in east atlanta
so are u guys gonna get a nazi cap and nazi scientist 2 pack
  i dont care for hydra civil warrior but i would have been interested in an anad cap
  hope you get him anon i overpaid online because i couldnt find him and still feel like i got a good deal hes my favorite ml all year
  any release date
  nah she ded fuck her
  according to joe russo shes alive she korg miek and half of the asgardians were spared and made it off the ship via escape pods
  didnt they already say she has a much bigger role in avengers 4 along with nebula antman and hawkeye
when does gambit drop
  completely agree gimme that cool blue version instead so i can at least pretend hes a good guy      yes she was photographed walking to set and everything      the ml one wont be until march at the earliest no idea for the reno one
    no idea for the reno one  me neither the revo on the other hand is for march too
saw the spiderverse pack at target today
amazon black friday sale was fun getting these 3 for the same price as 1 legend figure was pretty sweet and add to the glory my friend didnt want his herbie that came with his sue so he gifted him to me
  noice i keep waffling if i want to get it i like the miles but gwen is to much like the one from the absorbing man wave
as of late i have been getting more mafex releases the new iron spider looks great so does the black panther now i see this shf captain marvel  she looks great i do want to preorder her but i am hesitant b/c in case mafex does release one a year later what should i do guys
  im just going to buy every captain marvel  that probably doesnt help you though
  preorder now at hlj or someplace that lets you cancel even if mafex does show one off itll be at least a year out based on the rest of their solicitations and even then you could just sell the shf and buy the mafex for a loss of 20 or something which you could consider the price of getting something a year early
  it does not lol but i appreciate your response       yea i think thats what i am gonna do if i can find one especially considering how good she looks compared to the legend i had exams this morning  missed out /    also does anyone have a mix of figures from legends shf  mafex preferably a female shf so i can see the differences in scale
  not on hand but as a rule figuarts are gonna be noticeably tiny next to legends bandai is really close to hasbros star wars stuff so that looks fine mixed up but legends are pretty huge compared to other lines thats one thing mafex and amazing yamaguchi has going for them they seem like theyre made to scale with legends
  maybe its just autism but it really really bothers me that zolas face art is at an angle especially in that pic since his body is facing the opposite direction
  apparently he has swapable face plates at least two more
  its not like he uses that to see
  i passed on it i hate the miles design and i already have the gwen from the absorbing man wave plus i already have a normal miles dont see much desire to own it
captain marvel trailer  
  looks better than black panther not exited about anything i see though kinda wish they werent just ignoring marvell but whatever
  kinda wish they werent just ignoring marvell but whatever  it was my understanding that hes in it just more in the flashbacks or something to set her up
  i thought it was confirmed he wasnt marvell and that he was actually one of the villains either way we arent getting him as the main character
  gay her politics are toxic and her feet are a hobbits nightmare and black male white female the movie my mcu is the one where thanos wins
  seconded an outrider especially as an army builder that 1/6 figure looks amazing hell hasbro can even go for cheaper than usual and reuse the six arm spidey for that
  armored thanos and hulk a better nebula and star lord with a closed jacket would also be nice
  her politics are toxic and her feet are a hobbits nightmare  you have more in common than you think
  no man im cool because i hate things im not like her girls are ugly and dump and have cooties
  source that sounds awesome 
  clearly we need visionaire technology here  
so long before shrek was a meme shrek was a pretty important movie to me i identified with shrek in a lot of ways and so i acquired a fairly large shrek collection it sort of became a part of my identity people knew me as the shrek guy in recent years i havent felt the same the collection hasnt been on display for about seven years now is it time to let go i dont want to sell it and then end up missing something that meant so much to me
  youll regret getting rid of it you probably feel a bit empty because theres nothing new of shrek lately i go through these phases myself i think the major culprit is that youre wanting more than just shrek on display maybe slim down a bit and put the rest in storage of some sort
its all trash op hurts but the truth always does
  i second what  said alternatively sell off or throw out what you dont want and keep the things you treasure most it also helps to check prices for some of the items you never know what you might have
it sounds like something you miss op and that you know this is something personal for you something you dont want to be swayed by the opinions of others about even if you did give in to that before     try getting out some shrek stuff and see how it makes you feel maybe cull your collection go from anything shrek to my favorite shrek items     i collect a few things with more merchandise than i could ever hope to own so i focus on just getting a few things i really like and being that person with some unpopular niche interests
i heard theres a reboot coming up soon shrek guy wait for the merchandise and keep your collection going
  oh yeah and based on your statement  is it time to let go  do you say that because you feel youve outgrown your collection or because you dont like shrek as much anymore ive gone through phases where i think toy collecting is childish or i need to move on yet it is enjoyable to me i appreciate these things more as an adult than i did as a kid because i better understand how they are made and what decisions they made during production its really fascinating seeing some behind the scenes stuff or noticing manufacturing decisions in the toy itself id not do anything too rash though just give it some time before going one direction or another its easy to purge a collection but it would be just as expensive and time consuming to grow it back again
    i feel ya i considered that but honestly once i start trying to consider what to get rid of my brain cant decide its like either all or nothing
  i have a friend with a large shrek collection as well dont give up it resonates with you for a reason maybe just redisplay a new piece every week or so
  i was able to get rid of some things by sorting them by most favorite to least favorite and then only keeping a certain portion of that list   but if youve got the space for it and you like the stuff why not keep all of it
  i guess thats also part of the problem i dont have a whole lot of space it all fits in my closet for now which is fine but is it really doing me any favors in there
  you have a few options   you could trim your collection down to a few items you can display designate a corner or a side table or a new shelf to shrek   you could rotate your collection as someone else suggested   you can always just display a few things for now and hold onto the rest   unless you can be sure youre never moving again you could end up living somewhere with more space in the future   and you can always find a new way to keep shrek in your life that works for you now like a keychain or something for your car   it might really be a good time to let go of your old collection but you dont have to forget about shrek if you still care about it
  wheres the mcfarland shrek stuff
  this     my cousin had a pretty cool shrek that had armor and wrestling ring ropes
  wait a minute shrek was a movie
weve all been there anon id recommend keeping them if they still hold a special place in your heart i once felt the same way about transformers in my late teens and cant help but wonder how much of a terrible mistake it would have been to sell them now that ive grown back into the franchise as an adult
put it in the attic/basement its worthless but will give you good memories when you find it decades from now
  nice collection but you should get some of the dolls youre also missing a bunch of the happy meal toys
  i dont want to sell it and then end up missing something that meant so much to me  dont fucking sell it  trust me its a mistake keep one or two of your favorites out and box the rest up trust me when i say that in 10 years or so you will get nostalgic for your old collection and they joy youll feel when you open up that ten year old box will make you feel like a kid on christmas morning dont sell your memories for a few dollars aka a few lunches at a burger joint

post lewd pics in lewd pic thread  get them all fucking deleted the next day    you know if a board doesnt have a relevant nsfw version then nsfw pics relevant to it should belong in that board you know kinda how it fucking works on /a/ that should apply to the whole site not just /a/ ffs    its funny too the pics deleted were almost all pics saved from /toy/ back before anyone gave a fuck about nsfw on this site since it was assumed rightly so that you give up any right to a sfw environment when browsing 4chan no matter what
  does oyaji have enough articulation to do mating press
  bless u anon that looks even more awful than i envisioned     can you put the uncensored version on imgur or something
      cant wait for my gwen to get here wes gonna have sum fun
  was she created by that guy who will punch you if you lewd his daughter
  no thats spider gwen
  gwen stacy  also why is she so jacked
  because cho is a god
  oh so hes a punk bitch racist who doenst like people disagreeing with him    a god    those dont exist
  muh gwenpool isnt gwen stacy    yeah ok her whole genesis was a gwen stacy joke she might not be gwen stacy in name or even character but the intention will always be there
  cho isnt bad  he draws a shit gwenpool though  also why is that the image that pops up when you google frank cho
  nah cho actually explicitly made it known he isnt some altright sympathizers hes just a nigga who loves titties
  he bought into the sjw narrative that comicsgate are altright nazis instead of just fans who are sick of sjws injecting their agenda into every comic the same fans who backed him when the sjws came for him
  why not make a thread over at doublechins dead /toy/ board
  because its fucking dead even deder than this board
  so what that only means the thread will stay up longer if we start using it they will come
  he also send ethan van sciver pictures of his asshole
                        niggers my niggers lets get back on track her and discuss what filthy things you would wanna do to this gwen figure my oyaji is rubbing his hands right now
  beverly headswap do it fggt
              anybody know what body was used for the lame ass penny wise pics
  i think its a vitruvian hacks female blank theyre 118 scale
  barely the clips that connect his thighs to his torso are pointed upwards instead sideways like figmas he can barely kick his legs forward but then again he is a fatass so i can look past that      here you go anon  
  wasnt there going to be a figure like this but by raita
  there is    
  waaaaah  they arent the boss of me
  much better
  i want it for those crazy upward tits
  classic raita tits would be better if they were a little more forward facing
does anyone know the parfom amazons release date
  just that its supposed to release in november
  maximum peepee
  i think it involves sex and dolphins
  got any examples of this
  i get it
  her tits are average desu but the full nude option is nice reissue when
someone asked for this
  im a little confused what exact scenario this is supposed to depict  the dolphin with the eyelashes printing is a female
  if you drink to much water it doesnt have to come out yellow
  stupid sexy flanders
  mein neger need new head sculpts
lewd
    somebody saves your pictures
anybody still in this thread
  what body is that
  1/12 sozaichan light flesh by premium parts collection
  does it have nipsvag
  i live in a basement
  iits an attic  but seriously where do you think we are
  oh god thats adorable
  nnani
    dark magician girl is a personal favorite
  now that is really something
    nothing at all  nothing at all  nothing at all
  you sir are on the wrong site if thats the thing youre going to complain about
  nothing lewd just think of it as a prebuilt model kit similar to the bodychan that shf did it comes with a few optional hands and necks to accommodate the different figma peg sizes as well as a swappable upper torso and crotch molded to look like a bra and panty that you have to paint yourself
i need a good toy squid or something that neca trilobite is lame
  this maybe    
  nah its all foam rubber and doesnt bend well i got these  and stuck a bendy autism toy in it they were called bendeez and i bought 10 for 8 bucks but it looks like the fidget craze sent them up to 18 a piece you could probably just coat a metal hanger or some heavy gauge wire in there and be set
  what is that doll and how big is it
    its 17cm for some ungodly reason
  i remember being super excited for this thing until i learned about its remarkably shitty scale
  poop ever again i can never
  i would have gotten it but ive never liked the look of bdsm attire and aesthetics shame honestly i wasnt turned off by the scale at all
  by duncan you should have put some more effort into that underwear
  her head doesnt fit on hacks bodies thanks to the huge neck but it does fit on microman blanks so here you go anon
  t h i c c
  by duncan  i laffed
r u honry
cant wait till we have this figure for head swaps
  medium breast size    meh call me when they release gigantic beach ball tier breast size
  this desu im looking to get something along the lines of play toys xl bust body on a smaller scale
  fucking finally i saw some djanky ass mexican seamless 1/12 bodies on etsy years ago and have been waiting on some actually good ones ever since
strength you slut
  i hope they release male bodies too not enough figs with dicks out there
dat afterburner
  dat ass
does anyone know what happened to badtastetoybox his tumblr just disappeared the other day
  iirc tumblrs been cracking down on nonadvertiserfriendly content including nsfw blogs hes probably been nuked
one of the few figures out there with a penis
  those reaction shots  based
  you know theres a dude in the yellow ranger suit right
  then why does he have tits is he on hrt
      the super sentai counterpart to mighty morphing had the yellow ranger as a dude think thats where the confusion is coming from
  until the zyu2 footage where toei had a girl in the suit at sabans request
in todays episode of playtoy giant elsa gets knifed in the cunny
punish missed shoryukens
  where are her legs
  where do u even find nude figures like this what are they called
  its alice from the revoltech queens blade line
  its revoltech queens blade
    fun fact some of them have squishy boobs
      cool thanks do they actually have nipples and vag or did he censor that just to make it look that way
  most of them do have them yes menace has painted on panties and airis tits look fucked up if you take her clothes off almost all of them have molded on boots and/or gloves so i dont think any one figure can have a completely nude body but they get the important bits out
  dust caked in the joints  coffee stain on the leg  clean your shit my dude
  is itarticulated or is that just shadow making the package look like its pegged in
  the penis has no articulation     tfw no ball jointed penis with lots of joints so you can make it zigzag like a snake
  they have nipples and a vag yes if you want a fully nude figure you can switch body parts with other revoltech figs
  where are her legs  yeah i keep meaning to reshoot this now that i have a printed ruler tile the background definitely needs to contrast more i just built/shot it on a whim a couple years ago
   the redhead    i bet you want to take a nice hot bubble bath with her huh
  same
  what is shakespeare doing with that hippy and the midget
      just finished the reshoot much happier with this version
  very nice anon im enjoying the visible legs
anybody know anything about this thing i bought it at a goodwill and i have no idea what it is aside from its a kidrobot thing
i cant read this shit
  bump i think theres a vinyl/art toys thread up or there was at some point might ask there wish i could be more help
post pics of your toys and their pets
480 usd each  thoughts
  thoughts  why are you posting statueshit western or not on /toy/
where are the joints
what kind of retard would pay that price for statueshit
  kaws  overhyped undertalented  overpriced
  id laugh at the faggot who owns these
whats the deal with new vinyl figures costing this much 500 for a vintage toy that is nearly impossible to find is one thing but im not understanding why anyone would pay it for this
  hype herd instincts attention whoring/virtue signaling  i mean sure there might actually be someone who truly appreciates this garbage but its doubtful   kaws whole schtick seems to be an ironic biting of disneystyle characters with an edgy twist pop culture garbage
vinyl was originally used because it was cheap now its considered a fancy material     side note nearly all kidrobot figures have horrendous mold lines and poorly connected parts but no one says shit sad
  the faggots that own this sleep on a pile of money and laugh at your poorfag ass in return
  worse than funkos
this guy and ron english are hack frauds of the highest order    dude what if we took pop culture icons and added skeletal smiles or crossed out eyes to them    the indie toy equivalent of seeing a big blue circle on a wall in an art gallery fuck this shit
  kek someones overprotective ass is burned
this is lame sneakerhead shit but somehow even more pathetic
these sit nicely on my shelf next to where i keep my daytona and yachtmaster and start up many a conversation of interest from visitors fuck the poorfag haters i love them
  ron english made art critiquing consumer culture only to be caught in the trappings of it its fucking hilarious
  must be some vapid conversations
relevant 
  it triggers autists and isnt against the rules
  they probably wanted to know why someone would own and display such garbage
  much better ways to show off wealth this just makes you look like a wannabe pseud
welcome to the pokémon general gotta catch em all    old thread       archived threads      pokémon detective pikachu official trailer 1  
  i wanna cuddle the chu
  based and redpilled
  we will never have a pikachu plushie thats as soft and cuddly as the one in the movie
i want a toy of her
  i take toys of pretty much any trainer we dnt have
so how will they make the movie toys  will they just release the same toys they already have in the classic style or add texture and sloppy washes
whats the best piece of pokémon merch you bought recently i just got the moncolle togedemaru and its really cute
  id almost guarantee theyll be lazy and just rerelease things on movie packaging they dont want to put the work in and make good pokemon toys i cant see sculpting being their strong point so all those fur and feather and scale textures will go nowhere
  a joey nendoroid would be the bomb diggedy haha it could come with a little ratata and everything
  if hasbro made the toys we wouldnt have this problem apologize
  hasbros run of pokemon wasnt even good also they do repackage old figures as movie figures
  you act like those arent excellent figures as they are at least theyre repackaging something good
  you act like those arent excellent figures    not gonna feed the troll
  the yo kai watch toys were great
any hope that good smile will continue making pokemon figmas
  i need a rival for my red they keep making these shitty literally who trainers instead
  these shitty literally who trainers instead  who appeals to pedos im guessing why those are getting made over blue then again itd be difficult for them to choose which ver of blue is the one to make
  honestly i wouldnt mind if they made all the main protagonists of the games alongside the rivals then they can make whatever npc they want    if they made blue i hope itll match with red so the frlg design
is there an articulated squirtle out there anywhere ive wanted one for twenty years now
  it really depends how well they sold the lack of news isnt a good sign but well see after the next big convention if anythings in the pipeline          the majority of figma buyers are into cute girls its what sells if they go back and do older protagonists its absolutely going to be only the girls and characters like barry have no chance whatsoever    maybe with nendoroids which have a very large female market
  troll  found the revofag
  holy fuck stop shitting up every thread with your brandwar bs
  maybe you shouldnt start it if you dont want other people continuing it retard
  revoltech has nothing to do with this thread you fuckin idiot
  neither does marvel legends but you tried to use that anyway
  hasbros run of pokemon wasnt even good  it was used to back up the 1st point moron
  and it was wrong moron
hasbro pokemon toys were the best      apologize now
  lol no
  more than one person posts in this thread you autistic fuckbrain its never even problematic until you take it personally and start sperging out about imports
    kill yourself please
  maybe you should kill yourself you fucking pile of dog shit you dont even know what a good toy is you sure as hell have no business in this thread
  actually the darts toys were apologize
so will detective deadpools sidekick get toys like finn from star wars
im so sick of good smile and nintendo sitting on their hands with releasing pokemon nendoroids nendoroids were created to be a fastrelease cash cow but we barely get a new trainer a year not including the 3 reds 2 blues and 2 lils    we desperately need more gym leaders elite four and most importantly the gsc  rse protagonists
im gonna buy some of the sitting pokemon plush for friends but thinking about only getting the cool obscure ones that rarely got plush so far im thinking kangaskhan and farfetchd but not sure what else would be worthwhile to grab
  i am really hyped both for movie as well for merchandise
  revochads living in your head rent free nerd
best pokemon toys anons
did they ever make figures for the crystal protagonists
  youre gonna have to be more specific than that anon what are you looking for  trainers pokemon articulation correct sizing
  why would they one got completely replaced by lyra
i still wanna know why they stopped making zukan figurines
look who just arrived
  and it broke wtf the left elbow broke
  will i be able to get a replacement
  nope learn how to fix that issue and get a new joint its simple    inb4 hamhands
  it wasnt i literally just moved it to see if its alright and it just broke i tried sending an email anyway but fucking amiami 3 straight orders i got from them were fucked in addition to this i got a figma chicken chan with broken shoes and a diecast car with broken rear spoiler
  this is a fucking 50 figure we dont pay all that money for a figure to break so easily and then pay more money to fix it ourselves
  i didnt say you are just inb4 all the people calling you it       yes i know and agree they should be spot on out of the box but sometimes stuff like this sadly happens its useful knowledge to know anyway for if you ever do end up breaking something long after release   as annoying as it is its probably quicker to get a replacement joint than deal with the hassle of jumping through hoops for a replacement
  this is why i like tomy making the majority of pokemon figures western figures might not be a 1 to 1 replication but majority are built to withstand kids
  man figma just gets worse and worse and worse
the eevee tamagotchi was officially announced today it goes on sale in japan on january 26 next year
sorry for the pleb question but what kind of fabric do the regular pokemon center plushies use not asking about the material
  email them and get another one for free     
me want misty figma
  me want too ugg
  i want moncolle misty and jessie  like the serena figure they did  did the serena figure sell really badly so they now dont make any trainer figures
  they certainly werent the hotcakes that were the main moncolle line or what tomy usa did
  no she didnt she sell very well and you cant find her now for a reasonable price which makes me wonder why the didnt make her other outfit or more female characters it just seems that the market in japan is only interested in plushies and stupid stuff instead of good quality action figures they only made very few gen 7 pokemon figures and most of their releases now are repaints its very sad
  i need this now
  ive genuinely never had any breakage issues from ami ami they tend to pack things very securely chances are you just keep getting fucked on the qc lotto i dont see how this is ami amis fault also ami has genuinely good customer service when it comes to things like this id just contact them and ask for a replacement hope you didnt throw away the box they shipped it in or all the paperwork with it
  yeah i already sent them the details and im not blaming them although i can see why you thought that way amiami has been pretty great to me its just annoying and mildly amusing as well that i keep getting fucked in the qc thingy
  anyone got any pictures of pokemon toys in mystery dungeonlike poses/setups i love the vibe of those games cozy adventures
  this two pack is 60 in canada
  thats pretty comfy
  the trainer figures dont sell very well here either not sure where youre getting your sales data from but theres a reason theyve never really done anything like that again and why tomy us and wct have barely done any trainers not even mega bloks bother with any human characters in their sets human characters just dont appeal to kids in a series like this
  yeah thats why im so annoyed with myself for not being able to get into the pmd games gameplay the stories and vibe are comfy and fun i just dont like to actually play them i need like a pointandclick or something with fun talking pokemon
the toys for this movie are gonna be creepy as shit
  email goodsmile with pictures they will help you
i just want a tyranitar in big tomy plastic goodness
since the thread on /vp/ is now archived im reposting this here heres a giant lapras from pokemon center which ive got recently the standard one is for comparison
i saw a humongous but still kinda undersized snorlax plush/cushion thing and it reminded me of an itch that i havent been able to scratch what kinda 11 scale pokemon stuff is there pokemon themselves and accessories balls pokedexes etc thats about the only kinda pokemon toys i can really see myself wanting these days
  this lapras from bandai is pretty on point an adult person can sit on its back but good luck finding it at a reasonable price theres one on ebay that costs 8k i believe other than that there is only yahoo auctions but those are japanexclusive and it costs fuck ton of money to ship due to the size and the weight
  this does not feel right at all  its like a digimon fuck off
this this is perfection  darts action figures mewtwo venusaur blastoise charizard  even the freaking venusaur was articulated like never    what is the equivalent of this today please   are there any good pokemon action figures besides chibi toys like nendo plushes or cheap statues     this is exhausting you have to catch up whats going to release everyday to stay on point otherwise youll get fucked by resellers  these go for over 200 now  why the fuck are these old toys better than what is produced now  and why the fuck have they no equivalent even with a high demand and better conception ends
  broke venusaurs vinewhip accessory and now hes forever incomplete because new ones are too expensive    it bugs me way more than it should
  simple answer    tpci isnt interested in the collector market the franchise on all fronts l be it games merchandise or media are all going to appeal to the widest market they can reach in this case its pokémons main demographic children the games arent made for us adults and they werent back then either so why should we expect anything different especially when it comes to figures    i want good pokémon toys as much as the next guy but this is a company were talking about here
  this is cool buy maaaybe a bit large
  venusaur was so bad on so many levels it was tiny and doent look so weird and off from most of he angels  the sculpt was so bad on that figure
  all of the darts/figuarts massively bombed there were constant complaints about them online and nobody bought them until they hit clearance later attempts didnt do any better    the closest we nave now is the figma pokemon trainers but considering how quiet the latest release was and how there hasnt been so much as a hint of another coming it seems that line hasnt done any better    the kotobukiya statues while statueshit are pretty high quality though definitely not cheap price wise either
  i think mewtwo is the worst sure charizard has an ugly face and venusaur and blastoise were undersized but mewtwo is so bulkily unposeable but a lot of people see that as a strength
  how did this happen
if anyones interested pokemon center is doing free shipping today only
  be me  order from pokemon center  wait a week for the supposed ship  ask in support wtf is going on  get a reply saying theyve been having issues with their shipping partner  i mean ive got the money back and reordered but it doubt id ever order anything from their website again until they get their shit together i only did it once because it was my first time doing it and i was unaware of that
  sameanon here forgot to mention theyve been having those issues since at least september
  i had this fucking issue trying to buy stakataka twice    like wtf i have a lot of plush as is but chansey farfetchd and kangaskhan are tempting what do
  if you want them that bad id say just cross your fingers and hope your order gets through they voided my money for the failed one so even if they fail to process it you should at least get your money back anon
  i assume the problem with stakataka is the fucking size but they can ship buzzwole just fine    i wish the pikachus closet collection made it state side i bought one in japan and just a set of pajamas
  why is this thing a plush and not a figure you cant hug a fucking cube with blocky legs
  i fucking can and i fucking will
  this was my favorite part of the new wreck it ralph movie
is pokemon center usa going to stock lillie eventually
  bloomers  sold i hope mine isnt shit like s
  bloomers  theyre bike shorts
  bike shorts arent poofy
  neither are these theyre painted onto her legs with a few creases
  theres definitely poof there
i never thought that we would get the starters 1st evolution gary was a bland choice but hopefully we see more from gen 1 coming up
  we probably will but its unlikely to be those designs if we do which is a good thing for the most part some of the hg/ss designs were good but they fucking ruined sabrina with all the casual/normal girl/actor stuff they applied to her in all the later games
    yeah i agree those arent the best designs they were just the easiest to grab with a transparent background     lgpe would be ideal
  currently on my holidays in grorious nippon i managed to find this guy for 6500 in den den town which im pretty pleased with finally have all of the kantos now
being owl fag is suffer
  whats the matter  amazing value 399  you all better jump on this before it goes the way of the incineroar 3pack
  where the fuck is this
  99c only store
  i cant see the price
  oh wait i just saw it on the other one being retard is also suffer
  it seems they hit the jackpot with tru going down i saw a halo rc car for 15 when it originally retailed for 35 at tru     going to drop by the 2 local stores and try and pick some of those decidueyes up
anyone whos bought shit off of nip amazon know if theres any way to get free international shipping
  went earlier today they didnt have them at one but another stocked them right before i left they had 6 i bought one and my gf bought another to donate to a toy drive    overall not satisfied with the paint app but ill go to another one tomorrow and see if theres some available is anyone here wanting one i could buy one and sell them at cost  shipping if its really an issue
happy hunting for those who want the decidueye 3 pack from the 99 cents only store
  can you snag me a blastoise if you see one fren ill pay you of course
    had the set but sold them they were kinda shitty
  you think so i mean their qc was hit or miss but theyre the kind of poké figures ive always dreamed of so im willing to forgive them in places esp since tomys last figures aside they were the most articulated wed ever gotten       ill keep an eye out in akihabara anonkun
  as it should be
are there any christmas plushies coming out for pokemon that arent pokemon center    i know last year tomy did some at walmart for halloween and then they had like deliberd/some ice types for christmas but i kind of doubt theyre doing anything at all with wct being a huge mess of releases
i just bought this guy last week and im waiting for him to ship from japan you can all thank me if hes announced for rerelease next week for a third of the price
  but they fucking ruined sabrina with all the casual/normal girl/actor stuff they applied to her in all the later games  filthy casual detected
  wont they just push rerelease for more like charizard i was on and off about buying the bootleg
  how much did you pay
  there is no blastoise bootleg
  i mean the bootleg charizard
  thanks sweetie fingers crossed for other anons then i bought mine 2 years ago and still paid the latecomers tax
  definitely not cheap price wise either  those are super affordable comparatively to other scales though
so if meltan isnt getting a kids figure until april think itll be an entirely gen8 set    source on the date 
  kids
guys i have a revelation pikachu actually comes from the japanese adaptation of the english pocket jew look it up
  its weird how popular kids are in japan lol loli jk its hard to find any old moncolle in the shops whereas theres tonnes of those kids
  because kids are chunky stylized candy toys every pkmncollectors sales post has a huge kids section
  eh thats cute enough id buy it
anyone buy mega construx here    i was wondering about getting a pikachu squirtle ivysaur and charizard for smash reasons i like that theyre actually articulated and some come with effect pieces but i guess im worried that the overly blocky nature will make them look weird in a collection especially zard
  theyll definitely look weird in a collection of non blocky figures that said theyre pretty fun sets but id probably keep them standalone if you get them
  only if you wanted some weird almost n64 style
  i bought the giant pikachu on black friday its fun to build but you can tell its not quite as good as lego or even nanoblocks
  i have gyarados and its great a lot of them except zard maybe are represented well in brick form but arent exactly their definitive figures i gave my gyarados arms and legs because i can
  sounds neat could you share some pics of gyarados with legs
  show us
    k
watch a review of a jaeger rd  its by one of those acba faggots  he reviews a jaeger on a fucking alleyway diorama
well get out there and show him how it should be done or are you one of those dickless wonders who can only criticize
  t mad acbafag
  i dont have a camera  its just hilarious either way if they could remodel the interior of their house to look like an alleyway id bet they would go ahead with it
  the hell is acba
  a bunch of fart sniffers that think taking pictures of their toys in allyway dioramas is the epitome of art they also sell paper cutout speech bubbles and unwound coat hangers as stands to morons and talk about buying toys like its the most gansta shit ever
    jesus fuck youre embarassing you think they think of merely using dioramas as the highest art everthey dont and yet youre more autistic about the background for a review than they are
  defending acba  these are the fuckos that tried to sell hotglue strands and bent coathangers as premium action figure accessories after all not to mention act elitist about mls of all things and on top of that their photos fucking suck remember that one where it looks like spiderman is being propelled through the air on a comet of shit    acba is a fucking joke and so are you if you honestly defend them
  not just using dioramas alleyway dioramas  judging by their pictures the alleyway is the single most important location in the collective imagination on humanity according to them
  remember that one where it looks like spiderman is being propelled through the air on a comet of shit  the what now
  one of acbas photos was meant to be sandman punching spiderman or something the end result was it looked like spiderman was rocketing through the air propelled by a geyser of diarrhoea
  can someone translate this for me please i have no idea what op is on about
  try lurking
bikini edition    lets have a parfom thread    what is parfom  
looks weebish
are they supposed to be dolls or just weird competition for nendos and cupoche or both  im confused i wish senran kagura just had regular proportion figures
  sd  regular proportions
  how fucking slow can you be you inbreed hillbilly    go back to your marvel legends
hope for years senran kagura gets figures  parfoms of the worst game  cool i guess
parfom senrans  its not haruka or daidouji  guess ill make do with asuka for now      parfoms of the worst game  but theyre from pbs not ev
its great to finally get some senran kagura figures id like to see more characters done eventually but even if they did theyd have like 45 boring waifubaits to make figures of before getting to any of the good characters    maybe i could just hope for homura and miyabi instead to at least represent the main team leaders      just pretend amazon is your daidouji figure
parfom rikka when
  wouldve preferred then in their shinobi outfits instead of generic bikinis though
  phat probably thought this was a good way of releasing headswap fodder instead of just generic bikini bodies
shes next right
chibishit  peach beach splash  the boring ass team leaders
  are are those blank bodies    yes please
  parfom rikka when  she would fit perfectly in this line
  a 2b one would be godly as well  dont think my dick could handle that
  parform 2b  it would work too well
    parform 2b  stop it anon  i cant handle it
  payment request by amiami

  preorders  lord have mercy it looks like the price is only about 100 those night lolita dolls are about 4050 and their clothes are still a hot mess anybody who preorders it deserves what they get
  what are these things    are they even in the realm of bjd
  its like a 60cm knockoff obitsu the boy head and 1 of the girl heads can look ok with a good faceup but the rest are all horrible theyre still like another 50 to ship from china so they never took off internationally
somebody rebranded them for us release as my ballerina dolls for 100 but the clothes are still like a 10 nobrand chinese porcelain doll ie terrible
i finally found my grail doll on the marketplace and i dont think i even considered anything before messaging the person about him but i have zero regrets still trying to process
  the pelvis on that doll reminds me of the made to move barbies hideous hip joints
  are there any good male 1/6 scale bodies  any that aint hulking muscle men figures
tfw you realize your hobby is indistinguishable from this shit to outsiders    are those ball jointed dolls i asked thinking of the popular subculture of elasticstrung handcast resin art dolls that can easily cost more than a thousand dollars    im not sure said james peering between the rows along with me lets go check it out    the closer i got the more sure i was that these were in fact thousand dollar art dolls standing at 21 inches with inset eyes spectacular articulation beautiful sculpting and high quality clothes surely these were the kinds of artist created dolls that could only exist through unbelievable hours of hard individual artistic work these could not possibly by any stretch of the imagination be produced for market sales
when mr erickson told me that they retail on the my ballerina doll website for 110 dollars i was nearly in a state of shock this is an unheard of price point for a doll of such quality i am uncertain what even to compare it to in looks perhaps the bjds i mentioned earlier and yet a bjd of this caliber and size would cost 1200 dollars because it is handcast by a single artist in labour intensive resin in runs of maybe a few hundred for hardcore collectors
the extremely high amount of posability allow for a lot of different kinds of play and the interchangeability of the wigs clothes and even eyes would be a wonderful opportunity for a crafty or artistic child to project that creativity on the doll imagining their own character or themselves with the amount of tutorials on youtube these days even teens and kids with equally crafty parents can learn to make doll wigs eyes and clothes for collectors these dolls are an affordable entry to the kind of high quality many people can only dream of owning themselves only produced by highly skilled artisans in small runs painstakingly done individually and by hand
      massproduced manufactured crap that arent even in the same class as a customized faceup bjd
  actually thats only the deposit payment itll cost much more on shipment
  these look like total shit i would never consider paying 110 for this crap  this is just marketing bullshit
        that writeup makes me want to bury my face in the sand the doll body itself looks kinda wonky and those face sculpts dont really appeal to me      on another note i havent been around much so while not a bjd technically anyone know what happened to tokyodoll i went to their english site on a whim and the domain was for sale so i can only presume they went under i actually own a 1/3 and 1/4 silicone body so it made me a little sad to think about just a little
  why is her leg completely backwards
  congratulations anon theres no feeling quite like it      i hve to agree with the other anon this reads like one of those advertorials magazines do for their advertisers no one with eyes would think this looks this good there are pretty and posable mass produced dolls that are more affordable than bjds this is not one of them 110 could easily get you a tonner or fashion royalty doll
  and high quality clothes  its the part that triggers me the most    you can see from the photos those clothes are made from the cheapest fabrics available
  what happened to tokyodoll  hlj has pulled all their products off the site sounds like theyre dead    cheapest fabrics available  i know right when lolitas go to hell satan puts them to work in the polyester lace factory and then he sells that lace to the night lolita factory
wait maybe im wrong this url is still live   enjoy a pic of a night lolita looking not so bad i still think all in all if you have to spend 80110 just to get a generic base doll that needs new everything youd be better off fixing up some old 150 volks doll off mandarake or dollyteria
has there been any more information on the gockt stolen dolls situation
i want to make my dream doll but i need to be sure of one thing before spending half a grand    are dollfie dream outfits and wigs 100 compatible with the 60cm obitsu paradoll
  hit or miss with clothes some pants will be too short and tops will be loose because the paradoll is lankier with a thin deformable waist they also have smaller feet skirts shorts and most dresses are aok though wigs are not tied to scale theyre based on head circumference in centimeters
  the outfit in mind is a short and a belly shirt if shoes are a bit too large thats no issue only thing left to figure out is the wig size ill have to do do homeworks once i get home
      vomiting_madotsukijpg
have you ever had a doll you wanted so bad that it invades your mind everyday     the artist said theyll rerelease the head sculpt next year and i really hope they do because their work is beautiful
  they are good enough for the price but yeah they are no comparisons between that and the highend stuff    i still think that the best budget alternative to a genuine bjd for looks playability and quality are the obitsu paradolls especially when choosing the handmade faceup option    well for the 1/6 category at the very least im still hesitant to make the 1/3 plunge even at those prices
      i dont know about yall but if youre paying near 200 base plus eyes wig faceup and clothes because you know thats all separate or diy you may as well get obitsu maybe in a smaller scale or as someone mentioned fix up a secondhand volks or perhaps get into the lower but not recasttier resin
  yeah for some reason my initial searches never pulled up the jp site but i later found it when i looked up a specific model weird they have some new model stuff since the last time i checked too but now that they dont have an english site i wonder if theyll force me to use a forwarder if i want to order something        and as not terrible as  looks i will 4th the sentiment that it might be better just to get another base at higher quality for not a whole lot more money does make me wish that the obitsu 60s were just a tad cheaper though
  agreed finishing a doll is always going to be another 100 unless you are already a decent faceup artist and have the other stuff just lying around and you know even a resin soul will have eye sockets shaped for eyelashes and glass eyes and no weird dick neck
  trades with trusted people are a good idea too im good at sewing bad at painting my friend is amazing at painting andwell lets just say someone struggled through home ec in high school
those tan lines
  i just received a resinsoul mei w/o faceup  wig  wig cap for a total of 184 from denver doll emporium shipping to the east coast in less than a week this was a very very good deal considering i was willing to pay that for just the doll alone shipping from china plus 50 to get the wig separately i plan on trying to do her face up myself as well as making her clothes to save money too
any recommendations for image hosting sites flickr is basically forcing people to go pro and im not paying 60 bucks a year for it free accounts are now limited to 1000 pictures and even after deleting a ton im still over by 600    not a fan of instagram because you cant choose to see enlarged/full size pictures and i really dont want to resort to tumblr
  i saw someone recommend amazon photos if you have amazon prime
  damn it between flickr and photobucket half the images on the internet will be gone i dont like instagram for the same reason i dont like devianart your nice original stuff is sandwiched between so much worthless asinine crap and so much stolen shit at least flickr wasnt viewed as a jpeg landfill by idiot teenagers
  photobucket went full jew a while back too didnt they i remember their site being nearunusable but cant remember quite why
  yeah they blocked all image embeds for free accounts overnight with no warning and the paid account price was suddenly 399 per year    now its down to 48/year i guess they didnt get many buyers when you could rent a whole private server somewhere for that much
  imgur is pretty effective and wonts screw you overyet
  yet    i trust imgur to remain as good as it is they have a heavy socialmedia aspect which brings them a shitload of ad revenue as well as a storefront with some sitebranded shit i feel like they make enough to not restrict the available services
quick question i want to put a dollfie dream wig on the 885 grettel head for a obitsu paradoll compatible or not
does anyone have a decent tutorial for restringing o hook/ring dolls i dont care if its photo or video im just looking for something shot with anything other than a potato
  how much do you care about fit it will be big but it should still fit i wouldnt do it with a short/boy cut wig
who makes the best anime style dolls right now i want one thats not based on a license but will be like a good start for bjd stuff still not really sure what i should be getting
  do you want a bjd or any doll  because i dont think any bjds portray the anime look as good as dollfie dream but ringdoll makes fantastic looking dolls in a more realistic anime style    if you want dd in resin the closer youll get is sqlab stuff i havent seen one irl but they look pretty nice in pics
  argh the wig is a short one and may look like crap  final question before knowing what to do is are super dollfie and dollfie dream heads the same size the goal is to have an anime character but with a more realistic face body must be dd because the clothes/wig set i plan to buy is a dd one
  wouldnt you have trouble attaching sd head to dd body one is attached with hooks the other just screws on to the neck joint thingy
  this reads like either a paid promo or else received a doll for writing it even if somebody doesnt know anything about bjds those faces and their simplistic painting cant look painstaking high quality to anyone especially any reviewer of toys and dolls  a bjd of this caliber and size would cost 1200 dollars   although they definitely dont know shit about bjds
  if you arent hung up on having wigs or insertable/swappable eyes look into azone extremely cute anime dolls in zillions of options mostly 2025cm but if you had your heart set on a 1/3 scale they do make those also
    also iirc this year volks presented their dollfie icon project which is supposed to be more resinlike sculpts on ddlike body and all vinyl might just want to wait
  one thing is sure ill try to get the clothes and wig set as fast as possible but as for the body and head ill bid my time to find the perfect one for the most reasonable price possible      it really bum me out that the full doll is now over 9000 everywhere thats what one get for being late to the game
  not to be annoying but realistically speaking ill have to buy a used dd body to not break bank is mr clean magic eraser effective to clean out possible stains on a dd body
  itll get surface grime off but dye stains need removezit or benzoyl peroxide
    thanks i think im more or less set on wanting a bjd a dd counts as a bjd right but im still unsure what i want overall i know i definitely want a 1/3 scale or 1/4 scale doll and i know im not too fond of how set azone dolls are but they are cute sure
i never bought any event dolls from acbjd theyre having a promotion now that gets you a 90 discount on this smol deer if you buy a shitton of stuff and since i wanted to get my mdd some clothes anyway i thought id bite   but now im thinking maybe i dun goofd and will only get my stuff months from now if wait times are anything like for regular bjds how long do they usually take to ship out these event dolls
  dds havent technically been bjds for a long time but theyre definitely in the same sphere so nobody except autists really care if you think of them in the same way i think most of us do even though we know they arent bjds its just that many years ago they changed to using an internal skeleton instead of being strung and using ball joints
does anyone else get irritated that nakitaninja keeps trying to shove her stupid blog down everyones throat
  i have been for a while whatd she do this time
something about the nose or maybe the position of all the features on this sculpt really bugs me
  i dont think its the best sculpt for belle looks like a generic character also im not a fan of sharp noses and that nose looks like it would be a woodpecker from the side
i finally decided to save around 1000 for my very first dollfie dream i desperately want pic related however the cheapest available is 75k yen for a used one a new one is just too scalpypriced on evilbay dd rin would be my cream doll but thats an insane amount of cash especially for a used one    my other option is to get the clothes and wig set for 20k yen plus a used naked dd i found one that is complete with a nice faceup and blue eyes however shes badly stained of course the price is 30k yen separate shipping because different stores going this route would make me save around 20k yen total but i wont have kagamine rin only some random chick cosplaying as her    third option would be to settle on the way less rare and less expensive dd hatsune miku used is around 50k yen and new is 80k yen having miku would open the option to get a wide variety of miku modules for her    no matter what i chose it will take at least 2 or 3 months to scrounge the cash that is without buying anything frivolous the options may turn around in that time    to stop blogging and actually ask something any dd owner can tell who was their first dd and how/why you have chosen her
  any dd owner can tell who was their first dd and how/why you have chosen her  my first dd was a random custom ddh06 head i happened to see for sale on mandarake i was interested in getting into dolls for a while and i had the money at the time so i went for it had to get her body and some eyes/wigs/clothes a bit later though    shes not my only doll anymore and shes not my favourite but i still love her since she was my first
  for the price these things are its not unexpected to go for parts one at a time  im still debating if i should get the dd rin clothes set as top priority and wait for the perfect body and head later  having a cosplayer doll may be the right way to go because it will give more freedom in costume choices after all    dollfie dreams are super expensive but mostly huge so i could buy a brand new main body as a platform and buy multiple heads wigs and clothes sets over time thus having multiple dolls that take only the room of one
  youll probably end up just having multiple dolls even if you try to do that its too sad having floating heads
  oh im pretty confident it will turn out this way eventually the fact that dd parts can be bought separately allow complete dolls to be born over time
  anyone know what doll this is or what company its from i guess
    looks like an iplehouse mold
2500us  105cm tall    oh damn  thats quite the monster here anything bigger and more expensive around
how do you guys avoid or prevent this hazardous resin dust so i heard from bjd resin parts grinding against each other
  he looks really gross and faggy to me
  he  for fucks sake
  can you fuck it
  with your tiny dick you can fuck just about anything
  joking aside youre pretty close one step above that and we get a highend silicon sex doll
  i see u mr troll
  to be fair the bjd dolls are quite gender fluid  beautiful though and the price to match i bet
    oscar sama is so beautiful
  where the actual fuck did you hear this this reads like those mombie posts on facebook about how completely harmless and/or basically zero chance situation is coming to kill our kids none of my dolls turn into dust when im moving them around
  its only hazadrous if youre sanding them 24/7 without a dust mask and even then it will take good 15 years to kill you
  micoabrasion is impossible to avoid any time two objects rub across each other they are scraping bits off each other at the atomic level just dont fucking sniff the joints when youre moving them
shit i feel like ill not be able to wait for 2b and buy another doll before she arrives
  shes a year out so its not such a big deal imo even though i try to limit myself to one big doll purchase a year since you just pay a small deposit until then it doesnt feel like it really counts now so im thinking i might look into finally buying an mdd soon
how did i do with my first faceup sculpt is resinsoul mei
  to stop blogging and actually ask something any dd owner can tell who was their first dd and how/why you have chosen her    christmas white alna  promo pics and blonde
  like somebody else said i dont worry about it unless im sanding something like silicosis should always be a concern for anybody working around large amounts of dust
    seriously looks like a dude with the way volks did her eyes    what is the source material for this
        shes supposed to look like a man its part of the manga
i hope they go all out on marie antoinette i want to see a silk gown with a three foot diameter
whoever decided on doa to change the marketplace setup where you actually see a picture of the item next to each listing before you click it thank you you deserve a hug a raise and a bunch of whatever your favorite food or snack is this change makes market browsing so much easier
  it is clothing was absolutely impossible to navigate when you were looking at 20 pages of  sd13 dress  sd dress  sd tshirt  sd pants  sd pants  sd dress  volks sd13 shirt  sd dress  sd10 dress  kill me now nobody has time to dig through all that except the people who will lowball you even further on anything under 20
dfa has had a new 16 60/60cm practice head available this year but it looks like tatas paradise is the only international dealer to carry it ali express resellers have it as well
here is a compilation of taobao user photos
ill do another one tomorrow or the next day when i have time pass them on if you want if you know anybody who wants a mature male doll but wont spend more than 5 cents on it surely this is better than a 70cm mirodoll or resin soul
just search for bjd 苏苏 and it will pop up
  pretty nice anon i think the brows could look better but youre going for a realistic look and not the single stroke anime eye brows right
opinion on smartdoll
  they have some awkward face sculpts that dont hold up to being viewed at every angle and dont really have any advantage over a dollfie dream despite what smart doll fans say but theyre fine i guess its good to have another brand around i just hope their sculpts get way better their boy doll in particular looks absolutely retarded    i havent actually looked for pictures of their most recent sculpts so maybe theyve already improved though i dont post on /jp/ anymore because the guys there kinda disgust me so i dont really get anime doll news very often
  i dont know dd look lifeless compared so smart dolls and i dont know if its the camera angle but those necks look very long    anyway i have 2b pre ordered anyway even with all i said
   agreeing with this post also the plastic used for the smart dolls are much harder than the soft dd vinyl its vinyl but a harder cheaper feeling vinyl except for the bust go fig there
  they are easier to get in europ  choo actually makes effort to be friendly to buyer worldwide which isnt the case of dd  they also make male dolls  i personally find some sculpts really cute i havent seen any in person though except this one bought by this young guy at the ldoll looked perfectly ok from afar
  dully noted for the vinyl i dont get it for the faces maybe i need to check some amateur pictures
  im asking that because i was hesitating between a smartdoll and an azone iris collect
  the heads tend to start looking weird when viewed from side angles marketing photos wont show it pic related is two different smart dolls mirai on the left is just suuuper flat you cant really see it in the photo but its like she has no cheeks too whatever the other sculpt is on the right has these like bizzare puffy lips dont know about her cheeks all that said if you like the sculpts anyway its totally fine we arent the sculpt police or anything we all just like what we like      i really like those 1/3 azone dolls but unless you can sew youre going to be a bit limited when it comes to getting clothes the bodies theyre on are a bit smaller than sd13/dd size which is popular so it can be difficult to find things to buy that fit them
  pic related is two different smart dolls  oops here it is
    im starting to see what you mean    we arent the sculpt police or anything we all just like what we like  its just that a doll is a big investment and while 2b was a must buy im considering all the option i have available for my first one which will be more a customization/play doll    and sadly i can barely sew a button back so making doll clothes will be impossible
looks like truebjdconfessionz is gone    good riddance
    thank goodness truebjdconfessions is still around
    the only actual problem with 1/3 azone is the azo2 body sculpt the stock obitsu 48/50 sculpt gets btfo by it appearancewise but azo2 is way chunkier and will not fit in most obitsu/parabox clothing which limits your prefab clothing options a lot    pic related stock obitsu 48 on the far right azo2 50 to the left of it
  the stock obitsu parts actually look really good for a younger character i think the proportions look nice next to my dds
  i saw that this morning i wonder what happened i would check there every now and then just to see what dumb thing people were saying i will say that i hated most of the regular commenters i hope they all dont flood the other confession blogs
  considering that tumblr started deleting nsfw blogs after the app got taken off the apple store i wonder now if that blog somehow tripped off the algorhythm of the bot that was sent out somehow and falsely deleted it thats happened to a lot of blogs already so itd be bizarre but not impossible
  what were they saying on that blog   im totally pro recast  i have sexual though for my doll  i stole my friends bjd    that sort of stuff 
  someone fucked their doll  x is a pedo and draws shota porn
  and shes not my favourite  whos your favorite now 
any recomendations on a custom head shop for dd   shineworkshop on etsy doesnt look bad but i wanted to know if someone had experience in ordering one recently here
  dang its beautiful
  dstoric made a five foot tall doll i think not sure if its still around obitsu also has a vinyl doll for around same price
god this girl is nuts
  the horrible irreparable damage
    the poor mum i cant even see shit thats wrong with it in that photo thats supposed to showcase it
  face up got chipped hard to fix its not like you can just dab some paint with a small brush and spot fix that
  ah i guess it probably looks a little worse in person there are so many specks of dust or something on his face to begin with that it didnt stand out in the photo
  literally just have a faceup artist touch it up that is not that hard to fix jfc
  is that a conchita wurst doll
    i caught up with it just as the commenting ability got closed on it very dramatic thread i didnt expect to see today but it was an interesting read i had to honestly look in the comments to find where the damage was cause i could not see it at all  according to some of the comments its not the first time shes gotten super mad at something and it seems her priorities are very off the mark apparently she deals with ocd if i remember right i understand mental illnesses like that are awful to deal with but you cant use it to treat the people around you like shit i get shes mad at her mom making a mistake and everyone has the right to vent about stuff but shes going about it the wrong way and that seemed to bite back horribly for her
does anyone else follow doll posters on twitter i started following a bunch of them pic related 
  be adult  still leech off your parents  be unconsiderate and ungrateful    horrible woman
  my thoughts exactly
does anyone know anything about this judging by the price quality shown and it being on aliexpress im going to have to assume this is a bootleg but reversesearching the images doesnt turn up any meaningful results i obviously dont want to support a bootleg creator but if its legit im definitely going to pick one up
  recast  alright figured it out its a recast sorry im very new to dolls
  go for it anyway just make sure the store does good makeup if you are too scared to do it yourself yet
  and her mom was just trying to help her too one day her mom will be dying and if that op isnt a total piece of shit she will regret every time she ever troubled her mom for no good reason
  i tend to prefer prefinished dolls im garbage at any kind of diy stuff and the learning curve/investment in bjds specifically is very intimidating seems like the seller offers faceups and blush work so ill have to look for inhand reviews    i do understand the reasons why people dislike recasts but i wish they werent grounds for bans or excessive argument in most bjd groups
  not wanting bootlegs around is not an exlusively bjd thing many figure collecting groups do the same thing same with fashion groups especially niche/street fashion no one likes a fake if youre going to buy one just dont post it anywhere or mention it and youll be safe from a ban
  you can always send your doll out to a faceup artist there are many options and price ranges available if you buy a recast your options may be limited but i doubt most antirecasters will be able to tell with unpopular sculpts      i find that not being able to post your doll anywhere can either make or break the hobby i think that anon does want to participate in the social aspect of the hobby you can find a group of recast friendly people whether they own them or not but you will be outnumbered and you will be ostracized by a lot of people and companies         also anon are you looking for animal bjds in particular or something else i can recommend some places that offer layaway for companies you might like
  super cute i followed them i love twitter and i wish more bjd people used it because its easier to share and retweet peoples stuff    right now i only follow companies im having a hard time finding personal accounts on twitter any advice
  thats a recast of an already aforable doll and the person is chinese thats a pretty shitty move the legit doll is only like 20 usd    fuck recasters
  i feel like not being able to post a doll defeats part of the purpose of a doll i like the photography aspect of the bjd hobby and im not interested in effectively starting an argument by posting a nice photo of a recast some groups ive seen have a specific policy against artistic photos of recasts im not going to buy recast partially because i do feel that its harmful to small creators and partially because i dont want to have to dig for a community where im accepted    im definitely more interested in animal bjds or the inbetween ones with semihuman bodies the petit gem line is something im looking at at the moment
  i dunno once i started following a couple of them twitter kept giving me reccomendations you could also check who theyre following/rting and follow them
  anyway heres a couple more you can follow i could link these for hours because theres literally hundreds of doll accounts on twitter lol                          
    thank you anon      i see here are some companies that might interest you that i can think of    animal bjd    cocorang  pipos  luts zuzu delfs  dream valley 1/6 dolls  dollshe bubblepet mini  aileen doll  doll familya pets  dear mine  doll zone  the mushroom peddler   crobidoll limited    human/animal hybrids    soul doll  doll chateau  resin soul zhen and sui
    definitely seconding pipos honestly ive had a charlotte and just got a williams perfect size and nice weight
  can i get a link to where i can buy the legit doll its adorable
if you like doll family animals watch secondhand sales after everybodys holiday shipments come in some people buy x amount more stuff just to get the free animal to resell later
  i recognize some of these just by the handles      like  said once i followed one twitter sent me down the rabbit hole of japanese doll posters probably because i had like only 5 people i followed
how often does volks restock their dd sailor moon     ive been refreshing the site every week for the past year and only saw it restocked maybe once     i regret not jumping on it when i saw it because now shes out of stock /    someone on /jp/ said theyre going to restock the kaede but im not sure about sailor moon
this is the best photo ive seen today 
  dds get restocked once if you are lucky zero most of the time a dozen times if its migu
its that season where everyone is having sales coming out with new dolls and trying to take all my money im definitely not going to escape december without buying a doll      super cute anon im hoping to get an animal bjd soon pipos is high on my list
  no rin len shibuya rin have been restocked frequently iirc
somebody is selling this accursed thing for under 200 on ebay i only just found out that miro charges 400 for it sweet baby jesus why
  what would possess someone to but that in the first place
  this looks horrible    probably some cheap companies only person
  it shows what a sad rut some people get stuck in 400 would buy almost any 6570cm male doll on acbjd the body would be at least ok and the head might not suck
anyone knows how long it takes for ems to deliver something once it leaves japan i purchased my first smart doll and cannot wait to arrive
  depends of where you live
  i live in nj and ems can take anywhere from 2 business days to 2 weeks most of the delay is the dreaded    arrived in isc new york ny sorting facility
  13 days one it gets out of nyc customs for me inbound customs likes to sit on packages
  ive been looking at these dollce yummy sweets dolls lately i know they arent bjds but they have the sweetest little faces and i was wondering if i could hybrid one with a yosd sized body because the default one is barely articulated they dont seem to be very popular but i figured id try asking if there are any owners itt or if anyone has any information about them
  i own one so the thing about it is that it involes cutting some vinyl they dont actually have a neck hole they have a ball rhat sits on top of their neck and the head has a groove that fits on that ball to get an shook through youre gonna have to cut out a neck hole basically i saw someone hybrid theirs with a kikipop body so i did the same to mine it just involved making a pretty small hole with an xacto blade    so if youre okay doing some cutting to the bottom of the head its very doable they really are adorable though and i liked my girl a lot more when she was given posing ability
  seconding im starting to like cute tiny animal dolls       probably for massive mod projects lbr      haha the proportions remind me of culurs doll
  do you have any pictures of yours im very interested in seeing how it looks on a kikipop body as i was considering the same thing
  not my picture but this is who i got the idea from originally and also the person i bought my girl from i hope this gives a good idea i just wish the kikipop body was also a better poser but its better than nothing for sure and the proportions are still cute
  thats really adorable makes me wish i kept the spare kikipop body i had a while back i think id prefer something with slightly better posability though i could always order one of the yummy sweets dolls in the meantime whire i look
any of you guys happen to know of any place that sells 1/4 scale muskets  pic related
  what is this doll im in love
  i would check 1/4 scale figure makers and see if any releases came with one its easier to find those kind of parts if you know who they came with
    im impressed
  thats a dollce a head on an mmd body very cute combo here is another picture of her on her owners flickr account 
  dollce  apologies if im being dumb but do you need a proxy to buy from them
    you can buy them on mandarake as well i think
wait im a little confused are dollfie dreams copies of smart doll     i cant figure out any information but i can see that smart doll mirai released in 2014 while the dollfie dream mirai was released midlate 2015
  but just in case this isnt dollfie dream mirai first came out in 2003 some would say smart doll copied dollfie dream and danny choo would block those people on social media
  is yjapan the only place to get one of these theyre super cute
  smartdoll is pure garbage
    danny choo please stop shilling your dolls and get back to work thnx
          wow i was honestly asking a question because im new to this and havent be able to find any concrete answers
  alright i know this is bait but for anyone new to dolls reading the thread dollfie dreams came out in 2003 danny choo now owner of the smart doll brand loved volks dollfie dreams had his dd saber customized as his oc mirai iirc then in the early 2010s he decides to make his own big vinyl dolls with surprise the same size a similar aesthetic and a similar internal skeleton and suddenly he doesnt talk about his dollfie dreams anymore suddenly hes badmouthing volks suddenly his site that had been home to lots of dd posting went down all the interviews culture japan did with volks disappeared off the website   now danny blocks anyone who suggests his dolls are in any way inspired by dds or who asks questions like will you make a new body type or why isnt this pinkhaired character given a pink wig so hes a bit of a divisive figure which makes it fun to poke at people like me whore too stupid to leave well enough alone
  these threads are still good for beginners but lurk more and research on your own
hey whats going on in heohshit    
  i bet he has scratch mark everywhere in his room
  fair enough mirai is just a whimsical first name that gets reused for a lot of things
welcome to the lego general be a chad    the lego movie 2 official trailer       previous thread   /pbbg/     faq    /lg/ discord server    /lg/ flickr group    archived threads    third party information      thread challenge  build something very chad like
is 35 a good deal for the speed champions mustang fastbacka rn porsche 911 vs rsr 911
soin the last thread someone said wegetan ufo you can see an ufo in the background of a 2019 set legit      lego creator summer sets listthis list is from an company insider thats it    sowe get  a ufo/flying saucer set that comes with an alienuses an old mold in new colors  farm set  hotel modular  viking ship  summer house  monster truck  story set  castle/fortress set
   hotel modilar    viking ship   castle/fprtress set    pls reissue cafe corner    and i hope they have a dual theme of castle with english knights vs vikings thatd be based im surprised lego hasnt been too keen on vikings considering theyre a scandinavian companys  is it because all the rape and pillaging
creator is best theme ever post best creator sets and wishlists
  no
  yes buy it now
question time /lg/  what are your favourite parts packs right now  disregarding buying a lot of bricks second hand or buying specific parts from bricklink which set do you suggest your average builder pick up explicitly for interesting pieces  mixels used to be my personal goto for all those wonderful joints but have sadly gone the way of the dodo now
  sure theyre squeezing the shit out of the porsche brand    wishlist  one day ill be rich enough to afford pic related
passing
by
    thats last months
congratz anon c
  hi anon  im not sure exactly why   but this set  wedding favor set 2018  its been my choice for parts/filler bricks for myself
  creator and small classics
    the current state of legos brick quality
  its not a shop  damn thats pretty bad
  arent boxarts cg these days instead of photoshopped pictures
almost posted a picture of todays sw advent calendar gift until i remembered timezones are a thing  should we all wait to about 12pm pst until we post stuff from advent calendars does anyone else even have one  also spoilers on /toy/ would be great here
  introducing the brand new lego technic  buildable figures general              /biog/ will be rememberwelcome the new beginning
i hadnt even bothered to look at the friends calendar this year because the last few years it had a large amount of garbage but this years is actually pretty great
how is creator the only good shit in current year price to brick ratio wise speaking
  dont forget often discounted at 2550 by amazon i almost only bought creator this year
  in local shops too i wonder what is this reverse lego strategy with capeshit sets with few bricks or stawwaws prices
day 1    its a nice build but nothing too exciting atleast i know what it is
  its pikachu
  god damnit ahhhhhh
  jus some castle friends i picked up recently  comin into your general  sayin henlo
  you got me freightned mate
  ooo   whats wrong fren
any leaks on the new modular
  i guess people will just have to be careful not to go on /lg/ before opening their calendars
  building outside of bag
  you got me freightned mate    t the peasant on pic related
  i have city because star wars is shit got a spaceship too
any idea how many ideas have been submitted to lego ideas
  the 2015 i think shuttle was better appreciate the part choices though
  about 30507
    any idea how many of them were variants of the battle of geonosis
  143 actual ideas 5234792 shitposts and models made by retards and underaged kids
  id say around 57 give or take
  johnny thunder is flying mine
  brickbuilt animals molds
requesting some elves mocs up in this piece
  lmao genius
  nice i got that one too i like to put my sigfig in it though i always like to think johnny thunder is a big time movie character in lego city with movies like cairo crashdown london for ransom and prince of the blood diamonds
  this is definitely among the creator greats i need to find a dedicated pilot and get him a sky police helmet/visor combo
  my brother was really disappointed when he found out jurassic world and other dino sets had molded monsters so for his last birthday i got him the threeinone trex he thought it was the coolest    and is  a skeleton chad
  i love this guys stuff such a neat idea and all of his star fighter costumes actually look really good      a skeleton chad  heh
  not gonna lie i got the star wars one for the death trooper
  i turned mine sky pirates its a great plane    no its jaime lee curtis jeez its like you havent even pissed away a significant portion of your life on /tv
  that looks more like out of chima than sky pirates
  im getting some serious kaiju vibes off this thing nice
  i really like the boat build
  i thought id have more of these but ive yet to do much mocing with my elves collection
so a local store had this years city advent calendar for 945 because its already december it seemed to have many neat and useful parts so i grabbed one only 5 figs though which is unfortunate unless you count the snowman
  that hull is horrendous id drape more stuff over the side to obscure it top looks good though i like the spiral stairs to nowhere    its orange green and brown and theres a blurry ass skull and cross bones what more do you want
  that hull is horrendous  everything of leg slemt is horrendous though
  funtron does this mean that you have all your klocki at hand again
  and yet it has a chimaesque lion face
  what more do you want  not that anon but if you really want to make it look more sky piratesesque you need to tone down the orange a lot in the sky pirates sets orange was only an accent colour used very sparingly for details the main bases of the vehicles were black and brown with a little bit of gray dark green was only used for minifigs  theres also far too much white there especially as the base for the plane however those colour choices are necessary for the animal motif which works really nicely here but they do make it look more chima then sky pirates
just found this captain marvel set at toys r us i havent seen any leaks of it yet so i thought i would post it here
  danish were never real vikings     the history channel show even makes a point of laughing at danes for thinking they are real men not even joking halfdan says this look it up
  i could probably manage this if i saved up a bit but honestly it doesnt work for my city and would break the sense of scale fuck it all    to lego hell
  arcade but no shots yet
  this era of castle is so hygge
  brie cannot be captain marvel     not because she is a woman but because she doesnt even look like her so the men can be super jacked but we cannot even have an attractive female super hero
  wow what a sneaky release
  likely not given the two year old tradition of a basic assembly mistake on the cover of the christmas magazine/set
  its just kinda crazy how ninjago city is 80 less than this
  its super cool but has no real place in a city
  she is plain looking at best but often appears to be ugly
poll time     
  yes  not really  what did he mean by this
  thats gorgeous and swooshable as fuck
  i really wish i could have gotten that but sadly the cheapest i have been seeing go for is 55 used thats parts only new in box i think requires a blood oath and animal sacrifice
  i got new one recently for like 60 euros its a really good set
  if captain marvels powers come from love maternal love for men because shes a woman a woman who loves men where else would a womans powers come from skinny israeli accent wonder woman style ill be upset with you
  i did a dark blue/black one as well as a sky pirate one i really enjoyed that build
rate my mocs using parts from lego classic 10403
why do phones always do that
third times the charm
  i dont remember the price but i got mine at a costco so it was discounted compared to the regular store mrsp
  huh weve definitely not seen that before  nice find
      are you any kind of artist anyone know who you are
  whats the cats name
  those look like really ugly pieces comprising the roof
  that looks like a really lame coaster there isnt even a sheer drop
  no
  where i cant buy from the lego page because i dont have a burgerland paypal 
  its not about attractiveness with marvels female leads its starpower gwyneth portman blanchett tomei swinton oscar winning females are what marvel tries to cast smart move too tig ol bitties dont bring in female audiences
  what part is that hull
  this looks like it was made by a retarded toddler
  learn how to photograph better its clearly a nice moc
everytime i try to make a garage moc i just end up playing with cars    this is so satisfying to me the engine is held in by 2 studs nice a firmly its just narrow enough to fit with a hairs width
  target usa idk about international
the rear fascia is held as firmly by 2 studs as well and the engine cover opens with a single finger without unsettling the car         thats such an subjective question    how about should you rather buy a set that is everything you could possibly want or would you rather design and build it yourself
  i agree
  man thats the definition of comfy
  you wanna know what else looks like that your fucking retarded fishrice jirosama your entire life is the emperors new clothes
    i know its not the best but its the first im disappointed by the lack of a proper drop too but i like its look anyway
so like 2 years ago my niece and nephew were here for thanksgiving when they left they just dumped everything inside the next available empty container an now im digging everything out so i can bag up some sets and toylertrade them /toyler    tldr girls like animals and music and boys like robots and scifi
  why do dolls have less articulation than figs
    it was just supposed to reference the teeth painted on the sides of old fighter planes but in the face of the full critical powers of the goddamn siskel and ebert of trashy childrens lego themes i retract my headcanon that was a great plane set and i chimafied mine there
  thanks for posting these never stop
  do you know how hard it is to accurately capture that aesthetic
in the fuck you i liked it dept this was my saturday afternoon i saw it at 40 off and i thought i dont have a falcon why the fuck not
  its one of the better falcons i dont see the problem
  i saw it at 40 off  nice find its a really nice set  and its not even a gray box its a white disc
  oh sure you dont until the day someone smashes in your window and steals it and you give up on legos forever
  siskel and ebert of trashy childrens lego themes  sorry dude i just tried to be helpful because the other anon clearly wasnt sorry if it came off as condescending it really wasnt intended that way  i even said i like your moc it looks really cool with the face because it makes the rotors seem like claws to me
  fuck you too the falcon is a cool looking ship no matter how hard disney shits on the series
  people shit on star wars and most of the new shit deserves it even more on star wars legos even though i bought this set i agree with most of the hate the upcoming 2019 stuff is all skippable bleh shit except that microfighters set with the dewback that does look neat
    also i just now realized i derped when taking this pic that i closed the front panels wrong that gap isnt actually that huge oops
  i swear this is the most reddity board on 4channel
the charger looks so good i need one but i dont like black and its not out so i was looking at current sets to see what i can use and settled on pic related ill have to make it twotone but that sounds cool old school nascar look or get 2 and make a general lee itll be an 8 stud
sky police is the most retarded subtheme in city chasing criminals down in passenger planes or any kind of plane is the stupidest thing ever
  if youre that familiar with reddit you could always you know go back      one step closer to the triumphant return of space police anon were getting there
  we had space police less than a decade ago it was neat
  7190 is best falcon
  did you buy it
  ufo pieces     no thanks
  awaiting the inevitable conversion to  
  you talk like a fag and your shits all retarded
  hopefully next space police retains that space trucking western aesthetic it died out too soon
  space trucking western aesthetic     what the actual fuck are you talking about
  barely    tfw last space police was from 2009    where have the years gone guys
  god tier
  apparently little girls are too busy rping to pose figs
the posts earlier about skybound planes really inspired me ive never really tried copying a themes style before only copying colour combinations from the classic space themes this was really fun and came out way better than i expected
  probably that deep purple song and that one episode of dirty pair
  i really like your engine mocs so tiny but incredibly detailed
  nice that would fit in a ghibli film
    this is awesome mucho creative
  just rest anon  find a comfy blanket  think of cozy klocki
are there any modern sets that use the classic castle wall plates
    because they are basically polly pockets and this my ghostbusters hq became friends doll house and animal barnyard hq for that day
  johnny thunder is flying mine  i love this set i got it for my sky pirate gang purposes and i wasnt disappointed
  seems like everybody in this thread loves sky pirates which is awesome  skybound is one of the best things happened to ninjago also
    dude i fucking love this  im still bummed that we never got just a simple ww1 style plane but in skybound style
  nah i figure it will go on sale within the next month or so
  wait a minute do girls actually not move the limbs on dolls/figures as much as guys when they play im genuinely interested to know this now
  wait a minute do girls actually not move the limbs on dolls/figures as much as guys when they play im genuinely interested to know this now  yes one of the things lego learned during their billion dollars worth of research into what girls like was that boys tend to set up multiple characters and enact conflict between them where most of the action is played out in real life while girls tend to use a single character to represent themselves and most of the action is played out in their heads    not that other anon btw
  nah i was just being bantersome since we are on 4chan i appreciate you saying something at all let alone something nice    who the actual fuck is battling the sky pirates in your city anon do you just drive yournonflying cop cars to the scene of the crime and shake your fist in the air        fuck yeah
  no one cared so i sadly gonna stop next year
comfy lego
went to a lego store yesterday they had the new spidey sets out they all looked fucking awesome but ended up getting the big spidermech mostly because of sandman and vulture and the fact that its a big spider       its a really neat set nice and colourful sandman looks absolutely awesome     will 100 be picking up the rest of this series theyre great
  i am waiting for the venom set
  saw it there looked fucking incredible will absolutely pick it up shortly
  man we dont have a lego store here your a lucky person
  i want to buy these sets too and i want to do it soon before the promo item on lego website runs out i have hopefully i can make it happen
  i dont normally either it was on a cozy trip to a christmas market in germany with my gf     i like to buy a neat box of lego while im there to commemorate to cozy days
  that really does sound perfect to me anon
  does your gf buy lego too
  she buys it for me for christmas and things like that she enjoys watching me build it but has no interest in it herself       yeah it was pretty great
  she buys it for me for christmas and things like that she enjoys watching me build it but has no interest in it herself  shes a keeper
    no because theyre not his pictures        and heres the lie its a 2019 set leaked early if you actually saw it you would have bought one
do you think i could get away with buying darth vaderscastle and receiving the    darth vader podfree only with darth vaders castle   han solo mudtrooper polybag 35 and over on star wars sets   christmas carousel set 99 and over purchase   double vip
  oh yea i forgot to mention thatd id be selling the castle soon after on bl ebay cl etc
    what do you mean get away with    lego always allows you to stack on promotions what do you think will happen someone will see your order and go hey this guys getting 3 free items lets cancel his order    fucking autism
  on the lego site it says i cant but a lot of people say my local lego store is pretty easy going when it comes to stuff like that build a fig extra asscories and if youre 1 why of a promotion they still give it to you  just wondering th difference between what it says online and in store thanks for the answe though i usually never buy staight from lego too expensive and rarely any good deals or exclusives
  so german lego stores have the new sets which city should have gone there on friday
  the oberhausen discovery center lego store
yes or no    his description is    missing minifigs fire truck and most interior decoration also includes a few broken and missing pieces     my friend bought grand emporium for this guy for 150 at 95 complete and expected 118 pieces missing but it was only a couple gigs and 6 common parts
arms and lover legs are complete but i seems i went slightly overboard with leg size so ill have to increase the arms a bit  now off to thighs and hips
    w e a p o n i s e d   e   a  p  o  n  i  s  e  d
    i wonder if lego will take the hint or not     that being said we could all do with another landspeeder i believe weve only had half a dozen so far  not even double digits
this thing is big than i expected
  thats what she said
  i dont see it
  check the giant crack under her arm
  oh my god
  are those friends stickers on a porsche fukken lel
day 2    im not even mad about this rose was far from the worst thing about the last jedi
  thats fucking ace and dare i say it better than the actual sets really captures the feel of the sky pirates definitely makes me want to dig out and complete my wwistyle floatplane moc    since everyones doing the sp plane thing my contribution
  is there a blind woman who wants to get on the rollercoaster
  its those sticks to push the bars in
  ah thats a bit too far away but ill check out the cologne store on tuesday thanks for the info
  let me stop you right there and say that you can quit right now because its only going to get worse from there  this is quite literally the worst lego advent calendar ever
    but bare chested men do
  tell him about the diplodocus build
  the calendars in general are pretty shit this year  toylerthe friends one doesnt even have any minidolls in it/toyler
suddenly bagpipes
how many reptilian headpices has lego made prints on normal heads dont count i mean specialized pieces    at the top of my head i can think of the chima crocs dino suit guy ninjago snakes and a couple of star wars aliens am i missing any
  the snowman is pretty kino though
  another last exile fan    here have my stuffed goat
  but the friends one is all christmas tree ornaments which is delightful
  dragon suit guy from the latest cmf
are there any cool new themes for 2019
any news on the monorail will it use the same track of a new system will old trans be able to run on either
  i was just thinking of rebuilding this set and giving it a winter feel snowy ground snowy roof 1x1 jewel studs for christmas lights
  wait what a new monorail is it a space one or city/realistic one
  pokémon
  what
  why must you get my hopes up thats not an official set it is cool though
  will old trans be able to run on either  probably not they tend to have a shorter life span
  why would you be excited for lego pokemon do you really want to spend your money on overpriced pikachu charizard mewtwo lucario and greninja mold
  not sure why i am asking i would assume city since new space theme seems unlikely what with sw license      they do none of my trains have ever died on me
  oh right i got my hopes up 
  i think the city designers are venting their no space frustration with the new sky police line
sky pirates    back in my day we called it crimson skies arent their good guys flying dieselpunk planes too
i just had an idea and i dont know if lego would be willing to do it officially but what about a new castle theme aimed for older audience that is also a table top game similar to warhammer  where each figure siege weapon and building / castle has stat values they could use those lego dice with different printed plates to determine outcomes
  ive had this idea for a while it would be very cool however im pretty sure lego tried some sort of rpg/dnd knockoff with their heroica line though it was much simpler and for kids    i think a war game could be very cool and the possibilities for customization would be good however i am personally more interested in sci fi
hope youre all hyped to see the new modular building tomorrow
  could easily apply the same idea to a classic space flavored table top
  arcade we know or so you claim
    lego is a great company overall but they dont like afols they are fine to take your money from betas but you are not wanted even the lego movie reflected this truth
  what  its supposedly a toylersgas station/mechanics garage/nospoilers not an arcade
  some leaker you are
  yeah    thats the sad truth
  
  its going to be a tie in with those chinese exclusives
havent been able to build with lego for almost 10 years because i still live with my dad and i dont want him to think i am the hopeless manchild that i actually am    anyone else
  buy him a lego set for christmas preferably one of the architech or creator expert sets    then stop being a bitch about it and buy the lego friends set you actually wanted
  gradecuck  no room for legos in dorm
  sort of     havent been able to make friends as lego is one of the few things im interested in and want to talk about
its a starti want checker side stripe to run up to the front fender but it looks to slab sided
  lego is better than friends anyway
  i feel ya while theyre not collectors my work friends did enjoy the movies and they do enjoy playing with their kids lucky bastards
  fuuuuuck i am not paying scalper prices but i want these for my city
  not yet but i should in about a week if all goes well i have a short quest id like to run then
  i recommend you to swap ball and reciever parts of hip joints if you want legs to be decently poseable  spoilercant wait to see glorious rainbow patlabor/spoiler
  if you do please post it
  seconding this this sounds like a great idea      similar situation but ive bought lego stuff myself usually and keep it hidden still doesnt make it feel much better      please tell me there actually is a knockoff brand called legos now
      from eb  three story corner building with a gasstation in the centre and a garage / carworking place on the right first floor has a veterinarian office second floor looks to be living quarters very nice detailing 2569 pieces
if you are a mainefag check your local mardens they have retired sets the boxes are a bit fucked but the pieces are hopefully fine
  might as well open up a bit  as a kid i loved lego and my parents were very supportive they saw lego as what it was an extremely good toy with all its qualities we used to build opposing ninja castles together with my dad  called so because wed always include pretty imaginitive traps to ours  fast forward today i havent mentioned my current new collection to them i know im being paranoid and weak here but i cant escape the feeling that because i havent had a girlfriend lately and because im not a workaholic like my dad they see might see me as a bit of a manchild if i did then theres also the money im not exactly rolling in cash but im good at pinching some from elsewhere in life so i can at least afford bricks but my folks would definitely not like that if they heard want to add im not a neet  i openly build my old lego when i visit my parents mom thinks its wonderful i still see value in old things and dad too came to check out some of my builds last summer i built a small bank diorama pic related and they were both really impressed i feel my mom especially saw something beyond a childs toy in this build  five years ago mom got a ferrari polybag from a car wash thats where the newer faces in the bank are from and i was so excited of it that my dad bought me as small super hero set for christmas present as a halfjoke now im striking back with the awesome ford gt speed champions set ill give to him or for us to build together meanwhile im gonna open up some conversation and hopefully freshen their attitudes a bit about what lego actually is  sorry for the blog post just a good topic
  how are you that bad at doing spoiler tags lmfao
is there any piece of toy engineering more perfect than the minifigure
    thats a xing bao set they have a whole line of chinese styled modulars
  you can make that poll if you want i was just curious if people found moc building as challenging as other arts
  its almost like that user is toying with us but surely nobody on /toy/ would do such a thing
why does lego never use the technique of sticking pins into the bottom of bricks does it damage the pins or something
  gay
  why does lego never use the technique of sticking pins into the bottom of bricks does it damage the pins or something  yes
  im pretty sure its illegal
  say that again like lego gives a shit see 
  they specifically made a new mold of that piece to make that connection legal
  make that connection legal
  there is no groove in the tube for the rim of the pin to rest in so it stresses/squeezes the sides of the pin all pinholes have a small indented groove for that raised rim to catch on
  not your blog
  yeah lego has finally gotten the overwatch license about time too cant wait to get my mercy minifig doesnt get any cooler than that
  hope she doesnt end up as lady iron dragon redux electric boogaloo
  blue leader  worst advent calendar ever
  he asked for cool sets not cringe overshit    also i still get reminded that set 76036 uses the dan aykroyd head from the ghostbusters ecto1
  would it be better if it was green leader  spoiler

gradually making progress on the interior of my sanctum sanctorum why cant i just be rich already
  oh god i cant believe you went through and put in every one of those checkered tiles godspeed man
  i personally really dont get people like you sure i am not a very successfull person in life still being a 22 yo kissless virgin and studying something that wont help me get a job with a big income but i dont give a shit i dont give a shit what others think and even if i just have to scrape by as long as i am able to enjoy things that make me happy i dont give a shit about that either  you should adopt that mindset too just stop giving shit abut what others think of you just be yourself and be open about it you dont have to hide your passion for something because of other people
  thanks i rather enjoy playing life on infinite autism mode
  wizard level
    mixels are fun little creative sets with cool joints that cost little and double as parts packs lego cancels them  lego wants to make star wars sets it cancels space themes and forces the customers to pay the license fees  underwater underground and adventure themes are cool they get absorbed into city  technic cars can fit technic figs inside them technic figs are discontinued  castle sure heres lotr and harry potty  warhammery technoknight concept art we get half decent blue and orange puke instead and it gets cancelled  and neither last nor least  bonkles saved the company and made boatloads of money for years  lego never brought mask packs back despite the petitions  the last wave was a token presence of small crap with a cafeteria meal budget because itd take attention away from the ben 10 figs even though everyone wanted a legacy line  g1 lasted 9 years but lego claims in was 10  g2 was a very cynical cashgrab that was also sabotaged and cancelled early in favour of star wars constraction and ninjago  meanwhile ninjago is getting a legacy wave and a worn out whore of a videogame is getting a line    overwatch is going to tank because all the children have moved on to fortnite and thank goodness for it too fuck this gay company to hell there should be a petition for lego to go fuck itself
  for realism you need just one tile to be in the wrong place to draw all the ocd
  you monster
  devilish post
  if you look closely at the library side i included a busted floor joist
    
how did this theme do commercially i want more jungleexploration type sets
        might be a little too busy just wanted to green it up
  this is why you dont let castle play with space sets  
  finally a good ip like simpsons   big expensive sets have some figs with the stoned face  literally bart and homer in every set including dimensions including the cmfs  fuxking stickers    and    350 dollarydoo ghostbusters set  fucking stickers  cant even fit the ecto one properly    also lets not forget how overpriced lego dimensions sets were   30 for less than 100 pieces  sometimes just reused parts from other sets
  needs a wampa  
  if its not my picture then go find it somewhere else im not gonna waste money on something that will be on sale by christmas
    a previously unknown marvel super heroes set 76127 captain marvel and the skrull attack has emerged in a canadian branch of toys r us this image was taken by reddit user optiprimas  you can either admit its not yours or out yourself as a redditor
  i want a window piece for that airplane
  yeah but villains get like 5 aesthetic as an alignment bonus
  should be better since flesh printing bleed doesnt matter as much as yellow since its less abstract
  lmao that was me i checked reddit to see if anyone else had found it yet
  be me  want to be more open about my love for klocki  mum is super supportive dad thinks its manchildish  fill room with klocki  dad sees klocki t64 and thinks its cool  finallyacceptspng  mfw my mum now hates my lego hobby cause rooms a mess from klocki projects
  based this is why i dont limit myself to lego brand only
  man now you got me feeling salty over how unceremonious both cancellations of bionicle were couldnt be bothered to give us a decent farewell either time just oh hey guys were ending this shit  the fact that ninjago has received a fantastic legacy wave just puts salt in the wound
i think the wheelbase is to short but im done for now
  admirable i suppose but it wont make any real impact on the brand
  i liked it a lot too if lego ever brought back johnny thunder for even just one new wave of sets id lose my shit in happiness
  itll definitely look off weve seen that before but indeed it wont be as pronounced as with the yellow
  lego dominates precisely due to factors other anon was complaining about china makes klocki for people who want army toys cobi makes klocki for ww2 history nerds and mega bloks makes klocki for sci fi/fantasy nerds none of these niches compare to the main audience for klocki toys the children that lego products focus on
  nucarol  boy band skrulls

  finally syndrome hair cat minifig tail does ninjago do a vaguely close enough orange martial arts outfit
  you thinking of making a heatmiser
  tis the season sadly there is no face gay enough for snowmiser
  i really want this to compliment my winter toy shop also i love the print for mrs claus
  it is nice
  you can still buy the torso direct from lego but not the wedge lower body hair cape cheaper from bricklink as usual still plenty you can do with a bodice piece i suppose if youre into that sort of thing
  dimensions actualy were well priced for what they unlocked in game
claim your minifig waifu
this or dynamite
  i assume you mean for vegeta you may as well as well use killmongers torso since it was designed after vegetas armor
  whinyfu
  nah 30 for 4 themed levels is hot garbage my man the only one worth its price is the midway arcade since you get a bunch of midway roms to play on your console or perhaps ghostbusters since you basically play through a modified version of the movie   t bought nearly every series 1 set besides bain joker/harley all the ninja besides silver ninja all the chima besides the bird girl    wish i got the series 2 when they were going for 5 each but i was so burnt out by then i did grab like 4 cybermen/dylek to attack my retardis tho 
  post slutfus instead    also  be me  let younger family play with my legoes  fast forward two years  organizing bricks  missing all my batmen ironmen captain america spiderman supermen green lantern figs  only left me with big olive hulk wonder woman and carnage    wtf damn kids
  letting kids touch his collection  big mistake
  they left my 100 complete simpsons/ghost busters/drwho alone so im not even mad
      yeah i would only ever share lego with a similarly aged sibling or a potential child lego is too finely made to go whoring around        well its good to hear youre not upset over losing your capeflick bricks
  they should have another go at orient expedition/adventurers instead of incorporating it into city
has lady iron dragon in 70629 been fixed yet
comfy legos
day 3    what the fuck is this
  given that mercy from the overwatch sets and unikitty have exactly the same problem nope  dont expect them ever fixing that stuff given that now even the figures on the boxes show severe quality issues
  color scheme makes me think of 90s star trek
  lego original sw ship design arrowhead
so the image of the cracked figure is real
just got this qt as a gift
  yes  if that shit will actually end up on the shelves like this then my next trip to the lego store will be quite amusing
  i told you bro  i tried to warn you
  aww i want that qt gift too      this makes me upset to hear   why would they let their quality slip
  because everything lego is manufactured in china now
    i was a little perturbed when i first heard that they had a factory located in zhejiang if the standard of quality is lower there then i can only hope that the lego is segregated by region chinese factories produce for chinese market europe for european market etc     i just hope australians are not provided with chinese shipments if this is a problem
  mine is toxikita   picture not mine wish this drawfag was still here love this style
  old ice dragon also had few not photoshoped transparent bricks under the dragons belly
  reminder that white males cant complain about this toy because were sick of you buying our merchandise  t disney
  was going to post the same      ah i thought it was some obscure republican craft from tcw based on the colours
  the defiant
  cute
  looks like weakest of the line
  has lady iron dragon in 70629 been fixed yet    you cant fix it    the problem is that when you print a light color like yellow or caucasian over a dark plastic like black then the lighter color will look transparent or washed out the only solution is to not do this or to paint several layers on beneath the face which would drive up the cost per head enormously
  if the standard of quality is lower there then i can only hope that the lego is segregated by region chinese factories produce for chinese market europe for european market etc    theyre not every set produced has parts made in different regions
    it looks fuckin tiny and once again why are they using different face prints instead of the standard   face that all the other modulars used
    for a moment i thought that was the colonel
  and once again why are they using different face prints instead of the standard   face that all the other modulars used  because its a permanent change moving forward as the minifigures got more detailed body prints and hair molds the standard smiley ended up fitting less
  neat but a bit boring are there pics of the interior
  only one really new good piece
  go on brickset
i did an oldie only part i had to fudge was the spool as the old mold isnt in ldd but the rest i copied directly from scans of original instructions
  the set comes with 2569 pieces including six minifigures five animals a towtruck and a scooter   the set will be legos 14th entry in the modular building series and the thirdlargest ever created  wow theres more to it than i was expecting based on how it looks
  ye olde instructions were a little hard to read because each step was just a layer of the whole build so it was tricky to get exact bricks but fun to do
  took a few guesses to realized they used headlight bricks for windows
i now wonder what would happen if i posted this to lego ideas and see legos reaction to this being suggested
  whats a hub
  distribution center where ordered sets are shipped from
    it looks nice but seems a bit pricey at 200 bucks
    neat i still have mine got it just before the grey castle came out in 1984 though it is a bit worse for wear the helmet crests and low quality on the stickers was the biggest issue as this set didnt have a single printed piece to it afaik
  oh right
  if you look at the parts to price ratio it should be 250 so its nearly 50 off
  this goes beyond forgot to shop a few support bricks out  that boxart pretty much confirms that the increasing amount of new sets cracking after a relatively short time isnt some lolololhamhands you probably bought a bootleg from the official store  yeah right or shouldve stored your sets in a dark dry cold place in your basement in an airtight time capsule issue but a general problem with legos overall quality be it the moulding process the plastics quality the cornercutting during the part design etc  i mean how old would that minifig on that photo be a few months if thats what it takes for it to develop cracks then sorry your product isnt the toy you hand down from generation to generation as you claim to be anymore and those only the best is good enough signs you have can be tossed into the trash
  so comfy
i miss when these threads used to be comfy and slow before tlm came out and got all these adult fans into lego again
  i miss when these threads used to be comfy and slow before tlm came out and got all these adult fans into lego again  so do i but thats no excuse for complaining without posting mocs
    another  fucking  corner
  every 3 years
  every third modular has been a corner  last two modulars were not corners  what a twist who couldve seen it coming
interiors can be found on brickfan    i am amused by the price tag really it looks so small
  front light slopes are not available one can dream though
    alternate headlights car spam done
  sign design anon    is this a rendered model send it to lego idea
  this shouldnt be 200 its puny compared to the other modulars
  the design looks cool but the buildings rooms are so small it take only 2/5 of the base plate i already feel like the ratio piece/price will be screwed up by 1x1 pieces
  i already feel like the ratio piece/price will be screwed up by 1x1 pieces  definitely compare it to the grand emporium which is almost 400 fewer pieces but looks a lot larger and fills more of the baseplate  the height is pretty impressive though
  never forget rhodesia    hmm maybe that blue leader hairpiece is usefull for lego ian smith
  spoiler and back end are spot on but i really dont like the front id try to build it one stud shorter and lower also these had popup headlights so you can get away with using solid red
  lego rhodesia theme when
already complaining about the price of the modular    stay classy /lg/
    modular  detailed faces
  this is the future you cant go back now enjoy your stay
  fuck this    when did that change with the diner
  i dislike it too but you can just buy a bunch of classic smile heads and replace them
  its the fact they changed it mid way that boggles ones mind
      
  pass
     faces    i swear you motherfuckers live in holes in the ground    what they changed space from blue and grey when did this happen
    oh id honestly never noticed that  jokes on me i guess
    man this is nice i can hear christmas music just looking at it      where can i get this thats adorable      minidoll but her
  because the price is shit especially compared to the most kino modular downtown diner
the saving grace of these fenders is the ability to angle the front wheels  and damn the chargers proportions are cartoonish
  boggle
  read the thread retard
  youre a stud too long in the front and one too short in the back
    imagine trying to take care of an unruly pet when all those garage noises are going off below
  which brick is that right above the garage doors with the dots
hue
  elderly potheads
  dr jones  snakes why did it have to be snakes
  octan gas sign on the pump is a sticker  i remember being very impressed at all the printed pieces in the detectives office havent felt the need to buy any modulars since then though
  apparently it is a printed tile
  i see meme potential in this
   they changed space from blue and grey when did this happen    the bastards  wasnt it originally supposed to be blue and white but tlg had some problems or something
  actually the blue was added because the bosses thought allgray sets wouldnt stand out on toy store shelves
  modulars never have stickers though
  its the backside of a 2wide plate      its a print only modular with stickers is the cinema due to the movie tiein
  dont push it too far  youve got it good enough
why do girls get the better dragons i mean theyre actually made out of fucking blocks
  and yet star wars exists
  what are ninjago dragons
  ninjago has loads of fangirls anon
      well times change unitron was mostly grey and that was late 1980s
  so cute
  and elves has a lot of fanboys your point
  elves isnt as popular among boys as ninjago is for girls  ninjago has a huge appeal to girls its basically a unisex theme
  dnagervest  not based denagervets  or even dingervst
  i dont understand this nostalgia surrounding 80s lego i was born in 81 and loved lego but thought all themes where pretty lame i wanted many more colors and movable peices minifigs with expressions and accessories and smaller bricks and tiles    i do lament quality but otherwise i prefer where we are
    thanks anons i might replace the blue room with white panels if i can find ones big enough and have overhanging snow like  winter creator line    but it was the first set ive built in roughly 18 years so
    its rosetinted glasses basically    i mean different faces started in 1989 and people are still going crazy over having the basic  faces back
  anon you fool you never stick your brick in crazy
6 us at meijer
  tfw you are probably 1k miles from a fucking meijir
  been seeing these since early october barely selling at that fucking price more expensive than the baggies despite knowing what youre getting
  lego has definitely improved in the areas part and colour variety  something about older themes felt a bit more imaginative though
finally read to buy brick bank to add to my expert collection it looks like its the best one yet  sold out literally everywhere  now costs double in price if i want to get it from somewhere like ebay    why didnt i just buy it a fucking month ago fuck me amazon is the only one with assembly square left too and that one will be worth like a thousand bucks in a few years i should buy that one but fucking 400 for lego right now is agghgh
  every month or so an irresponsible needs a ride home from meijer otherwise i never go there i should go more though their lego aisle is great    sitting in my truck i built this lil guy should probably grab a few more
  siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
/lg/ i need some reference material what do you personally think is the best mech legos ever made
  my local one isnt great with polybags they do get in quite a few now and then but tend not to restock very often still i want to get back there and see if theyve filled out their stocking stuffer aisle the did have this little guy last time i was there yeah who needs another harry but that bird cage build is actually pretty sweet for castle stuff owls work for that but also im thinking the small dragon piece or maybe even a skelly older style with the floppy limbs ill probably have to make it larger for that or just use part of the skeleton which would look nice too nothing is more suspicious than a skeleton that still keeps all its parts together
  stories of missed sets    back to the future delorean  think ill pick it up later while at lego store  pick up mystery machine instead  delorean goes from 30 to 50  haha no big deal ill grab one later  50 to 120  fug    thank goodness for the dimensions delorean and figs
  alas the picture was swallowed by the internet goblins or incompetence either is fine
        
  thats worth getting for the cauldron and book as well
  do that too often and you turn into     may we all be so lucky
  i think the hair is a new mold too i always hated the original just because it never seemed to want to stay on the head i dont know what it is about that particular mold the new version so far has proven a lot more reliable
  nice    agreed also the tree pieces
all modular buildings should be 200 usd from now own    ill probably buy them anyway
  is brick bank being discontinued i thought it was going to be detectives office
    im sure itll be back in stock its just the holidays driving up prices
  the detectives office is gone the bank should be available again in a few weeks
the fender bricks im using wont allow the nose moved further back a stud behind the door helps i may need to add a stud to the tail
  detectives office is available right now    the bank however is sold out
  exosuit
  goblins are demeaning you cannot say that about our little green friends they just have a different cultural ideas
    how is this 200 when parisian restaurant is more complete at 160
finally got around to remaking this theres probably a thirdparty crucifix piece out there somewhere thats a little smaller
  more pieces
  small kai fire mech
  inflation
i want brick bank wahhhh
  i tried it shorter and it looks garbage also you have to take into account that the daytona model was literally a bolted on nose to the old charger grille so technically its supposed to be that long in the front i could get away with the solid nose no lights maybe i will but i do like to have small details like that
  titan xp
    does look nice without the lights if only i had stickers for it 
i love it
  looks like a monument here in my city
  brad pitt fight club  
  dont talk about fight club
  only car ever banned from nascar for being too fast    people rag on how silly it looks but its pure function the massive rudders on the wing made it impossible to spin out at high speed
  the simplicity in the old sets required more imagination when playing with them where modern sets have lots of functional action features and detailed prints reducing need for imagination and this has actually had a negative impact on play value of modern sets    play value being the artificial currency of toy manufactures
  people rag on how silly it looks  i think you mean people rag on how fucking awesome it looks    redneck in front aerospace in the back
  exosuit was a them focusing on mechs and had quite a few styles to choose from
  requesting tail end build details cant figure out how you done did it    i dont know how brick software works but any octan stickers would pop on it
  negative impact on play value    what do you have to prove that
new friends set
recently found lego in the garbage what would you do leave it or take
  take it and clean it
    take it put it in a bowl and rinse it out with hot water then let it soak for a bit
  dont talk about flight club
  thats the first thing i thought too it looked very promising but the smell was fucking awful there was all kinds of disgusting garbage in it including litteral shit
 this 
  i want to know what you were doing rummaging through garbage that stank like literal shit
  it was laying on the street someone just dumped it there and the lego was pretty obvious
    yeah but i sorted it out first there was about 20 intact pieces the rest were knockoff bricks broken parts and garbage
day 4    atleast i know what this its a bit boring though
  gross      literally who that anon was right about this advent calendar wasnt there one with a santa wookie
  i warned you this year calendars are horrible
  show us later what interesting pieces you got
what should i do lads    1 wait for brick bank to be back in stock some anon in this thread said it would be later on relying on him brick bank is the one i want the most  2 splurge on assembly square its not my fav but tons of pieces good value even though its super expensive will double in value over time even triple  3 get the diner diner is the least appealing to me of the available modulars i dont like the color scheme i do like diners but i dont like the 50s it does seem okay but i dunno    i have detectives office and parisian restaurant as well having 2 restaurants seems ehh although diner does fit with detectives office well    what do you think lads
  try to get brick bank if you can but its probably too late by now its sold out at my countrys store not backordered  you dont need to hurry with getting assembly square or the diner yet
  its from tlm2 d2c set how much is that set going to cost anyway
post hairy pooper toys
um i think someone killed dobby
the nendoroids are qt
i had these minifigures they made for prisoner of azkaban
  ill see your voldemort and raise you a gilderoy lockheart
  looks like hes giving a handy on the insert
  werewolf lupin is pretty dope
im not sure whats up with these things the castle is nice but the figs are ugly statueshit that cant even be used as toys for toys because the metal under their feet ruins the look
  dont people just remove the stands and use them how youre explaining or is that a different thing i wouldnt mind getting some toys for my toys but these are pretty pricey when i see them at walmart
  i dunno i assumed the stands were attached to the figures and couldnt be removed
i hope for pantsu pics
  if you get the doll you can just strip her totally naked
  why would i want to when she has those proportions
  do a headswap with a bigger titted doll
  actually how big are figuarts compared to revoltechs that hermione may be better suited for a queens blade headswap than the hermione doll
  rons face is perfect for rape
  yeah its on par with woodys face for that i eagerly await the creepy ron pics
james cheated on lily with a tomato and this was the result
is it weird i actually wanted to buy these dolls when they first came out keep in mind i dont buy dolls outside of action figures and i havent scene the harry potter movies since 2013
lucius is such a bishie      so whyd you want them
50 bucks for a funko mini fml
  is it true the 8 year old ginny doll has breasts as big as hermiones
  i just thought they looked nice
maybe more a tg things but now this is a thing
  fang is a cutiepoo and he is in love with mrsnorris    how big are these toys
  around 45 cm they are for an harry potter boardgames like a skirmish warhammer and you have to paint them
  wormtail looks like he shat himself
  man that body could be useful for some customs or something not paying full price just to make a custom from it tho
which character  scale  manufacturer would make for the sexiest figure     hot toys azkaban hermione
  i just want figures of the marauders so i can turn them all gay with each other
  parfom luna lovegood
  ill allow it in the case that your first setup for them is jojo poses take a few photos then you can go on to using yaoi doujins for references
no classic lego harry potter    distaste_for_plebsjpg
  no
  its pretty fun to play dressup with them
  theyre still making some look at this little niffler
  boys have plastic hair  girls have combable hair  even minerva  really makes you think
  it looks like albus might have combable hair just not a combable beard    theyre adding draco soon he has plastic hair too 
yep hairy hair plastic beard it looks weird
  i got each one at 50 off did i do good
  it looks weird  just remove it if it bothers you problem fixed
dont post it and dont post the amazon reviews
  whaaat
  obama  a good guy by any measure  its the harry potter thread alright
  i wouldnt mind having his doll in my collection hes a pretty cool character
  thats a sex doll
  lockheart is not a good guy at all hes a lying asshole
  is he a dementor
  beardless dumbledore would be kind of hot if he had a normal human face
what does /toy/ think of this 112 ko neca deadpool i already bought it
  oh thats pretty neat let us know how it is when you get it i wonder if theyll also make dd and other 1/6 neca figures
  i bought it from hong kong so i think itll take some time for it to arrive
  definitely still an interesting find though hopefully it doesnt explode or anything as it would probably be a pretty solid figure otherwise
  and it costs what i normally pay for a papa johns order
  i hope its wellmade for those that want it and that they do pfeiffer catwoman next
ko are you sure this just isnt supposed to be announced and distributed until fox decides on a date for a se movie release
  this isnt a movie costume
  looks pretty good not a fan of that sculpt but ill still probably pick him up been a fan of deadpool figures since the toybiz release which is funny because i think what the character has been turned into is absolutely insufferable but i still buy the toys i cant argue with that character design
  i think of this as a video game deadpool
thats really cool im also interested in a review once you get it
  this is when itll arrive
  sculpt definitely looks like it suffered a lot in the downscaling it was heavily textured so im not surprised when it arrives please give us some good infocus shots if youre able op
  i will
  there already is a review of it 
    aside from the kinda ugly sculpt it seems solid for a bootleg
  ko neca  thats redundant
  well at least you tried
  damn they made it neca size instead of 6 inch
  american toys made with american hamhands in mind
  huh
i hope they do a daredevil one
  found another review 
op here deadpool arrived but i wont take pictures of the figure because as ive seen in this thread there already are reviews of it on youtube  the figure has this weird substance/liquid on it that smells bitter and it feels greasy and the swords are very thin and could be easily broken and the hands are tough to take on and on you need to apply a lot of force to take them off and on but apart from that its ok
  would be cool if they did the same to necas daredevil
  did you try washing it off  also how are the joints
  i took a cloth and that took it away but still feels a bit sticky the joints are fine
why arent our figures with decresed articulation selling  i know lets put them in toothpaste containers and charge even more money for the exact same figures  dont call this a grave this is the future they want to curl up and die in
post characters that you always wanted high quality figures of
  old thread  
where the fuck my warframe figures id take revos 1000toys figuarts figma fucking anything in 6 inch range and nonstatue
  pic related and laughing octopus would be amazing
  i just wanna hold him in my hands
  how do you fuck up drinking juice from a straw that hard
  that could be a figure accessory
the one time funko pops would actually be 100 onmodel to the source
best tomboy needs to be next if figma continues doing more from idolmster
nanbaka
  does her hoodie say ussr
 maybe some day
40k in general especially space marines
  yup
  stop it hurts to think about
  i wish i lived in a timeline where she was the captain marvel getting a movie and not bland ass carol
  lesbian heavy metal space adventures will never get a movie
  ayami kojimas belmonts      this so much
  killed in a shock death in an event at the end of the first star lord era gotg book  shafted out of being in the guardians movie despite being a founding member of that version of the team in the comics  new captain marvel is essentially being treated as a subversion of the captain marvel title and a feminist icon despite doing the same kind of shit phyla did in a less interesting way while having the same amount of vaginas  shafted out of being the star of the captain marvel movie despite having a prepackaged connection to the guardians and thanos  cant even get revived in the new marvel comic climate despite being a way better super lesbian than any of the ones they are currently pushing  being phyla is suffering
  fucking this get on it bandai    this will never happen because gw are bastards who want you to buy overpriced statues you have to paint and build yourself   it hurts
1/12 with die cast parts ideally so im thinking sentinel/1000toys would be great but id accept a model kit or cheap neca figure
  honestly this feels like something mafex would do
dedede is fine too
  this newfag still doesnt knoe
  know what
you knoe who needs a robot damashii/model kit/fucking anything
  i remember how excited i was finding out that mcfarlane was doing figures from bram stokers dracula and how crushingly disappointing when it was just a box set with statueshit of the werewolf and batforms
  dear lord do i knoe for that matter a 20 revoltech of the mp evas would rock the old figures are pretty small and dated
  i think a few of them did have some figures
i am thinking about coping these is lim toys a new thing are they a good brand i cant seem to find anything about them online but these look like theyre decent quality         also maybe 1/6 scale general post preorders or shit you got
hi anon i have the ishmael editionleather jacket and its pretty solid got it the arms in my case were really tight on the joint and i was afraid of breaking it but its fine now there isnt much flexibility on the feet because of the boots but its the most perfect approach to the game character you will ever find  the negative on mine besides the arm thing is with the hand they are made of rubber and cant hold properly the handgun     even so im looking forward buying the camo one since mine was the special edition and came with ahab headvenons
  thanks for the reply anon i was curious about one thing on the ahab version the goggles on the neck can they be removed just curious about it also could you post a pic of your figures face sculpt
  coping  fuck off nigger
  imagine getting mad about a word
  oh okay i was thinking about purchasing this toy christ toyfags are the worst
got both of them from kghobby l the camo body did not come with a head cuz the delux biker body came with big boss and venoms head the camo body has the cut off gloves as actual cloth parts that are a pain in the dick to put on
  how are the face sculpts was gonna grab it from the exact same store weird that the camo body has no headbut understandable is it possible to make the camo body have a human arm or only robot arm
  heads are spot on to me the camo body was marketed like an accessory set instead of a solo peice but probably just a scam to get you to buy both not at home to check but dont think the robo arm pops off or at least did not come with parts to make it normal
big boss head
  awesome thanks so much anon think im gonna get it
  np   they are awsome for diplay but i dont collect 1/6th scale so i cant compare to other things build quality is good and little to no loose threads on things when i preorderd the had only announced the biker ver and later they announced the camo body so looks like they just packaged them both together looks like the hand of jehuty is exclusive to that set and that pisses me off a bit but oh well
          not op but how do these look shirtless i always either just went with the naked gear or parasite suit and ive long since given up on ever having a figure of the parasite suit but if these look good shirtless then i might get one too
  sorry about my delay yes they can     i cant take a picture of venoms face right now because its inside the box but its exactly like ishmael but with the horn and the scars pic related is mine ishmael
  fug looks like im going to be losing a few hundred tonight then shit
  just to get this right this version is different from the new one as far as i know only about the vest it seems they based the black vest on the sketches of the character and the new one with green vest on the game model
  its the best representation of the character which is funny because neither the packs or the hot toys one got so close to its likeness oh yes the zipper works and its a pain in the assmy case once again to put it back after i fully opened its jacket    this is the version i bought
    oh neat never noticed the chest rig being different in the new model well its ordered hope i dont regret it tomorrow
  look like are hot toy kind of quality i dont have any 1/6 scale toys nor collect em but i will let it slide would buy more of lim toy makes ocelot or even more mgs figures    and nice doggo in the backgrond
anyone ever bought anything from hobby galaxy is it trustworthy
  make your own thread you gay
    thread about 1/6th kits    site that sells 1/6th kits    its relevant anon
  kits  no figures
guilty butterflyaka quiet also coming from lim toys
    looks like theyre using rubber coated skeleton that means the rubber will degrade i want that pistol she comes with though
      no nipples no buy
where can i buy cheap 1/6th scale guns
  1/6th scale gun shows i assume
    1/6 body not included
  gun shows dont even have cheap guns anon theyre stuffed with over priced garbage
  they look cheap
  how so
  hes not a toyfag hes a polfag who was looking for an opportunity
for anyone whos jealous dont be you can buy him here 
would be cool to pair these up with the upcoming revo creatures
cute post better photos
  fuck that guys adorable
  would be amazing  if it had some level of articulation in the front claws
  nigglet where did you get this tell me now
  its from kaiyodos capsule q museum they make some of the best animal figures hes reeeeally small tho like 1/12 baby sized capybara  got mine from toysanta but they sold out your best bet is buying through this proxy   or maybe ebay
pic unrelated  i remember as a kid there were some toy robots based on the periodic table of elements   like one guys name was zinc one named copper  tin gold etc etc     all i know is that theyre not the rock lords they looked much more like transformers or power rangers    im worried they might have been some chinese knockoff of the mid 90s power rangers / ultraman / superhuman samurai trend
metalmen
  thats it thanks /toy/
    op here its not metal men i had no idea that existed    the ones im thinking of looked a lot more like power rangers or sentai robots    the more i think about it the more i believe they might have just been dollar store chinese ripoffs like the thing youd see in my picture     i guess i was just wondering if anybody ever saw such a thing
okay ive been doing some research its crazy how ignorant i was about toys  when a japanese company is done with their line of toys they sell the molds to american companies to be used for rebranding and cheap mass production    this has been done with various brands like chokogin godaikin dorvack etc etc    a set of molds probably got passed down to somebody making cheapo dollar general toys eventually ill keep digging around
any tips on stop motion for a newfag to toy animation    i want to make a kaiju movie with my toys i am mid functioning autistic and am willing to put in the work to get it done
there are smartphone apps for beginner level stop motion is good for letting you mess around and learn basic animation
use camera stand  pose toy  take pic  move toy  take pic  have lots of patience    ive done it before but only like 2 2 second clips    i might do what  said and get an app and do play around with it some more
i was wondering some stuff myself should i be taking 1 frame per photo and then playing back at like 30 fps to make it smooth or should i be playing more fps or less
  higher fps with one photo per frame can get you smoother animation so long as the transition between each movement is subtle think of an elbow bending from 90degrees to a straight 180degrees if each shot is 3degrees of bend you can get a modestly smooth animation at 30fps however at 60fps itll be smoother but with a shorter animation time
  get a remote and a tripod ideally a proper tripod so you arent knocking the camera when youre repositioning the figures but anything will do so long as it holds the camera/phone steady    theres programs that will allow you to overlay the last image over the current scene which basically means you can line things up better for a smoother movie    stikbot is a popular stop motion toy at the moment and they have a free app you can mess around with ive not used it though so it might be shit
float like a butterfly sting like a bee
  holy shit those soft goods look fucking awful
  really i think they look pretty good especially at that size
  those poofy shorts  that bathrobe  the coarse weave on the both of them  when will this soft goods meme end for the shorts at least they could have just molded them on this looks horrendous
  this looks horrendous    well yeah depending on your screen this picture is almost twice as big as the actual toy
  nobody mentions the 4 horsemen style feet  those are egregious but then nothing about this figure is close to accurate
  theres nothing wrong with the feet theyre like how theyve done other feet its fine it poses well and can actually stand on their tiptoes theyre lovely figures
  theyre lovely figures  i dont know about that one dawg
  like not to be contrarian but i actually dont see anything wrong with that
  i can live with the boxer shorts since those can be kinda puffy like that but that robe is rediculous still though itll be nice to have a figure for tyson to box
  ok that figure sucked why is this the only figure talked about from this company every other release being big buff guys seems fine
  she looks really really tired kinda like a really bored chinese convenience store owner
  it became a bit of a meme and there were arguments about it that and bisons fragile shoulders didnt put alot of hope in the toyline but theyve ended up doing pretty alright  sadly it looks like theyre kinda stuck in variant colour hell right now
i cant wait for the muhammad ali the mike tyson is great
inoki when
  i dont own this figure but see it for sale at gamestop i actually think it looks fine in person bags arent noticeable
  this i want a njpw toyline so bad sc or figuarts would be so fucking good
  i wish figuarts started with njpw instead of trying to get gaijin money with the flop of a wwe line id buy my boy kushida in a heartbeat
arent storm collectables like an inch too big to fit in with most of your figures
  big enough to fit with this whore
  depends on how much someone cares about that sort of thing
  i dont care about it at all
      kushida tanahashi okada liger uggghhhhh i need them
  you are a loser
  sure keep spamming the same thing you clown
im going to buy the living fuck out of this dragonality when they release it if they release it
  gosh ive always loved ali but i just think storm collectibles cost too much for what they are    i wish neca had gotten a proper crack at a realistic alitheir comic book one looked kinda weird and after buying and loving their clubber lang i can believe in them making a pretty darn decent boxing figure
  this robe honestly looked kinda bad even on the 1/6 version they should have known better than to try it again at half the size
  coarse weave  the shorts are smooth as anything and the bathrobe looks like a bathrobe this is really well done and scaled softgoods literally nothing wrong with either

  i would prefer it if the pokemon trainer amiibo was all 3 mons on one stand itd be a lot cooler and not as much packaging
whens the captain falcon action figure launching
  tba world of nintendo 25 exclusive multipacks 8bit jumpman and donkey kong inkling boy and 2 squids samus and 2 metroids  i saw the metroid pack at thinkgeek yesterday passed because they were the plastic version
  ssoon ii hope    pls
still no digby nendoroid to hotglue  it hurts
  probably cost more too   both to make and selling  im fine with with the single as long as player 2 amiibo with blue happens
  anon  blue isnt in smash
  is the starlink arwing worth 40 i wont be playing the game til next year at the least
    do you want a star fox toy then sure    do you not care about star fox then maybe not
  then explain all the marths
  oh shit will they be selling it online too i hope the stores actually have enough cause thats a good deal
  it honestly feels a little cheap and the starfox character toy looks soft and a little shitty    id wait for some heavy discounts the game is okay but not worth the investment at that pricepoint
  i just care about the plane and maybe the partswapping with other planes
  plastic or squishy i like em a lot
is it too late to get iggy koopa
  4 captain falcon with 164 scale blue falcon never ever
  1/12 scale captain falcon with 1/12 scale blue falcon model kit     plz
  the plastic ones are just bad though it makes no sense for them to release that one
  i think theyre pretty great a bit more durable shame about the seam though
  i have it and its cool but not 40 quid without the game cool
    47 inch captain falcon with a blue falcon to scale is almost as likely as nintendo ever releasing a new f zero
  you are aware that 164 scale is the size of a hot wheels car right
  hi there    you seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post luckily the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up you appear to have used a tripcode when posting but your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation whoops you should always remember to stop using your tripcode when the thread it was used for is gone unless another one is started posting with a tripcode when it isnt necessary is poor form you should always try to post anonymously unless your identity is absolutely vital to the post that youre making    now theres no need to thank me  im just doing my bit to help you get used to the anonymous imageboard culture
got my display put together added sora chief  crash to fill out more space but i also really want those 3 as well    definitely wouldve stuck banjo in if he had any figures besides that old ass diddy racing one
  except he didnt you fucking retard stop pretending to be an oldfag no one is buying it
  says the guy who doesnt recognize very old pasta
shouldnt he have an amiibo
  implying i dont recognize it     its one of the tell tale signs of a faggot refugee pretending to be an oldfag by broadcasting how in touch they are with 4chan culture when they dont have a clue because everything they see is reposts from other newfaggots     its right up there with shit like who are you quoting redditspacing and any variation of mongoloian basket weaving forum no one who has been here more than a few years posts any of this shit
  that games only gonna keep dropping id hold off
  yeah and ken and piranha plant which was shown during the direct op image was made before their reveals though
  its one of the tell tale signs of a faggot refugee pretending to be an oldfag by broadcasting how in touch they are with 4chan culture  no i just dont like attention seeking faggots who feel the need to have an identity on an anonymous image board if you want people to remember your screen name go to a website that uses them
  yeah if theyd lose that seam theyd be much nicer it shouldve been a horizontal seam around the base or something
  we have more chance of gsc or bandai making a plastic model kit of fzero racers than a new game
why the fuck is it called mario new package ver when the package and the contents are exactly the same as it used to be not a single thing fucking changed stupid fucking bandai
still no kirby nendo or megahouse news  why
  i recommend the 4 inch sentinel megaman super fun to pose
recently got my preferred samus in anticipation for the new game not a fan of smash bro ver and it being my first amiibo ever im pleasantly surprised at the paint app quality and the satisfying luster of the armor    for the price 10/10 would smash with
  what pokemon figures look good with the figma red the tomy toys at least the older ones ive got look cheap in comparison id like a decent alakazam or scyther if anyone has any recommendations based on those two
  most decent are the model kit scyther and hasbro alakazam
  the newer tomy stuff looks better but they recently lost the licence to wicked cool toys who so far have been pretty poor they have some interesting scale pokemon coming in later waves so were really just hoping the quality picks up    the d/sh figuarts are obviously the highest quality but they sold pretty badly at release so the line didnt go far and they now reach absurd prices on the aftermarket
  i had a similar experience anon i thought theyd be shit and then was surprised at the quality for the price and got hooked
  please
  the only ones i was interested 8n anyways were the charizard and blastoise but charizards joints looked super ugly and blastoise i just missed out on
gamestop took my money and couldnt be arsed to send me the incineroar figure i ordered  now its unavailable on the website  fuck this shit gamestop exclusivity is such a fuckup
  im sorry that happened anon that really does suck balls maybe itll drop in price on ebay
is this real
  unironically buys luchalitten garbage  gets dabbed on
    youre retarded
  garbage  being this jealous of hunky roarbro
  if it makes you feel better i ordered it the last time it was 1499 and they cancelled my order then i ordered it again at 1899 and they cancelled my order again no explanation either time and theyre not responding to messages theyre garbage
  damn anon that fucking sucks i got it when it was 14 too and yup they completely ignored my emails ill bet they were already out of it but still taking orders dumbasses      yeah guess well see at this point im going to get one out of spite even if its a little pricey meh its a seriously firstworld problem but im butthurt
    as a last hope you could always check store availability and give the clerks a call to hold it for you
if steve gets in smash you will unironically see 30 year old dudes suddenly asking anyone know where i can get a good deal on this steve figure meant for 7 year olds
  thank god thats not going to happen incineroar is already going to be enough secondhand embarrassment
  meant for 7 year olds  we already do that with won and pokemon figures whats the difference
  how much of an insecure faggot are you
  touch a nerve did i
is the tomy mewtwo decent also whats the best nondarts charizard
  it is decent specifically its more poseable than jakks but very floppy so yes decent    for zard i want to say pic related while the best mega forms were the ones tomy usa released a couple years ago
im about ready to suck a clit for the won falco figure i need him for my star fox collection
  i want to sell mine at some point it and fox are boring figures i do enjoy peppy and slippy but only because they arent in smash
  yknow im not sure how id feel about it in real life but the idea of eating a girl out in exchange for a figure is kinda hot
  i would if their shitty website would work
  any girl who is willing to give you a childrens toy in exchange for you eating her out is going to be the last person you want to eat out
  good point anongood point
  oh shit i actually called them and they had one scooped that shit ill still have to figure out getting the refund for the one they lost but at least my spite is satisfied    be kind to workers on black friday yall
when i started collecting amiibo i told myself i would never stoop to going online and i would just buy them as i found them in store and i just broke that rule hard  10 amiibos ordered thank iwata for these reissues
  the tomy mewtwo is a case of getting what you pay for  its perfectly acceptable for the 1015 it retailed for but if aftermarket prices have exceeded that then id recommend just saving up for the darts or vah ones
  youd think figma would jump on this one by now
  he might be considered too obscure although dark pit got a figure
  they were already making pit dark pit is just a recolour
tfw the best arwing model complete with moveable thrusters is a goddamn toys to life thing
  i wish we could get those stands but yeah i also love the interchangeability of it almost wish the gdiffusers werent part of the wings
  is the cockpit openable can fox fit inside
  theres a hole on the underside of the ships that the pilots fit into after placing the pilots onto the controller
  its really nice so is the fox figure that comes with it
i am now tempted to buy more starlink ships then mix/match them and repurpose them as a star fox team  
  wolfen when
  stock arwing  fox  stock cerberus  arwing gdiffusersupside down  falco  gamestop cerberus  arwing gdiffusers  slippy  stock cerberus  arwing gdiffusersrightside up  peppy
  no peppy echo of fox plus amiibo  no slippy echo of falco plus amiibo  nintendo you fucked up
  i need to buy more arwings
  the game fucking bombed so around about never
i pirate nintendos games why would i buy their merch    theyre a horrible company with anticonsumer practices that lies about the effects of piracy on the industry it doesnt cost them shit yet theyll ruin your life in court if they catch you with rom files     piracy also upsets conservatives because it doenst give money to the rich another reason to do it
  you think other businesses love their fans and freely distribute their products for you    it doesnt cost them shit yet theyll ruin your life in court if they catch you with rom files   you freely said you only pirate their games of course it costs them money and its not like they sued random fans for having roms they were taking down a website that was widely distributing illegal copies life lesson do illegal things and youll sometimes be punished
  sir we only talk toys here
  how pathetic can one man be    wahhh i leech off of society because orange man bad  wahhh maaaa change my diapies i steal from companies and they do things about it    you are unironically the most pathetic poster ive seen on /toy/ congrats
  look who still lives in a basementyou
still no news on ssbu simon  richter amiibos
  you are unironically the most pathetic poster ive seen on /toy/ congrats  youre bringing some strong competition by dragging in trump and assuming hes liberal just because you dont like him
  the guy literally posted    piracy also upsets conservatives because it doesnt give money to the rich another reason to do it    i feel sorry for you that you have such poor reading comprehension skills oh well maybe your next post will have an actual logical point i doubt it based on your previous outing though for the record im not a fan of trump or anything but the dude using hurr conservatives are all evil as his argument is pantsonhead retarded sorry if you cant comprehend
  not the person you responded to but he could still be a centrist and hate what both sides are doing
why cant you dumb retards just stay on your containment board
  heh i suppose that is possible but to say that im assuming hes liberal just because i dont like him is the weirdest stretch and lack of logic ive seen in a good while i think one would understand where i was coming from without jumping to such an odd queer conclusion      lol okay dude keep on stealing your games and shit  used goods  last i checked selling a used good is a 1 to 1 transaction i bought 1 good and sold 1 good to 1 person its not nearly the same as someone ripping someone elses creation and then distributing it to the entire world without cost where is the comparison here    dumb enough to pay for  lmfao for you to call someone fucking dumb for contributing to society is justwow fucking wow  i reward developers i appreciate with my money sorry you dont feel the same way is it because you have no empathy or are you just broke as a fucking joke so you make up false justifications i have a feeling its both    are you seriously complaining that hasbro named a toy line misfits which is an actual word in the english dictionary    you are seriously a broken human being please reconsider so many things
  they are evil though  hahahahahahahahahaha
  lol and one more thing  you even bring up in you very own post the subject of sales  sales yes sales sales are a big concern for a company for an industry    sales man it all revolves around sales where is the next video game without wny sales happening there is none the next nintendo console with no sales happening never will exist    so why do you admit sales are important the in the same breath go to act holier than thou for not contributing to said sales you literally note yourself that sales wont be affected because you know what an important factor that is again sales and since it is so damn important to the longevity of a company and in some cases an industry as a fucking whole one can easily make the logical conclusion that people contributing to those sales are well contributing to the growth of a healthy industry while the rest are you guessed it leeches  someone still has to buy shit or no one is downloading shit because there will be nothing to emulate    its too bad you are still so fucking brain dead that you wont understand a single fucking thing i said
nintendofags are such suckers they save up their allowances to buy new consoles and games on day 1 then end up buying them again because of better console version or a remaster same game w/ new hat all they end up left with are like 5 games and a bunch of lesser version 3rd parties that cant fit in their hard drive because they dont own a ps4/xbox after that they get all defensive and hopeful that this aaa 4k hd game ends up on the switch
  hasbro apologizes to jerry only  oh its you
i sure love to talk about nintendo toys here
  um you know you arent fooling anyone    remasters  literally every console has them and plenty of them ff kh fucking crash and spyro and they sell people like good games shocker  cant fit on hard drive  and what world do you come from where a ps4 base version doesnt need a fucking external hd to fit more than a couple of games on    how sad you must be at this very moment to have grown up as a person who lies on the internet i apologize for you
  thats okay i forgive you its very noble of you to admit that youre obviously ignorant that base ps4s can hold at least 500gb for many of its own remasters and at least the 20 exclusives you can play on it
  instead of complaining report the posts as off topic
changing subjects here are figures we need for smash    figma   dark samus captain falcon sheik marth ganondorf rob chrom ike little mac palutena robin shulk corrin bayonetta ridley belmonts and preferably young link and botw link     figuarts   dk fox peach daisy dr mario pichu fuck falco wario diddy wolf rosalina greninja bowser jr k rool incineroar    nendoroid   ness jigglypuff ice climbers game n watch gsc could get clever lucas dedede olimar villager piranha plant pac man     model kit/fucking anyone who will make it  rob wii fit trainer miis with different addon packs duck hunt dog     bring arts  cloud not kh
  honestly i doubt that figuarts would make any more nintendo figures im almost positive that they lost the license to mario either that or they were lazy and could only offer a good first wave a measly repaint and a mini bowser i hope for a dr mario though captain falcon needs to happen but idk nintendo has ignored him for years only thing keeping him living is sakurai
  adding on because im bored also i didnt mean to add corrin to that list    these are the figures that would make the most sense because of an existing line and them being relevant enough etc  figma marth ganondorf palutena ridley  figuarts peach wario  nendoroid ness lucas dedede villager    figures/lines that could have a shot to be made by being due to nostalgia factor/their series as a whole is beloved  figma little mac shulk bayonetta belmonts  figuarts dk line starfox line jumpstarting their pokemon line dr mario  nendoroid ice climbers olimar piranha plant pac man    figures that pretty much have no shot because they are not very relevant characters outside of their games release window and outside of smash bros  figma dark samus captain falcon sheik chrom ike robin  figuarts daisy bowser jr  nendoroid jigglypuff wouldnt fit because of the trainer nendoroids game n watch  and rob wii fit miis dhd    and ba tier  cloud
  im almost positive that they lost the license to mario  how could that be true when theyre releasing a new box  i agree with you though thats just what would make most sense to me if they were made at all because i dont really see gsc venturing into a sf or dk line either
    isnt nintendo no different from marvel in the sense that you have to pay/have rights per character instead of the whole umbrella covering said characters jakks main focus is always shelfwarming with mario but every once in a while they throw in splatoon and metroid then we have figuarts mario then pokemon with the latter being licensed under nintendos 2nd party tpci
id rather have a figma dedede desu nendo might be too small
  wait theyre releasing a new box can you send a picture of it here ive not heard about that at all also street fighter has a fully fledged line with sh figuarts
  i want to believe that they made warau salesman as practice for something like dedede its probably very flawed so now they can fix any mistakes they might have made maybe
  youre using old pasta incorrectly you fucking tourist
  figma dark samus  figma roy and marth  please
    hi there    you seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post luckily the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up you appear to have put an identifier in the name field when posting but your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation whoops you should always remember to stop using your identifier when the thread it was used for is gone unless another one is started posting with an identifier when it isnt necessary is poor form you should always try to post anonymously unless your identity is absolutely vital to the post that youre making    now theres no need to thank me  im just doing my bit to help you get used to the anonymous imageboard culture
  the issue was mario sold well the rest of the releases sold like shit its why hes the only one to get morw than 1 rerelease also their plan to sell accessory sets completely backfired since no one wants to pay 20 bucks for pipes and blocks    jakks has fared slightly better but now its really clear theyre terrified of doing anything outside of mario repaint and random enemy grunts we never even got a daisy or rosalina or toadette despite how sought after their peach figure was
  good thing we got all those yoshis though
  there is either no picture of the new box yet as it may release any day now i think or it ha released and its just literally the same old box but the product is for some reason titled new package ver  perhaps we will see soon if any new boxes are seen in the wild/online or realize it was just some kind of marketing scam lol
  jakks really disappoints me in the initial press release they said they had the rights to stuff like kid icarus and fzero but nothing ever materialized every non mario and zelda property they had the rights to got a few things and disappeared its been a crazy long time over a year since they released anything non mario that wasnt a repaint/rerelease its basically just world of mario now fuckin a
    isabelle spring version is getting a rerelease in april
  the new package box is literally exactly the same as the original it just says new package ver on it       jakks fucked themselves over by not locking down shelf space in the first few years target and walmart dropped them so frequently that it wasnt uncommon to see them carrying only a single wave release before phasing them out for some movie tie in toys instead toys r us used to be the one place you could find them but that obviously isnt an option anymore    i think the biggest issue theyve had is they could never find a decent balance for their releases yoshi has always been a shelfwarmer but hes a cheap easy repaint so he gets new releases every few waves but then the dk/diddy releases were on shelves for so long they ended up killing an entire scale with the dong then theres slippy/peppy who got rereleases no one asked for while falco is stuck at 90 dollara on ebay zelda shiek and villager seemed like the releases that killed all the nonmario stuff you could find them for over a year at stores because nobody bought them
  while falco is stuck at 90 dollara on ebay    great i was planning to open mine but now
  hes exaggerating its like 4050
  getting cleared out time and time again is bullshit and yet bendy and hello neighbor have permanent peg space in the aisles right now but not nintendo oh sure theres pokemon but theres no reason won shouldnt be there too
  fuck yes
  wow    of all the cheap jewish tricks to pull this is one of the most insulting    dont fucking advertise something as new when it isnt god that pisses me off
  gotta get those boxed collectors money
speaking of packaging changes man this looks so much nicer than the boring red from before
i guess this does prove that its no longer a general nintendo line and is just mario    unless theyre doing different packaging for each property
  according to this guy on the won subreddit who apparently works for jakks theyll be using different packaging for each property    not off the table doesnt sound like a for sure thing to me though
dont forget this for your smash collection      making the fireball just on a stick is pretty lazy
  oh shit im gonna need that for sure
  not off the table  yeah sounds like the current plan is just mario for now i cant blame them if the other stuff just wasnt selling though id like to see them just make these figures available from them directly through an online store im sure theyd see more enthusiasm for other franchises from collectors than they did from the general public in toy aisles
  tfw only want the baddies but bbts only has the entire wave for preorder along with mario and fire luigi individually
  rip won  not that it was successful anyways i used to think anything that wasnt link would be rare    and this likely means capt falcon and pit are no longer in the works
  im this guy   if she collects nintendo toys and got a falco but isnt really into star fox i will literally suck that clit deep in my mouth and stroke her throbbin bean to climax in exchange for that falco
  im ready for ya
  bandai promises new packaging for upcoming mario rerelease and lies  jakks actually comes out with cool and improved packaging  fuck you bandai im still pissed ive never felt so lied to by a company i cared about before
  alright maybe im overreacting lol but its like come on    this is hot tho
  nope nothing yet
  a company i cared about  uhhuh
  wheres the mario 1up undies fake news
  sheik fox peach falco fox wario diddy bowser jr piranha plant  world of nintendo for you
if i wanted all the unique hands for shf mario what would i need to buy
  fire mario and set b
  dankeschon
  when are these out 
  january
  its kind of sad but that is really the easiest option for anyone who wants a figure of classic samus id kind of like to pick one up myself
  hey thats my mockup pretty cool
i just paid for pic related on ebay first straightup collectible statue ive bought everything up until this point has just been buildable kits i can feel myself becoming less of a normie i forgot to check but hopefully it still has the certificate too when it arrives since it was described as new condition
the only nintendo product that matters right now aside from the megahouse
  fucking christ im excited
  if they made some of the fzero machines in buildable kits like tamiya with articulating air brakes and stuff that would be the raddest shit
  theyll never make kirbies with the copy abilities i want it makes me sad
  statue
  looks neat how tall i didnt even kniw they made this also starfox zero is a good game also i still need my falco fig also starlink arwing is ok
  nice the only weird thing about that statue is they expect you to glue it down when you put it on the base which is exceptionally odd i was going to get some museum putty for mine
  how tall  says it right there on the box
    which ones do you want
  yeah im retarded and saw it after looking at it again
  i want freeze because the parka is adorable but since we have ice i doubt its going to happen crystal shards has a few abilities that i love namely curling rock and refrigerator that seem too obscure in the face of all the ones they havent done    the other one i want is ufo which isnt that implausible now that ive thought about it again
  the nice thing about these kirby figures is that even if the kirbys dont come packaged with abilities theres still the chance although a very very small one that they could put out ability sets    personally i would prefer they keep doing things the way they are and releasing recolors give me a green white and red kirby
post your childhood favorite
  i recently found one of these but dead batteries so i dont know if its good or not    is it worth me buying a bunch of dcells
  bump trying to decide whether to keep it or not its a big gun
  just go for it whats the worst that could happen as long as your not paying crazy money for it
  being out 12 bucks for the batteries
upgraded the shit out the spring and left marks on my friends
mythic legions allstars 20  mythic legions soul spiller  2nd advent of decay pre order  the preordered items for the 2nd advent of decay preorder summer 2018 the allstars 20preorder spring 2018 and the soul spiller preorder fall 2018 are all expected to ship from our factory to our warehouse in february 2019    missing sword horsemen  if you get pledged into the mythic legions advent of decay kickstarter campaign for 3000 or over and you didnt receive your kickstarter exclusive version of sword horsemen please contact 4hmdshippinggmailcom     upcoming preorder mythic legions ogres   many mythic legions fans have been asking since we revealed them  the first release of mythic legions ogre scale figures will be going up for preorder will begin on monday december 3rd and will end on thursday december 27th and our current plan is to try to keep the allin for this wave around 20000    four horsemen on instagram      bbts has advent of decay allstars 20 and soul spiller waves up for preorder at an increased price      complete list of figures       accessory list can be found here      last thread  
what did everyone get from the instock sale    i ended up getting 11 basic figures 4 legion builders and a weapons pack more than i should have spent but i didnt want to miss out
  personally i skipped out on this sale i got everything i regretted not getting in the 2nd advent of decay pre order  skeleton wings    if i would have known the store sale would have gone this smoothly i would have ordered now instead but yeah just waiting on my 2nd batch of figures to arrive
  i ordered everything i wanted and more back in april and completely forgot about it
  picked up mandy and an iron knight just to make use of the extra torso pelvis and head from the deluxe knight set  wish i could tell past me not to go for the second preorder if id known it wouldnt be difficult to get the figures i wanted  anyways im waiting on calavius and bromdenn from the second preorder wave  calavius will look so good against romulus
ordered 1 of each gobbo except snagg which i now regret and then f5d so much that i ended up placing a second order for an iron knight deluxe kb2 and dark forces weapons pak   adding on to my existing preorder of 2 skele builders an iron knight and 2 kb2s     also these just came i have a problem
things i would like  female head packs  skeleton head pack  dragon mount  cool enemies like lizard men no more beefcake ogres and trolls  wizard robes
so this is my order so far allstars 2º preorder and instock what did you guys get  turns out i can get one more thinking of something different maybe the barbarian warrior for the halforc look to swap parts around skelefu either her or malachi
i bought a second hagnon and a fifth skeleton builder but seeing that theyre still in stock imtempted to buy another set
  malachi and give him the spare head from the skeleton builder i personally fell in love with that look
  ordered delphina a few months ago during the second preorder and bought some orc legion ladies during the instock sale i might try to pick up jjuno and the valkyrie woman if theres another instock sale as cool as these figures are they really make me wish we could get a decent warcraft or lotr line
  well shitmaybe i will keep him  do that
i love these guys but wish they photographed better the glow is alright but you really need a black light to give them a good charge for pictures
does anyone have gryshaa and black series skiff guard lando calrissian id love to see how good they look together
  i skipped on hagnon last night but im regretting it a little bit im a sucker for glow in the dark figures
  that looks pretty good i wonder how a vampire knight head would look on that body
feeling happy got a cavern dwarf barbarian builder and morgolyth on the 2nd pre order yesterday i got a brother mandibulus 2 gobbo builder vamp builder and steel knight what you guys got    also does anyone that has the barbarian builder could post some pics of the steel knight with her black helmet
  this made me get malachi despite not getting any of the elves it just looked so good    i also got a skeleton builder because this
i wasnt really happy with the grey on the iron knight builders so i repainted one to be a little darker gave it a wash and put some gold on the detailing i like how it turned out but it shows up very poorly in pictures ive got several more though and im gonna try some more garish stuff on the next one im thinking orange/black or orange/blue      if no ones gotten you by tonight ill post a pic after i open my silver up the full helmet or the one with the mouth
  full helmet please anon thanks 
legitimately surprised that the deluxe knight builder 20 is still in stock
beginning this coming monday december 3rd at 300pm est the preorder for the next wave of mythic legions figures begins and will continue through december 27th kkurzog the ogre charges the gates and wields his devastating mace at the siege at bjorngar
  keep your eyes peeled for reveals of the other characters in this incredible mythic legions wave along with various other details throughout this week    noooooo no more toys i want guys please my anus is bleeding as it is
  ill wait for video reviews and instock aftersale i dont trust that elbow would not scratch    even if i didnt get the instock aftersale theres always bbts id rather pay bbts tax rather than risk bork figures
  what will this wave entail
  okay youre perfectly allowed to be a dumbass
  you too youre welcome
    i swear they wont be happy till im completely broke
  i swear if its just the fucking ogres
  another fucking sale  during the designated month of spending money on other people    youre killing me and my wallet 4h
  preorder during christmas spending time  missed three days of work and for some reason didnt get my earned leave applied to it  this is terrible
  spending money on other people  why would you do something like that
the female barbarian builder is marvelous im really struggling to not order a bunch of builders right now
  4hm will replace your figure if it breaks tho youre making a mistake
    its almost as if weve known this was the date of the next sale for weeks like it was in the op of the past few threads or something even     knowing this sale was coming is the only reason i didnt get more from the instock sale       when asked about this at toycon nj they said it would be more then just ogres they said a while back that the all in is expected to be around 200ish so even if all three ogre builds were included there would still be some room for standard figures that said i believe its only the orc and barbarian ogres for this one so im sure there will be at least four new standard figures     dream figure would be a harpy character as its been confirmed that the gothtropolis figure bird legs and arms swap perfectly onto mythic legions torsos use a femvamp head and a corset/bikini torso throw on a pair of wings and you get one hell of a unique character
what is/was the sword horseman i looked around and wasnt able to find anything    also girlfriend bought me mandibro and is getting me hagnon for christmas im gonna wife the shit out of her
  uh at least extend this til jan also it would be nice to get the soul spiller line preorders with this because i missed out and would like to save on shipping
  how many of this lines collectors are gay
  ask people for prepaid visa cards for christmas and get in there on the 26th lol
  sword horseman was a freebie weapon given to anyone who spent 30 or more on the kickstarter if you bought your figures from either of the pre0order periods from the storehorsemen website then you wont get one though a different colored version comes with thistlethorn if you pledged for your figures during the ks and did not get a sword it was bagged loose in the shipping box contact the 4h via the email in the op with the subject being the missing sword horseman and a copy of your pledge theyll get it to you eventually as they were shorted them by the factory and are waiting for more to be delivered       every sale so far has been stretched out another week or so sadly the 4h have to keep to a certain schedule so they can fit production of the figures in at their factory this time of year is tricky as theres a big chinese holiday and pretty much everything there shuts down for weeks     at least with the preorders theres no real rush to commit just as long as you get your order in before the sale ends youll get whatever you paid for
any status on the freebie from preordering in the first hour of soul spiller
  b i g
    oh yeah
  i mean im bi and a furry which is why i buy most of the furries from these lines
  im sorta bisexualish and i buy the line but its not for wanting to sex big muscly dudes big muscly dudes dont do it for me other than being my ideal for myself
  sooo how about the manly boarrior
  i love mythic legions but ima need some fucking accessories in order for me to drop cash on anything    cause its looking like this dude only comes with a mace fuck that
    there ya go it sits pretty differently than the other helmets in a way that doesnt do it any favors a little low and forward so the chin looks extra big
    with a couple others
  bet itd look good on the goblin builder body make an evil dwarf
  delphinas alt head doesnt match the skin tone on this right didnt get any of the fleshy girls
so besides the guy with dioramas how is everyone displaying these
  i can test for you later anon if youd like give me a moment
  i pray they use the thistlethorn body and give us a meerkat i will have my timohn and pumbuus damnit
  noo why do you keep giving me figures i want to buy but i might wait to see the articulation on these in action  then again the 3rd of december is my birthday
  i believe its only the orc and barbarian ogres for this one  you dont think the vamp is going to be in this wave
  i just have mine chilling on these cube shelves these are all of them until now i dont know what im going to do with the new ones ive got the two i ordered from the kickstarter unopened and then 4 from the shop yesterday
  according to the very limited information someone got out of them at toycon nj they mentioned the price for the ogres would most likely be around 55 each maybe 2 for 100 during the preorder quoting the guy who posted about this from the 4h forum     they usually dont offer grouped deals like that for mixandmatch figures so my inference based on their previous sales makes me believe were only getting two ogres in this mid wave a fourth ogre is most likely in the works and i could see another midwave release with the vamp and mystery ogre and even more new figures     now that the main molds are finished and they know the figures come out well turn around time for new releases drops significantly itll be every 34 months for new figures at this point until the next big release is ready    that next big release being the horses and mounts which they mentioned could be a kickstarter or a preorder undecided but will have both character specific mounts in sets or each part sold separately there will also be generic mounts with separate tack so you could mix and match the parts for the horse you want to build     and again there would be new figures arethyr being chief among them         while i dont have an updated pic with my 20 figures mixed in this was my evil horde set up for the longest time though now the legions will be split up among no less then three of my shelves probably get a whole bookcase to themselves soon enough     eventually when i finish renovating my basement ill have a much bigger much more intricate display/playset type thing designed specifically for mythic legions and other fantasy figures but thats a long time off at the moment
does anyone else wish these were modular pegs like nendos
  ml and ar    me too
  nah
im not feeling the way i did the flames nor how i painted them but this is i guess the end of this dio still needs to be sealed tho
i know that these are just the 10 bodies but man i love them the new helmet is so rad and the trident is such a solid weapon gave the bull horned one a sword from the knight weapons pack love the red belts too wish we had some that were more variety in colors
  all he needs is a net and hed be perfect
i really need to get more shelf space dedicated for all these bastards but hey some bargains boys in a perfect world i would have shelves dedicated to each faction but thats a lot of space i lack
  make them out of hot glue and leds
  i really wish he hadnt sold out so fast he didnt make my gotta buy what i want within 2 minutes because this shitll sell out for sure order but i did a second one this morning and hed probably have been in it
  jesus you are one autistic fuck
  fuck off
im new to this line but how canni get the bog goblin just late comers tax at bbts nothing like this past in stock sale
  ebay for upmark
  bog goblin    bog goblin is getting reissued at the start of next year stay tuned for more updates
    thank you anon i personally think it looks cool maybe i will throw some black pauldrons just to help match the color scheme maybe a cloth cape just for some pictures and have some fun when mine arrives
  as another anon said hes getting reissued in a few months and while there hasnt been an announcement for an in stock sale from 4h i dont think anyway its almost guaranted  definitely mark that in your calendar if and when it happens some figures sell out extremely fast
  you wanna buy one off me ill sell it for a little cheaper than bbts
  black guy  bull horns  get your cuck shit outta here
man ive got so many good knight helms left over is there any cheap figure i could force them onto just to bolster my ranks    also im really regretting not getting an iron knight too
  you can still get iron and steel knights from storehorsemen i believe
  hey they packaged him that way i just threw the head on
  oh i know but thank you ive just already spent too much and i dont want to pay for shipping again
  dude yes i just end up liking all the goblins
  dont be afraid to paint stuff to get it to match man black goes on super easy i think i went over an entire figure for a basecoat in like 1015 minutes doing the helmet in a couple coats of silver to match the body would be easy too
  you have been emailed
does anyone have an idea how the joints on these things are assembled im trying to get some of the hinges apart but i cant see how they got them together in the first place the hip in particular is a pretty standard ring but the post it goes around seems like its one solid piece held in at both ends
curse you lizard mananon this is all your fault
i want vorgus vermillius the only option i see to get him is bbts preorder am i just better off paying the mark up or will they be selling him at another time
  theyll be selling them all eventually in the store in due time    pretty much everything you see on bbts has been rereleased plenty of times and the advent of decay just got restocked this monday
  will fourhorseman be selling him in their store any time soon probably not right
mythic legions siege at bjorngar preorder    this coming monday december 3rd at 3pm est and running through december 27th the preorder for mythic legions siege at bjorngar begins here again today were revealing another character from this wave that many of you have already seen bolthor the tower this halfgiant barbaric beast lays waste to the onslaught of dark warriors at the siege at bjorngar    featuring the new 9inch ogre scale base construction these figures retain the articulation level and body construction that youve all come to know from mythic legions but at a hefty new size
  it will probably be a minute yes     honestly if you really really want it and that extra 15 isnt going to hurt you just do it this whole hobby is a waste of money anyway whats the difference
i should get more pill bugs
  thats some beautiful nihilism friend preordered my dude man
  how much do you guys think hes gonna cost
    55 bucks
  45 ideally probably more
  they cant fix limited articulation i was disappointed with the troll figures because the elbow only bend 15 degrees
  giant skeleton next please      6570
  giant skeleton next please    my heart says yes but my wallet says no
  thats a big guy
        the 4h themselves said around 55 but that could easily change upon the actual preorder but they did say they wanted to keep the all in close to 200 and a set of ogres only around 100     55 should be the expected price
so we dont have any info on what the third ogre is gonna be right
  theyve shown off a vampire ogre if thats what you mean
  oh there is i thought they only showed the green and human ones damn i was hoping for a skeleton
  was teased a while back
  neat i wish these were more bestial and monster like in the chest area though
  id love an ogrescale skeleton but if we get one its probably a ways off since they cant just reuse the muscle body unless they go for a giant skeletor look
if these guys make a gorilla warrior i will jump into this line
  ive seen this lizard posted a bunch i want to make a warhammer fantasy skink too what is he
  i wish this guys head was of the regular scale i like it a lot and would have loved to put him on my barb builder
  one of us one of us  that lizards looking good anon where did you get those thin leather stripes i looked in a local hobby shop and a shoe repair shop but i could only find these thicker cords  also i really hope youve got a dark forces weapons pack
  its the marvel universe spider man classics ultimate lizard with tail attack from 2004
how soon do they usually ship out stuff
  nstock sale shipping for those of you who participated in the mythic legions advent of decayinstock sale that happened this past monday we are hoping to have all of the current customer service issues wrapped up by this coming monday and the shipping of those instock items will begin immediately thereafter
  thanks
  sorry if this is becoming a bit too offtopic but i just played around a bit with filters and actually really like this result
    i agree hes criminally underrated i wish i had bought an extra just for the parts alone i only wish they had given him an unhelmeted head
im trying to decide if i should toss the packaging theres just so much of it
  yeah toss it i do i keep one sample of of my favorite figure in case i want to put it back on card or something or at least admire the card art but the rest go in the dump
  im not that another but i use the same stuff its called leather lacing and i got mine at michaels it was near the beads and stuff i think
  im not  but well after reading this i will toss them too
    based and bluepilled
    yep from michaels     even the most daring adventurers are warned not to venture too deep into the undercity its not a place for the races of men
holy shit guys  another freaking gobbo
        i like him but im not 100 sold  thwikk  never mind 110 sold
  i like him build wise its what i wanted but some of these colours look kind of garish  id probably switch the horns out for something from the barbarian builder but that blue loincloth is awful  great head though
  i cant wait for him to ride my frost troll
  agree 100 exactly what i wanted in this figure since the teaser we got a while back but the colors look like a mix between a legion builder and parts they has lying around    that being said im definitely getting this figure
  that shit eating grin
        totally not interested in the giants my wallet can rest easy  here is a new goblin  awww fuck me
love the new face and idea of this goblin but the horns look like some kind of cheap plastic from the early 90s and im not keen on the blue
  want bigman the barbarian  now this guy too  theres still more shit to reveal     please stop
  creeping through the treetops to gain the upper hand thwikk the sneaky goblin archer chuckles  the fucking balls on this goblin sneaking around in the treetops while wearing what looks to be goblinsized full plate hes making sneak acrobatics and climb checks at a 8 the absolute madman
  yeah i think ill get him too and paint the loincloth and arrow feathers shouldnt be too hard i really want that head
  they show off more tinylegged ogres  they show another goblin  some stuff is definitely getting repainted as soon as i get him but thats an easy buy
im glad everyone seems be of the same mind as me i like the figure but his colors suck    i do hate the arrows pretending to be crossbow bolts though maybe ill give an actual bow or make some bolts
4h need to stop making so many great looking figures im running short on space as it it
does anyone have a spare snagg for sale
  you shoulda snagged him for yourself during the ks
  but his colors suck  they dont
  alright ill retroactively add in the obvious in my opinion before that jfc
  yeah i dont get whats wrong with the blue i like it not just being more metal or earth tones
  well played
  i love how 1500 has all the options from magneto to mountie hat
  your opinion still sucks
  i dont hate there being blue but it looks to clean or bright and it doesnt fit stylistically with the rest of the armour or even the other goblins for that matter especially for a sneaky goblin archer  and it bothers me that it is the fur thats blue looks kind of unnatural id actually love some sort of blue markings or war paint on the skin or armour make it look painted on but already a bit chipped and scratched
  i thought this was someones custom cool they can have my money crossbow and shield are good
can anyone tell which sword that is  also   when can we get a ml with the 1500 heaume i want a frog knight
  can anyone tell which sword that is
  ahh crap i need another shotel like a need another hole in my head
     shotel me what sword it is already
  the armor colors is a bit underwhelming and it would have been nice if there was more of that blue or some sort of striking color in the armor itself as is though while i may not be a fan of those colors on the figure itself im sure those colors could easily find a place on other figures snagg specifically might look good with the blue loin cloth to match his hat     as for the bow hunt down a toybiz lotr moria orc archer not only does he come with a fantastic goblin sized bow but pretty much every other piece of him you can pull off fits perfectly on the ml goblins its almost ridiculous how well parts transfer from the old lotr figures to the ml figures     the only hard part is getting those parts off the original figures without actually breaking the figure
  its the kopesh shotels are completely different swords
        every goblin is a goddamn winner 4h you sneaky bastards i guess im getting another goblin
man her hair was a bitch to get in but i am loving this snake sorceress
  i wish the horns were brighter
  now put her in a pose other than standing
  easy enough done
  i will when i get home
who is ready for kickstarter 30
  street alley
  where else do you find black people
  bazinga
  god damnit why did i buy the dark legions weapons pack then
  btfooooooooh
  so your figures can dual wield shields
  its urban fantasy duh emphasis on fantasy
  the orc sword in it is pretty neat plus the spear     but also now you can make a turtle goblin with a shield on the front and the back
  yep those two are some of my favorite weapons among the new stuff the spear looks amazing with the old orc builders the scimitar is pretty nice too and fairly uncommon    but also now you can make a turtle goblin with a shield on the front and the back  i too eagerly await the goblin club sandwich
has anyone received replacement items from 4h yet they asked for my address 10 days ago so im just wondering how long it normally takes to receive parts from them
  i love those and im a big fan of the skull axe
  i mean you could email them just as a friendly check in i dont think theyd get mad about that
and theres your red riding hood figure     im torn on the colors the red and gold look great but im not huge on the black bits though i do like that shes most likely part of the army of leodysseus that faction could use all the help it can get
  alt helmet so she can be troop built
  i dont like the helmet with flesh neck look  but otherwise i dig the figure
    everything about me should really dig this but something about the colors isnt working like the red cross on the helmet looks like its made of playdough and her gold really needs that wash that gwen had maybe the production versionll look better    when are these supposed to be coming anyway
    this should have been the fan built one last wave
  the paint looks way thick
  the preorder starts monday but i dont know think we know when theyll actually ship at this point this wave includes the newly tooled ogres so itll be longer then a full partswapped midwave but i believe they already started preproduction on these guys and i think the goblin head is already done so maybe it wont be as long as normal     personally im just a bit disappointed that it was confirmed this wave would be three ogres and two normal figures the ogres are great and all but one is enough for me but theres still so much potential for the 20 builds i would love to see     the two normal figures from this wave are both very nicebut at the same time somewhat lacking imo neither of them are must haves for me but i might just get them regardless     does that mean i have a problem
      oh i fucking love that may have to pick that up at least
    oh shit im not really feeling that face but the helmeted look is perfection easy yes
liking the actual figure but id just like to say i hate that longass too thick to grip staff with a passion its maybe good with the trident topper on but it looks stupid with everything else and none of the 20s can hold it properly
  cleric    she looks pretty sinister with that color scheme also yeah giving her the huge staff was kind of silly should have just been the one handed mace
  both the horns and the loincloth need a nice black wash to dull them down     i want to give her some bare arms and legs for the sexy red riding hood look might need to buy 2 to keep one as is with the helmet    you should try putting herras unique staff in her hand its about 50 thicker than the trident staff but seriously ive found that the 20 hands rebound much better than the 10 hands   look at  and  and see how her hand can still grip the elven blade after holding the staff
  thats actually the trident staff not the magic staff that doesnt fit even the old 10 hands at all the trident staff works fairly well with the 20 hands and is no worse then any of the other weapons     i feel exactly the same about that crappy old staff shaft a lot of weapons just seem like they were made without regards as to how well the figures can grip them some stretch hands way too much the 10 big axe and the upper half of the 20 elf axe while others have handles too small with no texture to keep it from slipping out of their hands both of the original orc weapons the 20 batch mostly works well but theres still a few things that just do not work as cleanly as they should
  did they include that handle with any of the figures know its in the knight pack but i dont remember seeing it packed with anyone
  i want to give her some bare arms and legs for the sexy red riding hood look might need to buy 2 to keep one as is with the helmet    i might do the same swapping her biceps and thighs with a barbarian builder girl red would look much more ridery while the barbarian would be more armored up but still have the whole bikini body to keep her savage looking
    looks okay id prefer it if the black was white or some other color though
  calavius came with that staff for his trident
  calavius comes with it as he comes with the trident    i do love that theyre willing to mix and match handles and toppers between weapon types the new dwarf hammer on the smaller mace shaft just works too well for them not to do it themselves at some point
  thats what i was thinking
  yeah i know that one its not as bad as the 10 magic staff but its still just a hair too thick youre supposed to grip it around the textured part in the middle for it to be resting at ground level where its at its widest you end up with like 55 of the hand gripping it ive had it pop out overnight like i said though my real issue is its too long and the actual attachments look weird on it like the pictured mace head or the 4winged flange mace are just super awkward noglin coming with the even longer halberd version was pretty hilarious       you should try putting herras unique staff in her hand its about 50 thicker than the trident staff but seriously ive found that the 20 hands rebound much better than the 10 hands  yeah thats one thing thats definitely improved i wish they werent so much smaller so itd be easier to use older weapons but they dont seem like theyll permanently warp like some of the 10 hands ive seen ive got a couple that dont want to cooperate even with a ton of heat
  i just stick stuff in with museum wax now the hands are totally shot    i do think this line would look much better with more delicate weapons
  i dont like the helmet with flesh neck look    this x100
  i didnt even notice this but now that you mention it its an eyesore  thankfully i have spare necks from some iron knight lbs whos arms and legs went to the deluxe knight builders spare torso
    eh id rather a flesh neck on a helmet over a painted neck with a hood though these can be easily swapped out so its not as much of an issue sadly the same can not be said of the fanex figure
  man i wish atila had a surcoat/tabard torso done up like hers
  a chainmail neck with a hood i could have still gotten behind the collar of your shirt wouldnt disappear because you doffed your helm
  i dont know once you have 2 or 3 figures with this armor combination it starts to feel redundant owning more
  true which is why im glad its this way easier to paint an armoured neck to match than to match the flesh tone since i dont have any spare flesh necks
  if it helps her gloves have only been used on thistlethorn and ranga so far also no build so far used the hooded head on the tabbard torso     also only three figures at most use this build angel chick delphina and the knight builderif you want her to     but yes part reuse and simple repaints do get tiresome quickly with this line
      the forearms look short
  three ogres and two normal figures    the last reveal is the vampire lame
  i wish the head could have been fem cat or something
  thats what everyone is guessing but cornboy threw this out there to screw with peoples assumptions  so it might be but dont be surprised if its a different ogre scale fig
  they are by about a fist length its a very odd choice
when i get my bromdenn in i want to give him an ale and a throne
  that would actually be pretty neat the vampire is the one i wanted this way i dont need to commit before anyone has had the ogres in hand that is if he would then be in a later wave
    pretty weak figure none of the details on the gauntlets grieves and leg armors are painted the bucket helmet looks dumb with flesh neck whats the point of wearing full armor if you dont cover your neck also this is a 100 repaint figure unlike the first 3 new goblin has new head     if the the ogre scale figure are just big orc big barbarian and big vampire then this is a pretty meh wave
  20 really blew me away with its incredible paint detail on the figures this on the other hand i dunno the gold is definitely not doing it for me  or the black either way this is a pass for me
rate my retarded part swap nothing has been cut merely popped out and plugged in mcfarlanes halo line is surprisingly compatible with a few of their joints
  lol goteem
  mom says its my turn on the silverchord
  heres hoping for some big ogre scale tiddies
  i want this to happen too
  
i bet you 4h is gonna reveal new characters over the course of this month to build up hype for 24 more characters seeing how the ks is starting at the beginning of december and ends a few days after
  what kickstarter the siege at bjorngar is a small release without crowdfunding basically ml 22  and i think they confirmed its going to be 3 ogres and 2 standard figures
  oh its not a third kickstarter guess im an idiot
  they did mention the possibility of a third kickstarter for the horses i think
  will the preorders for the orcs be on the website
saw a really cool custom with a borrior head on a minotaur body  but maybe not 150 cool  this is a really conflicting line to be into sometimes
    yea this is just a midwave release small batches of figures as opposed to the onslaught of an entirely new wave the next ks if it even is one will feature mostly mounts however they could just as easily release them in a preorder like they are with the ogres both options have their benefits but i honestly would prefer they stick to smaller midwaves for now     i love the big kickstarters but they get super expensive take exceptionally long to produce and then just overwhelm you with far too much product all at once midwaves are easier to pick and choose from imo and much more friendly to the wallet       the ogres preorder will be sold on the store and will have unlimited stock theres no rush to buy them as long as you place your order before the sale ends the 27th iirc though being new tooling this wave might not actually ship for a year so dont expect to have these guys in hand any time soon     in entirely unrelated newsi dont know how i feel about pic related
  vampires could be retooled with black feather arms and chicken legs would look better
i honestly like this guy better than the other two
  that harness is pretty fucking boss
    nobody asked for these
  accessories are all lacking painted detail  could he be an ogrescale legion builder
  yep thats what he is
  the gothtropolis arms actually fit the 20 bodies too meaning you could entirely part swap all the bird limbs onto a 20 body my only issue is that it doesnt look as good in reverse as now my bird has awkwardly long slender legs combined with his already thin and long abdomen it just looks wonky maybe itll work better with different colored legs but ill find that out when i get my legion builders         was not expecting a legion builder in this scale i love the idea but i doubt ill dip into it i have limited shelf space and only so much cash though now i have to debate whether its better to get the lb for my only ogre or splurge and get the much nicer kkurzog the latter has much nicer paint and unique parts head/feet/belt buckle but the former will be cheaper and come with swapable bracers     or maybe i should get three kkurzog to lead them and two lb to display in various states of armorwith potential custom gear if i can find stuff in their size    gdi 4h i didnt need this dilemma        actually lots of people asked for ogres though a legion builder variant is a nice surprise not super desirable from a mold standpoint the lower price point is a fantastic incentive for people who wanted multiple of these figures to get a few more though it all comes down to their actual price
only indirectly ml related really but i made some hot glue casts of the shield and two helms to make extra army for this lizard man the shield came out with more cracks than i would have wanted but it looks good enough for something he found in a swamp
  i didnt ask for most of the mls that ive ended up buying quite happily so
  i think its great that theyre going with ogre legion builders but honestly i was hoping for the vampire ogre so other than maybe shoot mcgobbins ill probably pass on this wave now
  i dig the idea of a mini brute squad one big boy and his two equal big boi cronies as a small elite shock trooper squad
  god damn these guys always look so good all geared up i wish i could find them for cheap so i can build my own little lizard squad       ill probably pass on the goblin as his best feature is his head the rest of him is surprisingly bland there had to be some better way to build him to make him not look like a gob lb with a blue crotch bare arms and more interesting colors wouldve helped imo but im definitely getting notred riding cleric though shell be part swapped into something far more cohesive once i have her my only debate is what to do with the ogres thankfully ill have time to decide as this runs most of the month
  shit im still waiting on my marvel legends asm lizard to copy lizardmananons custom
  i lucked out and just happened to find a buyitnow one for like 10 the other week it even came with his breakaway table     pleassse master keltusssss i need more time the serumitss jusst not ssstable
  unacceptable
  same vampire is the one i want maybe ill get the gobbo though
  eh kind of underwhelming for the final reveal i dont hate it but its no giantess or skeleton ogre i guess it makes sense for the wave theme though need some troops for a siege    i love the idea but i doubt ill dip into it i have limited shelf space and only so much cash  thats how im feeling i have bought 6 packs of nearly every lb so far and most of them are still in their pack until i get a new place to live but the real issue is that i planned to have a shelf for each faction but if it keeps going the legion of arethyr is goimg to need its own entire bookcase 15 orcs 7 lady orcs 7 goblins 7 cavern dwarfs 14 black knights plus named characters and now these fuckers  ill probably get an extra ogre lb on top of the all in but i honestly cant see myself getting any more than that even if cash was no issue
  15 orcs 7 lady orcs 7 goblins 7 cavern dwarfs 14 black knights plus named characters and now these fuckers  jesus more power to you but what do you do with all of them is it just for display i cant imagine having that many
    im a bit disappointed it doesnt look bad but its a bit boring the helm looks too much like the standard ogre helm at the very least they could have given it a somewhat unique head
  display is the plan those lb 6 packs were awesome value for money in the kickstarters considering i was an international backer i happened to have some extra cash to splurge with for both kickstarters and the colosseum wave  the extra black knights are for customs so far ive just used them for the extra skulls you get with the skellies  the end goal is two bookcases one with the good factions and one with the evil with a shelf in each bookcase for a diorama that i change up occasionally but most of them are in storage until i get a new place and all my dark factions are crammed onto one shelf
  forgot shitty phone pic of the clusterfuck
  legion of arethyr minus most 10 figs which are in storage
  so far ive just used them for the extra skulls you get with the skellies  bought one for that reason too i could see a display with a squad of them commanded by mandibulus being really cool
  the leftovers gave grysha some space since i got him in a sweet pose
   yep thats why i got 2 of the 6 packs and an extra 2 6 of them to use as knights led by a custom made from raygor with black knight limbs and rahmulus helmet and the rest get the skull treatment you end up with some good variety with all the extra skulls from keltuss scaphoid and hagnon with mandibulus tibius and pixxus skulls filling out the rest nicely

  maybe they upped the thread limit since migrating the board to 4channel
i have a question the packaging the mythic legions line uses is it resealable  in the same way a figuarts or figma box is or hell even a legends or transformers box
  these arent really doing it for me the gobbos head is nice but the rest of him feels really familiar same with faustia the ogres are ok i guess but i cant get past those stumpy legs ill probably grab kurzog if they do an instock sale so i can see how they look inhand first but otherwise im happy to sit most of this one out
      was hoping for a lb for the lion army like bronze 20 armor body with the gladiator head this wave is just odd i like the named ogres but i just dont have room for nor really want the ogre lb especially when the vampire brute is coming up and the horses dark lords and my eternal hope for another allstars wave from 1st ks    thankfully can save some money here
does it annoy anyone else that these two share the same armor and loincloths i understand the concept of reusing tooling to make these figures but i thought theyd at least change the armor/harness between them they look too similar to each other
  i was hoping for one more reveal but i guess thats fine definitely dropping 55 for kkurzog just for the painted details and soft goods on this big boy
    yeah thats the design kryptonite of this linesince i want more diversity but then wed have to pay even higher for it    one of them is gonna go harnessless for display
    overall not bad ill be getting the set and probably a few extra goblins and maybe an extra ogre lb just so i can have 2 on display
  can we talk about how dumb it is that he was metal bones on his belt/loincloth thing
  it was the first and last time a terminator set foot in mythoss
  i just want the original gold knight/black knight mold in the same color as the iron knight from 20 for the lion army maybe with the upscaled sugarloaf helm but your idea is pretty cool too fuck do both the lions need more troops  i also want to see a grysha repaint in a light gold shade for the sons of the red star    the buckles are different but both having the bones hanging down makes them look too similar they also should have changed the green ogres harness buckle to differentiate it from the half giant
  the packing on these guys is a plastic bubble with a cardboard backing that can slide on and off no tape or glue so you can open them without damaging the box and reseal them with no issue       its nice they added the different belt buckles but the harness being the same really kills the illusion still im only getting one of these guys so its not a huge deal but for those that get them all some part removal may be required
im kind of torn on this set of figures i definitely want faustia and maybe even a 2nd one to keep the helmet on i like the orc ogre but not the barbarian or legion builder and i only really like the face sculpt of the new goblin since i just spent too much money on the instock sale i might limit myself to faustia and the big orc guy and maybe a 2nd faustia
  wonder if theyre planning to do another three ogre  two normal scale wave with the vampire ogre or if the lineup will be different on it shame we didnt get him here hes the ogre im most interested in so far
  you could look at them as being charred to match his armor
  im torn guys i kinda want a bolthor and the price isnt bad but i dont think i have room
  same except with the all in
  no thick amazon orc  why live
  thanks now i realized im missing out on a snu snu figure its like 4h hates money
  i can guarantee that if they ogres do well enough well get snusanna in the next wave
  please god i need my snusanna
  i planned on getting bolthor because he looks cool but now i feel that it is my duty
  snusanna  yes
i only just realized that isnt supposed to be a cape but the back of his fauld but i prefer it as a cape  also wish they made a hooded skull so i could do up a good skeleton mage any good spell effects that scale well with the line
  i bet the marvel legends spell effects would work
  he should have came with a torn cape too
  the tamashii fire effects work pretty well
i dont know where the fuck to put anymore of these things yall and i have a bunch more to open still
  how did you position malachis cloak got a gryshaa in the store sale and i think that look would suit him  also nice cephalopod and pumpkin customs
  i wrapped one hole over his neck so it would drape and just manipulated it until it sat right
  the cephalopod head and pumpkin head are from a member of the 4horsemne forums but the body of the pumpkin was all me took a black knight and mixed fluorescent green with gitd powder to give it the possessed armor look i wanted super please with how it turned out
on ebay there seem to be a few predorders for mythic legion action figures and the seller is located in hong kong what does this mean
  move skele shelf to top shelf
  i love me some black and green gotta try and get me a black knight
  thanks thats a really neat look    thats where ive seen them before looks awesome i really need to become active on the 4h forums i checked out the customs thread a while ago and it was pretty great
  did you apply it as a drybrush or a wash
  a wash the poweder added to the paint helped it stick in the groves better
  thanks i wanted to give him more of a sneaky hiding something look
  thank you devinitely want to make one myself will be a good use of the extra skull head i got with mandibulus
  what bothers me is that these things are so big they could easily have added upper torso articulation
    im sure they could have but that would of course increased the cost they wanted to make sure the figures hit below the 60 mark that extra articulation would have meant at least one more piece to tool thats not cheap
  and maybe im weird but i think most ab crunch looks ugly
  i really like the two ogres and the goblins pretty good i only got knubnik and the builder from the preorder so ill probably get him not sure if ill get either ogre though ive got a lot of other stuff i need to be buying right now      this is the main issue i have with most legion builders i dont have any inherent problem with figures with simple paint jobs for cheaper value but theres always something they come with that has a clearly intended color that just looks wrong matching the rest of it
  the bones are burnt
  i only got knubnik and the builder from the preorder    you didnt get snagg
  nah i liked his head its a very classic goblin look but the rest of him didnt do it for me
  yeah same ill wait until they hopefully reuse that head preferably with a red hat
  we havent seen the ogre scale figure bend their elbow not even once    fool me once 4h shame on you fool me twice cant get fooled again
  buy a couple of gobbos  get curious go read goblin slayer  now want lots more plus some orcs and ogres to play hobgoblin and chapion parts
  thats how they get you
  the height difference may disappoint you
   want lots more plus some orcs and ogres to play hobgoblin and chapion parts    hmm with gonxxs neck adaptor im sure you can already put a goblin head on a orc ill try that soon
hey guys i got a vampire knight from bbts with economy air mail shipping but it turns out my local postal service charges a small fee to handle packaged localy and they dont warn you when your mail has arrived either so the only way of knowing when to pay is by checking the tracking number which is no an option with economy air mail  does anyone know if theres any information bbts could provide me about that package that would at least let me know when it arrives in my country  i already got a package sent back to the sender because i was unaware of this new taxation
  not familiar with your local post but would it be possible to leave a message over the phone to tell them to give you a ring when your package arrives
new    
  im in brazil so i hardly think so i did send them a message asking how to proceed though they should return to me in about a week or so im just worried ill have to wait for it to arrive return to sender and contact bbts about canceling/reordering it would be such a annoying hassle
  even with no painted details the legion builder only being 5 dollars more than the damn goblin is a little funny
  hopefully with some muscle definition this time

can anyone here vouch for the quality of the perfect strike gundam bought the aile strike gundam previously and got a loose right shoulder joint out the box did they get the issue fixed with this one planning on buying one as a christmas gift for myself
  there is a reason the logo image is always used i cant tell what the hell is going on in that thumbnail
  figures a bit outdated in the size/engineering dept but i had no issues on mine just that things like to bump into each other due to the design    also the promo pics make it look a lot easier to pose than it actually is you can do it it just takes some work
  i just weighed some robot damashii figures    rd zaku ii anime is about 70 grams  rd old gm sniper ii is 65 grams  rd dom anime is 130 grams  hcm pro guncannon is 30 grams  msia windam is 6065grams  125cm tall revoltech about 85 grams    modern deluxe transformers are 50 grams 1314cm tall    what is the perfect playable weight and size weight distribution is even more important of course
  are rds known for leaking plasticizers just picked up my tallgeese and its sticky
  no but i mean wing figures are getting kind of old and they were full of pvc all soft plastic leaks plasticizer this is why keeping toys in their packaging is kind of terrible for long term storage the plasticizer has nowhere to go so it develops into a film rather than gassing off
  interesting this was out on a high shelf seems to be the only one though but i havent checked them all i havent touched or reposed them in about a year
  thanks bud gonna pull the trigger once 13th month pay hits although  figures a bit outdated in the size/engineering dept  thisll be just my 2nd rd as of yet how would it hold up posed beside the newer released figs next target is the gp03 stamen assuming bandai would release one later after the announced stardust memory line
  how would it hold up posed beside the newer released figs  itll probably be too small at least compared to the anime releases though you might be able to fudge your display a bit using the included stand    hes still one of my favorite rd releases despite the age especially if you can get him at retail price
zenith is out on twitter
  auafag here i got mine in the mail today    just playing around with the two i got for now looking at my gunpla and other kotobukiya msg kits for extra weapons atm
  i wish theyd reissue the wing damashiis id rather not pay 200 for a heavyarms
  found a few weapons to give my zeniths placed number decals on their left shoulders
      lucky i cant pay for mine yet until the other items in my order comes out say is the hardpoint on the back 3mm i can see the shoulders and arms obviously are
  sadly not its a square hole
where is my fucking tomahawk bandai
  for real i dont know whats taking them so long to release this or the phalanx
  they were teasing shots of it in a magazine months ago it not being up for preorder by now is kind of weird
    i feel like 65  70 grams is the perfect weight i always liked how dense the msia line felt it produced some of my favorite action figures ever    that being said im an enormous fan of damashiis even though they do feel a little cheaply made in comparison
  its ok bro they gonna re do them again in an out of size format that wont match any of your other damashiis to appease americans
  maybe it was cancelled did the defender and spartan sell okay pretty much anything not a valkyrie tends to sell poorly
  not the same logo image    dont do that again please
  seconded
      too lazy to ctrl  f damashii on the catalog  jesus /toy/
  we ask him to not do that again  politely    anon its not a matter of laziness you arbitrarily changed something that was universally accepted as front pic for a long time and for a better smoothness     im just explaining you why i prefer the old logo no need to feel offended just because people did not liked your initiative
no gawain
  obviously even a shinkiro would make more sense than gawain considering suzaku is using it in r3
  too lazy to ctrl  f damashii  this involves letting go of my dick and i usually got porn running on my other screen when i browse 4 chan
      how is it it looks great in pictures
  it was a tough desicion for me wether to get this version or the desert brown version    i chose this one i still have the original zenith fm3 figure from 15ish years ago and that was in a desert brown color so i went for this blue camo
    i share the same sentiment bro
  having to ctrlf something cause some pleb decided not to use the standard easy to catch image
sorry guys i saw the last thread had hit the bump limit but i kept putting off creating the new thread to do other things instead op may not have gone with the usual format we use for the general but hey op wanted to talk mecha toys and the old thread was about to be pruned cant blame op for being enthusiastic about mecha toys thats exactly what these threads are all about    if anyone deserves criticism its me for being too slow to make the new thread and too lazy to take the 15 minutes to check/update the op info ill try not to be so slow/lazy in the future
anyways ny has metal build qant for 22000jpy which is slightly below the original msrp        absolutely lovely mb well worth picking up if youre a fan of the design      theres one up on mandarake for 9500jpy if that helps i know it probably doesnt haha great figure though          how is it as a figure does it feel sturdy/solid inhand hows the range of motion anything you dislike about it i agree with  that it certainly looks great
  they both sold out at online retailers anyways granted it took longer than most of the valk releases for that to happen but im pretty sure the destroids didnt have to drop to discount prices in order to sell out unlike say the messer scheme vf1 given how popular the tomahawk is i feel itd sell out even faster id definitely snag two
  i only own hikarus vf1a but if bandai ever made the nousjadeulger i would preorder it in a heartbeat
are we gonna get any more patlabor im still waiting on tv version peacemaker reactive armor ingrams from movie 2 helldivers        dammit bandai dont stop now
  speaking of the vf1 should i be worried about leaving mine in super battroid mode for long periods of time the boosters being held up by just a small hinge has me paranoid
  how easy it is to remove the limbs as shown here and yeah the desert brown version is best left for the parts swapping for consistent colour scheme i think
  goddamn monitor anon how dare you miss a thread after years of doing it this is like the second time its happened too one more strike and youre out buddy
  hes not the annon we deserve but the annon we need a watchful guardian
  how small are these guys 
  ditto im always in the mood for more zentran/meltran mecha thats one of the best parts of the himetal line      shouldnt be an issue whatsoever the super boosters are fairly lightweight and they securely plug into the backpack so theres no undue stress on the connection there plus the backpack itself locks firmly into place when in battroid pull downwards on the backpack when in battroid mode so theres no real stress on the backpack hinge ive had both max  miria in super battroid for ages max since his release two years ago and theyre still rocking        haha ill keep that in mind commissioner
  theyre hg/rd sized for its price i think its a bit steep
  ingram 1 and griffin were released i can die happily
  well definitely get the aqua griffin beyond that who knows the line will probably slow down to dunbine/lgaim speed if it continues with only 12 releases a year
  not that there are that many patlabor mechs to start out with
is op the new wing stuff also its missing tallgeese 2 and the twins
  no
    im so fucking glad i bought the tallgeese 2 way back for 50 bucks when i did i bought two of these cocksucking things     mad i never jumped on more of the wing rds i fucking love them what are all your favorites
  altron its an overdesigned clusterfuck but i bought the shitty old 1/100 no grade kit of it first as a kid so i guess its just the nostalgia
  mfw id pay retail price for used wing damashiis in good shape
  also i bought that same altron kit as my first gundam kit i was dismayed at how quickly the joints were down    i recall reading something along the lines that wings designs were mostly leftover g gundam designs and the most evident of that to me was the tv version of altron
ive got some concerns/questions about figure storage so ive been aware recently that figures in box will leak plasticizer and develop a sticky film on them is this going to be true for painted figures too or is the paint nonporous enough to leave it sealed in ive army built some ver ka figures and am boxing them up in preparation for a move in the next few months also rds have sort of run amok  this collection is growing too fast for this place to accommodate hopefully that improves in the future or youll be seeing some listings in bst
  the regular ew wing not the feather one is a true beauty
  i have to give the top spot to heavyarms but pretty much everything else comes in a close second the wing line was so good
  personally i keep the vast majority of my rds in their boxes and i havent noticed any issues all three of the wing gundams in  were pulled out of their box just now and there was no stickiness to em in terms of whether or not paint helps seal in plasticizer im not sure but id doubt it i think plasticizer leakage is a fact of life for plastics there was an anon in the last thread who said his tallgeese got sticky but i speculate that the type of plastic used for rds at least helps to minimize it i do think however that the plastic used for the budget rds the pacific rim rds and i imagine the upcoming lowcost rds will use the same will be more susceptible to plasticizer leak issues when i break out any of my pacific rim rds after having them boxed for a while they always stink haha    i actually had a pretty good comparison just now between xi gundam the fully painted heavy marking ver and xis shoulder/back fins xi has been boxed up for the last year and a half or so while his fins have been kept outside in an open storage tray because i couldnt figure out how to fold them to fit back into the packaging haha    took xi out just now and i noticed zero difference between xi and his fins and yeah rd collecting can get out of control way too quickly
  plasticizer is more of a pvc problem because they add it to make it more flexible rds are mostly hard abs but i have noticed its not as hard and rigid as gunpla still i think rds are less likely than other brands to leak plasticizer
  just open the boxes every couple months to let them air out its not perfect and will still probably age them faster than being wrapped in acid free paper or something but who has time for that shit other than museum curators
  wish id bought another geese 2 i did the neck mod on mine my favorite suits are the oz corp ones own them all but epyon kinda regret selling it and not getting heavy arms but i was hoping for an ew version
  is that the marking plus ver anon
still got every release so far for the anime line if not here its on preorder or on the way to me   cant turn back now
  army building pbandai    you have expensive tastes anon
  too expensive i need them to end the 0079 series so i can call it good haha
  im equal parts jealous but thankful im not int that hole     id love to see all those out in one big display though
  i bought a house recently and im finally getting around to even pulling this stuff out of tubs im in the market for a bigger glass cabinet than a normal detolf may have found one then i can really group up my zaku and i bought enough of each to display with alternate heads thats what has hit me the hardest with the wallet is the multiples
  proof that you can be a successful person and still a nerd collecting plastic robots    im just not one of them
  honestly if i had the space and money id have done the exact same when it comes to buying multiples one day i might suck it up and pay the price on some of the msv suits i didnt bother ordering originally
i cant remember was there ever a virgo rd
    if anything gundam and guitar equipment have helped make my credit score phenomenal as the years have gone haha
any news on this guy
      nope and nope
  probably never ever
strange how we havent heard a single thing about the new budget rd line yet i wonder why
feature/transformation video of the dx chogokin vf1j        looks like a super straightforward transformation with a cool solution to make the waist swivel work in battroid theres added head laser articulation that lets you cant them outwards too canting head lasers what a time to be alive haha      yea its the marking plus      ahhh kampfer is looking so gorgeous and hygogg should be out by the end of the week too       itll happen anon you just gotta believe im convinced theyll release it eventually since the other similarlysized destroids sold pretty well and tomahawk is probably the most popular destroid design by a large margin
    thats sexy gonna wait for a roy focker ver though
  god im so glad i somehow managed to snag a preorder for him cant wait to get him
you think its safe to use nail polish as a cheap alternative to fix chipped paint i dont know if theres any dangers to using it on plastic i know nail polish is tough to remove and needs a special kind of remover that can damage plastic
  nail polish can react pretty poorly with certain plastics and paint it also will probably need to be watered down a great deal if you want it to look smooth at all because it costs heavy and easily blobs together as always test stuff before you go ruining a favorite figure
  i applied some to a plastic model i had laying around and it seems fine the plastic doesnt feel brittle
    they look fucking great i have wing deathscythe hell tallgeese ii and tallgeese iii     the only problem i have with them is with the tallgeese line specifically i hate how the wing binders are attached to the shoulder armour and not to mounting points extending from the torso like they are with the rg tallgeese     its not like its a new idea even the kaiyodo temjin virtual on from like a million years ago had that
  this is only half of the rds the others are mostly major suits from the wing franchise that plus western toys and nearly 210 quarts of lego still need to find a spot thats properly accessible yet unobtrusive    i might be liberating myself of the western stuff i no longer enjoy it would simplify things and make room for more rds i actually care about theyre great toys especially for the price but im not as invested in the source material      hmm so its mostly a soft plastics concern i guess the abs of lego doesnt develop that problem so stands to reason that same plastic in rds wouldnt either good to have that pointed out though        i see im in good company here
  you have too many zeta pluses and neros thats not the right unit composition
any love for mechatro wego just got my first one with a couple little blind boxes
  army build with pbandai exclusive    vs    army build with metal rd    ok thats it im out of this hobby forever its been a pleasure and an honour gentlemen
  i had the miku one parts want to fall off too easily here and there the inner visor piece is very hard to take out without snapping it and all that painted die cast is just waiting to chip paint it felt like it fell short of being a decent toy and i didnt really get why they had the adventure time people redesign miku for it if theyd gone the extra mile with jake finn wego drones or an at/vocaloid crossover had come from it that may have made it worthwhile
  mfw thats probably like a months income for me in that entire picture
  thats about 2000 to 2500 if new
      serious question when i declare bankruptcy and the irs come take all my valuables would they grab the rds and mbs too or would they leave them alone thinking they just useless plastic junk
  irs employ people knowledgable in toys for this sole reason       i have one somewhere in a box i was meaning to sell it off years ago cute thing but overpriced for what it is love the little acrylic display box though       honestly cannot blame you anime is pretty much the only line i bother with nowadays besides the occasional one or two figures from other lines and i know thats going to reach a point i call it a day sadly
  anime is pretty much the only line i bother with nowadays  are they actually releasing other gundam figures with rd besides anime not counting ver ka
  ah i just meant out of any line out there figma shf etc somehow i have 4 figmas on order which is probably the highest in over a year    regarding your question it doesnt appear so seems any other rd is non gundam and all non anime releases are put into the other more expensive brands     only one i can honestly think of is the phenex for nt but there hasnt really been much gundam media been put out in a while besides ibo and build divers one having shelfwarming rds and the other been a gunpla focused show so wouldnt make any sense for an rd to be made    just the other day they did announce a new gundam movie every 12 years add in this hollywood live action and i would have to assume thats where all non anime rd figures are going to stem from while the anime line churns forward on the existing shows
  something like a toy collection worth 2000 even as a lot is absolutely something they would try to sell unless you filed an exemption for it you are allowed to keep some property if you file for it how much depends on your state i would throw out packaging and put all your toys in a tub to make them look as worthless as possible though if you really have to file its much harder to identify value on what they cant easily google
  who knew toy identification threads were actually irs guys
  only one i can honestly think of is the phenex for nt    well theres always the nightingale for the 1
when are we getting more max releases
  fuck you it kills me that they wont ever make rds of any of the suit variations in builders like the turn a wing zero or the fenice rinascita i cant be the only one whod buy them
  you probably are also obscure figures usually head straight for the exclusives so itll be stupid expensive even if they do get an release    but dont worry they wont
   that green tallgeese
  when you declare bankruptcy you have to list all of your property and its approximate value in your bankruptcy petition not individually itemized but youd have to list like collectibles  10000 or something personal bankruptcy relies a lot on good faith by the debtor plus you sign off on your petition under penalty of perjury as such youre generally not going to have anyone coming into your home to inspect your personal property theres serious consequences if you get caught lying about what you own so just be honest    as  said however every state has exemptions which protect a certain amount of your property from being used to satisfy a debt most folks who are eligible for chp 7 bankruptcy are gonna be able to keep the majority of their property due to these exemptions you need to actively claim these exemptions on your petition so you should definitely consult with a lawyer in your state for help       i would throw out packaging and put all your toys in a tub to make them look as worthless as possible though if you really have to file  definitely dont do that anon acting with intent to deceive your creditors or the bankruptcy trustee is going to get you in serious trouble not only will you risk not getting your discharge for failing to act in good faith but its actually a crime so youre risking jail time too      my money is on a webexclusive vf1s max next year
  most people who have to give up stuff have lots of extra luxury shit lying around my parents filed chap 7 about 11 years ago and didnt have to give up a single thing they want stuff like cars with high resale value boats jewelry and that nonnecessities they can take that they can get a fair bit for toys that are worth 10 each not so much even if the total collection might be worth 5k they wont want to bother selling off hundreds of individual units for low amounts they wont bother with ebay either theyll go to a standard auction and that shits not moving at those venues
  honestly its not really fraud considering throwing out packaging these days automatically lowers the value of most toys by like 50
tokyo otaku mode is running new deals everyday through the 26th and you get 30 back in rewards on every purchase 50 for premium members they had all their rds for 23 off yesterday and some decent deals on other gundam related stuff especially when you consider the reward bonus worth keeping an eye on i think the deals switch over every night at midnight pst    hlj has their black friday sale going on with a couple deals on rds i think the most notable ones are chars gelgoog for 3600jpy wryneck for 5600jpy and bozune for 3600jpy though that still doesnt beat the wild 20 deal on amazon last year or so haha      i agree anon though  was talking about rds and mbs i could see a trustee liquidating a mb collection if a debtor failed to exempt it unlikely haha but not impossible      well bankruptcy fraud is all about intent if youre tossing packaging for a benign reason like saving space or something youre gonna be fine but if youre doing it to make your stuff less appealing to creditors or otherwise trying to make them look as worthless as possible thats where you get in trouble    when you consider that its unlikely youre gonna be forced to liquidate your toys anyways its best to just maintain your collection as you normally would rather than risk going to jail for an absurd sounding reason like throwing away packaging haha
  geez does the kampfer look good vf1d is neat too though i think im happy with just the super ostrich i really like that minmeiholding hand the 1d comes with wish hikarus vf1a had come with something like that
  good lord its glorious     i love how every thruster looks like it can support an effect piece even the one in his crotch they also seemed to work out a way to allow his knees to actually bend and not be inhibited by his backthigh thrusters
   hello doctor im finna bust a nut
  impregnate me kampfersama
  cant fucking wait    now they just need to announce a gerbera tetra and i can die happy
  vf1d  y e s   e   s  ive been waiting for this out of all the vf1 variants the 1d is probably my favourite that head is great
   im struggling to keep my dick in my pants
  sexy
happy thanksgiving folks    nuu has his hygogg review up        hlj already took payment for mine woohoo
  let it out anon its not healthy to keep it unventilated
  hm i was hoping theyd use a darker shade of blue but still look great
  if you think thats sexy wait till you see the guy piloting it
  oh nononononono  look at the top of his head
  some pretty bad damage for something right out of the box

  looks like its everything plus the chobham and its effects
  battle damaged parts are omitted
got a gm cold climate in yesterday  like the way they did the ankle joint  hate a lot of the decisions made elsewhere  floppy thigh joint out of box  while posing the arm one of the collapsing elbow joint panels apparently broke and shot off into the unknown    wow     this is my least favorite anime release so far its really odd how well they nailed the basic gm from msg only to fuck this one up it just feels like they omitted or changed certain joints from previous anime releases that ended up hindering this one     things like only allowing the elbow to bend where it meets the forearm meaning they crammed 2 collapsing panels in the there theres no swivel on the forearm or elbow like other anime rds the neck is only a hinge joint where it connects to the head and the butterfly joint in the chest although a staple to the line created way too many seams in the cockit area of the torso for my liking and lets not forget the lack of a sidearm mounted shield option     i dunno i was excited to get this guy because i do like this gm variant a lot but this was almost depressing
  most people get the gm cold just to have it wrecked by the hygogg
  dont get me wrong thats practically why i got one too eh guess ill feel better about having him pinned down by hygogg now
  confirmed day one preorder ive been waiting for you    i dont think its a coincidence that they do this after the patlabor rds since it shares a really similar structure that shoulder/bicep articulation alone looks like the griffons
  what are you talking about
  they showed off some display of gundam figures last month people are assuming they are budget rd releases similar to the pacific rim ones but ive seen no mention or sighting of them beyond this single image so its all guesswork     although not seen anything of the tri line either
  another 78 wing and unicorn no thanks
  sliding on the ground  i remember when i thought it was so cool that shinn did that over the water using the blast impulse ah how little i knew of gundams origins back then
  the guitorre from aura phantasm basically an alternate take on the dunbine designs its based on the virunvee
  its not guess work you just have to ask the staff guarding the displays also they are scheduled for summer 2019 so of course there is nothing yet because may 2019 orders havent even started yet
  
oooo baby
what is the scaling like between rds and the other tn robot lines like src soc etc    got into srw not long ago and now i find myself wanting more crossover displays and am looking for good stuff around the same size as rds i know metal builds are too big
  neither are around the same size really soc are huge other than the rare exceptions like xabungle src are closer in size but still a good bit bigger
  i more or less forgot to hunt down a place for that but im happy to see someone here wanted it even more than me and has gotten it hope the qc is good on yours
  me to brother  ive yet to have any problems other than the known char zaku everyone did knock on wood
  probably a lot of guys like this posting on 4chan
  dont shame me for having a character i can finally identify with
  whats that zaku all about
  rainbow zaku    fuck dont remind me mines got shitty qc hips and wonky knees if they rerelease the figure with new stuff im gonna buy it and sell off the old one
  i think its a cheaper version of the rd zaku with minimal accessories its for people to test out the rd line without committing too much money     they made one for the gundam 78 too
  it also has green joints the gundam similarly has white joints i kind of want both because theyre more accurate to the show than the regular releases but considering none of the other figures will match its not a priority
  yea its anime accurate where the joints are all green and stuff was a tamashii nations con exclusive with that rx/ship combo   needed it just to keep up to date on the collection
  you gonna open that shit up id love to see it     fuck i wish dalong did robot damashiis
  when i get out of work today ill take some pics of regular and if for comparison
  that sounds interesting is it on amiami or the other usual shops
  you can find it on nippon and mandarake forsure
finally got this guy in the mail the wait since the initial reveal has been killer
review of the dana oshee arm articulation looks surprisingly good despite how funky the joint setup is           cant wait to get mine gonna be waiting another week or so though at least
  wow the zeons have really done it thats a funky mobile suit alright its rare to see ms equipped with missile weapons and have a wing of light at the same time though
  still better looking than  gundam
    thats from aura battler dunbine not gundam it does look funky though as all aura battlers do     id kill a blameless man for the robot damashii zuath
  i have all the other dunbine stuff barring the repaints and buying it still gives me pause not even for the price the wingspan and necessity of the stand will make it pretty hard to display seems like a lot of other people feel the same way because theres a bunch on mandarake for about the original price
  i was thinking the same thing yeah     i think itd make a wonderful display/conversation piece though sometimes its more about the visual impact though im still salty about discovering the rd line doesnt keep relative scale in mind    also which dunbine figure is the best as far as articulation i was looking at the sirbine
  probably the botune but its not a great deal more flexible than most of the rest its just thinner and has less bulky stuff hanging off it to obstruct movement the sirbine is about average i guess most of the line is other than the dunbine and billbine which definitely show their age
  good to know thanks ill probably just end up grabbing sirbine and zuath then     too bad i love the dunbine i bought the extended offshoot figures of dunbine and billbine but they were dogshit
did one po the mrd guren from amazon    mine was supposed to arrive today but amazon email me this morning and told me it cancelled my order because of unavailability
  cant slap facts m8
  muh shitty opinion is a fact hurrrrrrrrr
  the ankles are pretty lame for most abs i think vierres leprechaun and virunvee were the best from the tv line they all have good ankles
  a lot of people couldnt look past the mustache on turn as face to notice how amazingly shitty the chest is or that the main gun looks like a god damn supersoaker
  the sad thing is that the kunio okawara redesign actually makes the stupid moustache thing work quite well
  thats actually not bad the turn a we got looks like a 10 yr old looks at the original gundam for the first time for 10 seconds and was asked to draw it from memory
here we can discuss soul of chogokin   in that case are you buying gx40r godmars
  that thing is finally getting a reissue im there
  looks way too much like every other gundam
narrative rd when  stein rd when
    hopefully never narrative is an abortion
  glad to hear you have already managed to see the entire thing
  dont want a gundam looking like a gundam in a series about gundams    ive never understood this type of autism and never will
  it looking unique and weird makes it stand out its not really hard to understand man i mean ill agree even that the redesign is more aesthetically appealing i just dont like it as much despite that
  fair enough but i find the design choices particularly baffling in the case of the turn a setting which revolves around the legend of the gundam so heavily
  fuck narrative i still deserve a delta plus from unicorn
  0083  sucked shit  08th ms  sucked shit  igloo  sucked shit  unicorn  sucked shit  twilight axis  sucked shit    gee i wonder what this new fanfic movie will do differently to avoid repeating all the retardation that made every other uc ova past 0080 so fucking awful
  all of these were good besides late stage unicorn
  you know lad perhaps gundam was never really your thing in the first place
  0079  sucked shit  0080  sucked shit  zeta  sucked shit  zz  sucked shit also not anime  cca  sucked shit  why even bother
  08th ms is about as far from good as you can get
    i love gundam i hate the fact that uc has become an absolute joke with how lazily its being milked out victory was the last good thing to ever come out of it
  gundams are hideous so not looking like one is a good thing
  turn a is a trash looking suit desu
    wow monitorkun knows a lot about bankruptcy i am weirdly impressed
  i wonder if the real thing will look anywhere near this good the gunmetal paint really ratchets up the quality look to this figure
  the drumlo has surprisingly nice ankles as well
  every gundam has to look exactly the same and no unique aesthetics are allowed
  the creators of gundam wanted to make a real space opera and their heart and soul went into the zaku which is a realistic grunt unit that suits the real robot theme better than the gundam    the gundam was the compromise/ bait and switch they made to get funding form the toy makers who sponsored the show hence the bright red/white/blue crayon color thats kids friendly
  concerns from the sponsors about how a grey robot would limit the appeal to kids isnt really a bait and switch its definitely a compromise but i hardly see how them switching the colours changes the concept of the show
  zaku  realistic grunt  yeah nope  one eye stupid tubes giant humanoid robot  theres nothing real about it    gouf dom and gelgoog are better anyway the added bulk makes them look more like war machines rather than a human in thin cardboard  russian grunts at hte time shouldnt look bulkier than something thats supposed to be a realistic armored robot
what do you guys think of this one i havent bought a robot damashii before
  quite basic but still a gorgeous looking figure utter shame the option set never came out as id have totally bought a couple more barbies to display it all
  really is tragic id have probably bought two packs for ultimate crabhammer action and at least another barby or two to put it all on
  on that topic how well does the hg accessories scale with the rd might just bite the bullet and buy an hg just for the wrench mace part for the rd to use
  the zaku is real compared to the gundam laser guns laser swords and a giant flail in space the zaku are much more grounded in reality      basically the bait and switch part comes when the creators made a deal with the toy sponsors that they can have free reign over the enemy grunt machines as long as the toy sponsors can have input on the main hero machine back in the days cartoon shows have a very monster of the week thing when it came to the enemies but the zaku became the other mainstay of the show and last all the way until the final battle
  dont have that particular figure per se but rd joints usually cant support huge ass weapons like that
  he has no problem holding it its not a heavy thing if anything his hand could do with been a bit tighter to stop it slipping no issue with the joints supporting it though
  should be about the same size you might want to paint the wrench though it comes in all dark grey but looks pretty great with a little work
  i think theyre as real as each other  just too humanoid looking and too thin    boring designs too hence me not owning any except for the red one because it was i wanted to try a rg
  i never had problems when its all about posing and holding weapons with the barbatos the kimaris on the other hand it gets fucking difficult
new lancelot type and guren type kmfs for resurrection  90s trailer  
  lancelot type
    guren type
    was always hesitant in getting the regular versions they just seem incomplete now they have made what i want to see
  yes  now waiting for gx71
    is this a sequel
  yes the new movie takes place 2 years later
were never getting pacific rim 1 stuff are we
love this release such good articulation and detail for a grunt suit
  i think dunbine is a very good rd well worth picking up if you enjoy the design articulation is hindered a little in the in/out hinge for the shoulder due to the tubing that connects the upper arm to the shoulder pad but otherwise i think the articulation is great    my on complaint would be that the shade of plastic used for the lower legs is sliiiightly lighter than that used for the rest of the body its more/less noticeable depending on the lighting and i dont think its a deal breaker it was quite bad on the original dunbine release the subsequent reissues improved it considerably but worth pointing out otherwise you get sharp details including an opening cockpit and a nice spread of accessories including a neat sword slash effect part allinall a solid rd that i do recommend      i dont have any issues with the ankles on the dubine rds i own though it also helps that all of them have individually articulated toes which give you tons of extra range      aw dang didnt order myself but im sorry to hear that anon      haha yay      for a second i thought these were nxedge releases the proportions on these designs struck me as being kinda sd      great shot and pose anon
  i wasnt regretting passing on albion despite how gorgeous it is in candid shots but after conquista it just paled when it came to colour variance which i dont find with the zero colour one that and albion is a suit i find better in action than a static shotespecially with the missing leg effect parts    this fixes the colour variance issue even if itd be better without the hip pieces      this however doesnt take away from my longing for guren seiten it has a much more balanced look than albion and was a complete upgrade compared to the previous guren but it did lack an attack effect part   i cant say this new guren is better but its a great alternate look and would look even better sliding around on surfaces than seiten
  i wouldnt say never that said its pretty unlikely that theyd shift into rd from even for the nonmovie suits that were prepr ronin romeo coyote etc well probably keep on going with the chogokin line for the foreseeable future     now if many years later pr can put something great together like the fuller extent of the war prepr i could see a regular rd line and kaiju to go with them a long shot yes but franchises having comeback is within the real of possibility
got a couple new lads delivered today
  i got my flappyboi yesterday already love the hell out of him despite how complex it is getting the missile firing effects mounted you absolutely need a stand for it too id recommend an act stage combination for it due to being smaller with a shorter arm saves on display space by taking up less room and having to be offset less
  yeah it took me like 15 minutes to figure which way the ring is supposed to fit and how to mount the orange fairing to the ring i unfortunately dont have any act stages so i grabbed the figma stand i had around theres no way the arm stands on its own
  is getting the swauth worth it
  zwauth
  i want it in red
  well probably keep on going with the chogokin line for the foreseeable future    gipsy released a year ago and the prototype for crimson and the info for cherno seem to have vanished are they still even bothering with the rest of the jaegers they havent even been seen in ages have they
  i like mine he feels a lot sturdier than you would expect it really depends on how much you like zwauth and if youre willing to cash out for the high price he doesnt have many quality issues
  does it fit on a regular cabinet or its even larger than that
  hardest time i had was with getting the clamp oriented then getting the back part of the missile cover to interface with it for some reason it definitely wont support itself i did try just out of curiosity itll handle just the firing effect itself and the missile but not the exploding covers and related effects love the amount of ankle tilt they worked into the design to make sure you can moreorless replicate the box art for the old model the mono eye is on a nice easily manipulated part on a ball joint too im also quite glad id left a wide amount of room for it because it took up every last bit of it and then some    now bring on the kaempfers
  only if del taco makes the pre sequel him doing gay fish is why the sequel stunk like shit
flappyboi best boi needs a zgoke to go with it
  how can you hate it
  is the big ass stand to hold he arm missile effectg included
  no thats a tamashii actcombination stand one of the smaller types mightve been nice for it to include something given the firing effects absolutely require it
the next hi metal r macross vf1 is due for preorder tommorow right    is it 4pm japan time or 6pm japan time im not fucking up again i already have my search engines prepared on my mobile and i have a literal list of excuses to whip it out at work
    4 pm japan time 3 am eastern
anyone going for mb great mazinger tonight looks like an awesome figure with a great spread of accessories but i prefer the look of the standard mazinger so i may pass this time around    kinda on the fence on the hmr vf1d for similar reasons as im already happy having the super ostrich for my valk trainer needs then again i really like that the 1d has the minmei holding hand      dont have it so im afraid i cant give any insight looks fantastic though and i remember reading that they addressed the heavy backpack which gave zwarth problems        man i love that look of the hygogg planting its arm to stabilize itself makes me very happy that the rd can pull it off so perfectly good to hear folks are enjoying theirs inhand
  kinda on the fence on the hmr vf1d   you know you want it look at that head sculpt its great
  i dont care about the mb mazinger or vf1d but i assume the kampfer and spike figuarts go up tonight too
    dont be obtuse variations on a theme are fine complete departure from it except primary colors makes no narrative sense why bother calling it a gundam at that point
  i am going to pick it up after release even the mazinger last year wasnt on high demand
  he would have issues in a detolf at full wingspread hes mostly really wide
    can it stand up on its own or is it really confined to the base
what is the best version of the zz to buy i always see that there are two versions of the robot damashii but i dont know which one is current or better
  thanks for sharing its nice to get a real look at them already
  undoubtedly a handsome head sculpt haha      i assume the kampfer and spike figuarts go up tonight too  thats right      thats a good idea anon that reminds me that ive got a bunch of tom points to use too so i think ill also wait and see what the domestic prices are like fingers crossed for a tom coupon or something      the enhanced zz rd 179 is the one you want to get i cant recall the exact improvements over the earlier version but folks who own both have always recommend the enhanced zz over the older one
  the anime
  the enhanced zz would be the best  but there is also a full armor version of the enhanced which is really nice this is not the sentinel ka signature toy this fazz was released in the regular rd line the only bad part is the armor is not removable
  variations on a theme  thats what turn a is its not as different from rx78 as you think    why bother calling it a gundam at that point  its just a name it doesnt mean anything
has the vf1d gone live yet not seen it pop up at hobby search
  heres amiami and cd japan            waiting for hlj
  amiami wont even load cdjapans giving me an error and it sold out on the last page of the cart at hobby search
mb great mazinger            rd kampfer          hljs hmr vf1d  
  and now paypals giving me an error at hlj what the fuck  guess it wasnt meant to be if every website is stopping me from trying to get one haha
    took a while after the initial rush but got everything loaded into the amiami cart and checked out
  i hope we start getting more code geass shfs again beyond just lancelot and guren based stuff    still want these
kampfer is like 1000yen more on hlj than cdjapan    already ordered gogeta from them instead have nothing to ship him with    toptier annoying
  glad i passed on alex to begin with one of my favorite mobile suits and i knew i wouldnt buy it twice so holding out for the superior version has paid off for once
  superior version still doesnt say alex on the shield keep waiting for the real superior true paint version
  yea that annoyed me too on the flip side hlj does have far better discounts on the vf1d mazinger and the dbz figuarts balances out i guess
  you mean rds though i would kill for emperor lelouch and knight of zero suzaku shfs
  yeah rds i goofed    though yeah i would love more geass shfs like kallen and cc
trying to preorder vf1d  preorder starts during busy period at work  rush to bathroom and try to preorder using bookmarked links in advance  its 559pm japan time at this point  decide to give amiami a go over hlj  this item is unavailable   thats new to me  try hlj  after 5 mins because the preloaded hi metal r search wasnt showing shit work calls me to get back  get put in easiest position to do fuck all but am left infront of clients thus unable to even look at my phone  oh well its just another retool  after that i get released on my break 30mins later  hlj has it and aside from my phone being a dick and refreshing itself as i try and clear the checkout it went smoothly  meanwhile amiami then shown this item is sold out    i know today is monday but that went smoother than expected guess hljs delay saved me for once anyone else get their vf1ds or did yall get fucked over
  i only want belial and kamfer and they are still up missed out on spike though but i dont want him as much
  yeah i missed out on spike too because the vf1d was top priority didnt think spike would be as high considering their job on zero 2 was kinda meh but i guess nostalgia wins
  it actually does stand on its own
    well alright then i dont mind it keeping on the stand but those boosters and overall look is just right up my alley this would look really good next to the nightingale too
entertainment earth has the rd saturn security labor for just 2099        shipping is free at 25 grabbed one myself almost worth it just for the rd laborscaled police car haha
  zaku  reelism  the visual flair of the spikes on the shoulders and the command horns disagree with you the zaku are just as much kiddie bait as the gundam is and the true real robot is the gm total utilitarianism    psspoilerthe zakus were inspired by kaiju and look/act like them when fightan in the og series/spoiler
  is the gm the bauhaus of gundam
kmf a finally has a name its called lancelot albion zero    p bandai mrd  fuck off bandai
dana oshee arrived today took a minute to get used to posing the funky arms its kickass joints are nice and tight feels good and solid and looks wonderfully menacing
    so its basicaly a repaint but the price is not bad at all
  i cant believe lelouch is getting his own lancelot albion
  the dunbine line is allway very good except the probleme with zwarth backpack  you cant really pose him without a stand for the backpack because of the weak torso joint
  i might be remembering wrong cause its been a while and i dont have access to it right now but i believe i fixed my zwarths problem by popping it apart and stuffing a bit of kleenex into the joint to create more tightness and friction
    did you pop the actual joint apart or just stuffed something into the seam mine just got shipped from mandarake id love to know how to buff that joint up
  pretty sure i popped it apart but again my memory is fuzzy this was back when i first got him on initial release date and i havent seen him in quite a long time if i figure out where i stored him place is a bit of a mess right now ill figure it out and post itt
    zero is actually zerozaku though
anyone else collecting these little figures ive got aloy watcher sackboy lara croft and banjo kazooie      1 sack boy  2 feisar fx350  3 crash bandicoot  4 heihachi mishima  5 the hunter  6 parappa  7 kratos  8 atreus  9 evan  10 sonic  11 aloy  12 gold hoarder  13 watcher  14   15 jin kazama  16 artorius  17 umbrella lemming  18 ag sys  19 blue eyes white dragon  20 knuckles  21 tails  22 summoned skull  24 ryu  25 master chief  26 marcus fenix  27 conker  28 banjo kazooie  29 golden crash bandicoot  30 lara croft  31 neo cortex  32 coco  33 spyro  34 solveig  35  36 agent 47
ive owned amiibo the novelty wears off so fast     i might pick up banjokazooie because that series has been severely neglected but most of the other figures i own from other lines hunter ryu ken kratos
i was excited for them in the beginning but now with terrible communication and quality that hasnt improved a bit im not that interested anymore i have sackboy parappa and hunter and the only one i want is banjo amiibo are better across the board except for having to be tied to nintendo in game content so they wont have the range of totaku
who fucking cares about this shit when fortnite is gonna blow static statues out of the water when children will be demanding actual toys with actual joints
i really considered getting bloodborne hunter but i also considered on just getting a bootleg figure and putting in the time to fix that up
i was one of the people hyped for them but when i saw them in person i saw them redundant i could second buy master chief mcfarlane or sack boy neca of them they are nice as a display but a figure with joints can do the same job
    would you be on board with the revival of these lines do you own any of the original figures
  i own a couple of different figures from different lines the detail on these things is amazing articulation is a different matter obviously still id like to see what else they could come up with  the dragons line in particular had some very well made sculpts  designs and there arent many options on the market as far as dragons go so its actually not a bad idea for a figure line  not sure how a movie maniacs line would work though necas had that covered for years now
washed up has been with no new ideas plans to try and fail to relive his former glories yep real original
  used to own some id support a revival mm ts would be contingent on design hard pass on dragons if they brought their agame articulationwise none of that calling an assembly point articulation bullshit oh and pick a fucking scale already       neca has a lot of stuff from their mcflike statueshit days that id like to see updated i dont so much mind if its mcfarlane doing them if they actually articulate them
so iam looking for a 1/12th scale 6inch scale medival warhammer nothing ginormous a lot like pic related or as close to pic related i need one for a witch hunting knight character iam working on and would like to see my options before having to painstakingly sculpt one myself
  here is the knight in question
and a pic of the cat that wards off witches curses and protects from spells thanks to all the anons that helped me a while ago
if at all possible a war hammer as closely related to this one pic related would be preferable
are you really going to just make a thread asking to be spoonfed for every part of your oc
  no just the ones that are really hard to find ive googled used etsy ebay amazon1999jp big bad toy storeand others found nothing on any of them and am just asking you can call it soon feeding but iam just asking for help
an imai knight model kit has a pole axe
  that might work but the war hammer does apparently no get as much love or crdit of effectiveness as swords or polearms do
  the mounted version of that knight is coming in march and has a pole arm variant of the war hammer
  do you even know what a warhammer is
  ignore him hes probably one of the autists that thinks every thread needs to be a general
  thanks man i just cant believe there are no medieval war hammers in 1/12th scale hell ive only seen one in 1/6th scale and it was a custom one someone made
so i made a handle its a rough concept i need a real dremel tool and a better piece of wood thinking on getting a 4mm doll rod and trying something there but i have no idea how i would make the head out of metal or some kind of epoxy putty
  i was thinking of getting the dremal tool and putting a small nail through then using epoxy putty to sculpt a hammer on it but i have no idea how that would turn out
    get a playmobil check how the weapon fit and repaint it   at least you get a one handed hammer
  thanks ill look into that
is this the first toy from this line when are they gonna release a spamela
diamond select has done other muppet figures ive got gonzo personally and hes pretty great nice sculpt good poseability he can be a little rough to get to stand right since his feet are small but hes worth it
  gonzo one of my fav thanks for the tip
  no this is a cancelled toy that got uncancelled to see if sales would justify bringing it back    bad side is only 2 waves got released    they probably wont release a spamela considering they didnt get the whole electric mayhem out shes a long way off
  i dont understand but i will try
  it looks like you understood just fine that skelly is clearly having a good time
  i like the idea of this thread ill contribute what i can

where will you go to discuss toys once 4channel fails and has to close down
thats a cute samus
  im a mod on a small forum so probably there might try and channel some weebs from here into the anime and robot sections to keep discussions lively
probably back to tfw2005 as much as id hate it /tfg/ has its idiots and shitposters but at least you can call out those idiots and shitposters without a zerotolerance policy biting you in the ass back on tfw the frustration just bottled up    for everything else maybe toyark but id be losing a lot of interesting discussion since that site is full of hasbro and neca collectors who dont import at all
  everyone on tfw is either too fucking old or a kid i like 4chans 1830 age range so much it aligns with my collection interests way more
  since were dying we should add likes to posts to now cuz i want to know if you like my posts 3
  honestly probably nowhere ill just try and keep track of releases by myself    i always like everything you post anon
  i wish i could tell that you do _
  looks like miyoko
is 4chin really dying
  hiro split the blue boards to the new 4channel domain so maybe he could get actual reputable advertisers to keep the lights on problem is no company is going to believe this new site is safe for their reputation when theres still a ton of linkage between it and ye olde 4chan and the moderation is about the same quality that it ever was because ban evasion continues to be pisseasy without some sort of account requirement preferably an invisible one
unironically facebook even if a lot of the time discussions there end with lets agree to disgree  fanatical geewunner boomers are a better group to hang around than deranged trannies that can only think about politics
  i honestly cant really think of anywhere id even want to go i avoided the other sites to begin with and was originally a fa/tg/uy before i even realized /toy/ existed and mainboarded here instead
man i hope things keep on keepin on my favorite part about this place isnt just that people discuss virtually everything but that ive been put on to so much cool shit that i wasnt previously aware of
ill try to revitalize raving toy maniac
  what else even is there i get that the whole board culture thing cant be replicated but is there even another site that talks toys with such diversity i mean diversity in the toys lego marvel shf figma gunpla models 1/6 transformers gi joe all in one place every else seems specialized to only one of those things at a time
  i mainly collect klocki     but im going to miss popping into the weeb import threads learning what exactly the fuck gylos is being surprised that preschool toys have such vibrant followings and all the westaboo/import masterrace flame wars      wouldnt have known about those cute aqua shooter gachas were it not for 4chan id hate for this place to go     im still deciding whether to get some acid rain or not hope i can still lurk for some time yet
id probably find a place but i havent even looked at other chans cause im basically done with this shithole   i pop in every few weeks just to see whats happening but its always the same old dumpster fire     forced generals  pg13 content blue board  shitposters shitposting  no weeaboo statueshit because rules  vigilante modstaff  no fun allowed
futaba will probably just lurk there though
  is there even another site that talks toys with such diversity  this is my favourite thing about /toy/ and my main concern if it ever goes away i know of some sites to discuss my more mainstream /toy/ interests but they are very contained  i would have never heard about mugenbine or rihio multiabyss there and when i started with model kits i would have had to find a new forum to get accustomed to and ask questions there instead of just going to the gunpla general here  the best place to go would probably tfw the audience isnt too bad and they have some general toy discussion
i just want a place where i can be anonymous forever not just so i can talk shit but because i dont want to register and remember passwords and shit that was always a draw to me
  neopets
if the new /toy/ falls apart probably nowhere aside from just watching for the two lines i still collect ill probably just sort of fall out of the hobby i had figures before finding /toy/ sure but i didnt really collect until i starting coming here
i would probably try to follow threads on tfw so i could keep up with new releases but those threads are shit for information compared to here so id probably miss out on a bunch of figures
  probably this before i went here i used to lurk and look at forum posts as a guest no signing up just observing   going to futabas toy boards will be the closest to be on 4chan if the thing dies even if i cant post anymore  at least the oc they do over there will be entertaining
i mostly collect 1/6 scale so it would be back to any 1/6 scale board
  me too i like 4chans plug and play set up im not a shit poster but i like the anonymity too as it keeps everything level any forums ive seen start feeling hierarchical with popularity and veterans and everyone starts watching what they say i really like the freedom and community here so i hope it survives
    i thought of opening toy board on 4x2chan i know we supposed to hate each other but its just a suggestion  let me know what you think
so im an irregular poster here why are people thinking about leaving is it out of principle or are there some upcoming changes something more drastic than the domain name change
  honestly this  other chans never build up enough steam to bother with and if /toy/ goes then so will my entire collecting now too long after just because im going to encounter a whole lot less of what is out there       its more the domain name change in some misguided attempt at seeming like a fresh site away from 4chan so gookmoot can earn more money through more reputable ads if he doesnt mind splitting up blue and red boards he clearly doesnt hold much attachment to the existing structure easy to assume that he could cull boards when this 4channel gimmick doesnt pan out fully
  they just think somehow this change that affects nothing on their end is going to somehow bring the downfall of the site
  4chans being run for a profit now and everyone but hiroshimoot knows that theres no way this site would ever be considered ad friendly enough to bring in the big bucks so when this gimmick doesnt bring in the money they want theres the chance that theyll just close the site altogether    nice try satan
  as long as /toy/ exists theres really no need but if this site ever ends i would look there to find other /toy/migrants i doubt it would live long there but itd be something      the domain change seems to make a few people nervous i dont think anything is going to come from it but it does show that this site isnt making enough money to be profitable which means changes are a possibility
  get fucked
    if 4channel isnt profitable why keep it around or split at all
  back on tfw the frustration just bottled up  i know this feel honestly the site as a whole has gone down over the past couple of years the main tf forums are elitist snobs and the 3rd party forum great god spergs spergs everywhere i keep hoping to see some news in a thread an their talking about the stupidest shit no even related to the topic toyark is more friendly and helpful anyway i dont get why op thinks this place is going to close down you can view all boards in the navi now and besides i think most of are traffic comes from blue boards /v/ /co/ and blech /a/
  lol who cares if it goes it goes /toy/ is the only one i actually follow anyways so its no skin off my nose
  splintering into discord channels
  discord
tfw for diaclone  as for nearly every other line i care about this seems to be one of the only places on the internet that is actually willing to talk about them  every other major toy forum either just wants to talk about fap statues or walmart toys
  wonder why he didnt go with a completely different name if he was trying to rebrand for ad revenue i dont get how adding nel is supposed to negate the stigma
  if 8 still allows those pedoerotica boards where they post toddlers in swimsuits then its a no from me dawg ive been staying away from 8 on two parts disgust and one part not wanting to be on a watch list just because i want to talk about toys
if the board were to ever shut down it would probably serve as impetus to get serious about starting a blog or youtube channel it has been something that ive been turning over in my head for a long while
  i dont think its about stigma but instead about the simple fact that there are filters that work on domain to domain basis like if 4chan is a known offender then 4channel is a whole new site free of gore porn etc the name itself doesnt matter      you do it anon a random blog or youtube channel will surely help in replacing a whole image board
  so when this gimmick doesnt bring in the money they want theres the chance that theyll just close the site altogether    they would just sell it someone else not throw it away
  to be bought up by reddit or facebook
are there any good alternatives to /toy/ i checked out some of the others mentioned here and from a quick browse they seem very western figure focused
  those were banned years ago dude
  as disgusting as that is it is contained within their boards just like bronies are on /mlp/ right
  the moderation is about the same quality that it ever was because ban evasion continues to be pisseasy without some sort of account requirement preferably an invisible one  dont talk about shit you dont know moderation was miles better years ago they started hiring new types of jannies and such 67 years ago redit tier retards with no objectivity thats when this place started getting shitty
  there isnt really place that can replace it as  said especially the fashion doll thread which the only other options is tumblr or libtard female forum the horror        why you hate chan is it because of            from my own experience in some boards such as /co/ /a/ and others yes it is contained within their boards the only crossborader i noticed was /pol/tards imagine 4chan pol but with 100 dumb natsocs
guess ill learn japanese and surf 2ch
  huh yknow what thats not even a bad option though i can guess that theyll be complaining about a huge 4chan invasion around the time and id be accused of jsl a shit ton but fuck it its better than facebook
  moderation was miles better years ago  yeah back when phoneposting wasnt common knowledge even ol shiteater greg got himself banned on every open wifi source in his town before he found out he could get a new ip by just toggling his mobile data off and on now everyone knows and theyre spamming the sameold bait porn and tuxedo frogs every morning while they shit    better moderation would be great sure but it would be even better if bans actually meant something again
  itll just get merged back on to the original domain like last time
  theres a whole little manga of samus doing cute shit in that artstyle but i dont know where to find it
  he will go full lowtax and try to charge you ten bucks for monthly access before trying to close this place down    but that would just be staving off the inevitable
  its funny that a lot of people look down on 4chan as some rotting skid row of a website but are a lot happier on a forum where being attached to a name a post count and your own reputation puts you on a specific ranking    ive even seen 2 forums where theyve even removed post counts but its still the same
  what is with the general autism    if 4channel shuts down for whatever reason its more than extremely obvious that the board would just continue to exist on the 4chan domain    why are so many posters here just blind to simple facts jesus                    all people who dont understand how simple things work simple logic and internet 101      this is the only fucking person in the entire thread who understands and see how easy he explained it with one fucking line instead of all this autistic theorizing  its a fucking domain relax your fucking asses nothing is going anywhere at least not for a fucking domain change no one here understand technology wtf
  what makes you think 4channel will die
  you sure you aint overreacting a bit  i know shits bad but 4chan wont end just like that and even if its gonna end some day ill be fuckin ready
  youre missing the point that hiros probably only pulling this stunt because the current ad revenue isnt paying the bills 4chan will probably fail if 4channel fails and 4channel is a harebrained idea that wont fool anyone
  discord
  eh okay i get you  maybe im the autist after all either way not sure if this is all just conjecture and theory or if any stats actually come out i have trouble believing 4chan is facing issues staying up monetarily but i guess i dont know better than anyone else
  different anon but even before hiro wasnt moot barely breaking even on 4chan all these years serious question i only read this in an article this or last year
    moot was worth millions before selling 4chan it was making money
friends and neighbours staff and customers at the local toy shop
  worth millions but not making millions  people recognized that 4chan was a unique place full of potential targets for advertisers but moot held off ads for as long as possible and doubled over backwards to keep his otaku site up and running so people could come to talk about their japanes animes one time he even had to pile the servers 4chan was hosted on into a car so he take them to another state where he could continue hosting    the guy designed a neat place where people could come to share pictures of neat things and wanted it to stay that way it was never a moneymaking venture and never made money    up until the day he left moot had one hoodie and mostly lived off cheap street vendor food i honestly hope hes doing better for himself now after everything he went through for this place
    hes a google employee now so im sure hes making decent money     its true that moot was dirt fucking poor when he owned 4chan though it was not a profitable website and most of the time couldnt even break even
  this would never have known about glyos and its galaxy of stuff without /toy/    sans 4chan i guess ill hang out on facebook and instagram maybe signup for an allspark account
hey /toy/ im trying to find doctor who gifts for a friend for christmas but it seems like its impossible to find any trustworthy decent merchandise from the show anymore i remember seeing stores sell cybermen voice changers do you guys know of anywhere
  the 5 inch figures of yesteryear were pretty good maybe some funko pops there were good ones of those cant really go wrong with something like a 4th doctor scarf a fun replica and useful
as a dr whofag i like this lego set and the dimensions set a sonic screwdriver light up pen would be a 10/10 gift for me
i bought my sisterinlaw a 10th doctor sonic screwdriver for christmas not sure if itll come in time because the email i got for it said the earliest was the 14th and the latest was the 30th
watch capaldis final episodes today and i loved it want to get a mondasian cyberman figure whatre my options
  theres a 5inch character options one that looks a bit discolured imo  pictured  theres a 121 figurine collection one like a small statue closer to 375 scale  lastly theres a robert harrop statue thats about 12 inches and looks sick but its also 70 quid and out of stock  if youre not in the uk youre a bit fucked as always but id recommend the 5inch figue  a bit of paint or just leave as is  hope this helps
  that works well enough thank you
    you can find them on ebay for good prices typically  the classic stuff commands a premium but some of the sets are reasonable    i got the claws of axos set for 20 which includes the brigadier jo grant and an axon    i also picked up the 11 doctor pack for 50 making each doctor 450 they regularly go for that but the condition varies    what sort of doctor who does he like because he wont want the companion sets without the accompanying doctor
someone knoes the sauce/name of this cool mofo
its probably from a chinese sslike show try asking their generals
i dont know the name of them but theres a korean toy series thats like power rangers with two vehicles to form the megazord    try googling hello carbot
    its a tobot from tobot v
  thats it  thanks for the video  it looks cool as fuck
my god it looks amazing way better than those absolutely crap weve been receiving for years straight from sentai
  yup nips could learn something from korean boys
high metal vr  metal build  2 highly sought dragonballz characters    are you ready for the crashpocalypse    how are you prepping what is your strategy
what is your stategy  buying the model kit for great mazinger because im too poor for a fancy metal build
  pretty sure ill have no issue ordering the kämpfer once the initial rush has finished and the sites work as intended so im not prepping anything
so 3am tonight like usualfor us east coasters
thanks to all of the love the line has received thus far the initial run of the beasts of the mesozoicraptor series has proven to be a success as a result im very happy to say that the next set of raptor series action figures has already begun production without the need for crowdfunding and are now being offered for the first time to preorder at a special reduced price these figures will remain available to preorder until they are instock which is estimated to be late march/ early april 2019 after that the remaining stock will be available at the regular price    so apparently theres going to be a new run of repaints theres 3 of them that are listed as second release and then theres the three new ones im very confused but i like the black velociraptor
the exclusive is on the creativebeast site this time and i actually really like the colors on this one may have to order it
guess theyre coming with instruction sheets and trading cards too
not sure how i feel about these minor paint updates
  looks great    very minor repaints but they look better for it kinda glad i didnt buy more than i did and its good to hear that theyre selling well enough that theyre making more unlike certain other shitty companies
anyone have that pic that shows what bird each of the raptors color schemes are based off of
  unlike certain other shitty companies  you are one extra pathetic salty asshole
    what company
    yeah nope this does not work for me looked more natural before oh and why is shipping so bloody expensive
  4h who makes everyone pay rape prices if you decide to like a figure and want more because they only make one batch and thats it despite their toys supposedly being army builders
  do they make dinosaur figures
  who makes everyone pay rape prices if you decide to like a figure and want more  nnnnnnnope try again dumbfuck nobody makes you do anything you whiny little fuckstick
  go back to your general to sell your poorly articulated overpriced hemans for 2x the price you paid because 4h knows collectors like limited numbers for their resale value
  ah its the 4hanon who will viciously defend his favorite shitty company simply by slinging insults
    oh hey its the same morons who try to shit up generals because they think the world should revolve around them kindly end your lives you have no meaning or purpose     by god you cant even keep your autism in check for a single post before you begin blubbering like a vagina over your salty issues
4h is good at exactly one thing making toys everything else from their company to marketing to sales and everything in between is a dumpster fire fuck the 4h they should stick to making toys for someone else or hire someone to actually run their business
  case in point
 4h is good at exactly one thing sculpting toys  fixed that for you  the engineering on their toys is shit not enough articulation and the articulation that they do have has mostly shit range that it makes mcfarlanes figures seem like yamaguchi revoltechs in comparison
  the engineering on their toys is shit  nice crap ass opinion you have there you dont even own their toys but youll troll every thread you can with the same bullshit youve been kicked out of the ml threads as a laughing stock take the hint youre not wanted anywhere
  i posted photos of my figures and no one was kicked out more like ignored because they need to ignore the fact how overpriced 4h figures are especially when lines like topic give more articulation paint and are produced when more i wanted theres nothing left to say when you stick your fingers in your ears and pretend its okay a 6 toyline has as little articulation and range as 4hs do in 2007  oh wait its 2018 fucking rip    now go back to your circlejerk and paying twice as much money for figures you didnt think were special during the kickstarter because 4h isnt making anymore and you have to rely on scalpers for the figures people are showing off    pic of my minotaurs shields peg broken off from falling 4 inches onto my desk because the minotaurs knees couldnt support him
so with tumblr melting down again and people jumping ship seems like a good time for another one of these threads    /toy/ instagrams or other sites worth following
  doubledealer_93  im starting to post more
  he said worth following
female presenting nipples
  rip you showed me
raspberry chainsaw and dca_toybox are there theyre pretty good    d amazing is there  hes pretty shit      i enjoy your stuff
  d amazing is there  hes pretty shit  are you that retard that got kicked out of the mezco group for being a racist shithead
  nope i dont do facebook      guess more than one person can think a guy sucks
  hes a good reviewer but his photography sucks
  hes a decent reviewer hes not very interesting to watch but he gets new toys quick and puts up reviews promptly i sorta group him with peaugh dry but informational his photos are pretty damn bad they feature most of the typical acba problems poor composition lack of hierarchy/focus in shots predictable angles cheesy word art alley/warehouse backdrop fluorescent background i think the problem is that he jumped into this game by buying an expensive camera without learning any photography basics and i think he feels like hes too experienced at this point to go back and learn all of that which is evidenced by how salty he gets when criticized which is regrettable cause i constantly see beginner mistakes in his shots    im not any of the anon who posted above btw just another person who thinks he kinda sucks
          youre welcome
ig is reze11even    i try to take a variety of different toy shots but its still about 50 glyos
  acba  is this just a buzzword for thing i dont like now
  heres a fucking example
  i dunno newfag why dont you actually fucking lurk and find out
  i already like what i see nice selection of figures and that is one niceass vinyl build followed
  if youd simply google the word youd see that most of the photos by acba members sport those same mentioned problems
i like jesterjive a lot
  acba  is this just a buzzword for thing i dont like now  are you literally blind and/or illiterate the post you quoted explains in detail why acba pics are bad
  my biggest problem with his photos are theyre extremely redundant with little to no creativity ever    my biggest problem with him is that he thinks hes gods gift to toy collectors
  all social media websites including this one are masonic controlled
  all his pictures look the same but with different figures the same extreme poses the same extreme angles it gets boring ive seen way better pictures in the photography thread
  looking like a decent start but check what youre doing with some of your uploads a few of them in the multipic posts are weird closeups with no focus like on the slumber party post where i just see a bedsheet           i just looked this guy up and its a mixed bag i expected worse with all the shit being thrown around but when you take so so many photos of the same type of figure trying to show it off for review purposes how really different can it be i saw a few images i liked with silhouettes that said legends esque shit is boring to me pretty much no matter what         this is great lots of variety and a handful of truly amazing photos
december  kid kuririn    january  mister satan web exclusive    february  great saiyaman    march  majin buu aku    april  dbs broly  artificial human no 21 true form    no date  angel son gokû  champa  gotenks absorbed majin buu  gt adult son gokû  jaco  jiren  porunga  son gohan absorbed majin buu  ssb son gokû  ssb vegeta  ss4 son gokû  vados      previous thread 
majin buu 59 on amazon currently if youre on the fence about him now is the time its an excellent figure
  thats a pretty good price especially since buu is way bigger than the pictures let on hoping roshi gets an amazon sale today
barnes and noble has yamcha in stock and 20 off with the coupon cyber20 roshi and bulma are also 45
  never mind yamcha is already gone but i noticed they also have buu for 60 so hes less than a normal figure with the coupon
  wont let me use coupon
  ha
  got roshi thanks br0
bulma is surprisingly fun little figure glad i was able to get her for 43 at bn this weekend would love a dragon ball yamcha and first gi goku to go with her
why are the 10s back in the op
oh shit cloud is about to do his limit break
  because some people are retarded just waiting on that 10 angel wing goku anyday now anyday
  can bandai please make a trunks figure that isnt shit

  april  goku black fiasco flashbacks intensify
    this is an impersanator    to answer you fuck no
  goku black was the figure that made me realized i need to pre order every figure i want luckily i was able to find a black randomly at a hot topic
  same tho with buu being 60 on amazon and bulma and gotenks being figures i want to sell i wish i didnt preorder everything
  well what i mean with what i want is only the characters i like i dont tend to preorder every character and yeah buu being 60 hurts
dragon ball north america tour final stop location los angeles tcl chinese theater hollywood during dragon ball super broly hollywood premiere on december 13th free admission anyone going probably no new stuffs but the updated nubroly sculpt

chichis coming fellas i can feel it
  0 ankle pivot  worst leg articulation since whis  xenoshit outfit  almost always on sale on every site because no one is buying it  yeah its pretty great
  what happened with goku black
  whichever anon that linked the hot topic listing is a fuckin hero
  the classic supply vs demand everybody and their mom wanted goku black preorders were getting cancelled left and right and before he was released his priced skyrocketed it didnt help that he was releasing around the same time the goku black arc was going on
  in my state whoop but way too far a drive
  hmu if you need a middleman price  shipping  10 i have to go to fucking hollywood blvd fee
got awakening goku for 34 bucks on bn today cus of cyber monday cheaper than son goku wew
  some weird thing happened with bluefin and bandai and bluefin apparently got way less of them than they told retailers they would
should i get armoured trunks for 30 i like trunks a lot but the figure looks really similar to ss vegeta which is awesome but he has like no accessories
  just get it dude eventually you will regret not picking it up hes currently the best trunks made
  o damn thats crazy i hope thats a one time thing because i would be suuuper pissed if that happened to me
  i mean if you collect a lot are fine with character multiples and are itching do it hes totally fine and looks cool but as your only representation sucks
  you didnt post the time patroller
  if he really insists on keeping it around he should at least have it be complete too wheres ss3 vegeta and korin
  can you headswap xeno trunks onto the body
  no sadly
  this is a perfect example of bandai getting in their own way a lot of people would have bought xeno trunks just to swap his heads onto the armored body they need to stop fucking around with the cross compatibility because its costing them sales
just got my first figures awakening warrior goku raised on earth goku and battle damaged gohan wow these figures are even mire amazing than i hoped cant wait until my ss3 goku arrives
this guy looks good are there any problems with him is he outdated in anyway or is there much chance hell get a doover
  he came out recently and is a doover of an older figure most peoples complaints about him are lack of paint on the body which is minimal all things considered id say go for it
  hes pretty good has less accessories than the original scouter vegeta and really needed some panel lining on the armor to make some of the detailing pop a bit better its also your only official source of a modern base vegeta head
    then ill leap on him thanks
  hope it goes up for pre order before the movie comes out cause all the haters will want it as soon as they get out of the movies
  okay
    you should buy both vegetas and then throw away the scouter vegeta
    wrong you should buy both vegetas then turn scouter vegeta into namek vegeta
  why is his head so big
  they accidentally made him in db scale
  yknow id love the time patroller outfit a lot less if he had his long hair no idea why but that seems missing to me
  i mean more fuck
not that im hating but why did tamashii make jiren before finishing the goku black arc like were still missing some key characters from that arc like zamasu fused zamasu and to a degree future mai it makes sense to continue that arc seeing how the last two super characters released are from that arc
  they dont seem to be doing anything in any particular order they hop around different arcs from different franchises every month im sure well get merged zamasu in time
  honestly i dont think he was supposed to be revealed yet i mean they showed of zamasu at the same event but jiren was the one that got leaked by a streamer why do you think the promo shot is of his back and we dont have there clearest of pics for him
  i mean they showed of zamasu at the same event  mexican lies
  both vegetas  i really want to neck swap the premium color because i like tiny armor vegeta with the new head
  kek
dbs trunks review   overall figure looks pretty good actually oddly enough this reviewers trunks doesnt look that bad when it comes to the blue hair shouting face qc issues with some owners
    i personally think it still looks bad but im not getting the figure either way each to his own
  horseface trunks
  fuck it looks great
  to distributors and licensing partners
  to distributors and licensing partners  im actually one of them no such thing josé
  zamasu  you must be confusing it with the dragon stars line
  i know he comes with a lot by current standards but i really wish he had at least one more face for each form both lack a neutral expression base has happy and yelling two extremes and ss has a teeth gritting and yelling which id have less of a problem with if the teeth gritting wasnt looking off to the side
  nah yelling face is still shit reviewers are just spineless
got my old hlj account banned a while ago because i couldnt pay for a couple of orders  made a new one a bit later  paid for every preorder since  wake up this morning and attempt to change the shipping method on something  find out the account has been banned losing several new preorders include dbrelated ones  also find out that my old account was restored    is this what karma feels like
  very nice effect useage
  neutral faces are for statueshit boringasfuckstanding poses
  got my old hlj account banned a while ago because i couldnt pay for a couple of orders  how im pretty sure if you spend more than you cancel youre good so i doubt it was a couple of orders
  and a lot of people want to be able to do that
is he worth the hefty price tag
  yeah neutral expressions are boring in a line that can give us 3 faces i get it in marvel legends where they give us just one head so neutral stuff would work in lots of displays but if you can give us various options make them non common and boring shit
  i cant only assume you meant the figuarts in which case yes
  i meant the dragon stars one i like figuarts but it just bothers me how little effort went into his hair after ssgss goku just not sure if hes worth 40 bucks
  but were not getting 3 faces per head and if im only getting 2 faces per head one of them should be neutral a neutral expression would most definitely give me more posing options than a happy face or a shitty screaming face
  absolutely fucking not
  what the fuck are you complaining about his smiling face is his neutral expression
  his smiling face is his neutral expression
      you fucks cant beat tien
  well it was pretty new and i maybe only bought 1 thing beforehand
  megalopolistoys has him for 25 last time i checked
  why did they ban your new account did they find out it was associated with the old banned account you should contact customer support or something and maybe you can salvage those preorders
  dragonball has some of the most expressive characters in any anime wanting mandatory neutral faces is just boring taste
  this i want expression that reflect the character not flat faces with no emotion
  thats great for you i want to be able to get the most out of my figures and having expressions on either end of the spectrum with no middle ground doesnt offer as many options again a smiling or screaming trunks head has much less uses than a neutral one and the remedy to making everyone happy is to simply include three faces per head instead of two its really not an unreasonable request for a fucking 65 figure
  its really not an unreasonable request for a fucking 65 figure   you acting like they didnt give us two heads 4 faces a galik effect a huge ass spirit sword and normal swords with of course the hands and a stand  also   expressions on ends of the spectrum  neutral boring shit
  nah best is one neutral face and then some more outthere ones you dont want to have to be forced to constantly have your figure sperg out because all theyve been given are overthetop faces
  you realize youre talking about a character thats stoic and awkward right
    why does he come with an extra leg is it a baf with the same sculpt as him
  merged zamasu baf
  i wasnt referring to any specific character but if you meant trunks then yeah he is stoic and a little awkward and his smiling face represents that pretty well id say dragonball super trunks has a bit more hope and optimism than cell saga trunks who constantly felt like the z fighters were in imminent danger and rightfully so
  need i remind you how much shit we used to get for 40 and before you blame inflation 40 when the line launched in 2010 would be about 47 today even a release like trunks is giving significantly less value for your dollar the spirit sword isnt a 20 accessory
  one of the worst figures in the line i cannot believe how bad this is wow
  times change get used it not a single import company is as cheap as they used to be 10 years ago  hell thats good hopefully the extra dollars are going to some workers or the betterment of the facility they work on
  justifying being ripped off   actually believing the money is going anywhere but the pockets of the greedy gooks in charge at bandai
  ok what are you gunna do
  how is his jacket sleeve ripped but you can still see blue jacket fabric underneath instead of his sweater color
  the fuck you talking about
yall tired of translucent hair try metallic hair instead
  would look cool for ultra instinct but definitely not anything else lol
  he wears a green sweater under his denim jacket shouldnt that be showing under the rip    and who the fuck unironically likes translucent hair shit looks cheap and the hair never looked translucent in the anime    translucent power auras and stuff yes but hair cmon bruh
  colors and design are most likely based off of official toriyama art
  a dark metallic would look good for ultra instict yeah    i wish people would just paint this stuff to be graphic looking like the show    the translucents look cheap and the other things people try look ehhhhh
worst version of gotenks  worst version of bulma  worst version of android 21  garbage line
  every version of gotenks is the worst tbf
  i want metallic gold super saiyan hair for nostalgia purposes
heres your canon gogeta    
  toy reveal at chinese theater
  not ssj4   its shit
  odd that there arent any dbs brolys gogeta merchandise so far statueshit trading or whatnot
bought yamcha when he was in stock at barnes and noble over two weeks ago  order still processing  expecting a cancellation email any day now
  theres a bunch of statues and gachas solicited as blanks should be revealed soon
  ssj4 gogeta beats omega shenron  ssb gogeta beats broly  gt fans believe ssj4 stronger than ssb  but broly is always the strongest  but he was in a movie so hes weaker than omega    conflicting arguments will end both gt and broly fans collectively ushering in a new era of based dragon ball fans
  ss4 gogeta isnt stronger because he doesnt even exist anymore
  how does ssb gogeta even work considering vegito couldnt stay ssb for like a fraction of the normal time due to how much energy got expended in ssb
  holy shit this animation is fucking great
anyone else expecting a gogeta figure for the last stop of the tour
  its pretty clear that they were just straightup trying to conceal the fact that he was in the movie at all they did pretty terrible at it but there are all sorts of figures and statues and other shit that are all unrevealed broly movie character or whatever    they did that with a bunch of shit for mui goku as well
were going to get a ssb gogeta figure before a vegito 20  i mean i have the ssb from this year but it still kind of stings theres no way theyll give gogeta base ss and ssb heads
  now you know why people are so excited i didnt care about super and im barely a dbz fan but this looks killer
am i the only person that still fucking hates super saiyan blue fundamentally
  i wish it were so you retard
  i really hope they give base ss and ssb heads but i have a feeling that if they do make a gogeta they kind of want to spread the releases out
  i do now actually   broly goku vegeta and now showing gogeta seems even logical
  i could see super saiyan and blue heads but do we ever see him in base form
  whoa why so hostile
  he used the fword first
  why the greenery if theyre in the arctic
  
  i dont hate it but i still think its boring conceptwise  ultrainstinct was cooler but im glad goku lost that because if time passed on and it was just integrated into baseline gokus moveset itd never be brought up again and just fade away into obscurity
  they teleport away from the arctic to fuse and goku and piccolo need to teach vegeta the fusion dance
  its more the color electric fucking blue really toriyama this is the kinda shit people used to make fun of and write shitty fanfics about     i will admit i do like the cmyk thing going on with it and regular ssg/rose but thats all there is going for it
  well we already had yellow in the original super saiyan then green in legendary super saiyan red in super saiyan god i guess blue made some sense pink in rose of course and lastly technically white in ultra instinct
    holy shit they actually did it i would have been legit hyped if i saw it in the middle of a movie instead of being spoiled by a trailer
  if was a combination of ss and ssg then they shouldve combined those colors make it orange or something     ironically i loved rose but maybe im just an arbitrary faggot
    gogeta figure is pretty much confirmed now i will be happy as long as we get something other than a blue head getting all three would be great but i just want something other than blue
  rose kind of felt shoehorned in for me but if you liked it more power to you
    left would have looked a ton better but i hate super in general
  see veggy looks like his hair is fucking made of fire thats badass
  fuuuuuccck theyre going to paint his vest yellow on the figuarts arent they instead of the og orange
  yeah hes wearing the same colors as gotenks
    story wise it makes sense why would the colors if his fusion suit be different from anyone elses    design wise yeah it blows the orange looked way better and i think wouldve looked good with ssb
ive done my good deed for the day convinced a random person at bn to pick up nappa i hope we enjoys it also bn restocked a bunch if shf db stuff so go check out your local store
    ohhhh thats why he looked really weird
    no he looks like a ginger
    of course people are excited most forget half the appeal of dragonball which is the art and animation dragonball and dbz is visual eye candy and dragonball super for about 100 episodes at least doesnt look or feel like dragonball at all it wasnt until the tournament of power that they started drawing and animating everything to look like z which is what everyone wanted to begin with
    shf ginger when 
  but goku is supposed to be the carrot
yoooo
  sdcc dbz movie 12 gogeta figure confirmed
  i just told the dude at bn to keep his out for an announcement for gogeta too glad im not a liar
  something seems off
  its just that the colors arent what you came to expect after decades of seeing it one way
  its the colors youre used to gogeta with a bit darker color palette orange and black vest dark blue belt and boot wrappings the new movie design matches gotenks color scheme for the vest and lightens up the belt a bit
  that absolutely did not take long
    that could be it but i think its more so the lighting it makes his neck look really tiny and his muscles incredibly defined to the point when it looks a little gross also the big as fuck ears lol
avoid super thread on a because spoilers  come here to check if broly finally went up for pre order  spoilers    tthanks guys
  caring about spoilers
  super is a fucking midquel there are no stakes here spoilers dont matter
  midquel  what the fuck are you even talking about
  its not a spoiler if they announce it
  it takes place before end of z we already know who lives unless they retcon eoz which would be a godsend
  it still qualifies as a spoiler if it ruins the most important aspect of the movie the fight
  spoilers dont ruin good movies
  jesus that was fast he better have base and ss heads or ill still buy him but will feel disgruntled
  the version of gogeta i want is going to be a goddamn web exclusive or sdcc exclusive meaning almost double the price fuck
    give him base hair dont fuck up the chest again     also his elbow is already fucked up youll never be able to pose him with straight arms
  web exclusives dont mean shit in the dragonball line or at all really
  the arms usually sort of collapse over that elbow piece doesnt look like anything different than what theyre already almost always doing
  cool be nice if they did include a regular ss head as well
  youre asking for way too much
    no offense but i dont believe you
  you dont need to just use your fucking eyes
  its the same mechanism every arm has what the fuck
    sorry i didnt make it clear enough here you go buddy    c i t a t i o n  n e e d e d
  probably yessadly
  i honestly dont give a fuck if you believe it or not
  if you actually owned any of the figures that came out this year and werent just some retard troll you would know
      if you dont think this elbow is fucked up then youre an idiot show me one picture of the elbow collapsing back into the arm
  look at any of the figures that actually have bulky muscular arms    the fact that youre picking this stickarms figure just shows that youre likely just being stupid on purpose
  on top of that that trunks can still straightarm just look at the fucking op
  im disappointed that broly wont be in scale
  lmao if they starting making figures that big they might as well make great ape vegeta first
  will df give us the ssj head
  great ape vegeta was on the latest poll
  still no raditz  meh
  yes
  raditz is boring
anyone hoping for a ssg vegeta
  id rather have base or rage broly first
  so will tamashii make classic gogeta an event exclusive
  yeah im assuming thats the deal
  base broly with a few bases faces and a few super saiyan faces thatd be good
  you and me both brother
  fuck up the chest again are you talking about what they did with gotenks
  just imagine how much better both of them would look with translucent hair  demoniacal fit please save us from this mediocrity
    yeah painting flesh over dark blue instead of the other way around
  now this is epic
gogeta is now canon    i fucking hate db super
  wasnt everyone hinting at gogeta being a thing for like months now
  how could you hate fusion reborn
  goku and vegeta are not the same height they shouldnt be able to fusion dance plus it takes away from gotenks being the only fusion dance fusion in canon made him special
  hey its the gotenksfag
  stay cucked
  i swear either the gogeta or the 20 ssb goku and vegeta better come with pointing hands to do the fusion dance pose even though the ab crunch probably wont even allow them to bend that far
  trunks and goten arent even the same height you fucking moron  i dont know why this made me so mad
  im going to guess that the new ssb goku and vegeta will have fusion hands gogeta will have a base and ssb head and there will be an event exclusive of fusion reborn gogeta which will just have the ssj head bandai might pull some shit and give classic gogeta the fusion hands exclusively
  yes mostly because of the movie rereleases
  not him but still supposed to olive  not that i care
    jackets have multiple layers you guys
  thats 2 different outfits
  not sure if this is the best or worst comment ive seen for a while
  you realize the pants are different and therefore a different outfit overall
  plus it takes away from gotenks  good
    the actual color of the rip in the actual picture youre posting is grey you fucking chowderheads
    why not this one first 
the screaming fade looks fine on shishioh dumb faggets
  you can hate gotenks but hes still going to win db figuart of the year
  shouldnt be able to because not the same height  why is one guy crunching to the side a bit more than other not work
  not the same height so they cant fuse    holy fuck it toriyama with the real facts
  goku and vegeta are not the same height    no need to spread misinformation bro what kind of fucking jabroni are ya
  bruh did you have any doubt about goku and vegeta winnign at any point
  fuck a base head gib ssj for those janemba vibes      god i would love if the new ssbs came with god heads it would be so simple
  i really wish that silly caveat wasnt real
do you guys talk about the statue figs in here or nah banpresto etc
  fuckoff statuefag
  i have the trunks statue where hes jumping and its gorgeous i wont report you but you better buy some sh
  dismissing the entire metamoran race
  since when does fusion require the individuals to be the same height trunks is also taller than goten so it cant apply
  nope read the rules
does this mean were getting a pre order date on saturday
  yeah probably
  dis wa sa sexy statue
  statue    new here
  wait does this mean broly is a regular release
  been awhile since ive had to camp for a preorder so will this go live around 4 am friday in the us
  no i collect sh im just saying that one specific statue is a very nice one that i keep on my desk its a very specific level dynamic
  amiami normally does midnight how do hou get webshops exclsuvies
10 off toys on ebay right now just picked up yamcha
statues look like collectables and figures look like kids toys    t my gf
  i dont care as long as we go do things    t my gf
  no way youre displaying these in our apartment    t my gf
  kek    im thankful my gfs stipulation was none in the bedroom my personal stipulation is only 1 dedicated shelf
  no way youre displaying these in our apartment  anon i dont care how much you love a woman never compromise never settle
  im sorry i hit you when i was mad i promise it wont happen again and ill buy you that broly figure and those enkei wheels youve always wanted    t my gf
  damm he looks awful why the fuck they made the skin so shiny like plastic
  because artist today cant draw on paper paper and do cell paper frames instead they use shitty computer paint coloring
  you mean an stylistic choice by the character designer at the time you retarded fuck
  pussy whipped as fuck
    he has the best theme in all of db  
gogeta 5500 jpy april 2019  vegeta blue 5500 jpy may 2019  broly 7800 jpy april 2019
  might pass on broly but get gogeta based on what he comes with
  retail releases or pbandai
  vegeta blue 5500 jpy may 2019  forgot to mention that its an exclusive
    still no pre order date shit
  gigolo  brocolli are regular
  lol
    i appreciate them for trying but its terrible    son of a fuck i just wanted a good vegeta  also gogeta comes only with blue heads i guess considering hes marketed as super saiyan god super saiyan gogeta
  yeah not the best stop motion but its a nice touch
    its nostalgic reminds me of the 90s american irwin toys commercials
    monkeys paw    fuck this gay blue world
  being this much of a fag   no name funimation composer over based kikuchi    
    ayt least its better than showing some fat hairy otaku hands holding those figures  playing them like a murrican manchild does
  fair point
  ah yes an actually cultured db fan in this thread a rare sight
  i feel you im so tired of 1 issue ruining my interest of purchasing a release  want majin vegeta  the one face i wanted the most is misprinted on all figures  want vegito blue  10 body and gloves still have fingernails on them  want gogeta  its super saiyan blue  i wanna die
  i think it is pretty obvious that theyll do a movie 12 gogeta probably for sdcc or something next year    its certainly the one i would rather have too but
  to be fair you dont know yet if gogeta has a base or super saiyan head option super saiyan trunks came with a base head so gogeta may as well
  lol agreed im so sick of blue hair figures
  i think it is pretty obvious that theyll do a movie 12 gogeta probably for sdcc or something next year  im actually hoping for this instead of a ss head included with the april release that way i can have a ssb gogeta with the yellow trim vest and a ss gogeta with the orange trim vest
  so is broly gogeta and 21 releasing in april or did 21 get cucked by gogeta
  21 got cucked
  april is going to be lovely
april is going to be fucking expensive oh well at least ill get a bunch out of the way instead of waiting all year fucking web exclusive vegeta though is not cool
god im so glad gogeta is happening late enough to be an updated body no way they dont do og colors as an exclusive down the line would really be the best of both worlds
if anyone wanted to know krillin is releasing the 14
    how will you feel when figuarts 30 comes out
  when does goku ssb come out
  same vest design as gotenks  oh no even though gotenks chest paint looked like absolute dog shit bandai is just going to repeat the same mistake arent they its cheaper to do that way and i highly doubt theyll do anything about it since this isnt kamen rider and therefore they dont give a fuck
  why cant you follow rules
  genuine question where can they continue to improve they fixed the issue with the knees the shoulders could use a bit more tinkering with the pelvis area is still in need of more fixing
  i just hope they dont start doing hot toys style rubber skin bodies like bandai teased a while back that sounds awful
  he hasnt been given a release date yet i would thonk in june though
  cry harder bitch boy
  isnt dragon ball right up there with kamen rider sales wise i always thought dragon ball and kamen rider were the most popular lines tamashii makes
so with all these new announcements who else is still on your wish list  piccolo 20  ultimate gohan 20  merged zamasu  17 super  ginyu force  i think everyone else i really wanted has already been announced or released
  piccolo 20  raditz  future gohan  final form cooler  dabura
  king piccolo and i guess kid buu thats it wouldnt mind cooler and janemba but i doubt that once super buu and gogeta/broly get here im not sure anymore really no one to really look forward to for me
  heck all your picks are solid throw in a krillin 20 and a videl and id be satisfied
    i just want good representatives from the main fight of each saga so far thats been good but we need updated androids future trunks and more movie things
  videl  thinking of her makes me depressed she had such potential to be a true z fighter maybe not android 18 tier but still enough to make a difference like roshi and krillin i would get her just to pretend that she ending up being one of the boys and fighting along side them being the brains/strategist of the group
gogeta is already confirmed to come with normal and ssb hair pieces    so yeah dont expect a super saiyan gogeta until july unless demoniacal fit has other plans
is kamen rider really that big in japan    if so why    i just checked out what it was and it seemed kind of gay
  wrong thread  you want the toku thread  you are in the shirtless men yelling at each other thread
  piccolo 20 and merged zamasu for sure  but also 1st form cell and frieza and mercenary tao
  right she was pretty powerful for a human learning how to fly that quick and all i dont think she would be the brains though
  piccolo 20 and 17/18 20 id take top versions of 17 and 18 id also love the world tournament announcer and mr popo but those will never happen
  the difference is japanese collectors are much more discerning and generally expect a higher level of quality kamen rider is primarily aimed at japanese collectors db stuff is primarily aimed at americans where it outsells japan by a huge margin    this is why bandai gets away with doing lots of lazy shit with the db line that they couldnt get away with for kamen rider      yes it is
  id watch a miniseries with her and gohan fighting crime
  superheros are cool
  you
  this is why bandai gets away with doing lots of lazy shit with the db line that they couldnt get away with for kamen rider  the original shf dbz line flopped hard in japan and america saved it there has been improvements but lets not pretend the line is without flaws shf one piece flopped and died for the same reasons but it didnt get an american bail out instead it transformed into variable action heroes which finally gave fans what they wanted to some degree minus the truly awful qc in that line
  genuine question where can they continue to improve  they could start giving them good paint jobs and shading like the older releases off the top of my head they could also touch up some of the more meh releases like gotenks or majin vegeta i said this before but i can see them doing a shfss equivalent for the dragon ball figures a few years from now
  height    gotenksfags aside i wonder how their gonna explain when they had the time to learn the dance i can see vegeta conceding in temporarily fusing for the good of the universe    but ultimately i think we all stopped caring about canon at this point    implying dbs was/will ever be canon
  niggas sleepn on low cut neck vegeta
  theyre fucking crazy if they think were buying ssb vegeta or goku now
new thread 
  ha did you get that off instagram or some spic fb group
  top 10 would be    17 dbs  janemba  pink outfit bulma  merged zamasu  bardock  18 any other relevant design  videl  cooler  trunks 20  hit

elizabeth bathory

jeanne darc alter poche
medical extra bodies or clothes sets
tentative future extra sets
  police uniform  i need this  for scientific purposes
  5th birthday  holy shit cupoches have been around for that long it feels like theyre still just getting started too bad theres been a lot of lost potential in this line
  i dont recognize the sailor
  8888  quads checked  i guess that she is a new character that will be revvealed in the future
  this is probably because of low amount of figures  very slow start i think they started friends line when the series already existed for 15 years     anyway fox poches are great especially the black one
  anyway fox poches are great especially both  ftfy    and yeah they had a slow start and i think that gsc in their first 5 years with the nendo line didnt release that many figures in that time but koto needs to speed up a bit too
  and i think that gsc in their first 5 years with the nendo line didnt release that many figures in that time  by february 2011 nendoroids 5th anniversary gsc had released 164 nendos so way more than the current amount of cupoches and with less ocs its a shame i really like this line and want more figures of characters that i know but with their turtle releases and gscs new doll line it just seems pointless to me
  and gscs new doll line it just seems pointless to me  that depends on if you like the fucking awful proportions of the nendo dolls to me they look like a regular person wearing one of these huge mascot heads i cant unsee how unholy they look with their tiny feets and hands  the nude bodys pelvis area looks bad i get that is to give a good range of articulation but you cant have a desent looking swinsuit body with how that body looks
  it looks like me when i lost lots of pounds haha
zombieland saga poches please
      is that akagi and kaga from azur lane
itll never happen in a million years but you knoe who needs a cupoche
  i dont see how ocs are a bad thing they are really cute characters and because theyre are popular amongs fans is the reason why koto have keep doing them but i agree in that koto need to speed up in their releases my guess is that they have concentrated their release effort towards the frame arms girl and megami device line as there are really popular line among plamofags and shinkifags that now have something to hype about and not beating a dead horse toyline like busou shinki that have been dead for a long time        cute        koto is having a poll right now to decide which of these designs will do next you can vote here        this poll will be open for a limited time so hurry up and make your choice
  they are original characters black kitsune  white kitsune but yeah they look a lot like the akagi/kaga version from azur lane but the funny thing is that you can give some weapons from kotos msg line and pretend they actually are akagi and kaga        nice gallery maybe koto will release in the future an artbook with all these illustrations
  especially since kaga also wears a kitsune mask on the side of her head and akagi has that red eyeshadow i guess some tropes never die
one piece thread    who else are you hoping gets a figure
  statueshit isnt allowed here only jointshit    unfortunately the only jointshit one piece line is now dead also it was shit
  that aint a statue you fucking idiot put your glasses on before you browse
  im tempted but id rather wait for them to make a perona figure first    this actually is a figure its one of those 1/6 seamless bodies
  inb4 someone btfos you
    fuck
  wrong all accounts seemless 1/6 scale and vah was a great line you were probably too poor to buy vahs anyways so you bought the shitty china kos and that is what you set the standards on
just bought this super guy to go with my vah
      damn thats kinda cool though ive heard bad things about those rubber bodies deteriorating fast
  i was really hoping vah would make a blackbeard/fujitora the latter especially
  vah had such shitty qc i had to buy two of each figure i wanted just to get one decent one
  thats a really lewd outfit  i like it
i want a vivi
  all of mine were fine only one joint was a little loose but they diffidently got better with more releases
this is blasphemy this is madness
all i ever wanted was a pre timeskip franky and brook that could scale with my vahs
i want the 3 admirals
  1/6 action figure  1/6  action  bbut it is articulate  hot toys shit
  yes anon action figures can be 1/6 scale
  how much for that fig
  poorfag
  160
so wait a second this figure is inone piece 
  yes shes from the dress rosa arc
  no cast off no cash
what a shitty character to start a line off of     also why the fuck do we still have no good 1/12 figures when the market is so big right now
  because scale doesnt matter except to poorfags
i just want a vah brook and franky to complete my crew why is life so unfair
the joke      
a thread for barbie dolls disney dolls and any dolls that arent bjd    old thread 
still waiting for the new wreck it ralph 2 princes set to hit my local disney store
holiday anna and elsa set is out again for christmas got the the set plus holiday kristoff last year for around 3 cash a whole lot of work and imagination
im not into toys but my waifu had a doll of her released and now im so charmed i want to dress her up and sit her on my desk to be with me  how do i make this horrible feeling go away
  fap
  movie comes out next week maybe theyll get it around then
  my waifu had a doll of her released and now im so charmed  whos your waifu   if shes not pricy you should just buy her and put her on your desk whats the big deal     how do i make this horrible feeling go away  why would you want to make it go away do you live with someone who would shame you for it
  any update on this
  i mean you already admit to having a waifu people collect figures and funkoshits of their favorite characters all the time what harm is their in collecting a doll of a character you like
  theyre not even bothering to hide the lesbian incest subtext anymore
  yes my family is very confrontational and judgmental    i just dont want to indulge it    i want to add that i looked at some reviews and it seems the doll is kind of fragile and now ive lost interest
  just tell us the name of your goddamned waifu
  coraline  i was interested in the neca doll but seems like its kind of fragile
  ive got the original pj coraline for nearly a decade and shes holding up really well like all figures with a bendable wire inside you just gotta be careful not to bend the wire too drastically or else it will break      yes my family is very confrontational and judgmental    oh yeah then be a fucking man and get your damn waifu tell them in no uncertain terms that if they dont like it they can piss off because its none of their business as to what you like christ we got full grown men in this thread openly collecting dolls whove got more balls than you because they dont give a fuck what anybody thinks of their faggy hobby uncuck yourself kid
  how do i make this horrible feeling go away  15 hail marys and a flogging
  back when monster high had its own threads there was a slew of insecure dudes who would come up with elaborate schemes to get their dolls in secret lest some teenage cashier judge them shit was ridiculous
  anymore  implying they ever tried hiding it
  i hope they still have them after black friday im usually tapped out of dolly spending cash by the end of the month
  my family is very confrontational and judgmental  im sorry to hear that unless you have an older bother or sister that you know would probably steal the doll off of your desk or pull prank on you id get it fuck everyone who teases you for liking what few things in life brings you happiness live for yourself and for your own pleasures let them deal with their own mental hang ups about what you should or should not own if you really think it will bring you trouble dont put it out in the open keep the doll in a box and hidden away
  havent seen her in stores and shes not on the website hope we get more info on her soon
  coraline  honestly i wouldnt even consider coraline to be a legit 100 doll she doesnt even have real hair shes more like an action figure of a female character that just happens to have clothing and what clothing she does have doesnt even reflect what a girl would wear since coraline dresses like a tomboy i mean its not like your waifu is ariel or rapunzel get her and keep her in her box at least youll have her and maybe in the future when you stop giving so much of a crap about what others think about you youll have the option to put her on display if you dont buy her now she will go up in price and you will end up paying an arm and a leg for her later
  doesnt even reflect what a girl would wear since coraline dresses like a tomboy  what nothing she wears is tomboyish theyre just regular outfits the most tomboyish thing she wears is the hat
  i remember her having a cranky and jaded personality as if she was always sour about something also to be fair there really isnt anything particularly girly about these outfits here  is there you could put those outfits on a male character and nobody would teas him for dressing like a girl if anything her outfits are sorta genderless
any dolls on your wishlist this holiday season are you going to be gifting any dolls to friends or family this christmas
  a pink sweater with blue jeans  orange and pink pjs   nobody would tease him
  pink accents on the sweater and pajamas   girly hair clip  other outfit is a spangly top with heeled boots  ill give you the slicker but everything else are typical girl clothes
  im not really comfortable asking for dolls from my family since im picky about face screenings any christmas cash i get will usually go into my doll fund though nobody else i know collects toys but i am planning on donating something to a local drive for needy kids
  like all figures with a bendable wire inside you just gotta be careful not to bend the wire too drastically or else it will break  still sounds too awkward to do much with  tell them in no uncertain terms that if they dont like it they can piss off because its none of their business as to what you like  you make it sound like its easy but my family is very agressive and having anything that makes me happy makes me feel vulnerable to their attacks my mom loves to throw my stuff away without out of spite and i know shell try to get rid of the doll    see above    if you dont buy her now she will go up in price and you will end up paying an arm and a leg for her later  but also better models may come out is not likely but ill prefer it          shes a tomboy in the sense she isnt traditionally feminine shes still feminine but not girly its easy to imagine she grew to be a hipster or a bohemian  also if she aged in real time shell be 20 years old now
  you make it sound like its easy but my family is very agressive and having anything that makes me happy makes me feel vulnerable to their attacks my mom loves to throw my stuff away without out of spite and i know shell try to get rid of the doll    are you underage if not move out
  this would be it there are a few things working against me like not having the money for it till next month the movie coming out at the end of the month which will create hype for the dolls like what happened with frozen in 2013 and the end of the month black friday sales if a few box sets survive black friday or they restock i might be able to get it for myself nobody that i know in real life enjoys doll like i do so i wont be gifting any
  speaking of donations does anyone have any suggestions for dolls kids might actually like i know blind box stuff is fairly popular right now but have no idea what will get the most bang for my buck
  i really wouldnt know what middle class children are into now a days really i believe they enjoy those grossly over priced blind box toys like those eggs that hatch if you rub on the egg the only children i interact with are poor kids who cant even talk their parents into buying them used 1 barbie dolls at the thrift store
  the charity is specifically for poor kids and id just like to get something that doesnt suck i used to give monster high dolls back when those were popular and they seemed to go over well
  ill be in a job hunt soon dont worry about me
  i mean it really depends on the kid
  hasbro has some nice playline disney princess dolls the ones with a gimmick though they can be pricey sometimes  most of us here hate lol surprise and blind bag shit but thruth is the brand is really popular among kids right now  piny pon i think thats what theyre called some kind of mixandmatch plastic dolls ive heard some parents actually asking specifically for them at toy stores/sections  those new shoppies lil secrets dolls a la polly pocket  i guess anything with vanellope will be popular for holliday shopping  miraculous ladybug dolls however only lb/marinette dolls seems the ones to be selling  some really young kids like fur real there are cheaper toys with less interaction and actions than the annual big animatronic  i guess jojo siwa is popular right now im not sure her dolls are though  the poopsie unicorns seem to be a hit or miss depending on the childs preferences also the insane price tag    i guess thats basically whats in for kids this year on the doll side
  thanks
  couldnt have made a better list myself if i tried nice job
  great list i second everything on here i dont have any interaction with children but the hairdorables seem really popular with all the adult reviewers i follow i guess it depends on the specific kid and if they watch youtube / social media but the dolls are advertised on there a lot plus i think theyre pretty cute and they cost the same as a lol surprise
  good list anon used to work at the toy store myself til earlier this year and from the ones that arent new a few of those i dont recognize that sounds about right lol surprise dolls and shopkins were absolutely the top 2 that girls gravitated towards and i got the most questions about jojo bows were super popular as well i dont think the dolls were though my little pony was pretty popular too blind bag items are definitely the big thing kids seem to like so unfortunately a lot of toys are getting marketed that way    barbies surprisingly never sold much until the holidays kinda the same with the disney dolls we had monster high and enchanted for a little bit but the shelf got smaller til they got clearanced out and gone for good i got a couple of their mh dolls for cheap when that happened so that was nice      the hairdorables are at least kinda cute the unicorn one is especially nice the lol dolls look really weird so besides the blind bag bit i dont get their appeal
  youre welcome          thanks oh yeah i forgot about hairdorables i guess as anon said it depends if the kid watches yt since theyre on early steps while lol already has a lot of side merch like clothes and party supplies  the mlp hype seems to be dying already im not sure if the show is still running might be because of that or most likely the kids who used to watch it already grew up and the next generation is too late to catch up but theres always that one kid who is obssesed with horses
is isi dawndancer anywhere available for a reasonable price
  shes by mattel price will be 3995 no release date yet
  the mlp hype seems to be dying already im not sure if the show is still running    horsefucker reporting in yes the show is still running theres about one more season to go plus a finale movie in the works then its on to g5 theres already been leaks of g5 art which is not good its a common agreement that the pone ride is finally ending at last weather thats a good or bad thing is a mixed bag
  damn i didnt realize she went up so much in price
leak of the mary poppins 17 le
  pleasantly surprised there is no manjaw mump face but    emily blunt  not julie andrews  no go for me
  i would kill a man for a no manjaw doll of julie andrews mary poppins in her coat outfit
  im really surprised by how cute she is wish julie andrews had something comparable for her mary
    theyre not julie andrews but iirc they did some nice dolls for the broadway mary poppins
  i dont want a 17 of some middle age actress i dont even know about wish this was julie andrews
  they dont have the rights to make a julie andrews mary poppins doll right now and even if they did julie wouldnt go for it because she said she doesnt want to overshadow emily in any way
  doesnt want to overshadow emily in any way  the film looks generic soulless and totally by the numbers  i also dont even know who emily is ive seen her face here and there but ive never actually seen a show or movie thats shes in why would i want to pay over 100 for a large doll of her
  the film looks generic soulless and totally by the numbers    thats an opinion you can have its not everyones opinion     i also dont even know who emily is ive seen her face here and there but ive never actually seen a show or movie thats shes in why would i want to pay over 100 for a large doll of her    no one said you had to buy it the people that are going to buy it are people that enjoy the actress the character and/or the film
  they dont have the rights to make a julie andrews mary poppins doll right now  this is almost as devastatingly heartbreaking to lean as when i found out julie andrews did a random nude scene in some old movie until that point i had always viewed her as a larger than life respectable elegant and classy british woman totally image crushing moment for me its a good thing i didnt grow up watching mary poppins as a child i did enjoy her in the princess diaries though i wish we could get dolls from that movie
  wish we could get dolls from that movie    tonner did a line just the one julie/queen doll though
so this youtuber who usually only reviews disney doll is starting to review these large anime type dolls called smart dolls at first i thought it meant that they did something or were little animatronic dolls but they seem to be just large pricy dolls from japan with generic anime charcter faces he says they are expensive but as usual never ever actually mentions the price during the video he made this big disclaimer video today in his new little mermaid boat set review that he doesnt get payed to plug dolls because a lot of people in the comments have been calling him out on it but his new smart doll videos really do come off as sponsored videos since he lists the creators youtube channel website and gushes over them anyone have an honest opinion on these dolls or their price    
  wish some company would have done more dolls of the actors in the film like anne hathaway erik von detten mandy moore and heather matarazzo
  tonner did one of mia i think these were the only 2 dolls in the line
  theres zero chance hes getting the disney store dolls for free maaaaybe some of the mattel dolls but most of his disney doll reviews are disney store and/or le or theyre older mattel tyco etc stuff most of which hes purchased months or years after the original release     but the anime doll reviews do sound a bit like promo videos from my perspective as someone who has speckled in bland positive reviews after getting stuff for free in between genuine revies though i didnt hide it and had a big got this from the company in exchange for a review on top just hits certain marks like listing the youtube channel and linking to the product describing the doll character in the description even the video length and the way the video is shot in comparison to the others seems promoy to me    at the same time checking out that smart doll creators instagram page its got a ton of followers the posts all have thousands of likes the dolls are in demand etc so does he really need a primarily disney blogger to spread the word enough that they gift him a what 500 doll     it could be something similar to what the chinese wigisfashion shop does or at least did at some point if you posted a review with a link to the shop and shared it with them you got a 15 or 20 discount code
  the dude mentions the price like twice in this video anon seems nice enough i guess seems basically like an animu vinyl bjd
  i watched his first video in full this morning and he didnt bring it up ive only watched the first few mins of the video i linked to but since he usually never goes into price details i figured his second video wouldnt mention it either it is a nice looking doll
  smart doll    these dolls are basically a dollfie dream knockoff created by danny choo hes the son of famous shoe designer jimmy choo danny was a long time fan of dd dolls but he wanted to take them to the next level by having them move their limbs blink etc with animatronics so he borrowed some of daddys money to start a doll company to make his doll waifu mirai the main doll is literally his oc waifu she even has her own figma behold the power of weeaboos with connections    so long story short danny got his doll company started but the animatronic gimmick was quickly dropped at best theres an optional 170 torso part that has a usb hub in it dumb  expensive also the dolls come in basketballamerican brown and theres a bishie male doll as well    but yeah id rather stick to volks dolffie dreams
    your basic smart doll will run you about 500 a dollfie dream will run you anywhere from 300500 depending how fancy you want her
  id like her coat outfit or the white supercalifragilisticexpialidocious outfit
    
new barbie shower set
    mmmm yeah babs you take off that spaghetti strap towel and wash up youre a dirty girl arent you
  its cute i guess but what a small space to shower in even normal size barbie wouldnt be able to move around in there i can only imagine how funny it would look if someone plopped a fat curvy nubarbie in there the doll probably wouldnt even fit between the pink wall and glass the doll itself is a let down as always no rubber click knees very light weight and feels cheep when you hold it these sets usually run for around 20 to 2699 for that price why dont they offer a nicer quality barbie doll
  its sad to see how the quality of these bathroom sets have degraded over time here are a few way better sets
  so much to doo in the bathroom
    honestly the 90s and 80s sets look better on the box than the actual product i was super disappointed with the sets i picked up last year aside from the pain in the ass of putting them together they definitely have a cobbled together at ikea look but with a shitty monotone pink shade
loft bed set
  even one of their new recent cheapo showers looked better than this thing
    i had this one but it was pink and it came with more stuff it must have been a recolor set done in the 80s no surprise as i see lots of stuff in these bathroom sets being recycled
  includes liquid soap cented with real barbie fragrance  real barbie fragrance  so this set allowed you to finally find out what the real barbie smells like if she was a real girl   imagine the smell     90s barbies were just on another level when it came to creativity   
  i was super disappointed with the sets i picked up last year  which set did you pick up last year  they definitely have a cobbled together at ikea look  you mean when you put it together it didnt look like the image on the box some of these sets are kinda pricy on ebay but ive been thinking of pinking one up should i not
  when you see it youll shit bricks
  theses are like shopkins shoppies without the molded on plastic tops
  not my pic but i bought the i can do kitchen from the 90s sweet shoppe food court laundry set a few of the accessory sets    this is all just my opinion of them im sure plenty of people love them    for me the problem with the 90s sets and to a lesser extent some of the 80s sets is that the bones of the furniture are primarily made of this cheap feeling plastic that come in single very unfurnituresque shades think valley meets unforgiving acid shades its all unassembled which isnt inherently a problem just about any detail that isnt that monotone plastic is a sticker which even if applied perfectly just looks cheap and sometimes the details or even entire features are made from printed cardboard that you have to fold perfectly right the first time or your furniture will forever have a shitty crease sometimes this cardboard can literally not be made to look like the image on the box but even if you manage to fold it right cheap cardboard on cheap plastic just doesnt look good    its hard to explain but on the box the shades are more subdued and of course every sticker is perfectly applied plus the boxes featuring entire scenes complete with 90s dolls makes them seem less ott its just too garish and cheap looking to me     feature wise a lot of them have fun themes for doll sets laundry travel agent post office just the execution isnt to my liking i wouldnt say dont get them just look for photos of the actual sets out of the box before buying one to see what youre getting
  
  i remember my younger sister having if not this then at least something very similar to this set for her barbie house when we were kids
  is that igor from young frankenstein  i forgot they made toys for that movie
  this is great because it prepares little girls for the size of shower they can look forward to when they grow up and rent a tiny apartment        vintage barbie was so much more aspirational and bougie than millenial barbie      is barbie hitler saluting legendary photo
so now that 4chan is officially splitting the site in two by sending all blue boards like /toy/ off to some new ad friendly website called 4channel where they will more than likely force you to eventually create accounts to post will you guys migrate over there or leave
  create accounts why the whole appeal to 4chan was the anonymous nature of thr user base no identity we were just anonymous hiro trying to turn 4chan into some ad friendly site is going to kill the point of 4chan 4chan is nsfw it is offensive thats the ehole point of the shit hole
  4chan is nsfw it is offensive thats the ehole point of the shit hole  the new site that will host /toy/ will probably be heavily moderated for language and content all discussion threads about these changes are being mass deleted on both blue and red boards they dont want people talking about it i for reasons
  shes up at the disney store now im really happy i was wrong about the molded on clothes
  i dont ask people for specific presents sometimes i get barbies though    im giving my cousins daughter a barbie set she wanted and their older daughter an elphaba barbie since she loves the show
  release date december 15
    theres going to be pocket smart doll aka 1/6 version so im pretty excited about that          and this is why i moved to collecting liccachan          well i did thought about opening toy board on the chan board that must not be named hereif anyone would like to let me know
  and this is why i moved to collecting liccachan    liccachan sets are bad though arent they
degenerate here  i came looking for this thread because i was curious if any of you all have experience modifying barbies/fashion dolls    i was thinking about cutting up a plus sized barbie and reassembling her with more joints and poseability i was also thinking of making her more anatomically accurate by giving her nipples/labia is there a means of making them more shapely like some material i can use to give her bigger breasts hips thighs and ass
  i never got one personally yet it very much deepened on each set specifically still way better than the current average barbie sets
  if they ask why you have a coraline doll just say something along the lines of it was a good movie suck my cock lol    theres no need to tell anyone its your waifu just say you liked the movie it wasnt even particularly girly
  im considering getting america chavez because the 2017 comics made me laugh like an idiot i really like her now
  if youre worried about the fragility of her body consider doing a headswap maybe her head would fit on less fragile bodies
hey guys    i found this today at a salvation army    shes a 2014 integrity sheer sensuality vanessa doll shes perfect in box all the contents are still sealed paid 125 australian     also snagged a jakks believix bloom in box for 35
  great find
where are the best places to find mh and eah for cheap for ooak
  that stilted dialogue reminds me of the room  isnt she supposed too be a transmexican from the lesbian dimension
  look at this tuto     she added articulation and gave the doll bigger hips and boobs  hope it helps you
  ive had some decent luck with facebook marketplace
  paid 125  i could be wrong but that seems kinda high for a charity thrift store still i have no info on these dolls or what they actual sell for on sites like ebay so congrats
  degenerate  why is it that most chans that ive visited over the last decade have such a hard on for this word its not the type of word that you bump into often on other fan forums or social media sites ive never even seen the word posted in the comments section of youtube videos where someones committed a horrible crime
  i could be wrong but that seems kinda high for a charity thrift store still i have no info on these dolls or what they actual sell for on sites like ebay so congrats    its integrity toys and so a charity shop person does tend to look up ebay prices to get a more accurate pricing  considering how fucking shitty the aud is to the us dollar and how fucking expensive shipping is anon did a fantastic job at getting a brand new in box it doll for 125 aud
  shes just a lesbian mexican from a lesbian world
  when i grabbed her i was worried i was taking too much of a gamble i confess ive bought her to sell but considering shes worth about 500 im glad i bit the bullet    im saving for an american girl barbie so this will get me a bit closer
  add 10 tax to that now too    putting gst on international purchases is a pain in the arse but good for my business
  what american girl doll are you saving for
      in the 2017 comic i think she was genderfluid or something heres a comic where she gets offended over being called a lady
  in the comic she looks thin but as a doll she looks thiiiick/chubby for some reason         is this a chubby latina fighter doll or a chubby arab fighter doll
  latina and her doll is very muscular not chubby
  so it looks like this fag might be lurking /toy/ as well he basically posted exactly what i said last thread about next years premiere series including the d23 frozen 2pack   might be a coincidence but who knows
  nothing you said was particularly unique and has been said previously by others in the doll community including elsa/anna being a d23 exclusive
  artfag here shes chubs
  6 spots in the designer line 6 nonfrozen princesses left  so theyll probably do these 6 remaining characters in wave 2  anna and elsa 11 le dolls typically treated as separate entities from the disney princess characters and released as exclusives or otherwise outside the line  so theyll probably release anna and elsa in some exclusive way  original concepts do not steal
60th anniversary proudly pink silkstone barbie doll
  so basically if this is what mattel pulled out for their 60th anniversary silkstone barbie im not getting my hopes up for the rest of the 60th anniversary dolls
    yikes
  not american girl anon a vintage american girl barbie    a nice one goes for around 500
  shes not well sculpted enough to be anything but chubby
  almost tacky as the new fashionistas       the head is nice though    im not getting my hopes up for the rest of the 60th anniversary dolls  havent bought barbie since 2015
  makes sense i guess it would definitely explain why i always get a triggered as fuck reply every time i say something unfavorable or unflattering about a brown minority doll in theses threads i used to think that the worst part about his videos was having to look at the ugly hairy moles on his hands now he has ghetto ass tattoos on his wrists as well
  wahhh why cant i call black dolls nignogs without getting called out must be a a doll reviewer i accused of plagiarism for spouting common sense
  i got shit twice for not knowing two of the disney princesses names i called two of them the brave pixar princess and the black frog princess of course the sjws here did give a crap that i failed to remember the brave princesses name but boy did they lose there shit when i forgot the black frog princesses name
  wahhh why cant i call black dolls nignogs without getting called out   nobodies ever talked like that in these threads that i know of  personally would have no reason to use words like the one you just felt the need to share in order to describe a black doll of color those words are not necessary or funny and they certainly do not represent the rest of the 4channel community
  you repeatedly called her the black frog princess for years despite being told her name then even posting images with her name in huge letters you also remembered meridas name but nice try
  moana is not a princess nor is she part of the disney princess canon
  you repeatedly called her the black frog princess for years despite being told her name    so i dont talk about them often its only natural that i would forget even if some triggered sjw felt the need to say her name     you also remembered meridas name but nice try  thats a lie and you sir are a liar i always forget both of their names and here is proof that you are a triggered sjw liar ive been calling her the brave princess for years nice try tho
bought my first integrity doll ever on ebay but the shoulder joint is loose how do i fix it   tulabelle true wonderland line is what the box says
  floor polish apparently
  nor is she part of the disney princess canon  neither are anna or elsa but i guess after wreck it ralph the three of them are officialy disney princesses
  at least her retail price will be about 70 and not 150 like people were saying
2019 busy gal barbie doll reproduction unknown retail price and release date gold label
another mary poppins pic
    i dont think theyre bothering to do the coronation thing anymore to make them official i mean we all know theyre trying to build a multicultural roster as it is im just glad theyre finally actually using other cultures mythology instead of bland retelling of germanic ones
  shes a space mexican hence the last name chavez we dont have arabs in the land of the free
  i think shes really cute apart from the gloves the outfit could really use more detail though
  the fuck is the disney princess canon    also moana is the daughter of her tribes chief that makes her more of a princess than say mulan
  im hoping for an african princess soon a real african princess not african american like tiana or maybe an inca/aztec elena of avalor is a sucky mexican princess
  whats under the hoodie
  raging homolust and hatred for cis white males
  is it the same body as squirrel girl
  i think squirrel girl is shorter and fatter
  no squirrel girl is smaller shorter and more like a curvy barbie
i really wanna see this hairstyle on more black fashion dolls hair beads are severely underrated
  princesses who have had the coronation ceremony and are included in the official line up
bratz dolls are out 4999 amazon exclusive what a mess
  remember those dark times during the 00s were disney was being severely raped in the ass by dreamworks and the doll market consisted of bratz and barbie  disney tried to survive by creating the disney princess franchise which included snow white cinderella aurora ariel belle  jasmin   they released dolls and merch with these 6  after a decent success they released some dvds which included music videos where other disney girls made an appeareance tinkerbell alice mulan pocahontas esmeralda and megara there were some toddler dolls of alice tink mulan and pocahontas but in the end only the last two gained an official place in the franchise leaving all the others out  time passed and the princess and the frog was released tiana actually had a small coronation but no one actually cared her merch was still marketed as the princess and the frog when punzie came to the game because of her big success she had a huge ass coronation in uk or something and it was then when the started releasingg disney princcess merch with both tiana and punzie   then merida appeared she had a smaller celebration because honestly she shouldnt be in the franchise since shes pixar and the movie is literal garbage but anyway  then frozen was released and we all know the autism it caused the success was so huge that disney decided that frozen will bbe a franchise by itself and that anna and elsa wouldnt be joining the disney princess anytime soon  then they announced their new princess moana so everyone assumed shell be the 12th princess but there was no coronation  now with the wreck it ralph situation it seems that anna elsa and moana are part of the franchise despite not having a coronation
  for 50 dollars i at least expect the dolls to have actual shoes and not the stupid pop on shoes
  they alredy tried that in 2013 and it was disgusting
  brave is literal garbage  it has the best disney character of all movies the witch who solves every problem with bears    she should be the disney princess desu way cooler than mershita
  i sort of like the slutty secretary
  the fresh dolls have some
  was pretty good with bratzillaz
  is there any way to buy the individual dolls i want mulan rapunzel pocahontas and all but i dont want to spend so much on all of them together
does anyone know of any dolls for non rape prices for a casual collector im particularly looking for asian style dolls in that they look asian the most im willing to spend is maybe 40 or 60
  the chinese kurhn doll
  cute but not entirely what i meant i dont necessarily mean traditional asian get ups and what not i just mean the doll itself is asian and well made
  i wish there was anon they might sell them separately in the future but i doubt it odds are that as soon as ralph breaks the internet  leaves theaters so will the box set and as of right now the only way you can get them is by buying the 100 box set
  i want mulan rapunzel pocahontas  if they would have given us the option of buying them separately i would have gotten rapunzel snow white cinderella and ariel
  jesus the price is already steep for me its gonna skyrocket      ahh yeah i forgot to say snow white we got the same last name yo im not a huge fan of the animation i just like her design and fan art of her
  where can you buy the box set
  no it wasnt shoes were repetitive their feet looked like tamales hips were loose as fuck and their legs were as wobbly as jelly which made the stands useless
  at least they have a second outfit but id rather buy up 50 of old dolls on feebay
  4999 in us  4999 in uk  they can fuck right off 50 is 39 when converted the uk are paying 64 per doll which is outrageous
  disney store or parks
  kurhn is probably the best bet not all of her dolls have vaguely traditional looking clothes
  licca bijou should be good option they cost around 40
  love everyhting except for that disgusting shirt/dress
theyre adding draco to the harry potter line
  nifty hope luna is in the works too
  harrys getting a quidditch doll too
  enough kids to recreate boku no pico with dolls  noice
  as a big licca fan the sets were a lot better pre2000s they arent any better now they do try to recreate older versions of sets but all in this annoying pink color a lot of licca collectors like her because shes consistently looked cute and simple not too much but id never buy a new set
  im loving that little quilt
  i hope he comes with his standard uniform not going to match the others
  my second hairdorable im happy and done collecting
  but all in this annoying pink color  sounds like barbie in the 90s    that old licca playset use vinylits like how diecast action figures disappeared from playline from which year is that blue playset
  this
  he doesnt the doll is part of a quiddith series     im assuming well eventually get robe draco
  1970s i believe
  i really want a vintage licca maybe a gen 3 since a gen 1 is too expensive other than that the rest of the barbie collaboration clothingcause the new ones fit licca and skipper so damn well
  like diecast robotssigh      imho gen 3 licca is the best shes great mix between cute and pretty have old school shoujo aesthetic and nice body proportions
does anyone have any recommendations for barbie or barbiesized dolls in 1950sesque outfits
anyone know where i can get a pure neemo white flection m ll bust body online
image of the saks le cinderella regular version
  oh i totally agree im cheap i need to buy one at some point  i think she looks great next to wataru  out of all licca friends i want him
does licca castle have any release schedule for the repro liccas i dont think i have ever seen a live listing for one on the website but fresh ones show up secondhand for 100 so they obviously still make them i assume its like volks and they make their most desirable products only available at events
whatever anon was talking about smart dolls and how david choo is probably paying that youtuber to review them myfroggystuff recently got two smart dolls and her channel is kind of all about affordable dolls excluding special releases im pretty sure he may be sending them to doll youtubers to plug
  shes always said in the past when shes gotten stuff for free from the company i dont see why shed lie now
heads up if you wanted to get the wreck it ralph princess set tonight is the time to do it    shipping is free at shopdisney until 4 pm pt with the code freeship    you can get 20 off orders 75 or 25 off orders 100 doll set is 9995 so add something cheap i guess with the code cyber ends tonight
  that and dolls of them in their teenaged years heres hoping for a yule ball hermione
  already sold out bummer
  its ok mmdisneywhatever dont try to clean your reputation with us just next time you try to shove your weabo shit down your followers throats make sure to tell them its a commercial
  thanks for the heads up anon couldnt buy it with my my 25 or 20 off coupons because my local store didnt have it and they expired i was going to pick it up tomorrow in person with my 15 off coupon but when i called my store i was told only three sets were left and that a scalper was on his way to buy them all he tried to get them to put all three sets on hold for him but was told they could only hold one for him i basically had to hop in the car and try to beat the scalper to the store i was only able to get 10 off but on the bright side i did get to chose from over three different sets and i picked out the one that looked the best
  anon idk who that youtuber is i was just bummed that froggy got them even if she did buy them theyre kind of unusual for her especially her audience i subbed to her for mostly playline dolls not expensive wet dream material
  as for the dolls i knew they were mini dolls but they are way smaller than i imagined they would be considering how small they are im amazed at how cute and detailed they are im a really big fan of the first film so much so that i own in on 3d blu ray but i have no plans to see the new one any time soon i heard it sucked hard   i read that they turned the ralphs character into a bumbling dependent man child whereas in the first film he was just a maligned lonely man with nothing to lose looking to finally make a change for himself that sounds like a totally different character
  severus snape when
  they also messed up vanellopes character     original film  rejects the idea of being a girly princess   declares herself the first madam president of sugar rush instead     new film  quits her job and walks out on everyone as soon as she starts getting board of her job and her responsibilities   openly accepts that she really is just a princess and even sings a princess song  jumps from one racer game to another in order to find fulfillment  wonder womans voice tells her she should stop thinking of others and should just follow her heart and do what ever she wants   bravo disney
  thinking he goes here    just like you thought hey theyll prbably have the remaining 6 disney princesses in the next part of the designer line was copyrighted idea do not steal huh
  hopefully soon   i want one so bad snape truly is the real hero in all those harry potter films
  very dramatic
  sorry anon _
  thats a different anon sweetie
  its clearly a knockoff
  never quit your job even if you hate it and youre not happy anymore  taffyta is the one that calls her a princess to which vanellope replies that despite being a princess like taffyta said she still should only see he as a friend  vanellope had to announce herself as a princess to blend in because fuckin cinderella was about to stab her with a broken glass slipper  princess song with explosions sharks eating dogs and robbbers punching each other yup a princess song not a parody nor satire  shank tells her that she should choose her own dreams not ralph never said to not care about anyone anymore  sorry no
      theres already a few but they cost a ton
  omg who do you ship him with
  i got her today she is so beautiful
  the second movie pretty much says turbo did nothing wrong
  if you followed her instagram shes been talking about getting a smartdoll for over a year shes also gotten hate for customising pullips and other japanese dolls back in 2010 and has kept quiet about her interest in them because of it but i guess smart dolls are her testing the waters of doing more expensive dolls again
lol hairgoals are probably the best series out of the lot why they didnt decide on rooted hair before is beyond me because these look adorable
  snow bunny and dancing diva are possibly the cutest out of the bunch imo
  not really turbo stayed in other games past the arcades opening hour   slaughter race would be a different matter since its an online game and new content is constantly added
  i never understood the hype around dolls with brushable hair it always gets messy and ugly after a while    is it still profitable to buy big crates of lol dolls and sell the dolls individually
  never quit your job even if you hate it and youre not happy anymore  not when youre the ruler of the land and your loyal subjects depend on you no  taffyta is the one that calls her a princess to which vanellope replies  doesnt change the fact that she is the true and rightful princess of sugar rush and has an obligation to her people   because fuckin cinderella was about to stab her with a broken glass slipper  thats just a joke you man baby grow up did cgi nucinderella hurt your childhood besides if vanellope did feel like she was in danger she could have just glitched out of the room just as quickly as she glitched herself into the room she didnt have to go along with the idea that she was a princess to save her skin she did so because a part of her wanted to be a princess   princess song with explosions sharks eating dogs and robbbers punching each other yup a princess song not a parody nor satire  ok ill give you that it was a hardcore butch feminists wet dream of what a modern day princess song should be nevertheless she still sang a princess song  shank tells her that she should choose her own dreams not ralph  so basically what i just said shank told her to think of herself and to not worry about what would make others happy by others of course she meant ralph and her loyal subjects
  loyal subjects depend on you    neither film gave any indication that the citizens of sugar rush depended on vaneloope    doesnt change the fact that she is the true and rightful princess of sugar rush and has an obligation to her people     what obligation again neither film gave any indication that her presence mattered    besides if vanellope did feel like she was in danger she could have just glitched out of the room just as quickly as she glitched herself into the room she didnt have to go along with the idea that she was a princess to save her skin she did so because a part of her wanted to be a princess     why would she glitch back out the door when she knew there were stormtroopers looking for her youre projecting majorly hard here    ok ill give you that it was a hardcore butch feminists wet dream of what a modern day princess song should be nevertheless she still sang a princess song    could you try to project your reddittier incel virginity a little harder i think you could if you tried whining because she sang a parody of a princess song in a film that just made fun of disney princess tropes is just sad     so basically what i just said shank told her to think of herself and to not worry about what would make others happy by others of course she meant ralph and her loyal subjects    shank told her that a real friend wouldnt demand that she give up her dreams for them and that real friends will understand that friendships change and you wont always be physically together which is true though if youre a lonely incel i guess the idea of a woman telling a girl dont give up on your dreams to make someone else happy your male friend will understand would bother you    loyal subjects like tafetta who was trash talking her or the other subjects who didnt give two figs about her being gone
    david bowie barbie  barbie 60th anniversary doll  barbie mythical muse mermaid enchantress  barbie x keith haring collaboration
  im not sure if you mean buying and opening them maybe more adults are getting into lols so maybe if they want to find a specific one  please dont scalp lol dolls and resell them for way more than theyre worth thats a shitty thing to do
  not if you know how to take care of doll hair it doesnt
  thats a shitty thing to do  dont hate the player hate the game
   forgot the first part of my text these are new dolls coming in 2019
  neither film gave any indication that the citizens of sugar rush depended on vaneloope  neither film gave any indication that the ungrateful citizens of sugar rush didnt desperately depend on vaneloope once their memories were restored and she became president     youre projecting majorly hard here  could you try to project your reddittier incel virginity a little harder   if youre a lonely incel i guess the idea of a woman telling a girl  if i could date crazy ramblings from the internet id take that post out for ice cream and neuroticism you might want to turn off that projector of yours before it overheats though    loyal subjects like tafetta who was trash talking her or the other subjects who didnt give two figs about her being gone  sometimes the people you rule over dont always like you see current us president however this doesnt change the fact that youve been given a job to do and have responsibilities you dont just get triggered and quit
  i never understood the hype around dolls with brushable hair  its a pain in the ass if you take them out of the box due to dust even if youre careful while dusting fly away hairs will always pop up i think this is way i like blonde dolls for the most part you cant really notice a little dust on a blonde dolls head dolls with black hair are a pain in the ass just a little dust  and the doll looks like shit from across the room
  neither film gave any indication that the ungrateful citizens of sugar rush didnt desperately depend on vaneloope once their memories were restored and she became president     except both films depicted the characters as 100 fine without her i wont even bother reading the rest of your comment since i know its drivel go warm up your chicken nuggets and head to /co/ if you want to get all incelautistic about disney movies
  any word on what era of bowie
  the game only exists because of its players
  the players are the reason no one can get certain dolls especially mtm  scalping is subhuman behavior
  nope nothing so far
    the game is capitalism scalping is just part of that    do you think stores could turn a profit if they played fair sheesh
  shes so beautiful this is what the disney store doll should have been
  this is what the disney store doll should have been  we didnt even get a 17 le doll release this september what happened i swear if they screw us over with the little mermaid next year by making the 17 le ariel dolls d23 exclusives or by only releasing her as an over priced doll thats only available at saks 5th avenue im going to be majorly pissed off le dolls belong at the disney store not at some highfalutin clothing store      congrats anon was she really priced at around 400
  different person but yeah she was 395
  not gifting dolls to anybody but i am hoping for the princess kakyuu please god dont let me summon the creepy pullip dude pullip shes one of my favorite characters in sailor moon and never gets any merch probably because she shows up near the end of the series where everything is full of wtf     licca i always wanted one of these as a kid but i only ever saw them at toy tokyo expensive japaneseimport toy shop in nyc and we were poor so i couldnt have one im tempted to get one now and again but im worried ill get too into it and wind up with yet another thing i like to collect hahaha
    meh the charcter design similarity is still shit  not sure if doll collectors or disney fans in general are animation pelbs with low standards      if only there was doll company that made lincesed dolls by the exact character desgin  no using of shitty generic doll body and with rotted hairsigh     im tempted to get one now and again but im worried ill get too into it and wind up with yet another thing i like to collect hahaha  what else you collect
  rotted hair    fucking gross
cant wait to see what the disney store film collection live action aladdin doll will look like next year
  honestly think this fan made live action jasmine looks pretty good even if she is in a conservative dress that doesnt show her midriff
  the big bratz lips are a bit much but everything else looks great
  i hope they dont cover up her belly in the new film but since we all know they will i just hope they dont also raise her bodice up to her neck in order to cover her up from head to toe as the new disney parks costume does
  autistic naval anon    please god no i hope they cover her uo just to trigger you
  that cleavage is hardly conservative buddy
  a conservative dress
  i hope they cover her uo just to trigger you  youre mean aladdin is a boys movie and one of the things that most guys remember from the film according to threads on this site is how sexy jasmine was in the cartoon and this is mostly due to her sexy outfit if they cover her up well just have an adventure film without the sexness they already covered up aladdins chest which is a shame whats the point of making a more grown up live action version of a g rated cartoon if the cartoon version is more risky than the live action version
  different times i guess some shit done in the 90s for disney wouldnt fly today esmeralda was poledancing in hunchback if notre dame you can bet that if they do a live action remake that entire scene will be gutted it was easily implied that adult simba and nala fucked during the can you feel the love tonight scene that wont get shown either the list goes on though im sure people got triggered by that stuff then there werent social media lynch mobs that could launch viral hashtag complaints to boycott the company for scenes and such its sad really
    im honestly surprised no one has been reeeing about whitewashing since jasmine is arabic and her new park outfit is clearly european    i guess nowadays most arabs would prefer to see her in a burka though
  aladdin was totally a girls movie
  its sad really  its sad indeed and such a waste of potential
        damn those are some big tits
  im personally not a big fan of tattoos but im sure jafar would approve
    fuck off with your midriff bullshit
    that looks like some guy waiting along the fence at the local home depot
  wouldnt they be made by mattel like all the live action dolls from this year  im wondering if ds will keep doing the princess movie dolls and leave the rest to mattel alhough clara was a princess too
  please stop coming to these threads and shitting them up no one wants you here
    that looks horrible
  as soon as disney stops covering it up in order to be more pc ill be glad to       kek      im wondering if ds will keep doing the princess movie dolls  i really hope so they do excellent work on the outfits       do you honestly think the live action dress will look much better i hope so but im not getting my hopes up
  well went to the walmart in hopes of finding at least one of these every single one was gone  i want to cry theyre way too expensive online
it looks like lularoe is finally shuttering in its honor post lulalewks that you expect to see a barbie doll in someday
i definitely see one of the curvy aa fatshionistas in this one
  they cover her up in literally one aspect the disney ownes parks you giant manbaby
  literally one aspect the disney ownes parks
  literally one
  i can see it now
  i want to cry theyre way too expensive online  im sorry anon ive been there dont lose hope youll find one when you least expect it maybe you can ask for them for christmas or hanukkah
new ariel  eric hasbro wedding doll set with crappy molded on clothing
  i want him here
  who cares the other hasbro merchandide shows her naval its not a blanket ban on merchandise though that you want a literal childrens doll to show her naval so you can masturbate desperately over its plastic bellybutton is disturbing enough      so its a modern redesign not meant to reconstruct any movie outfit
2019 celebration barbie contrary to social media posts if youve seen them shes not an anniversary/barbie 60th anniversary celebration doll shes meant to be similar to the birthday and christmas dolls meant as a gift for friends/family at various events     some more barbie 2019 news    barbie signature toy story barbie doll  glf78  barbie signature astronaut repro barbie doll  fxd49  barbie signature barbie styled by grace coddington doll 1  fxf20  barbie signature barbie styled by grace coddington doll 2  fxf21
  not going to post all the images since theyre shit quality but farming is the new camping a new barbie farm line is coming in 2019 complete with multiple playsets and dolls of varying sizes
  her face and hair is really cute
  did they ever come up with any good schemes  asking for a friend
  yeah it works well i like the heart glasses so i might pick her up for those
  stop being a pussy the cashiers genuinely dont care what youre buying
  what else you collect  got into pullips a few years ago when the human luna one came out because shes another of my favorite characters it took me a while to get over the whole dolls are so girly thing because i still had a bit of that immature tomboy mentality from like high school myth cloths occasionally jojos bizarre adventure figures magical girl shf plushes   got my moms old collection of barbies and gi joes as well as a few of my old favorite barbies from when i was a kid i occasionally get a new one if she really jumps out at me but i dont call myself a serious collector   i also collect art supplies i mean i use them lmao but i dont finish say a set of colored pencils before i get acrylic paints so ive wound up with a bunch    this wouldve been my jam when i was a kid i always loved the dolls that came with animals if theres a set with a cow i might actually get it provided the cow didnt have eyelashes and lipstick or some shit
  would a heart on the forehead be acceptable
  if youre really so ashamed with buying a doll in public then purchase a birthday card with it
  why would anyone spend more money unnecessarily  do you really care that much about what a poor uneducated person with a shitty job think
  anon is a birthday card really so expensive  i personally dont give a fuck and have bought dolls just fine in public im just repeating advice ive heard before
  not sure about 50s but i know poppy parker has a great early/mid 60s look and the dynamite girls have a later 60s/early 70s thing going on if you wanna go to bigger scale gene has a wide variety of 30s/40s maybe into the 50s looks
  because shame
  not going to post all the images since theyre shit quality  the dolls themselves are probably shit quality too
  you sound fun to be around
  the dolls themselves are probably shit quality too  well its modern day mattel so you know its going to be crap   barbie dolls post 2015 are just a step above dollar store dolls they wont even give them rubber click knees anymore only barbies that arent 100 crap today would be the mtm bodies but they always put them in cheap yoga outfits or boring boy outfits like soccer player / baseball player barbie
  boy outfits    grandpa get off the internet
  late replybut smart dolls are also known for having flatter face sculpts compared to dollfie dreams danny choo also kind of made a name for himself in the dollfie dream community as being kind of a weirdo back before smart dolls were even conceptualized
  as someone who used to work at a toy store i really dont care who youre buying the gift for especially around this time of year since people buy gifts for people all the time theres no way to really tell and no one is going to really pry into it unless you bring it up first cashiers just try to get people through the lines since its usually super crowded now makes me happy im not working retail this year seconding the birthday card idea if you really dont want to purchase it by itself but the cashiers honestly dont care if the item is for you or someone else i wouldnt suggest ordering online unless you have to since you cant check dolls for wonky eyes beforehand      im laughing a little because i remember a dude i knew back in high school whose mom didnt let him watch aladdin when he was younger because of jasmines attire im guessing for the products its probably just company laziness on trying to get the top to look right vs just doing a one piece outfit   but seriously youve been posting about it constantly in more than one thread its getting a bit much now we get it you want jasmine to show her midriff either make your own outfit that matches the movie or send your complaint emails to disney and the toy companies that make the jasmine dolls
  theyre kinda overpriced and not as poseable as dollfie dream only get if you want a generic bishoujou with a flat face and huge forehead thats slippery beyond all comprehension     also why do people always do those weird creepy photoshop faces
  sorry i forgot that lgbtq2 girls like to dress up as boys and play baseball too im talking about the majority of girls kiddo
  oh youre a perfect blend of senile shityourpants grandpa and whiny old evangelical preacher from christian summer camp    the women are wearing paaaaants the lawwwwwd is aaaaaaaaangry  honey i need a new diaper
  girls baseball uniform   damn sjws
  well duh women participating in sports is sjw women having jobs is sjw women are sjw no more women
  hes right though that apronshirt all as one piece  thank u next
  pretty girl  baseball uniform   pick one   i mean if it was a sluty halloween baseball uniform costume id get it but the outfit that nubarbie is wearing isnt even trying to be feminine i wont even bother reading the rest of your comment since i know its drivel go grab the carton of ice cream from the fridge and head to tumbler if you want to get all tumblerina about gender identity
  theyre a little late for that
  oh jesus its adorable those big cow eyes the plastic looks sorta cheap unfortunatelyim somewhat glad about this though because now i wont feel compelled to buy this whole set for the animals lol
  when i played baseball we all wore the same uniform and im a girl its kinda unisex   this shit is literally 1940s era and its impractical  why would 2018 barbie wear this
  thinking its okay for women to wear pants is tumblersic now    i dont often advocate for selfeuthanasia but ill make an exception in this case please do so before your autistic rage towards women because you cant get dates makes you flip out elliot rodgers style and you end up hurting people
  its such a waste baseball uniforms are some of the best looking sports uniforms too not too tight not too baggy just right
are you happy now midriffanon
  but its the wrong shade of bluueee
  lol wtf
  hasbro dp already moving to molded on tops  wasnt that what made disney drop mattel in the first place
  mattel had gotten a fair degree worse plus it didnt help that they had their own fairy tale line going against disney princesses
new thread 
  postapoc minifigs  supercool new minidoll parts  sewer babies confirmed irl  pink spaceman    and the cherry on top is all the tourist butthurt were going to see cant wait for this
  naked spaceman with a nasa tattoo on his chest and a helmet made of skin
  looks like the helmets are a new mold
  love it havent bought lego in a long time but i keep up on it and ill definitely get this set id love to get a clean blue guy instead of benny though
  lego is ruining classic space to appeal to zoomers and sjws
  yeah im hoping itll come with some clean parts that busted helmet will bug me so fucking much
  not deeply into lego but ive been meaning for a long time to get another naked spaceman never did figure out what my parents did with all my toys in the early 90s when i went off to college
  i lived to see yellow naked space man return
   is ruining classic space to appeal to zoomers and sjws  what
  there is pink in my set i can not handle this
  all the colors match their jobs pink is shocktrooopers
  pink is the pleasure model
  tourist butthurt
  to be fair trying to appeal to females is a wasted effort as its been proven time and time again that they require a very feminininine product in order for them to get into a toyline   so the traditional lines like the spacemen would sell less for having feminine things in it because little boys and autists are picky like that
  see 
  and a giant tumor on his back
  sewer babies confirmed irl  fuck yes
  one of the main characters is voiced by a black woman and there are a couple of girl power jokes
  to be fair trying to appeal to females is a wasted effort as its been proven time and time again that they require a very feminininine product in order for them to get into a toyline  the friends line is legos secondbest selling line after city it beats out star wars and all the other licensed themes    ops pic is a 10 armybuilder set made for afols
  im gonna buy like 8 of these  im gonna end up with 8 bennys    damn it
  ruining  yeah adding some more suit colors is a really bad thing  i just want the same shit over and over because i have advanced autism
  is this part discontinued
        as of 2010
  apoc minifigs    wait what
  spaceshiiiiiip    wait does his helmet come prebroken like that from the movie
    are the vehicles and robot from a classic space set i swear ive built those exact models before in my life
  its a lego movie 2 set you motherfucker you made me think that space was coming back as a theme i hope your floors are forever scattered with bricks and your shoes are nowhere to be found
  yup
  bricksburg is mad max now
  tell us how you really feel instead of what /tv/ thinks
  a purely npc post
  me too but eh  new headcanon the blue ones are redshirt explorers/soldiers  rank and file redshirts who get almost killed and shitkicked every day  theyre typically beat to hell and their armour is cracked compared to the other squads    plus a naked squad white squad and a new pink squad to hang out with pic related
  its a classic set disguised as an armybuilder disguised as a generic movie tie in
  they better give us the fixed helmet in blue somewhere down the line
im willing to bet they introduced a pink so they can do some kind of voltron/power rangersesque scene in the movie
  its a very feminine product line
  voltron is such a boring design
    i would have rather preferred red as well pink has no place in space colonisation         more suits     its okay to add more colours include the whole palette of light visible to man if you want to but it shouldnt be at the expense of the classical colour palette imo
  still more exciting than most super robots from its era though
    over and over again     this is the first time weve had spacemen in decades and including pink likely means we wont get red or black this isnt autism its not wanting to have to fall on extortionate reselling markets for the classic colours
  nah
  i want the original blue helmet not this broken one
    its not just the helmet though the nasa emblem is worn out too
  i want the original blue helmet not this broken one  so go on bricklink and buy some
  true      true
  i would have rather preferred red as well pink has no place in space colonisation  the point of this movie is that you can mix and match boy lego and girl lego putting a pink spaceman in the set is clearly a step in getting girls to buy the toy soldier army builder space lego set which could only lead to more classic sets so this is a really good thing     suits   its okay to add more colours  but it shouldnt be at the expense of the classical colour palette imo    we get half of the classic colours plus a new one in whats basically a classic space minifigure pack i suspect that if this set does well and theres a strong indication that it will well get a second pack somewhere down the line with the remaining colours red black green and new one or nondamaged blue    if thats the cost for new classic style figure packs fuck it please put a neon pink knight in with my 10 pack with a horse lion knight falcon knight and wolfpack knight
  we already have classic space torsos in new light bley cmf rocket kid and green exosuit
pink fuck off lego
    how do you know which lego themes sell the best i couldnt find any such link online
  good luck on the whole literacy thing
  virgin voltron  chad geta robo
    pink may lead to more profits which will lead to more of the classic colours     well thats kind of a tossup youd need more people who like pink buying the set than people whod otherwise purchase the set not buying it due to the cost of the pink and maybe damaged blue/benny minifigures     hopefully youre right as i would like to have a classic astronaut army     spoilerhey look at it this way if you have an allred collection you can have a cosmonaut army/spoiler
  a wolf pack knight how dare you sir    do you think us joking forest men or cowards hiding behind armor    no    we are a band of brigands and rogues that shall die by the sword before swearing fealty to some false monarch    we are the wolf pack and we hunt the night taking treasure and blood from any lion falcon or dragon we come across
    i hope we see red black and blue released i dont know what all these different color mean though i wouldnt mind seeing orange done to match the miner i dont mind pink being done but whats its rolegirl    white  pilots  red  soldiers/explorers  yellow  scientists  blue  security  black  spies  green  mech pilot  orange  miner  gray  minor  pink  girl
  the pink one is a dude though his name is lenny
    poor guy imagine getting the fucking pink suit lmao
  sex workers in the space brothels on ceres
    maybe pink are doctors like medics they dont seem to have those
  10
  he chose it how dare you insult his sexuality
  999 actually      its cool how you tried to argue something that you didnt have any information about though      how do you know which lego themes sell the best      i think the minidoll stats were from 2017 because according to this the top four selling themes of the first half of 2018 were technic ninjago creator and classic
    actually 999     actually its 1599 dollaridoos sweetums
  you must be using an apple brand device
  thats a good idea now im going to need to build a classic space hospital
id be sorta disappointed if queen whateva isnt voiced by wanda sykes
  actually its 1599 dollaridoos sweetums  ouch sorry i razzed you before
  its a wanda sykes knockoff if it makes you feel any better
  youd need more people who like pink buying the set than people whod otherwise purchase the set not buying it due to the cost of the pink    my big thing is even if the afols are divided i think itll be a hard set to keep in stock at least initially putting us aside the pack is a musthave for kids benny is/was a popular character who was locked away in a 100 spaceship set last time not counting doubledecker couch released way later to remedy that and all of a sudden hes even easier and cheaper to get plus he comes with themed friends plus theres a new pink one so girls and completionists will impulse buy this set as much as boys in theory
  i only ever had one wolf pack guy who came with the glowinthedark ghost set i gave him an openfaced knight helmet when i lost his hood some time back     in my personal headcanon universe the kings knights are all themed after different animals which lego characters and cmfs kind of have done anyway and the sole wolf pack warrior was promoted to a rangerlike forest defender role     and a few years back he got a unit of his own     hes definitely still got the smallest force in the kingdom though so you and me well have to continue to wait
  literally kill yourself lego has been angling for a female audience since before you were born
    implying the paradisa line wasnt made for chadsinwaiting
  naked spaceman with a nasa tattoo on his chest and a helmet made of foreskin
    wait do prices actually inflate in online shops the same way they do on plane tickets and the like or is this like when the price slowly creeps up the numbers then companies bring it back down to the og price on black friday and pretend its discount    im confused bewildered and retarded
                the reds will rise again
    i  was viewing the item in aud whereas  and  were viewing the item in usd
    its better than be the naked one
  screw you for getting my hopes up    this is nothing but lego making an ironic reference    tfw we will never see a rerelease of 6990 monorail  why even live
  can confirm that its 999
  pretty cheap in my opinion
  for 4 figs and 3 little builds yeah its cheap as shit
  one pink can service 20 men in a single sol
  wildly cheap considering the average base cost of a minifig is about 45 bucks based on cmfs
      maybe theyre testing new prices
  i dont think thats the case especially with the fact that this is a classic space build most of the parts are pre existing however the gray 22 stud tile combo may be new
  i feel like this set is a test in a lot of ways besides price   testing classic lego properties popularity  testing adults buying for themselves/nostalgia testing boys and girls buying same set for themselves  testing armybuilder sets that arent star wars  testing a series with more than one impulse buy / small set which lego seems to have stopped doing outside of microfighters which was always very weird to me    i hope these are all wildly successful tests and lego becomes interested in revitalizing their other classic lines
  yes i want pirates back    but with classic faces not these new ones
  bennys  kek
  and i want more lego castle shit    best case scenario they release halfwaves of modernized classic sets     worst case scenario the set is still popular enough that lego will occassionally throw out a random 10 classic set with a bunch of knights pirates adventurers or whathaveyou    best worst case scenario those vintage themed sets include 3 army build figures and one bennylike character such as johnny thunder ogel or basil the batlord
  a lot of the new sets even star wars sets seem to be aiming for a lower price range  its not surprising since one of the most common complaints about lego is the cost and this year was really pricy with very few small impulse buy sets
    bbut why though
  wut    why
theres not a lot of good pieces in this set the benny figure and the pink girl are especially bad     i hate bennys cracked helmet and worn out space logo it triggers my autism also no classic space guns really sucks
  the pink one is a guy  the white one is a girl  no really
    cause it was replaced with a new mold  
  the new one makes more sense
  i mean if youre going to complain about a lack of interesting pieces why knock the pink astronaut when the pink helmet and air tank really are the only interesting new pieces in the set
  only if youre gay a woman or an effeminate male and theres nothing wrong with being any of those things pink just doesnt appeal to the majority of average males and thats just the way it is deal with it
  no girls allowed
  post apoc lego set    more info
  lol average minifig costs more like a 1
wouldnt be nearly so bad if the overall colour combination wasnt so weak not having red is absolutely god damned criminal but sets that girls buy cant have red so thanks lego
  this isnt autism    anon were grown men talking about lego of course its autism
  what its not anon unless youre buying second handed
  time to take your hormones jazz
    imagine being this disquieted by a colour
  we only like manly colors like blud red and storm blue and sick green
  imagine being this triggered
  lmao how do you even function in daily life when youre constantly worrying about being judged by strangers on the street    honestly you sound like you have a severe lack of selfesteem
   post apoc lego set  more info        no u mad  must be 18 to browse 4channel kiddo
not futuron era  fuck that shit go die in space without a visor on your helmets faggots
no orang transparent chainsaw  what the fcuk lego  thered better be an ice planet cameo i mean theyre going to space this is their best chance to bring it back
  using a visor instead of optically perfect force field    sad
  t effeminate male   tell your single mom i said hello sweetheart
  doesnt care for pink  suddenly this is about being judged   what a hilariously laughable insecure faggot stop projecting your insecurities on on others
  as long as shes got that sassy black lady voice with a similar sounding tone im down
i think i want to get a vintage blue spaceman to replace bennys worn and broken parts plus i kinda hate charlie day
  fuck you miloanon i heard your mom got raped by kavanaugh and you told her she should be thankful because it made you    pity zaush has shit sperm and cant make babies from the women he rapes actually thats good hed just rape the babies too because hes also a pedo furries usually are just as jin sergalicious saotome oh wait thats you miloanon    stay mad grandmotherfucker
  from all you zombies  womens   emergency   national   corps   hospitality    entertainment   section    or    womens   hospitality   order   refortifying    encouraging   spacemen
  its not pink its lightish red
guys the  face back then and even now is gender neutral so pink is probably a girl
  the box says his name is lenny and the white one is named jenny
  pfft they cant tell me what to do just like with the ages on the box
  helenny
  i still have one or two of those shields i hat young me because i lost most of my favorite minifigs
  i still have one or two of those shields i hat young me because i lost most of my favorite minifigs  are you familiar with bricklink
oh hell yea more colors for the spaceman
    pussy is pink it represents femininity well why would you be ashamed of a feminine colour not liking pink is werid in my opinion
  the helmets are actually new molds with attachement points for a visor
  i think the old ones also had the points didnt they    it was always possible to use the visor
  so that makes you a gay robot
  i think the old ones also had the points didnt they  it was always possible to use the visor    some versions of the old helmets had attachment points for the classic castle visor which is a different mold than the modern motorcycle helmet visor    based on the box art of metalbeards bike the new helmet can fit a standard motorcycle visor
  oh i wanted them to be curate with the originals
can we develop a lego theory  in line with the pixar theory in that all tthe lore from lego original series are connected on a single timeline    rough idea would be as follows    dinosours  cave men  castle / knight kingdom  pirates  wild west / adventurer  trains  city / creator / friends  city space base  classic space  dino / dino attack  rock raiders  life on mars  lego monorail  mars missions  ninjago  exoforce  nexo knights    distant future    mixels    even distanter future    bionicle
  fan theories d  did you know that ash ketchum died during first episode and other episodes is what he seeing in coma so this explains why he never changes o  fuck off
  no fun allowed  lego  youre in the wrong place
  no stupidity allowed either pleb go with fan theory trash to youtube
  what are these cute guys from
  broken helmet piece
  my autism is superior to thou
is space the first lego theme or were there other themes before space
  what are these cute guys from  the lego movie 2      is space the first lego theme or were there other themes before space  when the modern minifig with arms and legs was first introduced in 1978 lego released town castle and space simultaneously
  wolf pack
  zoomers today dont know what it was like in the neon 90s
  not one mention of blacktron    neck yourselves senpai
  i had that set  prefer the earlier black visor blacktron but those were still good times
  its fucked me up for as log as i can remember
although these arent as nostalgia filled as the older castle series i still miss the dwarves and orcs from this
  pink knights in a gaystyle castle no weapons
  yeah i just am focusing on making other things atm and just remembered having the shields i probably will do a little bit of army building with them in the future
honestly the lego movie 2 sets kind of suck at the moment    only 70827 ultrakatty  warrior lucy and 70834 metalbeards heavy metal motor trike interest me at the moment the color scheme for many of the sets just does not mesh with anything i would build from them  the new characters suck other than rex but hes generic and the only interest in the higher priced sets currently is just for the raptors    a lot of the sets seem targetted at females who accounted for barely any sales of the toys or movie tickets for tlm     feels like lego is targetting the wrong set of people and has missed out on another chance to make creative sets none of these have remotely the same level of creativity as the vehicle changers from tlm
  nothing new was already the case with the first lego movie
  im happy with them but im a giant classic space fag whos happy to get some crumbs
  what rock have you people been living under
i caved and ripped up the third engine to thicken up the challengers boiler
  you have the data showing how many females bought movie tickets and sets for the lego movie     somehow i doubt it
postapoc means im a little closer to being able to build lego gorkamorka
  postapoc means im a little closer to being able to build lego gorkamorka  you can already do that
nerf gun general buzzbee adventure force and such always welcome
target has the mastodon for 40 if you bogo50 thats 30 each prometheus is 112 bogo50 and its 84 each
wow amazon exclusive stryfe for 17  fuck paying 30 for it    6 hrs remaining
and hammershots for 7 wtf
local target has the prometheus on clearance for 100    its tempting but i have nobody to shoot foam balls with
i have a longshot cs5 in pieces in my closet is there a place i can get springs for it or at least a chart that i can find so i can get an appropriate sized one im pretty sure it never got put together because a spring flew off and i never found it
nerf is op pls nerf
  plunger main spring can just about fit anything so long as it fits around the plunger rod for all the other springs pens are unironically your friend
  just google longshot spring endless results i wound up buying a bunch of springs from aliexpress for a few couple bucks each im sure if you were the enterprising individual you could wind up finding some industrial spring that fits the bill for a few cents each at least thats how i imagine what a spring should cost
hi /toy/    do any of you own the mp32 reissue does it still have the same problem with the beast mode upper arm panels not being able to close all the way image related    also does the reissue have any other improvements over the original release
hey look mattel finally realized they made a mistake and put paint back on the trains instead of doing that trendy bare wood style
  but wait whats that it used to look like this only 2 years ago dont be ridiculous
wooden railway merlin when
  how will you know its not made out of artificial wood if its covered up
  real wood  whats the big deal about that are trees close to extinction or what its gonna cost us more because is just real wood
  im not a train autist so i dont know anything about this stuff were those sold at the same price point if so thats crazy
  sold at pretty much the same price point yeah  but mattel is going bankrupt so theyre trying to spend less on manufacturing but make more on sales
  sir those are very ugly gresley a4 you have
i know this is going to sound really shitty but i honestly mean no offense by it is there a large market for adult collectors of thomas i had this same reaction when i found out adults were buying imaginext power rangers is it a nostalgia thing is it a general train thing do you have small children   again honestly not trying to start shit just trying to get a little insight
  is it a nostalgia thing is it a general train thing do you have small children  a little of all three pic related is apparently worth a decent amount of money
  how is collecting thomas different from collecting anything else this board is full of people who collect things from literal toy commercial franchises for children that are much more recent and mainstream than thomas is whats the actual difference between something like transformers or tmnt and thomas why would you come to a board about adults collecting toys and be surprised adults are collecting toys does thomas need to become a shitty hollywood blockbuster and have overpriced adult toys made for it for you to take it seriously
  we cant all be brio
  only one trailer
  believe it or not the flying scotsman only used the second tender for special trips
  this is a brio thread now post your first or most nostalgic brio train fegits
  still have it
how come little old abuelitas dont play with the saints in their altars     the virgin of guadalupe needs a dollhouse
  because you are not supposed to play with the image of something sacred to you
same thing with hindus some of their altars look dollhouseish enough already they just need some rement furniture
  implying christian stores dont sell biblical action figures up the wazoo
  americans will make an action figure of anything until its something really cool then they dont do anything with it
do they have a good lucifer figure where he still looks human
  they dont sell those at christian stores but theres some demon action figures out there yeah      implying jesus isnt really cool    youre going to hell lad
  you know what i meant
  protestantism was a mistake
  you havent watched enough bibleman or veggietales
  thanks to the protestants you can buy a potato version of baby jesus
  depicting jesus as an icon or statue is blasphemy  lol how cute jesus is a baby carrot
to be honest ive seen some mature women in mexico not playing as in tralala time to change your diaper jesus baby but rocking them while singing to them having beauty pageants with actual money prizes  and to think that there are mexican houses where families cant afford toys but are shit insane with religión it wouldnt be hard to think that there are baby jesus being played as actual baby dolls
i wonder how hard it would be to turn a pose skeleton into santa muerte
  a family in tepito mexico city prayed to a dark souls figure thinking it was la santa muerte
  honestly bibleman looks kinda cool  just needs a proper helmet and it would pass as a semi decent toku hero
i only have this picture to work off of but there was a 9in tall figure of goliath made years back that looked rad as fuck of course they make him black and orclike with warpaint but its a neat rendition of the character it reminds me of mcfarlanes figures but i have no clue who actually made it or the line it was from
  is there a 6 scale jesus figure
  let me help you out anon  good luck finding one
  thanks anon damn thats a sick figure i guess ill just keep my eye on ebay listings if they pop up
  statueshit  thats why
  rementesque packs for altars sounds like a pretty neat idea people already invest a lot into those packs to build up a christmas town they might as well invest more money to make a fucking nativity scene        there isnt a photoshoot of these two duking it out  feels bad
  praying to death itself  i never understood why
  in the bible at the end of days jesus will throw death into the abyss some people took this to mean that death is a physical being and they pray to it just like you would pray to a saint    at least thats how a coworker who prayed to the death explained it
  juarezfag here i cant talk about why other parts of mexico or latin america worship death but the reason some crazy cunts started worshipping death was because of the cartel warinduced violence and mass murders back in 20082009    it has nothing to do with catholicism death isnt meant to be a physical entity much less a saint that you can pray to so they intercede for you i mean maybe other beans have an argument for worshipping it but over here in northern mexico it was nothing but a morbid and insulting cult that a dumb bitch made up the actual entity you pray to for the dead is the holy spirit
  the actual entity you pray to for the dead is the holy spirit  this    source  isaiah 281518  inb4 fedora tipping intensifies
  because death in christianity isnt bad its what takes you to heaven    shes not the only skeleton saint either      
  someone should open an etsy shop selling saint costumes for bfs blanks and pose skeletons
  damn i never thought i would see this again i saw jesus and two other figures i dont remember well who they where at an aliss store like 4 years ago or somethingi actually wanted to grab one but didnt
  the quesadillas doesnt have cheese  everytime
  angel of death is part of gods power youre not supposed to pray to him only to god    santa muerte is just false idol
          something to keep in mind is that a lot of the stuff you see in mexican catholicism is almost as much mesoamerican aztec maya and all of the other civilizations in the region that were just as complex but nobody seems to know about like the mixtec zapotec purepecha toltec huasttecs totonacs otomi etc in nature as it is catholic     obviously death and skeletal iconography is a big deal in mesoamerican religion though less from a dude evil death cult perspective like most people think and more because rather duality and cycles were a big thing in a lot of especially the aztec/nahua worldview and life and death was viewed as such a cycle and dualism so a lot of the blood and skeletal shit was actually a reflection on their views on the sanctity of life and its wonder but impermanence     i talk more about mesoamerican human sacrifice cosmology and themes in their poetry and philosophy here 
  reminds me of the experiments i did in the 80s trying to make costume changes for gijoe starwars and superhero action figures  created a technique where i used a heated leatherwork stamp tool to heat fuse synthetic cloths and plastic bags instead of sewing the results were fairly good but i havent done anything like that since i started restoring classic cars   i dont think there is a big enough market for me to try making microfigure clothing again though but it would be good idea to start a business failure with
what are some good toys youve found on aliexpress or taobao    ive only used the site for bootleg lego minifigs but surely theres some treasure on these sites ive been wanting a cheap way to display my action figures for one thing
there were sellers who offered figma misakas for a discounted price on taobao the regular release was only available as a packin for a psp game they were about 20 each and the middleman service i used had a cheap shipping promo going on the whole team here ended up only costing me about 130 after service fees and ems
im selling a bunch of different digimon figures i have 50 of them listed on ebay and a ton else that arent listed let me know if theres anything specific youre looking for as i probably have it    
thanks dustin
    please call me the wind
ive found the new play arts kai advent children cloud for a reasonable price the seller received it from an anime convention and never opened it    my concern was that it was a bootleg now i know   play arts   but this is a design ive always loved and since bring arts doesnt seem to be ever getting around to it i figured this was my best bet can anyone with experience with the line let me know if its one of the knockoffs from china from this photo
my opinion is that its legit the paint and details are way too clean to be a bootleg
  i mean isnt the bring arts line still kind of in its infancy id give it some time before writing it off but if youre happy with your purchase
  best comparison i could find yours looks legit how much did you pay if you dont mind saying
  it is but in the absolute worst case i have a friend i could gift it to who also loves ff7      53 dollars after shipping
  i have a bootleg cloud on the way from china i know its a bootleg because it was fifteen bucks on ebay and coming from china if i remember ill post some pics if he ever arrives
  bring arts is a new line but square enix is also insanely slow with their games as well as their merch and it will take them probably years until they even finish their dragon quest and ffix lines other ff games will probably also take precedence over advent children figures    definitely wouldnt wait around for it itll be years if at all
z bots
  i wish i could still get the cretaceous advencement set
bike bots
is there a really comic/game/movie accurate sexy black widow figure is the biggest attraction of the character and the only thing i see in hot toys/legends/   figuarts is a girl with 0 good body i need a sexy black widow with a tight clothes and only a statue bishoujo looks good its sad
  just learn to work with latex and make a 1/6 scale latex catsuit for a hot toys widow
  the fuck happen to her knee
  body wise id say that legends 2 pack that came with the winter soldier shame about that face
just get the winter solider bw ht if youre that hungry but i think the latest one is better despite her new look
  wait for yamaguchi widow
  figuarts head with mezco one 12 catwoman body its perfect
  i wish theyd make a line based on various video games/cartoons other than the comics and movies
  0 tight this looks like a fucking pajama and i dont wanna imagine her pancake ass
  fucking trash
movie black widow  sexy  lol
  with mezco one 12 catwoman body its perfect  ahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahah
  im gay t post
  shes really not that hot
  she was stupid hot on the first few movies then 10 years happen
  took an arrow she aint no avenger anymo xd
  vintage wave legends widow has a sexy tight clothes body as does the one with the motorcycle
  im already widow maker
  or just put the figuarts head on the figuarts body and then you dont have a qc nightmare body with the articulation of a sub 20 toy
i legit thought it looked cool
  it looks fine the problem is that that body has trash articulation and the catwoman figure has a high defect rate     if you just want museum/basic posing it works but its not worth the 160 itll cost you to do it
  whats wrong with the catwoman    thinking of buying her and the few reviews ive seen there doesnt seem to be a problem
  hasbro sneaks them into the legends line sometimes the taskmaster we got a while ago before this recent classic one was based on his appearance in ultimate spiderman and a few other recent cartoons/animated films then theres iron skull from one of the avengers cartoons the ps4 game suit has also an ml then the 375 line has a twopack featuring the civil warrior and theres a new hydra cap figure coming out that will inevitably be rereleased as civil warrior
  her face looks like robocop without his helmet
  1 the mezco female body buck she uses has very limited articulation single jointed elbows and knees bad shoulders its literally what youd see on an older marvel legends female figure     2 shes got one of the highest qc fail rates of the line people have been getting them with busted limbs out of the box and more are having the single jointed elbows/knees shear off in use because for some reason the joints are ultra tight and the plastic pegs on the joints isnt able to tolerate it
thanks for your help /toy/bros but im looking for something like this a woman in tight latex look the perfect curves thats what i want catwoman mezco looks horrible 0 tight and legends did it well but they look very flat
  buy this  buy fujiko mine figuarts   place gauntlets on figuarts head optional  there you go
  buy fujiko mine figuarts  done
  i guess you never watched robocop
    fujiko mine is way too small to fit with legends or legends headsculpt
  thats cool    wonder if danny ever got her that ambulance
    just a little warning the joint used in fujikos neck is almost as thin as the one used in lupins wrists and is connected really tightly to the head chances are that breaking the joint and replacing it will be easier i hamhand it and managed to shove a small figma joint after drilling out the leftovers of the broken joint on the neck and head
  hmm ill keep that in mind but it doesnt sound that bad considering the reviews
  no the point is buy the fujiko and forget the other steps
    was waiting for someone to say this so i could get angry at them
  im straight up not downplaying it its an 80 figure with the body of a 20 figure and the qc of a 10 figure     every mezco fan group has been ragging it hard since release
  not sure what people are disappointed at since thats what was advertised since it was first shown  its a good look and why im getting it
  the classic legends and the modern legends arent bad i have a few gripes with the legs/feet although if you want a sextacular one im not sure either have an enhanced cgi butt like in your pic
a fucking huge difference hot toys  mediocre
  almost as if you can make a computer models clothes as tight as you like while with a 1/6 scale model you are restricted by the limitations of the material
  there is no justification
  you are aware that the same material can react differently depending if its a small piece or a much larger one i hope you do at the very least
  well her but didnt look like that in the movie that is from an snl skit
  pic related
  not sure what people are disappointed at    really you dont get why people are disappointed that an 80 figure has shit articulation and qc issues
  the infiinity war widow is good they thickened up her lower body to keep it looking proportional with the upper body given the fact that shes wearing a jacket just take the jacket off and shes thick as fuck only reason i bought her
  if it has qc issues i understand the disappointment but it seems most of them are fine in terms of not breaking everything else weve known for since it being shown off
any good mega man classic figures ive been wanting a cut man but any character is fine
if you werent a lazy shit and actually looked youd see there is plenty
  darts  4inchnel  action 66    if you want cut man hope you find the 4inchnel 2pack for a good price or youll have to luck out and get the action 66 one
previous thread 
shf btfo  western kidshit btfo
  aw look the child is trying to start a company war adorable

  shf btfo  not hard these days     although each company has difference strengths and weaknesses and the biggest plebs are the ones who are one brand only while shitting on the others
  this just buy toys you like
warming up to this head sculpt but eh still wish she was on the thicc body
rip st jk this is just frank having dinner
  shf btfo    how they do mcu stuff and revoltech does the comic counterparts
  the real general my fellas    
  lol
  wheres that chair from    reminds me i really need to get a punisher figure sometime
  looks like morpheus chair
  seems to match it in the images i have found thanks for that lad
  no ones gonna post in your bootleg general third worlder go cum on some mls
  did you not get the joke
  not having the mezco spec ops punisher  its like you dont want the definitive classic frank
new thread  
  mezco is cool and all but the face is fucking ugly
but the face is fucking ugly  are you high thats the best part of that figure
  its a nice sort of ugly dont get me wrong but its not how classic frank looked like it looks like punisher max era frank wearing his old suit
  homo  mezco should make a john romita jr punisher next
  not going with the best punisher designs of all punisher 2099
  oh man the amount of stuff he could come with would make me come too    plz include censored face    id also love to see punisher 2099 as agent of shield when doom 2099 gave him the job to oversea americas safety  also a doom 2099 one12 too
  which suit is this based on
hey guys is this in the stores
  looks like bleeding edge/heroic age based on the torso
  doom 2099 iron man 2099 both spider man 2099 suits
  yeah check gamestop my store had him ronin red skull and the thor and antman twopacks    plus i think theyre still 25 off this weekend from black friday
  why do you want him
  i want him to kill liz
real general without revofags     
  not him but i own the baf and hes a fun figure for those not wanting to pay 40 for a used figure this is worth it    i actually might get this and repaint him in iron man colors
  stop spamming your thread no one wants to go to
  i want to make a doombot out of him
  anon you cant be so rational in a /toy/ thread
  dinner  some beers and a gun
  some beers and a gun  some veggies and a meat    im not seeing the problem here
  right
lads whats the best 6 inch scale ghost rider figure out there and theres a lot toy biz movie figures and current mls
  i saw him at my local best buy like two weeks ago
  you can probably find the current ghost rider/bike combo for less than the 40 it retails for the figure itself is pretty good its his classic colors though not just black and white like the rhino wave one the bike itself is pretty legit too i really feel that you cant get ghost rider without his bike     i think mezco also has one announced but who knows when itll actually come out plus it really depends on how you feel about cloth goods on 1/12 scale figures
  yeah my best buy has a shit ton
i really wish we were getting more spiderman ps4 design figures im really liking this hammerhead
  i wish the spiderman we got had effort put into it
how do you go from this
to this
  im surprised theres no mafex/shf for the ps4 suit i think well see more marvel legends trickle out eventually but im not sure how well theyll turn out
    how  that isnt even kind of close
  does sony have any strong connection with or own toy companies i mean it doesnt matter to get a figure out but just wondering as a company they dont care too much in that sector
  i cracked up when i stocked this between peni and scorpion that was one big box full of shit
anywhere i can still get the netflix daredevil for retail or is loose the only way im getting him for 20 now
r8 my collection so far
  implying youd want a figure with a generic anime face  they improved it you fucking weebs reeeee
are they going to release dark phoenix red costume action fig again please   or where can i get her at a fair price 
  your room looks disgusting perhaps its the flash and hand me down glass furniture and tv on dresser but great toys
  ththanks
  matrix collection  no animatrix  poor effort man
amazon has some decent legends deals dont know if its cyber monday or just in general    black widow on bike is 13 some of the 10 year anniversary 2 packs are half off red skull is like 12 bucks
  no matrix collection should ever extend beyond the first movie
  hasbro store on ebay has been having a sale
  bought another 2 red skulls for that price because fuck it thanks for the heads up
  its like jackie chan in a wig and also a midget
no news  dead thread    are you guys getting anybody marvel related toys for christmas
  fuck the matrix get dark city instead the movie that matrix wholesale ripped off dark city is better in every way
  this fucking boring thread
  better than third world posting
  dark city is better in every way    naw they do have similar themes but the matrix is first and foremost an action movie while dark city is noir scifi    both good for their respected genres
  subjectanon will defend this
  i bought a thing for my dad he used to always say its clobberin time when i was a kid i dunno if he wants it or not but i was teasing him earlier this week for not having anything fun on his desk at work he bought me that shitty gotg1 wave iron man when i graduated college earlier this year so i guess im returning the favor    i love my dad
  i picked up a few on walmarts site for 12 its funny most of the other stuff on sale walmart simply chose not to carry in stores but we actually got a decent number of red skull figures i guess i could shitpost walmartrighttrumpnazi but the mcu10 stuff is also more expensive so carrying it in a poor people store is weirder either way i was happy to pick up some hydra troops on the cheap
  more like youll troll a thread because youre that pathetic
are there any decent modular armor iron man figures
  closest i can think of is their sie japan studio division who did gravity rush and that leading to the figma however insomniac while a close studio to sony isnt part of the many studios sony own so thats bound to be another hurdle that needs tackling     i honestly just think they dont actually care as much when it comes to figures/merch they do weird oddball choices like shoes but then halfarse their mini ps1 they are missing out though i bet the demand for figures of some of their franchises would be fairly decent
  get the vintage frank and give him a black coat and walgreens punishers head and guns
  where is this photo from
  its a custom
will hasbro give us punk hulk and captain anarchy
  why is everyone in his universe punk lol kinda makes him seem unoriginal
how much thing could a manthing fling if a manthing could fling thing
  whats the best that doesnt require buying 3 figures
  spend 60 bucks on some part swapped piece of shit instead of just buying a better figure
  that comic sucks is why
  because you dont read comics
  to be fair the best classic frank the mezco spec ops variant goes for 300 or so in the aftermarket i still dont know how i managed to snag one everyone freaked out how the site just shat itself meanwhile i add to cart and checkout without a problem
  why autistic people dont have a sense of humor
is there a kind anon who want to trade thing with magik my local walgreens is swimming with magiks but theres no thing
  its between these three all have their faults tho
  i love the newest one ive never had any of the others but its a great figure
  hey does any of the ghost rider heads fit on punisher
  i dont know i dont have any punisher figures mainly horror and ghost rider figures they should i guess i seen a custom cosmic ghost rider on ebay so it could work
  hasbro needs a ghost rider wave
baf can be a fucking sherman tank for the wwii tank crew
  you know never thought about it but they do  scarecrow blackoutorb deathwatch hannibal king blade from midnight massacre danny ketch gr  ghost rider 2099  90s blaze and a baf of fat mephisto
  id love a new baf blackheart the ms mephisto is good but i get not a lot of people have it
  the wave we need
  ms mephisto is great  i do like the black heart figure this bitch is just so hard to find the need a new figure
  personally the walgreens one is probably the better option but hes gonna cost more vintage wave frank is the easier one to get but he lacks weapons aside from a big bazooka netflix one is fine if you want a more modern style punisher     best option is still a 23 figure purchase imo netflix punisher with the long trench coat and the head from the walgreen or vintage frank
    thats really cool id buy a cheap netflix punisher for that i have the walgreens one and love it
  3/10
  
  man that namor head makes a really solid looking rucka era punished frank might need to see about grabbing another netflix frank and doing one myself
    this roster still needs a lot of love would love a new blackheart wolverine pizza spidey  juggernaut are the only ones im content with and even spidey could use a redo on a different body    the fact we dont have a classic/smart hulk yet is dumb
  you forgot classic vintage wave cap and iron man anon
  i can take a look around and see whats in my area
  id be happy to have a mix of classic and modern/90s horror characters     werewolf by night   dracula tomb of dracula   monster of frankenstein   the zombie simon garth  manphibian  scarecrow   daimon hellstrom  gabriel the devilhunter  blade tomb of dracula   johnny blaze spirits of vengeance  ghost rider danny ketch  vengeance  digger  hannibal king  darkhold dwarf  mephisto  blackheart  demogoblin
  i really wish they would stop with the shiny plastic punisher looks like some goth rocking some pvc gear   how well do these figures take to matte coatings
  if it makes you feel better the figures dont look that glossy in person because cameras need more light than the eyes to see detail so in person it doesnt look like that unless you have cataracts and need everything bright as hell to see shit    and if you really do have that much of a problem with gloss buy yourself a krylon matte spray can for all your toys a quick pass or three will fix em right up piss easy that will produce great results as long as you shake the can for 5 minutes and spend no more than 2 seconds doing each pass length wise
  i have like four things in my local area and i bought one the other day for exactly this situation but i cant find magik anywhere please email me
  no one is satisfied with either of those figures that iron man is horribly outdated and had no business being rereleased with minor changes and that cap would be fine if it had a better headsculpt
tfw no peni parker toy
  i mean there is one  it is absolutely terrible but there is one
  yeah even a pop would be better
  oh well get one eventually  marvel legends  semireal face sculpt instead of an anime face like ml gwenpool  uses a female body type that make her look like shes in her late 20s  outfit will not be her school uniform  widespaced eyes like ultronwave wasp  big red lipsticked lips
  revoltech has most of these covered
  thats true but not everyone is going to like the revo style when it comes to sculpts and articulation never hurts to be able to get the same figure in as many ways as possible though
  i love all the revoltechs but spiderman but only magneto psylocke and spiderman are based on the same outfits as that roster which most people are pretty anal about
  put a shirt on
  big red lipsticked lips  i was so glad when the new spidergwen in the miles 2pack had a less stupid and dead complexion
  peni parker  he knows too much seize him
  hey whats the best figure of the classic hulk preferably one that would work well with legends or is legends ive been eyeing down that toybiz galactus wave variant one how is it
hows the mafex iron man mark 45 compared to the figuarts ive never been in love with the design but i kinda want to have a collection of different suits from different companies now since so many different people have made so many different suits of his     that and the shf mark 45 and 46 look kinda shitty
  it really depends on what style of hulk youre partial to there are so many different shades of green plus the grey and red ones theres also a plethora of facial expressions and various sizes even within the ml lines    so what kind of hulk are you looking for
  y know what fuck it the mark 45 shf is actually good looking its just the 46 that looks kinda poopy as fuck what the hell happened bandai is it just a case of rushed to come out as close to the movie as possible like we got with a lot of rider figuarts in the past
  mafex iron mans are really shite its a floppy fuck made before mafex started to get their shit together
  oh shame guess ill keep an eye out for the shf if i freally want it
i think my noir is pretty solid these legs are pretty clunky though
  eh ill buy it
  sort of a generic one something more classic though akin to this
  hey its me again i figured id add a bit more im definitely looking for a green hulk for facial expressions i prefer sort of a neutral look but i dont really mind as long as it looks good a good example of what doesnt would be the marvel select that face is just grotesque for size id like him to just be relatively 6 inch scale
  youll be wanting the faceoff hulk then
  oh wow that does look really nice are there any other ones you suggest just in case i cant find this one
  yeah i still need to sculpt on the bandage and hair in order to get the full solid frank look going on
  i dont care for the movie version of peni give this the comic versions long sleeves instead of a sweater vest and im sold
  yeah he looks good but the bodys definitely not ideal for a spiderperson
  there is also this face off hulk he comes with the eraser head leader
  thats one sexy revolver hes got there
  picked him up at bb  thanks bud hes huge  anyone see the blue putz  i do like him all he ever wants is for people to take matters seriously
  its the exact same sculpt as before though  idk paints better but im not impressed she looks bored
yes or no guys  i like robots so yes
  hes at most gamestops around here now
  ill get him cheap off ebay like manthing and warlock he wont be in any sort of demand
  looks like shit no
new exclusive venom
  that looks fucking terrible
  agreed
  whoah i like that a lot actually disney store or what
    make second version of venom  emblem still cuts across waist joint for no fucking reason    this shits on purpose
  fingers crossed for ankle pivots/rockers this time also the head sculpts here seem heavily inspired by clayton crains art matching the alt head for their carnage though i cant tell where the closed mouth expression is sourced from
  i think this figure would be a million times better if it went for a slightly movieinspired look and removed the spider logo and did white veins either way this looks like itll be a fun figure to add to the collection
  
  its literally just a reuse of the original select venom body with new heads
  that looks a bit better honestly but her receding hairline is still a big problem
  god i hate you youre fucking pathetic
  even the funko is better than that
          that looks really cool will definitely get
  has his repaint been confirmed for cap marvel yet
  oh wow thats pretty cool
  for the cap marvel wave yet
    hope they do something like this to reissue the carnage too
incomin best be movin whitey
  dayum dat killmonger art is fire
  klaw got shafted in the movie but i still think hes great
  so they gave up showing product shots on the back and are just showing the actors now
  i mean you can see the figure in front why does it matter if you dont see the photoshops on the back
  two thirds of those are incostume
  to be honest its rather surprising becuase it could cost more to produce than those mediocre box window shots of the toys
how well can the ml netflix punisher hold a twohanded gun pose with his rifle specifically in a way that looks like hes actually aiming at something
  its always nice to see pictures of the figure in various poses
  they look pretty good not gonna buy them though
the only infinity war iron man that comes with the best/most accurate weapon accessories are the hot toys and now the nendoroid  why this
  her proportions are incredibly unflattering not saying its not accurate just making an observation id never want this on my shelf no wonder marvel forced kotobukiya to delay the captain marvel statue until 2020 and canceled the psylocke rerelease wouldnt want people getting anything aesthetically pleasing or sexy on their shelves gotta lower them standards so this shit sells
  carol danvers  getting multiple high end import figures  these are dark times  i still cant figure out why she had to be the character marvel pushed for the girl power angle since i could name ten marvel females off the top of my head who are more interesting
  marvel pretty much had to rush out a female solo film and most of the good female characters were owned by fox shehulks rights seem iffy too who else was available
  im not a fan of carol but i think brie larson is cute so i may get one hoping theres an unhelmeted head for the green suit
  marvelthe comics anyway have been pushing carol hard for almost a decade now decreeing her to be the most powerful ever i dont know if its to swing their dick around because shes captain marvel if its just the we want the world to see how progressive we are mentality or a combo of both
  yeah it sucks i generally like the mcu and thought theyd tone carol down but feige has already proclaimed her the most powerful hero also brie larson is annoying
  i hear ya man mcus looking to be a big letdown posta4
  getting the fox characters back gives me a glimmer of hope for the mcu if the movies tank then disney will throw a bunch of money at the russos to do secret wars though which is what got me into comics
  im holding off too much hope until i see what their xplans are
  the shf has like an accessory pack coming out right
  they still couldve fixed the paint on the torso at least the spider is too long anyway      cant really say why they settled on her theyve definitely changed her character significantly im not one of those she shouldve stayed in the black bathing suit kinda people but she was an alcoholic and i havent seen that brought up again ever shes a decent character and her powers are generic enough for her to fill the super strong and also a woman role       most powerful hero lol okay didnt realize we were going full dbz here fiege maybe if she absorbed a star or something but cmon she wouldnt stand a chance against thor or hulk cant wait to see someone writing her win that fight though because they have to show shes strong somehow sigh      itll be fine if they show something different for once theres something to be said for the success of doctor strange black panther guardians and spiderman captain marvel and antman fall into the same camp as iron man and cap as far as im concerned give us fantastic four give us xmen make it different enough from the previous ones and the other marvel movies to actually give a shit i wanna see a mutant school fighting the worlds strongest terrorist and the worlds greatest family going on science adventures not family gains powers and has to work together to defeat a new super villain thats basically an evil version of an existing hero
  dont expect anything without butterfly joints doing that
  fuck yes best girl
  i know theyre just prototypes but the proportions seem weird they remind me of those 7 inch marvel figures that diamond select puts out    i might be wrong about this but i believe shehulks rights are at universal
  i literally thought it was agent k at first
  yikes that looks terrible
  we want the world to see how progressive we are  its totally that one  her kamala and miles are basically the poster children for that kind of thing these days  its a shame that they went with carol instead of say phyla they could also get some lesbian street cred with her for their virtue signalling mascot since i will never be able to see carol as anything other than bootleg supergirl with all the personality of a log
  whats wrong with his face
  boy thatis not good
  i just want one good captain america figure
    easiest skip
  is that face different than the civil war one i feel like it looks a lot better
  rescue captain is my one wish
wtf is wrong with her forehead
  same  i dont give a shit about mcu cap but captain america seems to be the superman of marvel in that he has a ton of figures but none that are really great
  her hair isnt on right
  is this the new heddie brock
  i have less of a problem with his face than i do with his torso its too slim    the others at least got the shape right
  oh wow  its like they didnt even try
  kirsten dunst
  sounds like a great time      i cant imagine the demand for a coulson figuart was so high to even justify this half arsed effort
  this is basically the golden age suit which is the replica suit he wears during the final battle in tws
  much better also its his best outfit as well
  he looks more like a slightly younger stan lee here
alright fellas i want to start collecting the marvel sh but i just want to know if the stupid after market prices are actually worth paying for the figures
  it varies on each figure warmachine mark 1 definitely the mark 2 is pretty good but i guess you could just snag the hot rod that is coming out soon at a cheaper price and that seems to be the same figure with a new paint job     id not pay aftermarket on hulk thor or cap though though id be surprised if thor did go up in price figma hulk is a great avengers 1 hulk though
  yeah coulson was a big deal after the first avengers but the hype is straight up dead for the guy
boy i sure am glad i dont like figures of actors cosplaying as super heroes
more pics  
  sad the toy gives me more hype than the trailer
    she looks really good probably the best out of all the new reveals but i cant see myself picking her up unless her movie really surprises me
oof
  carol merch is going to empty my wallet like no other  especially if theres one with her bomber jacket
  why who asked for more black panther figures this is as bad as deadpool
  this looks better than the comics
sneaky sam jack on the left
    looks pretty decent brie larsons hair is a lot more blond though      solid maybe ill pick it up when itll get heavily discounted      that hair looks fucking bad      he looks asian but good for a more regular hulk
  i think the twopack nails his head but im still waiting for a better body to come out
  heartbreaker is so good looking
  i like everything about this loki but they missed with that face so close to perfection
    mental   organism   designed   only for   coulson
  iuh huh i literally just bought a3 hulk this morning because he looked good and could work as a good generic comic hulk    good to see them going back to the older movies though i always thought a tws bucky was in the never ever pile
    no gemini reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  alot better than caveman bucky
  oh my god i was just thinking that the comicave one getting canceled still hurts
  did comicave just kill all their ironmen i was looking forward to reviews of their mark 7
  alright seems fair but what about thanos and the iron man figures that are around 150
  thanos pops up in the 7090 range on ebay sometimes which isnt bad i think he retailed for around 80 its a pretty solid figure all around
  i just want killmonger and the baf
  couldnt tell you on thanos as ive no interest in the angry grape man     mark 3/6/42/43 are all solid releases   wasnt as keen on the suits after that they seem more basic in the manner of their figure layout   did quite enjoy the mark 46 though the hands can be a love it or hate is situation    are they worth 150 though maybe if you can score one with a hall of armor piece but not really only thing i could suggest is that you bite the bullet if you dislike it that you just sell it on knowing the aftermarket prices mean you can get a solid chunk back
  this wave is gonna clog pegs for like eight months like a whole wave of misty knights
  high key considering canceling my ml order and picking this up my only withdrawal is that these figures dont scale well with mafex or legends does anybody have a true mix of a collection from different manufacturers preferably the ones i mentioned that they can show off
  how good this looks just makes me more pissed at how phoned in cap was
i didnt think id miss this old faggot but this picture is getting to me
  she was an alcoholic and i havent seen that brought up again ever  before making her captain marvel and giving her a huge push they gave her a mind wipe to effectively make her a blank slate strong female character
  no they didnt youre thinking of enemy within that happened years after she was captain marvel and basically didnt change anything about her  also shes been sober for decades im not sure how youd bring up aside from what they already do she drinks soda when others are drinking alcohol and she goes to aa meetings with tony offpanel
  black panther was a really popular movie and a lot of people wanted tactical killmonger and myself and at least a few others were hopeful for klaw getting a figure
  captain marvel and antman fall into the same camp as iron man and cap as far as im concerned  the trailer seems to suggest captain marvel being a greenlanternesque space cop with supermans powers which would explain   most powerful hero    also in the mcu tonys alcoholism and ptsd hasnt been brought up since im3 so addiction doesnt need to be a characters defining trait this isnt a drugculture movie franchise so it can just be a background thing
  maybe ill pick it up when itll get heavily discounted    she gonna be exclusive like probably iw thor japan only exclusive that discount aint happening
  this killmonger is my biggest want from the wave with mbaku and klaue not too far behind and even then i actually like the rest of the wave enough to get them it does help that i actually wanted tchaka and glowy bp plus i never actually got the cw bp so every figure is technically new for me
  holy shit are modern marvel comics really this badly drawn
  shes a regular release
  whoa i didnt know bandai had the license to make comic figures
  put texture on skin  make pants smooth    the japanese are a confused bunch arent they
      shf heartbreaker  shf shotgun    fick mich now all they have to do is remold the mrk 46 and reissue the war machine mark 1 and goddamn it
   could always get one customized or maybe if one of those ebay sellers will make one i do love bomber jackets over superhero suits too
  im really hoping this is just a bad angle because its easily my favorite costume in the mcu and i was all set to talk shit about the bulbous shoulders but      man the iw hulk was king for all of two weeks how long until bootleg companies are selling head packs like for the dragonball stuff      1 whats wrong with the 46 and 2 theyre much more likely to do a renewal version of war machine like they did with the mk 6 it still holds up really well but they could stand to rework the proportions a bit
  finally didnt think someone would make this hopefully it comes with the masked head too
  i dont know why exactly maybe its just bad photography but the shf 46 just looks really shit to me flat sculpt bad proportions and    lazy engineering make it really look like a rush job to me     uneven red paintjob no blue for all the lights it should have and the unpainted eyes look even more dead and empty than usual they finally painted the eyes blue on the 45 then immediately stopped here the handguards still have the mitten problem the 45 had
  get the revoltech
  thatd be stupid
  revo has a better body sculpt
yknow while im bring autistic about iron men i wish someone would make the mark 7 at the end of the battle of new york after it had ejected all of the extra shit specifically the jetpack
  not really
  that hulk with a better head would be great no doubt the figma hulk head wouldnt work well with it
  the legends/select bodies look like wooden maniquins
  dont respond its mlfag being a troll again
  mlfags in the nutshell ladies and gentlemen
  see look at this contrast the mark 45 looks like a work of art next to the 46
you guys think we will get a japanese spiderman from the spiderverse movie
    ill give you the eyes and mittens but i think the proportions are fine maybe aside from the head but thats basically every shf iron man the color mismatch on the forearms is really hard to notice in person too     i dont know coming right after the 45s weak torso range and instascratching sometimes faded out of the box paint he felt like a huge improvement and the slideout shoulders were really well implemented too he was the first one where you could get the shoulderpads looking natural in most positions
  shame the 45 likes to fade
    well i didnt know about the paintfading issue at all or the waist and my issue with the paint on the 46 is how it looks so much darker on the chest than the rest of the figure but that might just be photography again
  t has never actually held a real marvel toy before
  the mitten problem is due to being based on concept art instead of the actual final design only the mark 50 gets that right
  if i ever actually get either of them id strongly consider just cutting the gold bit off with an xacto knife or if its a separate piece just trying to pry it off
  wree my toys arent shit you just didnt get your hands on good once111  tty harder sissy
kingpin wave was up at dorkside for a full 10 minutes before kingpin singles went
dorkside has the kingpin and mbaku bafs and singles up but kingpins gone already
so how are the bootlegs of these iron mans by the way
  damn and that was going to be the first baf i preordered by itself too theres not a single figure in that wave i want besides him i guess everyone else in the world felt the same way
  i got a bootleg of the 43 because i already had the 42 and didnt feel like full price double dipping on a straight repaint but it was disaster and im pretty sure i ended up throwing it away everything was loose the hands didnt fit or fell off and the paint was straight up terrible thin in some places and thick and gloppy in others and there was an honest to god gloved fingerprint on the chest ive had alright luck with other shf bootlegs that were light on paint like the homemade spidersuit but i wouldnt bother with another iron man
  got it thanks
  delet this
  yeah that wave is basically kingpin and a bunch of future pegwarmers i cant help but think they figured it was timed for the always shortordered post christmas slot and intentionally put all the nobodies of the year there i missed kingpin too so i guess its ebay
  no
  holy fuck anon
  his head is too tall why cant the get his sculpt right theyre doing so well with everyone else too
  hopefully his weird bean head will be fixed before it gets released if it ever does
      looks like reviews for the mbaku wave are already coming out
  terrible awful qc which is a shame because the sculpt and engineering are pretty ingenious
  insults most of the thread  calls others trolls  ok
  literally my only post in the thread dipshit
  is it the kind of qc that could be fixed with some dish detergent and future
  so youre talking out your ass then good to know
  pin heads  i see figuarts are copying toy bizs ideas
  not really no youd have to literally tighten up every joint on the figure and thats assuming you get one thats assembled properly shame as its probably the most accurate 45 sculpt in any scale
  did you leave it in the sun fucks sakes what a retard
  those shoulders and biceps  some toybiz figures have not aged well
  that pic is from someone in the bst thread who didnt dust his iron man at all for like two years
  this would be the perfect figure if it came with the masked head cant fuck up a face sculpt if you just give him a mask
  thats been the hope for every cap so far nothings ever fixed
  unironically a great movie pack in if other movies came with totally unique figures like this i might considering doing something besides downloading shit illegally
  i on the other hand wouldnt id have no interest in the physical media and i can imagine selling it off sans figure would be a pain
  no a whole seperate iron man with the wings
new thread 
  if this scales in with a marvel line from way back when and they never made a venom then maybe this is ok
  you forgot frankencastle

im not one for conspiracy theories but there have been so many poopbased toys and games this year and this one is almost straight up fetish shit it all makes me feel very creeped out
indoctrinating young girls by normalizing /d/eviant sexual fetishes   based and redpilled
  that promo video
  i mean weve had some pretty fetishy stuff in our childhoods if you really think about it
  even the color of toy itself have some unhealthy pale tone like if this thing having some lethal metabolic malfunction
  this glittery shitting alien unicorn is 90 fucking dollars
  and its a mystery package you randomly get one of the four
now let this thing shit rainbow all over new sheera toy face
if they poo does that mean they have buttholes what does the pooslime feel like on a dick inquiring minds need to know
  i mean i would absolutely fill it with lube and fuck it but i dont think this is a healthy thing to be marketed to young girls
  why not      yeah man who didnt get a fetish for tickling thanks to tickle me elmo
why
    because little girls have been obsessed with peepee and poopoo since time immemorial
gnight western civilization
why are there lots of peepoo playsets but no bloody period pad changing playset
  because blood is bad
  america is at long last catching up with japan
    genuinely looked like fetish shit with the weird bloated bodies
  everyday we stray further from gods light
  ive noticed this too the ones that really bother me the most are the candy poopers where the child is encouraged to eat candy shit
  the ones that really bother me the most are the candy poopers where the child is encouraged to eat candy shit
  my first thought too
  unicorn rainbow deviant eating shit fetish s  more like blue pilled
  this is the kind of toy that children are being advertised to want in the year of our lord 2018
      good god i dont even think the 90s grossout fad was this foul
relevant    
dont forget the diaper fetish at work here too
  you mean germany
  /pol/  cherrypicking jews writers  right    the people coming up with this shit are all white if youve ever dived deep into the furry community youd know theyre almost all white with a significant huge european presence especially as the fetishes get stranger like scat macro and that sort of shit not even kidding
  european furs may be plentiful but their fetishes are actually very vanilla all the weird and gross kinks are primarily based in the american part of the subculture if you see this content coming from a eurofur chances are he/she is just doing commissions for the westerners
    this seems like a lot of work for such a small amount of slime
  nope theyre definitely european not just artists either the community at large they may speak english well but they keep european hours and schedules     that said shit like inflation and soft/magic vore is decidedly american im not sure why americans are so obsessed with fat
  we had blurpballs vomit gak and other gooproducts terminator vital flesh regenerator gore aliens still amuses me that a movie franchise about interspecies rape mpreg gore cockmonsters femdom biobondage and snuff was marketed to boys big john toilet game a game where you pick rubber boogers out of the guys nose without making his brain pop out dr dreadful still exists as a line monsterface and yet scatdiaperunicorns is just too weird for me
  tr3yway
  probably because all of the things you listed much like the whole 90s grossout subgenre were aimed at boys
  the new must have toy of the holiday season  notice that this phrase is only ever applied to girl toys or early childhood toys  its a marketing tactic meant to appeal to mothers
    the poop theme is relatively harmless i mean theres tons of unicorn poop candy slime bath bombs products out there so they decided to merge that onto a baby doll not sure why companies still think little girls like that i certainly never did     whats disturbing is the design the unicorns have a teenager top half long styled hair makeup and slutty crop top but below that are fat baby bellies and diapers its grooming girls for ageplay and also purchase bait for adult fetishists
  why are so many products unicorn themed
  because little girls like unicorns horses are already immensely popular then you add the extra magic and sparkle that is a unicorn with an excuse to color them in white and pink and purple all the time and youve got a winner
  hasnt mlp been doing that for years
  the unicorns have a teenager top half long styled hair makeup and slutty crop top but below that are fat baby bellies and diapers  didnt bratz have a baby version
  this one is amazing to play in bath but do not have sex in it
  ill stick to having sex in a bath of jlube
  it is like it was paraphores official merch
  boi
  i want one  unironically pink one is cute        theres a cheat i saw on yt where you can shove your phone under the lid with the camera on so you can see the horn and hair  also you get one of two the white box only contains either pink or rainbow unicorns while the purple box only has blue or green
  more like korea
  im not sure why americans are so obsessed with fat  the feminazis have forced us to accept it as a good thing
  dont fathers eat their daughters shit in the comingofage ceremony in korea
  european furs may be plentiful but their fetishes are actually very vanilla  ahahahahahahahah oh you dont know anything do you if you only knew the reality
  germany specializes in scat porn theres a surprising market for it since like the 80s
      see  this shit is nothing new     now that might be what is causing retards here to suffer serious confirmation bias is the fact that this 1 brand is aimed at girls so now idoits are seeing it everywhere when ther have been always at least 7 major gross toys out since 1980
  thank you for the heads up
    what happens when the kids are done with their slime bath and youare stuck with a 50 gallons of slime in the bathtub does it clog up the drain
  as i said i dont think even the 90s gross out shit was this bad namely because i dont think it was weird with a fascination for feces as we see today
isnt it a funny coincidence that last years selfproclaimed must have toy was also overpriced garbage that nobody wanted
  i think so
  dont knock it till you try it
can i blame furries for this one
  90  what the fuck last time i saw one of these in stores it was 60 i think its stupid to pay over 10 for a surprise thing why couldnt they just make these regular dolls
  its as coincidental as an assmad conservative bringing up a fag pedo with a failed journalistic career every time someone says anything thats remotely factual about conservative hypocrisy or promoting leftist ideologies on here      they do look like child characters so furries are probably rubbing their dicks on these things the fandom is a front for pedophiles anymore
  they only identify the disease they dont identify it sources because theyre brianlets      based  we found evil ideology  lets attach it to certain group of people regardless if they all believe in that ideology or other people outside that group also follow that ideology  /pol/tards in a nutshell        i want it for the lulz        no girls have been obsessed with baby dolls hence wanting realistic baby doll that pee and shit      we generally had better toys in the 90s you knowbefore hasbro and mattel buy out all the companies
   military initiation involves the newbie eating his seniors shit   feces wine   they think shit is medicine  i hate koreaboos
  im not sure why americans are so obsessed with fat  we begin by coveting what we see every day dont you feel eyes moving over your body clarice and dont your eyes seek out the things you want
  just go buy your 90 dollars poopsie boxset miloanon
  absolute units
  weve had patrick stewart play literal shit in a kids movie and this kind of shit
some where a furry fetish artist who was told all their fanart and drawings would get them no where in the real world is getting the last laugh
  will confirm
    sauce
i am not okay with this  
hi /toy/  im trying to find a scale model of a specific motorcycle a suzuki bandit 600n    google turn a few results but they are all out of stock or discontinued  i was told to look at yahoo auctions japan but i didnt find anything there    the brand of the model is not important
bemp
itt cancelled toys you would have bought in a heartbeat  tfw palisades toys is gone forever
considering this is hasbro maybe theres still a chance this will be made
  what gijoe series is that from
  from the renegades cartoon    since they have ownership of all that its unlikely they need to pay royalties and can just introduce it into the line as some just a newname truck    just look how fucking perfect it is it has a trooper compartment in teh back and hidden missile launchers too
there are many cancelled transformers from over the years 1986 unicron several 6 titanium figures alternators just to name a few but the cancellation of animated hurt me the worst id give anything to have all the the canned figures from this line pic related is a new version of megatron and they had at least a new ironhide hot shot and several repaints planned some were able to be released as botcon exclusives and takara rescued blackout hydrodive bumblebee and jetwing prime so thankful for those id buy every single one of those unmade repaints and new molds
  if i could choose one xevoz to bring back
shocker/toybiz grendel  figma tanya  figuarts char  figuarts goemon  figuarts sunshine    this too  the rockabilly warlock guy was also cool as fuck
  so ernie is supposed to give bert the d
  its really a shame it makes me wonder what else is hidden in the archives of unreleased transformers thats never seen the light of day
  why do the muppets keep getting shafted 
  oh shit by sunshine do you mean the one from kinnikuman
  palisades did some great work its truly a shame theyre no longer around picrelated still haunts me and im not even a halo fan
  yep  they showed off a proto but all signs point to the line being dead    animated powermaster prime  this one makes me sad
  will never have boipussi
  i was gonna guess sigma 6
  palisades are gone they used to be incredible didnt they do a few high quality chrono cross statues
  nope renegades  they stole a truck owned by cobra that could do camoflage and change its paint to whtever
  cookie monster figure  never  fraggle toys  never    it burns too much
  muppet babies and fraggle rock    closed for the last 12 years anon  i dont think those cc statues ever came out
  if blastoise was my dad things would be different around here
  why do you hurt me
  didnt hasblow pull the plug on anything gi joe i know they pulled the plug on the 12 inch line then again their last attempt was horrible pic related is the navy special ops horrible fabric uniform cheap horrible fasteners cheap plastic horrible skin tone literally yellowish horrible paint ap gloss black hair i paid i believe 15 for it and i felt ripped off ive bought knock offs with better quality
    animateds toys were shitty at the start which is understandable because they had to accurately sculpt wyatts wonky schwonky designs but they actually got better in later waves if only animated got released in later years or somehow integrated it into later shows
  tfw had massive collection of palisades muppets i collected with one of my best friends back in 20042006 including the backstage playset  sold them all around christmas of 2011 because i had no room for them and needed money badly  probably my greatest toyrelated regret i did keep my rainbow connection kermit though and ive still got the memories we had both just gotten our drivers licenses so we used to plan trips to every toy and collector store in the tristate area to try and hunt these fuckers down so much fun i was so hyped to get a sesame street line too such a shame
i just want my boy sachiel dammit i know about the kit but that rubber skin thing sounds dicey
  id give anything to have  well there is the hyperbole again  there are 3d modelers 3d printing and other services and people who can do this  i lost so much money and time working with people who would give anything and then were usually halfway through their project and they bail out leaving me to sue them for breach of contract  if you really would give anything for these you would already have them welcome to 2018
  im somehow more willing to believe that youre an obnoxiously autistic pedant that nobody can stand working with
  joe will only have retail presence if theres a movie to buoy it more or less
  why god why
    hasbro put gi joe on hiatus due to tru going under and the last movie souring retailers because they were stuck with a movie toyline without a movie for a year    the were selling the toyline without movies and cartoons for years though the 25th toyline was actually supposed to be a seasonal thing with just two waves but it proved so popular that they kept on releasing new toys for almost 3 full years before the first film came out  same with the waves inbetween the first and second movie but the hub cartoon helped push sales
  i wouldve totally bought a big bird too its such a shame that line died with the company
  3d printed tf toys  that is a lot of money to pay for plastic shards
it really fucking hurts /toy/
true pain
  because deep down only a couple of characters kermit ms piggy gonzo animal fozzy actually sell and more to the point the last time anyone gave a crap about them was muppet babies which is an old shame for henson and a lesser extent disney who recently resurrected muppet babies after realizing they couldnt make money off of muppet show nostalgia after numerous attempts     also palisades did a bunch of sleazy shit where they made a bunch of figures that had production runs of 1020 made total for internal events that they flaunted online which pissed a lot of completists off
  sota darkstalkers
  i am still mad about this i wanted lord raptor dammit
    if theres anything that makes me feel better its that it was made by sota and that morrigan is ugly the other 2 still wouldve been great
previous thread      post hot wheels n shit just like the last three threads
oh if previous thread hit bump limit which will anyway this will keep going
you cheeky bastard that gt2 is maisto model

main spot is literally bingo on mainlines except for complete pegwarmers and has been for the past 34 days  where the fuck is the a case you fuckers
i was wondering when this would show up
  its beautiful
  thats actually pretty cool
where do you guys get your hot wheels news about stuff thats out or is coming out
  either from here or from youtube
   is pretty good about it and keeps a comprehensive list of stuff with updates
well heres the new hype in a 5 pack
      both have model leaks straight from the factory often
  gotta get me one of those
  are those gulf models car culture tier or are they like the lambo and honda lines because if they are like latter i might have a chance to pick them up
  car culture set
todays pocket rider is a special tribute to stan lee rip
i am sure this gets asked often but what are your   never ever in mainline  models  for me its   66 toronado   68 corvair  87 shelby glhs
amazon has the fast and furious premium line up  silvia   skyline 32   skyline 34   dont think the escort and the yellow lambo have shown up yet
  huh jada is making initial d cars again  i honestly dont like how they did that model the fenders are too exagerated and for some reason the car looks slammed to the ground which is not what the tofu car was set up      anything toyota id like to see the old celica gtfours or the old supras honda prelude various generations would be super nice too      ey thats pretty good
  r34 sold out instantly  scalpers pulling them for the ebay feast    found some b case today
  doh
my brother in law found this recently forgot to ask where
  rollin into highway 35 be like
never ever
  escort   its out of stock atm
  i prefer r30 skylines unique looking apart from the later incarnations except r31
  now that we have almost all the skyline coupes 4 doors and stagea when
about time my local walmart had the balls to restock the hot wheels except these are the shortcards except the farleft one    from leftright  2010 pro stock camaro  77 pontiac firebird trans am  custom ford bronco  mini cooper classic morris mini
  what set/box is that transam from
  its part of the 2017 hw flames set
  you still had 2017 lying round   i have been stuck with 2018 late case pegwarmers for the past month
  apparently thats the short card they recently stocked
heres some m2 badassery  its not even a chase piece
where can i find info about m2 chases both walmarts near me are fucking piled with the stuff and ive started to develop an appreciation for it
its hard to find rx7 fc stuff anyone know where i can find offbrands/chinese whatever im not from around here
september2  all my spots still dragging out 2018 cases    hot wheels has a wide bodykit one that looks bretty spoilerbad/spoiler in my humble opinion  you need to specify region if you want retailers
  do you mean this one this is an fb and the newer looking one is the fd im looking for the generation in between and retailers dont matter ill pay anything for car and shipping online
  pic related fc
  my bad no idea why i though it was the fc  i did a quick search i am no expert either but i found some here    no pictures though  and some ebay stuff from tomica        i just looked for tomica rx7 fc or japanese diecast  it also depends what scale you want and if you want to assemble it yourself then you have to look for scale model
  thanks anon
  basically the only thing you need to know is that if the production  is 1000 or lower or it has a sticker saying chase then you have yourself a chase  the new coca cola set has stickers  everything else will have low numbers such as 750 or 250    todays ride along is from the newest hot wheels b case
snake  mongoose car culture sets are selling like hot cakes  and they just announced the next wave hold onto your asses
i really need a nice die cast dodge charger pic semi related dukes flavoring not required but the wheels are the best wheels for the charger ever      however i could be open to larger than hot wheels standard so up to this size 132 would be good but cant be a slot car theyre lame if you dont have a track to run them on      what are my best options already got the ghost rider hot wheels and a couple charger 500s
  i think their team transport is great fresh idea nice take on car culture just hope they will not overdo it
  they could improve it by starting to shipping them to mainland europe
  yeah thats for sure
not really hot wheels but i figured these would fit the thread as well got this set earlier today
  these look extremely cool whats that
  muscle machines/tamiya brand  
  how do i get them whats that club stuff is all about where to press to order them
  i think you can get them on ebay theyre very old items iirc they were released ten years ago i think i also saw some pop up on mandarake luckily the ones i got were from a local seller
  ahh i see thats a shame
  how much you did end up paying
new matchbox 5 pack with a purple ute
  thats a pretty good 5 pack excluding the panamera  pity none of the stores around me carry matchbox
  bre datsun 510  my god i can only imagine the absurd prices of these things the scalpers are going to charge  also i wish hotwheels would also license real truck models to use with the team transports cant have it all but it would be a nice thing to have
  also i wish hotwheels would also license real truck models to use with the team transports  there was one in the first case vw t2 if i am not mistaken
  around 38 usd for all 6
looks like the pace car from last year will be a police model for the 2019 set
  this is completely unexpected
  i mean what else could they do with lamborghini with lights on top pace car police car and thats about it
  a fire car i admit the concept of fire sportscar is pretty weird but a police one is already pushing it
  police car is for all us nfs autismos
went to vegas over the weekend this is all i came away with thought id shared my modest haul here
  highway patrols  or just your regular dubai cops
  nice skyline but i liked my red r30 better
  if i ever find it ill pick it up but i think i prefer the white/black version personally
all r30s are trash until they release a car culture one with a metal base and real riders
this came in today shipped it unregistered sal and assumed it was lost got my shipping notification on 10/13
  unregistered sal  madman
  i felt like rolling the dice for some reason i always do ems or air small packet and wanted to see the difference
    the fd will look nice next to this love the packaging detail on these would never pay this much for 1/64 ever again though i just love the 787b
  if you want to put skylines  trash together try the 2003 coupe 350 which later became the infiniti g35 in the us
as far as hot wheels these were my last two pickups i think one of the stockers found someones stash and put these back on the pegs
  the 350/g35 shouldnt have been labeled a skyline its a luxury version of the z which has an awd option for those in a areas that need it
  whered you find it never seen that
  is that batmobile a hot wheels original design or what
why did this have to be yellowof all colors    
  hating on pussy magnet yellow  lmao what a virgin
  walmart / target
found this at a salvation army
  from the back of the 2019 card  born 2019 el segundo ca  designer hot wheels  batman streaks through gotham city in this allnew for 2019 takes on the batmobile by hot wheels its armed to the grille with hidden missiles lasers and other hightech weaponry check out the rounded hood vents and the four gigantic rocket thrusters pointing out of the back   it is apparently
still no a case anywhere  anyone else from europe have you gotten yours ukrainebro
  yea its weird too i almost didnt buy it but i have almost one of every batmoblie design
  cool little guy   would be nice if we got more vintage f1s or indys
  it does remind me of the batman 2004 version but in blue its an original design but this aint the first time hw did their version of the batmobile
  ukrainebro  last time i checked about a week ago  nothing tomorrow gonna check again
  my main spot has a cheeky promotion of  buy 3 get a golden black one  that ends on 26th  so 27th might be the magic date for me
  same promo here  dont want to bother with it for now
  neither do i nothing i want is on the pegs at the moment
    i have the same model in mint condition  guaranteed for life is making me laugh though considering how easy it is to bend axles those openwheelers
  whats the gold model    a collectibles shop opened up down the street from me tons of funko junk but a small section of older hot wheels i snagged a couple keepers the barracuda is a funny car that opens up
  these
  nice i know a hobby shop from outta town where they sold some old hot wheels ive posted several pics of the ones i collected there like the chapparal 2d the dragon wagons dragster and spent 10 on an atomix car it came with a free bogstandard hw
  removed  welp
  i like that batmobile is it from something or an og
    i like findind classic race cars
  oh right bummer did you ask them about the gold camaro chase from that set or have the employees already scalped it
  i dont think employees30 year old ladies  care that much about some toy cars  i havent bought any because there is absolutely nothing i want left on the pegs from mainline so i have not had the chance to ask  a case still mia i suspect they will craft them open after the promo ends
  been waiting for this since the pace car model came out
  why in the name of fuck they have to stick that thing in on the bed it would be a great model otherwise
  well this is one of the three versions of the el camino the old model had a wing  engine on the bed this one had part of the bed covered solid  a different engine and the last one had none apart from the bed being covered
e24 or e34 when
i didnt like the orange/green flamed one from a while back but i am taking a liking to the metalflake purple theyve been using recently
  trans neon orange window
  got 2 of those 787bs renown and the white/blue    kinda feel like theyre pretty overpriced maybe i shouldve gotten the kyoshos instead
  called a funny car  not actually funny or anything comedic  jesus who came up with this term been a mystery since i was a kid wasnt drag cars seem too much or something
see that mainspot has restocked from far  its another 2018 p/q case  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  nah its not a drag car per se  its a dragster with a shell plastic most of the times on top of it that resembles stock production car thats what so funny about them
  i remember having the takata nsx and wedsport celica as a kid good shit anon
    i went and found one today after seeing/asking about it here i like it a lot actually its kind of a mix of the tas the batman and arkham asylum batmobiles always nice to see bat vehicles in colors that arent black too
  i have the arkham knight batmobile in a slight green color and the 1989 batmobile in grey
where the fuck can i get a clamp it
  toys r us oh wait youre fucked that thing looks incredibly useful though        love funny cars
  the base of this model just says snake hw vintage i know its a mainline but thats pretty neat
are first editions considered to be a part of mainline if so 99 mainline was fucking incredible
can anyone tell me more about these
d case leaks when
  last night  
  dont open em
  datsun nova and crx  nice now if i only local retailers would start putting up 2019 stuff
  wasnt planning to  are they valuable got all of them  pack of nascar playing cards fridge magnet three pens with signs of race drivers and some thing with number 18 for slightly over ten bucks i think
i work for a thrift store and i have a lot of fun going through toy car donations    there is something really exciting coming across ones you like
    those nascar are pretty cool definitely do not open them unless you are setting up a diorama value wise i have no clue    heres walmarts 2018 winter set some decent fantasy models i guess
gas gas gas im gonna step on the gas
  my favorite of the set
  nice mr2 ye got there i still have it after all these years
    why are you keep telling me to not open them if they arent known valuable cars whats so sacred about cars in blisters
  turnleft is worth fuck all just open them and enjoy them
  jackhammer looks like someone took the ss wagon model and squashed it
bump      that or it could be a chevy nomadbased wagon
good luck post for a case at my main spot tomorrow bros
im gonna need a bigger shelf
  another pic
  but wait theres more
heres an archaelogical find from the depth of my sisters toy bin a johnny lightning 65 corvette c2 well its actually the 64 vette since the side paneling  back window matches the resemblance    yeah the condition is shit but i had this since 2005 i dunno the wheels are fucking horrendous theres a lot of chipped painting and the base was rough around the edges good news is that the hood still works
        i commend the collection mate but you really need to get a new way to displayingno offense at allbut that looks pretty bad id really think about investing in acrylic display cases its going to cost a lot im not going to lie but for the amount of cars you have they look good you want to put the effort/money into making sure theyre displayed nicely
look at these fucking pegwarmers
  he probably is mentally challenged and it has simply been a battle to keep them this clean
      yeesh fuckin hot wheels collectors every time
      all those shitty fantasy castings
  he hates fantasy models
  just the shitty ones
  which ones are shitty
  most of them
flea market find opened to get some air on the ride today
  looks like something out of the redline movie
  i think ive seen those before but without the wheelie bar
    this is the first edition version of fright bike other versions have different color plastic bodies really sweet ride    this autoworld ford gt40 just showed up at most walmarts its very detailed but it is tiny as fuck the wheels are a highlight
  does this say 2019 anywhere on the car
  i will have to look closer when i get home    the remains of a c case that hit target this morning notice the red series momo
  nice to see the rapid responder is back its been a couple years since the last one
  we dont have these here in france   theyre so cool man
  i finally get my answer of whether car culture is an american only thing or do we in the eastern europe just get snubbed  on an unrelated note have you gotten any of the 2019 cases in fronc
  car culture is a thing here but most of our car freaks tend to prefer modern affordable sports cars like the renault sports peugeot sports cars golf gti most of them are actually hatchbacks im not a big fan  on the other hand i sometimes buy hot wheels for myself my gf is ok with it but i dont expose them on a shelf in our flat because im not sure what my friends would think of it except for the closest ones who know like when i bought a skyline gtr33 a couple of months ago and a friend of mine saw it i tried to pretend it was a key ornament you know those things you can put on your keys he didnt believe me but told me it was okay i just discovered this part of 4chan and im amazed by the cool ones you guys can get
  car culture as the hot wheels premium model line not car culture as in /o/  i dont really care anymore about hiding it i go in and there are models i want i cop them if there are kids in the aisle ill go to a different part of the shop and come back after while so they can pick what they want i personally go for classic 60s to 70s cars and some classics which most kids dont really care about
  i personally go for 60s to 70s cars and the iconic cars
  oh my bad haha   here the collectors prefer the bigger models 1/32 scale are the best sellers  hot wheels are not seen as potential collectors or at least im not aware of it   i like the classical models too especially the americans ones absolute favorite cars in my mind but i sometimes like to go for a japan model and i also own a delorean replica from the first bttf movie couldnt resist haha  i wish there was a mad max hit wheels series but i never heard of it on the web unfortunately
  they you have nothing to worry about  our american colleagues have problems with scalpers buying up the premium brands but it seems that europe at least mainland europe doesnt even get them  i too have not felt any major rush for hot wheels here but i did really start going at it more systematically just as 2018 batches came to an end  there is a ford falcon xc that occasionally comes up but i too am not aware of any series  besides that its late here so this will be my last reply for today  stick around this thread its somewhat slow but still a nice place to catch up with
i used to have a lot of hot wheels many of them cost a lot of money now but i forgot where i put the bag
found at kroger in geoffreys toy box this wasnt even half of them
  this is the one you want super detailed for a matchbox car i buy them when i can find them
  plastic base  pass
  dont bother if theyre in a bag well unless you want to show off
  tell us when you find black 50th favorites gassers at krogers those are 40 each online right now      i grab those every time i see them the wheels are awesome for swaps
alright anyone got any formula 164s at home    not necessarily hw since they have 3 molds only gp2009 which is a 00 chasis older indycar and some futuro shit even unlicensed
  from actual f1 cars no the only f1 i have was tarmac attack
  to me not being in any comic or film totally kills the collect value also the design its a little retarded and we had a batmobile overdose in 2018 its sad they make this full metal when other better models are plastic
lads what the fuck is this gt now  50th favs are only three 510 and about a thousand of fords
  what are these
  theyre airplanes you colossal retard
  matchbox has been making those for a long time i didnt know hw is in on them too  if you want cool airplanes check out the adventure force tailwinds set at walmart really cheap and true castings of real planes    pic is new drag strip demons just landed in my target
almost december  2019 cases still mia  main spot keeps restocking 2018 mainlines  when will it end bros
my tru stocked some a  b cases  hell yeah motherfucker
  the only f1esque car i have is carbide
i always pick up a few nascars at the flea market and free them
zoom zoom motherfucker my local walmart just stocked these along with the disney ones i also have the cobra daytona coupe but ill wait for that on christmas      i used to have some acceleracers back when i was a kid my favourite was the bassline also that name to me kept referring back to one of the robot wars robots then add spinnah at the end
  also the back can be popped off dont like the wing on this one doesnt seem to be in proportion as it was slanted
oh yeah nissan made things beyond the skyline
  that should be a then and now i know i have an old yellow one in storage still want a real one
anyone here have some nice jdm collections
  whats up with crooked wings on these
  wouldnt mind a nonbodykit fairlady unless you meant 370z
  
  yea i know hotwheels has a mold for them its just that recently only fairladies i see are the widekit ones
  they get bent by the card
  seems fair but the wing is wide as the car itself possibly mediocre packaging but you could reshape the wing but im aint risking that
spotted the batmobile while passing thru the hot wheels aisle and had to grab it picked up a couple other guys that seemed neat while i was at it the poor sideways jp explorer was particularly calling out for help freeing him from his mispackaged hell haha
  all super neat cars particularly impressed with the jp explorer
  those 50th anniversary wheels were a mistake
looks like the last 2018 kday and possibly last kday ever got pushed a week later
any of yall homies into mad max style customs or gaslands    gaslands is a /tg/ style miniature game that uses customized hot wheels cars to play out road warrior battles    not talking about the /tg/ shit just strictly talking about frankensteining the shit out of cars    pic related is a customized poison ivy from metal machines by zuru an offbrand die cast manufacturer you can get at target
  there is that one guy on youtube who occasionally makes one
  blue flake on the tas batmobile yuck
  i agree
  feels good to finally finish the set
      very nice
  oh man thats one worth getting
now that the dust has settled should i be getting storm collectables or should figuarts if i am to start my street fighter collection
they both are quality lines with a few shortcomings   if you want to mix and match with other 1/12 scale figures and you dont mind a slightly anime look shf are the way to go theyre also less expensive   storm are really nice but have a scale all their own some people find their female headsculpts unattractive i happen to like them but to each their own
collectables    holy fuck
  collectables   items able to collected  no problem here
  depends on which one you like better or which other street fighter figures you want to get for some characters your only options come from one toyline rather than the other like figuarts being the one with rmika cammy and blanka and sc being the only one with mbison alex and zangief  but if youre some basic bitch that only wanted the shotoshits then just kill yourself to begin with sempai
  figuarts the storm collectible have some serious qc issues m bison with his shoulders that come broken in the box as an example are really weirdly scaled and their female characters are a joke chunli is especially bad
  calling shf 1/12 and sc nonscale  its actually the other way around shf is always free scale never officially 1/12 you will never see 1/12 scale printed on any of their products in this line  sc is the real 1/12 scale as comparison see bandais figurerise standard plastic kit line actual 1/12 scale those too are bigger than shf op if you want your sf figures to play with other nonscale figure lines like shf figma revo etc mostly japan figures get shfotherwise sc for actual 1/12 lines scales well with neca line too
scs actually look like they came out of the video game figuarts are generic anime figures putting them in the same ranking as jazwares style    so its no contest if you like quality sculpts
  fuck off subjectanon havent you got to check to see if your toys are still intact from where youve shoved them in a box like an autistic child
  except sc is nowhere near 1/12 unless ryu is like 78 feet tall
  so its no contest if you like quality sculpts
  neca  kek
  you should stop trolling threads just because you dont like that there are a lot of people on /toy/ who expect their toys to have quality sculpts
  you should stop calling everyone who finds your faggotry annoying trolls
  shf is not 1/12 either all sf characters within shf doesnt scale with each other
op just get what you like asking for opinions here is a mistake
  it is whilst subjectanons around thats for certain
  yeah boi  i fucking knew it
  op just get what you like asking for opinions here is a mistake  thats not true    you can ask for opinions as long as its not about certain japanese brands because if you dont choose their brand youre going to rile up the nest
  implying spergs like subjectanon dont chimp out and cry about weeaboos if you dont sing the praises of their favourite brands specifically hasbro mcfarlane mezco and sc  kek
  no matter what they say on the box  shf chun li is exactly 1/12  sc chun li is exactly 1/10
  come on even you dont really believe this people call out things for being shit and theres always going to be someone who thinks something you like is shit but theres only one person who repeatedly spergs out whenever someone says anything negative about his favourite brands and most of the shitting on said figures after that is because this person continues to be such a sperg    try and pass the blame all you like but no one and i mean no one is buying it anyone with eyes sees what happens in these threads and its not just a single person or even a small group who thinks youre a total fuckwit with zero worthwhile input
  youre just blind if you dont notice how gigantic the shitstorms get if you dont like certain brand  even the sf threads got shitstormed because of this hence people posting shoops like this to pretend its a bad figure     theres a huge difference been hasbros psylocke not being liked when it was revealed and when revoltechs psylocke was not liked   mostly unfavorable views with no shitstorm during sdcc reveal vs 2 entire threads of nothing but shitstorming and trolling  nevermind the fact of how peaceful these threads were before certain companies got the license despite the license already being shared with various other companies like diamond even with people saying how they liked the toy biz figures better the difference is like night and day    do you even remember figuarts cammy a head rolled for that because of how the thread was pruned because of how biased they were    so im going to call you a newfag because you obviously werent here for that or noticed how other threads were before
  people shit on shfs all the time in the figuarts threads hell there was just a load of big reveals with negative opinions being posted about most of them opinions differ and some shit is thrown back and forth but no one flies into an autistic rage over it    people continue to post things mocking the sc chunli precisely because you or someone with similarly shitty opinions flies into autism fuelled rages whenever it happens its moderately hilarious
  theres a huge difference been hasbros psylocke not being liked when it was revealed and when revoltechs psylocke was not liked  maybe because hasbro psylocke is a lazy cheap piece of shit and revoltech psylocke isnt not to mention half the complaints over the revo were by one or two obsessed shitposters who basically didnt like it because muh brand and couldnt handle the bantz
  so you admit that theres trolling going on but pretend its not bad because autism  nice cognitive dissonance you got going there      cant handle the bantz  2 threads of it because of two people complaining about the revoltech  gee
  who said anything about it not being bad subjectanon and anyone who remotely agrees with his opinions are complete retards who derail every thread they touch because he cant handle someone disagreeing with him or saying something negative about his favourite brands of course people are trolling him theres no other way to approach him this point
  trolling  bad   where do you think you are
anon asks for an opinion  autists start a brand war     just another day here on toy
  the question is literally brand vs brand what do you expect to happen especially when subjectanon is still on full patrol in case someone says something mean about his gwenpool toy again
  thats amazing projecting especially considering the fact of the trolling taking place in this thread and how other threads turn to shitstorms without subjectanon being in it      not bizarroworld      except that never happened but i guess delusional shistormers like yourself just like blaming everything on other people
  its usually why i only frequent brand generals now a days but even on those there is no respite
  uhhhhhhhhhh le generic anime  theres nothing more brainlet in the world than people complaining about a japanese video game series created by japanese developers originally released in japan that the shf figures look too anime ivs and vs more western pandering artstyle really did a number on 09ers and zoomers i guess possibly consider suicide
  figuarts chun li doesnt even look like the picture you posted    quit defending generic anime style instead of demanding quality sculpts
  no one said figuarts was accurate even though it should be much more appealing to any actual sf fan versus scs trash im just making a point about the retarded rationalization its only weeb when its convenient to these retards     someone likes the shf one more weeb  proceeds to fire up the japanese machine to play street fighter a japanese developed video game that has always had generic japanese anime artstyle   its truly amusing how brainlet people are
  youre literally acting like an autist now and nobody has even done anything to warrant it
  no one said anything about weeaboos    just that its not based on anything but generic anime style which puts it in the same category as jazwares realistic generic style  generic as shit and a waste of a perfectly good license    stop reading insults that arent there overly defensive weeb
  who basically didnt like it because muh brand and couldnt handle the bantz  soooorevofags got it
  just that its not based on anything but generic anime style  generic anime has always been street fighters artstyle nothing about the official artwork i posted is anything but generic 09ers and zoomers that started playing with sfiv and enjoy storm are the only ones that actually think otherwise  stop reading insults that arent there overly defensive weeb  like i said amusing and brainlet
  no u  laughs in revolver joint
i prefer shf but have storm gief despite the size difference he works well with the shfs imo
  nah the art you posted is distinct whereas this is just generic     even if you want to say that this is distinct it still doesnt match the official arts style and youre just pretending to be autistic by not understanding that the faces look different
    its funny because ive mentioned this before and a certain youknowwho sperged out over it if youve watched enough youd know that sfs old art style isnt in any way unique its literally a generic anime style a better criticism is that they dont match the actual style of the artworks but youd be an idiot if you think that the sf artworks arent generic anime especially with how the female characters are drawn
    oh also storm gief while he looks great he falls apart if i move his joints even a little    its weird how the sf storm figures have so many qc issues when their other lines are great scorpion subzero and hollywood hogan are some of my favorites
  thats not generic by anime standards though and its just as distinct as the artworks posted before if thats generic then those artworks are just as generic youre better off saying that it doesnt match the official art style which is actually valid criticism
the only thing i dont like about the sc figures are the occasional qc issues ive barely played around with my akuma but because of the rubber chest piece the paint apps on the neck has started to rub off from me just posing his head around it sucks but thats what happens when you use material like that
  who cares about creating quality sculpts for the toys so that they look like they came out of the video game as long as long as i call all the art generic  
  nah the art you posted is distinct whereas this is just generic   nah it isnt pretty damn typical generic anime style for the 90s    it still doesnt match the official arts style  its overall more faithful to street fighters 90s generic anime style and generally more appealing to any oldschool sf fan the head is small like plenty of old chun li artwork and illustrations coupled with the more round feminine face sc is accurate to v and only v whereas figuarts is more faithful to the old generic anime style to say otherwise is fucking retarded no other artwork of chun li looks closer to the storm figures compared to figuarts other than sfv every other artwork and game of sf presiv leans towards generic anime sfv fans should stick to storm the game is garbage the artstyle is western pandering and the game is trash and the line accurately represents it any other sf fan should get figuarts  and youre just pretending to be autistic by not understanding that the faces look different  nah its not my fault you like manjawed women and are upset over generic anime and weebs whilst arguing over a figure line based on a japanese video game developed by japanese and marketed towards japanese with a 90s typical anime artstyle on 4chan always amusing and brainlet
  nice projection why dont you actually try to argue something instead of greentexting like an autist on steroids
  funny how no one replies to this its the only thing thats stopping me from getting more sc figures
  nah it isnt  ok so youre just going to pretend that that chu li looks like the art you posted  im not going to argue with a literal delusional person   keep pretending your napolean or whatever you do to cope with your shitty life      if i was projecting id be pretending that you also like your toys to have quality sculpts instead of lapping up whatever your favorite brand does and arguing only autists care for their toys to look like the license
  delusional  kek i thought it was delusionment
  subjectanon wont reply to it because even he knows its true he doesnt mention it because it pretty much breaks down his argument in favor of sc
daily reminder that subjectanon  is a /co/cksucker  treats his toys like shit throwing them into boxes like old socks and thinks its their fault when they break  complains about accuracy despite preferring the monstrously inaccurate mcfarlane queen to the superior neca version and buying things he doesnt know anything about  called starcraft figures warhammer toys  thinks coathangers are better stands than actual stands  believes any toy that costs more than an ml is overpriced yet accuses people who use detolfs of being poorfags  bought mcfarlane bootlego fnaf steven universe and rick and morty shit  thinks 90s era comics/rob liefeld shit was very mature and serious  believes he has uppertier looks because of on time he was allegedly hit on by a gay guy  is a literal cuckold
  believes he has uppertier looks because of on time he was allegedly hit on by a gay guy  he was very proud of it too which makes it even more hilarious
  you must buy figures based on sfv with bad paint apps and qc issues in a bad scale or you are a shit human being and most importantly you arent a true fan of sf
  checked and kekd
      always great to see how you cant defend your poorly sculpted toys and just revert to being little kids needing to fill their strawman
  daily reminder that you  suck cock  shitpost daily  ruin every single thread by starting this subjectanon bullshit  need to fuck off
      seething
  ruin every single thread by starting this subjectanon bullshit  i mean pretty sure thats subjectanon himself whos starting the bullshit
  no fuckhead its you its always you you cant let anything slide you cant let any pose go unbitched at it fucking doesnt matter what he does youre here to shit up the thread even more fuck you
  im sick of it  then leave    nice samefagging
  the point being made is that scs are fucking huge like gigantic compared to what the normal size of 1/12 figures are normally shit is humongous
  fuck you and kill yourself youre worse than subjectanon ever was
  better plan why dont you grow up
    absolutely anally annihilated
  answers all subjectanon posts thus proving him right  cant fucking exist sylviahoeks subjectanon dciconsclearplastic ad necafag just cant stop
  you trolls are sad
  not as sad as the people who get upset about le icky trolls on a cambodian basketweaving forum
  fuck off already you have no life
  says the guy this angry because someone is willing to call out subjectanon
  youre not calling out anyone youre not accomplishing anything you fucking simpleton you are keeping the fights going and thats all youve ever wanted to do you arent doing the board a favor at all but youre too stupid to realize that
  im accomplishing more than you are
  you have a diseased brain of course you think that way
  you sound legitimately mad its not good for you to get this angry about such trivial shit you know
this thread is now officially retarded
  it lasted six posts before subjectautist reared his ugly head again
  literally all your fault for starting it
so i guess subjectautists new gimmick is saying its everyone elses fault what a fucking faggot if anyone deserves to have their hands amputated its him
  last six posts before someone says that sculpt quality matters  such shitposting for wanting figures to look like the license theyre from huh    maybe if your favorite company actually did accurate sculpts you wouldnt be so sensitive to your figures looking generic    or you can be like me picking and choosing the best not caring about the brand and just enjoying great toys    ps check out my ryu figure pretty bad likeness but you wont see me lie its great or that sculpt doesnt matter like you guys desperately do i got it because i just thought itd be cool to interact with the rest of my figures
  the sculpt quality is great you just have shit taste and poor eyesight
  i like the part where you continue to blame someone for your shitposting
  that carelessly thrown together pile of toys  just
  doesnt look like what its based on  quality sculpting  i guess in your world this would be a quality reproduction
  all those figures are made of high quality plastic and paint so theyre perfectly safe unlike diecast crap thatll chip or have the paint rubbed off
  man i feel bad for those toys what kind of dipshit owner throws them all in a pile like that
  if its not exactly how i say it should look then its trash  you might just be an autistic child though judging by how you treat your toys and then attempt to justify it that wouldnt surprise me at all
  yeah this isnt new subjectanon always thinks in a zerosum scale i genuinely think he has some form of autism or hes on the spectrum if that sounds more appropriate
  youre austic for expecting 50 collectors toys to have collector quality features most other collector companies do feature  but they didnt even try hence my comparison with the jazwares figures     though to be fair a lot of the sf2 japanese art is on the realistic side so i guess jazwares did put more effort into their sculpts than bandai did    and can you tell me which lines you own that youre so fearful will be damaged by being put in a pile like that they must be pretty shit quality if you think im doing something wrong with actual great quality toys
  not that anon but i own a lot of figmas and i wouldnt treat them like that at all especially since figma sculpt work can chip and paint apps can be prone to being rubbed off if youre not careful colormolded stuff like samus is perfectly fine though i speak from a lot of experience with handling them mind you so im not even being an asshole about this treat your figma with better care if you want them to survive
  earlier figmas were that way but theyve improved a lot
   collector quality features  lmao what is this even supposed to mean the sf figuarts have good articulation are built well and with the exception of cammy look good yes theyre not 100 detailprecise to one particular instance of the characters appearance but given how fucking inconsistent the sf designs are chunlis only consistent facial design feature is cute anime face who cares if you honestly think that not 100 adhering to one specific depiction completely ruins an otherwise nicelooking nicely made figure then yes you have autism   so i guess jazwares did put more effort into their sculpts than bandai did  lol dude you really are a spectacularly shitty troll  and can you tell me which lines you own that youre so fearful will be damaged by being put in a pile like that  literally any of them collectors toys are designed to look good and pose well first and foremost because they dont expect people to throw them in a pile like a literal child sometimes its just a design thing eva unit 01s horn is always going to be fragile due to being thin and pointy short of making it out of a warpingprone rubbery plastic
  theyre not ridiculously fragile its true but theyre still display pieces and not childrens toys throwing them in a pile especially ones with complex paint apps or pointy bits is a ticket to sadtown
  i think youre the one acting like an autist
        holy shit is subjectanon using one of those dubs/get scripts what a pathetic loser
  theyve improved a lot in terms of durability and sturdiness yes but i wouldnt put them in a pile like that since theyre still prone to have stuff chipped off especially when it comes to details like the hair pieces protruding parts or segments with actual paint apps etc      pretty much its not like theyll crumble in your hands but purposefully being haphazard in handling them can lend to breakages if youre not careful at all
  how do you manage to live with a zerosum mindset its no wonder youre so autistic about your toy discussions and always feel the need to prove yourself right
  i heard hes at fault for all the famine in the world too grrrrr hes so evil hes also trump grrr
  hes not evil hes just hilariously pathetic
  kind of like you its a wonder you dont all get along
  back for more are you
  at least we both agree that hes pathetic
  i agree that youre part of the reason this board is going down the drain
daily reminder that subjectanon cannot pose to save his life
  you cant agree about a point with someone if they never mentioned that point in the first place so i dont where youre getting that reiterating what i said i agree with your statement implying that subjectanon is truly pathetic
  i agree youre a shitposter and destroying this board with every single post you make you might honestly be worst than subjectanon greg anyone ever youre scum i agree
  i remember subjectanon thought that this one figure had great range some space marine thing only to get called out that the figure he posted literally had to have its knees broken to achieve said range and it was practically customized into a statue good times were had
  i agree  who are you agreeing with yourself thats kind of sad
  ohohohoho looks like you have been coaxed into a snafu i was the one youve been arguing with this whole time not him it would seem there is in fact more than one person who thinks subjectanon needs to get a life
its a lets bully subjectanon episode
  oh god i remember that that was a kek and a half
  kek i thought you wouldnt reply to him so i wanted to join in and continue the convo
 lmao what is this even supposed to mean  i take it you dont buy a lot of toys huh    go look at mafex figma neca nonyamaguchi revoltechs mezco and a lot of other collector companies who sell toys that look like the license theyre using     if you honestly think that not 100 adhering to one specific depiction completely ruins an otherwise nicelooking  im saying that collector companies like the ones stated above do make an effort to look like the source material kid toy companies like mattel hasbro and jazwares dont put that amount of effort usually which again is why i compared bandais sf line to jazwares  if you like the toys good for you just like how i like my hasbro ryu but again im not going to lie and pretend its a collector quality sculpt like you keep on trying to do  generic styles are for kid toys great likeness to the license is what collector lines have been giving us since collector companies upped their game in the 00s    literally any of them  how strange that all those figures in that pile have no damage  youre likely just lying and are embarassed that your toys are so shit hence not giving me any examples of the toys that have such shit paint and bad plastic that theyll get damaged from just laying there
  ohohohoho looks like youre an autistic child it looks like you need to kill yourself and save the board from having to listen to you further
  neca  hahahahahahahahaha  nonyamaguchi revoltechs  couldnt resist getting one in at big bad yamaguchi could you what a pleb  mezco  what those horrendous meme toys with shitty cloth pyjamas and awful qc  and a lot of other collector companies who sell toys that look like the license theyre using  what you mean like figuarts  hurr something something it has to look exactly like the source material or its kiddy crap  oh subjectanon you and your blackandwhite thinking and inability to see in shades of grey what a tool  kid toy companieslike hasbro  who are you and what have you done with the real hasbrofellating subjectanon still nice of you to finally admit that hasbro are an absolute garbagetier company that dont belong in any serious collection  youre likely just lying  no i just dont throw my collection in a pile like a mongoloid
  absolutely seething
  found the rampaging retard
  found the endlessly bootyblasted assclown
  they really are the best episodes remember that one where he accidentally posted precure nappy porn
  fucking kek why are you so mad did your gay boyfriend break up with you or something
  /pol/tatd
this whole thread
  fucking what do we have all is retarded mishaps on record
  alas i think the thread got purged pretty quickly after that and i foolishly forgot to take screencaps i was too busy chasing my sides around the room but it was quite truly hilarious iirc it was a figuarts thread
  i havent laughed so hard in such a long time holy fucking hell
  you got the one of his collection around a messy stack of books
  is this the one
  generic anime style    literally meaningless
  only if youre a weeb
  ah yes the classic everyone i dont like is a weeb argument courtesy of a westaboo who thinks that 90s capeshit was serious and mature
  nah there is a bookcase in the back but a pile of books in the foreground with his figures posed around them not interacting with the books though      not convinced its sa though
  youre projecting again
  projecting  nigga i really dont care about capeshit why would i be projecting that onto anyone retard
  this was it another one of subjectanons collection
  a retard calling other people retard  hilarious
another one he posted
  pretty sad that you keep on avoiding telling me which toys you own are so shitty that youre afraid of telling me how messed up they get just by being touched by another toy    but please keep on paying 50 for toys that cant even look like the license while most other companies actually do and defending a shitty practice of not even trying
fun fact subjectanon only turned down the gay dude in the vain hope that his one true love would come and sweep him off his feet sadly chugli suffered a fatal aneurysm on one of her happy powder times so hell never be with her now
  thats just it none of my toys are shitty im just not in the habit of throwing figmas and the like around like childrens toys not going to treat my precious collection like dirt to satisfy you subjectanon 
  yeah you guys just keep proving that youre worse than he is no normal person would have saved all this out of such spite
  guy has decent taste in comics though
  or i just found it with a quick minute search on the archive
  suuure    or are you telling me that youre paranoid about your toys and baby them because of your ocd    but im asking a liar who needs to fantasize to feel better about yourself and your collection with the constant need to shitpost and derail threads because someone said that 50 toys shouldnt have low quality sculpts like this
  or are you telling me that youre paranoid about your toys and baby them because of your ocd  so treating your belongings with respect and care is ocd now wew lad  low quality sculpts  pic unrelated huh
  no normal person would have spent a decade trolling a forum for toys on an indonesian crab sculpting site
 so treating your belongings with respect and care is ocd now wew lad  toys  with respect   i think were beyond ocd and into a real mental illness if you think a toy should be respected or not  toys arent as delicate as they seem to whisper to you    pic unrelated huh  if you think thats unrelated you need to see what the art from the game looks like  again lots of other companies are able to produce higher quality sculpts again what bandais sf line does is no better than the generic shit jazware produces or even sota      no ones trolling youre just an sensitive baby who gets angry not everyone shares your warped views
  taking everything absolutely 100 literally  yeah youre autistic  again what bandais sf line does is no better than the generic shit jazware produces or even sota  never mind this goes beyond autism and into downs territory i should feel bad for picking on a disabled child and yeti dont
  sensitive baby who gets angry not everyone shares your warped views  what a perfectly apt description of yourself bravo
  so youre still a spiteful autist
  ok so youre just going to pretend that that chu li looks like the art you posted  i dont need to regurgitate my point again because you obviously cant read or comprehend anything  to cope with your shitty life  lmao alright nigger its just toys japanese toys from a japanese video game that always has had generic as sin 90s anime artstyle yikes  if i was projecting  whatever you do to cope with your shitty life  if i was projecting  projecting  lmao
  i dunno i think its more autistic that youre freaking out because i dont baby my toys like you do theyre not made of diecast so theyre jsut fine but you continue posting about it like its a big thing   whys that  sure is anger that not everyone does things the same as you    this goes beyond autism and into downs territory  thats sad that you think companies who do a great job at doing high quality sculpts for the purpose of impressing collectors who expect quality sculpts is somehow worthy of down syndrome and autistism name calling  only in your fantasy world do collectors just care about the brand name and should expect low end sculpts like this i mean at least when a company like sota or takara fudges it up theyre only charging you like 10
shfs are cheaperlooking with the bare minimal details in the outfits zero color shading ugly cuts for articulation and shinier plastic finish on some of them   storms at least have more details in the sculpt more detailed color shading less ugly cuts for joints except the knee joints especially when shf and storm ryu are retailed for around the same price storms just looks more like a higherend figure  but if youre looking for figures to play around with and dont care much for how good the figure looks go for shf    also im surprised once again with how many people are complaining about the qc i have storm ryu hot ryu akuma arcade ver and zangief and have had no qc issues at all aside from some of zangiefs brown chest hair rubbing a bit of brown to the chest skin thats covered
  youre just an sensitive baby who gets angry not everyone shares your warped views    well this explains your entire lack of selfawareness at how much you shit up threads     would you be up for an overall toyline discussion general where we can contain this type of discussion instead of having them over multiple different other generals
  i love how glib you are but you expect me to somehow know what youer talking about because i call someone a sensitive whiny baby   im all for self improvement but when people just do middle school insults its hard to take you guys serious nothing but angry trolling because you simply dont like anyone criticizing your brand    would you be up for an overall toyline discussion general where we can contain this type of discussion instead of having them over multiple different other generals  theres nothing to really discuss when people just start getting butthurt the minute anyone says anything negative about their brand itd be nothing but a shitstorm that only creates ammo where the trolls will take it to another thread    you might as well ask a room full of monkeys to type a single word
  itd be nothing but a shitstorm that only creates ammo where the trolls will take it to another thread  so just like this thread then
  stop you lost already
  personal preference shoots me over to the shf
  theres that other thread too    i mean one other guy is still upset because i enlightened him about how diecast is a cost cutting method he refuses to understand that a company would charge him extra because companies know that consumers will think that weight/size is more expensive when thats usually the opposite
  man if db didnt have a fighting game out right now then there might have been a chance of us getting this kind of crossover thing as a bunch of skins and stuff  17 chun li  goku ryu  vegeta ken  piccolo dhalsim  cell mbison  bulma cammy  broly abigail
  sc  quality sculpts  apex kek  also i love how you continue to completely defeat your own points by posting examples of muh shitty sculpts that look anything but
  stop biting the bait faggot
theres some new news right  sas official site   search term for sas 超像可動  sas list   sas reviews bloglivedoorjp/hacchaka/archives/cat_50046494html  jojo 101   sas sound plate list   where to find 
do people do anything with their boxes
  goddamn it if youre gonna make a new thread at least put the new wf stuff in the op
  i keep em sort of like that but less organized its like a stack next to my bookshelf
  the funny thing is that i have even more sas boxes that shelf isnt big enough for everything
  finally a new thread    i like to keep mine in my closet but then again i still have a pretty small collection i keep them to store their parts
did anyone here ever buy those sas big figures of jotaro or star platinum
what was the bike that josuke used to escape highway star are there any models for it that is too scale with sas
just got my abbacchio and moody blues and while they look stunning abbacchios neck barely moves and his waist is completely static is it just how he is because of the coat   also does anyone know if its possible to take off the moody blues heads from their necks i was kinda thinking of putting abbas alternate head on it but i need a neck
    sas ruby rose for an actually pretty decent price the lowest ive seen her being sold for
  for abbacchios neck and waist if you want them to move try putting them in somewhat very warm water and no im pretty sure medicos doesnt do that with their necks
anyone have any good pose ideas for johnny i just finished part 7 and have a few in mind but a lot of the official art is just kind of bland
  try doing something with him being upside down there arent many of him in such a position
does anyone have a picture of part 1 1st dios head the blonde one on dio 2nds body i need to know if its worth wasting a lot of money
  ive wanted to do this for a while
  now do the reverse
so uh whats the new news i kinda lost interest in jjba and will probably sell everything i have except for part 6 stuff but if they announced something i care about i might be interested
  oh my god thats too strong thanks guess i have to spend upwards of 100 now
  well theyre doing rereleases of the part 5 crew and the main jojos dont know about their stands though and a pink jotaro got announced articulations the same    thats about it from the top of my head
  honestly mustard dio is still an atrocity in my opinion
  i use them for risers lol
  kind of this  i still love the series especially parts 6 and 7 but postanime meme overload and the fact that the entire country of origin hates my favorite parts too much to allow a satisfactory amount of merchandise for them has really burnt me out on the series
  there any pics of the pink jotaro
  
got el presidente but need d4c have they not done a wide release or am i stuck paying 150 was there a preorder or a raffle sorry im out of the loop been a busy semester hes the last figure thats essential for me
  they will eventually do a retail release for d4c but as of now the only ones on the market is the wf edition
  whew thanks anon i wouldve dropped the money immediately do we have any idea if it will be the same colors baby blue and pink are a must
  if johnny and valentines release is anything to go off of itll be the same as the wf colors
  i keep all my boxes in a storage box  my gf always throws her boxes away and keeps the spare parts in plastic baggies i think its degenerate
  it absolutely is
      i settled for this pose
    i keep all of the accessories in cases like this
    and i stuff the boxes in the closet
      my nigga damn basic as it might sound but thats goals the pose looks great
  is that the retail release of johnny
anyone know when bucciarati is rereleased on amiami or anywhere
      according to medicos twitter hell go up at the end of the month
  thank you anon
  i hope they fix the box mistake
pink jotaro announced for winter wonfes 2019  thank you based medicos
  is that the retail release of johnny    yes
  slowpoke is also pink
  so they took greentaro painted him pink and slapped a price tag on him god damn these guys are lazy
  complete new figures are exclusive  lazy repaints of ridiculously outdated figures are exclusive  this is the worst fucking company
  so what exactly constitutes as a decent exclusive to you then
  certainly not absolutely everything but incomplete figures and rereleases  repaints are fine for that kind of thing but that jotaro has gotten all of the mileage it deserved and then some
  so they took bluetaro painted him green and slapped a price tag on him god damn these guys are lazy
i like jojo and these figures look great how do does the posability and quality compare to say sh figuarts dragon ball z line
  how do does the posability and quality compare to say sh figuarts dragon ball z line    more poseable in some aspects the elbow joints can swivel on each end connecting into the forearm and bicep as well as being double jointed the paintwork is among the best of any toy line they are truly action statues
  looks great where is the best place to buy these in the usa online
  for new figures sites like amiami and hobby link japan are your best bet    for used ones mandarake is the best nonproxy site but it can be a little hard to order off of if its your first time
  wow how did i just realize dio was wearing a tie the whole time
    i have a huge collection of both the sas and figuarts line and i can say that im less worried with figuarts when posing them the sas stuff is more highly regarded because of the fine paint and sculpt details leading me to be more careful when handling them
  so they took blacktaro painted him blue and slapped a price tag on him god damn these guys are lazy
  isnt this only really true for older releases new releases dont really live up to the same standard but theyre still good in most situations  and i gotta admit i like sas elbow articulation more than figma or figuarts
wait so i am looking at amiami and are most of the new ones just recolors of old figures dont know if theyre manga colors or something but i dont remember star platinum being reen dio wearing pink and killer queen being white
  yeah most figures of characters tend to be recolors that pink dio is the closest youll get to the anime version if thats that youre looking for there are two other colors of star platinum one being blue and another being purple like the anime white kq is just a recolor
fucking medicos i just want part 3 star plat smol
  like a nendo size whatcha mean anon
  i want them to rerelease more of their old stuff
  yeah but that would be a logical thing for them at least they are making a push during the part 5 adaptation personally it would be pretty nice if they made an updated sculpt of jotaro from his sas big design to the regular scale but god knows how long it would take them unless they surprise me at winter wf
  i would kill for a 6 inch jotaro with that sculpt the one i have now is great but that is a good sculpt
  no only gyro was really bad and johnny/valentine are a little off especially compared to previous figures newer stuff like white snake pucci rohan v3 etc are all fantastic and the brand new d4c and diego figures are just as good as the old stuff medicos just had a slump which paired with the slow release times lasted almost 2 years
bucciaratis up for preorder on amiami
  my sas boxes get their own closet
  mad lad
  that actually looks really aesthetically pleasing    thx
i just ordered gappy as well as soft and wet  i just looked up a review for soft  fuck
  whats wrong with him
  his articulation is apparently absolute shit  like almost star wars action figures shit
  oh damn like how its made or just how it cant move
thanks for all the info guys preordered this guy off amiami since most of the stuff was backordered will see how i like him in 2 months time and perhaps ill get more into the line still have to find more room to put all my figures and boxes but thats a question for another day
  i have his figure and hes nice i would recommend not putting the backpack on it just gets in the way of articulation the bigger peg to put on his stand was a bitch to get off once i put it on in my experience every figure is different but his head tends to pop off pretty easily and his torso was frozen so id recommend giving him a hot water bath to loosen up his joints if you pop on the head after the bath and let it cool itll stay on pretty nicely
  dont worry it seems a lot worse in reviews aside from the torso and elbows its almost decent also it makes up for it by being absolutely stunning paintwise
  knees and elbows are absolute shite
  well all he has to do is look cool next to the gapster and punch stuff so eh
  i was today years old when i realized this anon is a genius
  b l o n o
  if you live in a dump maybe
  how old is this base body now
  god his face is so retarded
  the stone ocean figures are probably some of the best articulated anime figures in existence
  
  the stone ocean figures are probably some of the best articulated anime figures in existence  i only have jolyne and stone free but i have to disagree  jolyne is only barely okay and a good part of the reason i never branched out past main characters and their stands
  aww thanks dude     its also nice that theres a little bit of jojo in every shelf 
  theyre way too distracting to be used as risers
  gyro is the most articulated sas only white snake comes close to the level part 2 is good too but engineering is pretty outdated by today standards i see why the dude would say part 6 is bretty good articulation wise
  if you taped some paper of your desired color over the box design it wouldnt be
hey i really want to get johnny but i dont know if i should try for the wf version or just get the retail version i just want tusk but i dont want to pay big bucks since i cant afford it    which should i get which one is worth it
posted in the bst but ill post here as well   looking to buy johnny d4c and gyro if youre willing to sell feel free to email me thanks
in regards to that jojo event thats going to be held in marui japan over the next couple of months theyve just announced some of the rereleases that will be on sale there they did say that theres going to be a whole bunch more in addition
  interesting choices for rereleases do we know if this will be available to the general public itll be nice to pick up a jolyne for nonrape prices
  im pretty sure its like 6 years
  do you have highway star rohan hes incredibly articulated i was blown away with him
  pink giorno  interesting i figured they wouldve rereleased the blue giorno 3rd
    3rd isnt the anime colors
    id say that part 4 star platinum is also up there with most articulation
  i hate pink giorno i am gonna get that jolyne tho
  i hope they fix the issue with old joseph why pink rohan there is a god since jolyne is getting rereleased at such a low price
apparently there are gonna display over 300 figures including special limited and rare ones are there that many
  which issue the rerelease back then fixed up his waist joints if i remember right even touched up his purple hermit effects paint
  probably theres a fuck load of sas with almost every single one with a second color even a third and lately jotaros case 4th color   theres the clear plastic and the swarovski stuff and probably stuff im forgetting
thats crazy if what you said is true over 300 figures and i cant imagine how eye candy the event display is gonna look like im hoping theyll throw in some not yet released or their own custom figures
funny how its encouraging attendees to try out thier sas big new mold i wonder hows the actual sale of the big line so far there aint that many reviews on it honestly im hoping that sas bigs line will die so theyll transfer the newer design back to the regular size sas cant stand how small part 3 and 4 size are
  honestly the big design looks so amazing i second what youre saying anon i already have a jotaro but id be willing to get another if the design was like that
i wonder if anyone is crazy enough to buy the big line and disassemble it and 3d scan each parts to so they can shrink the scale through 3d print software part 6 scale which i think its the best size and 3d print the parts and assemble back together
  some badass out there just might
  i wonder if theyd just scale that down i assume its digitally sculpted
most likely yea the big line is pretty obivous digitally sculpted if you pay attention to the left side and right side they are identically mirrored
  it could be other lines by the same company that or they went insane and are going to show off a bajillion figures that havent been released yet
dont forget fist of the north star was also announced so im guessing a few preview of fist of the north stars a few new jojo regular size and the the big ones and as well as di molto bene too
  okay i just counted up the jojo releases theres about 126 unless i fudged a number somewhere and i only remember maybe a couple over a dozen other figures when we count kinnikuman rwby ajin etc either doubles other brands or a bunch of new stuff seems likely
cant wait till the 21st so excited
2019 is gonna be very exciting for medicos fingers crossing
yo anyone got dmb of part 3 curious how they stack up with part 6 figures because i have medicos part 3 figure and they tiny af and i am thinking of getting dmb if they are bigger any help is appreciated
people keep their boxes  i always just toss them with the recycling  i feel left out like i did something wrong
  i only keep them so that if i ever have to sell them i can pop it on the bst threads a little easier as long as you have a nice way of organizing the extra parts theres no shame in tossing them
dont waste your money on part 3 and 4 the figures are terrible
  i think the 300 will also include statue legends and other stuff like banpresto prize figures and stuff
dont forget the hitman crew from part 5 too
and the hokuto figures
  i keep forgetting di molto bene is a subsidiary or sister brand to medicos not much else to be excited for if thats the case but hopefully kenshiro gets painted and the world sas big shows up
  i wonder hows the actual sale of the big line  from the limited research ive done it seemed to have sold okayish though obviously not to any really big numbers i imagine what really hinders the line without taking scale into account is how much theyre trying to charge for each individual figure at almost 20k yen each more or less a reviewer said it best in that you have to be a serious jojo fan if you are interested in buying the big line    also green star platinum incredibly dumb decision imo and i remember there was outcry from people here about it too should have tried profiting off the anime and used the purple colours instead like jotaro at least
i think medicos is about drop all their old jojo figures in favor of the big line or an official 20 figures looking at other companys practice such as bandai before ultraact got canned they pretty much reissued all the figures and then the announced a newer models of the ultraman line the shfiguart kamen rider were reissued with their bikes before announcing the new line 真骨彫製法 too and with all these reissues of jojo figures its just a matter of time
at the moment i have to agree that the popularity of the big line doesnt have the same impact of sas when it was originally released due to 2 main factors high price and a completely new scale which you cant do too much pose with it due to being too heavy yea not only you have to be really into jojo but you gotta be rich too its really off putting
  ill nut if the 20 thing happens and we see something similar to the ss line shinkocchou seihou amazon is such an upgrade versus the original release
just look at the new exclusive pink jotaro you are not only getting the punch effect part you are also getting 2 new exclusive sound plates if thats not going all out then what is it 
    im a bit concerned about the eventuality of an sas 20 line because if anything medicos quality has been getting worse over time
  heh big numbers    20 figures would be neat if nothing else it would give them a nice excuse to finally go back and do stuff like speedweed hol horse and vanilla ice/cream
i feel yah on the quality issue so far the only obviouos fuck up is on the 1st gyro diego johnny funny and dc4 aint that bad
  medicos quality has been getting worse over time  not really the figures were getting better up until the part 7 figures

blacktron  evil criminal gang that preyed on hard working ice planetwhite people
  not transparent orange    bad
  i maaay have crossed a pc line here   i recognise taht  but in my defence i am very drunk
      what 90s sitcom is this
  its the fresh dolls theyre a new tiny doll company
  actually yes
  theyre cute for nignogs needs more darskins though
  coalburner located
  lynette and aria are the darkest ones they have
  is that mbison
    well it seems i wont be supporting playmobil in the future
  no dad around  seems legit
  both versions of trumps pedophile friend    no i dont mean brett kavanaugh
  now i cant unsee that
who here remembers these fuck i stole these little shits from my classmates back in early elementary     we had this game where wed set all our gogos upright on these big stone slabs in the courtyard during recess and take turns flicking them at each other theyd always go flying and like the trouser snek i am id go shuffling through the tall grass to snatch them up before the other kids could find them
  okay ive realized reading this over that im a fucking prick    i have all three of what i think are the rarest guys and theyre all stolen    i also have two mosh gogos theyre apparently the rarest
finally some taste on this board most fuckers just shy away when they see these things arent action figures with (((kungfu action))) and adjustable limbs i fucking loved these things and still love them at 20 because of how original all their designs are   pic related case in point
  i have a gumball machine full of them both the og ones from the 90s and these ones whenever i find some i buy them
oh dude i have like a tupperware full of these guys and i remember when i went on a trip to england they had the next series which never made it to the us maybe it was series 4 and i felt so cool for having these top secret gogos
      dude i used to have so many but thing is i just kept them on display and never stored them properly so now theyre just lying around the house    one time i was lonely so i took two goguys with me on my trampoline it was actually so great til i shattered one by stepping on him
  these four are my favorites
  forget the fucking gogos what the fuck is up with that vas
  ive also always liked fisty boy though im only partial to the starbelly     i bought the gogo encyclopedia and apparently hes a general of some sort
aw man i couldnt help but dig these guys out again good memories
i always really liked these darth vader guys
these were all my other favorite dudes
    this guy was rare
  the top right  the uncanny valley humanthing    this wasnt in the handbook
  i dont think i ever got one of those guys damn they look cool
  according to the handbook mosh is the rarest original figure ive got two but that pic isnt mine one of the ones i have is dark blue i think
  its from a series of gogos soccer players theres another one face down in the middle of the photo i have like six of them yeah theyre weird
series 3 and 4 i wanted the red mushroom head guy but never got him
another thing i found cool about these guys is their advertisements n o s t a l g i a    i also found it cool that they are kind of based on the game i think they were made around these games were based on flicking them in a direction and some notice how many of them are topheavy with tiny bases were better for offense being styled like an arrow and others the bottom heavy ones with larger bases being better for defense usually being able to stay up after being nicked by a slightly offcenter attack     pic related is a more optimized figure fitting into both roles one of my favorites too though i have him in a different color
  hahahahahahahaha    hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  he looks like what targets mascot could be
  fucking nostalgia boner
okay
    
no one talking about the original bones  its all gen z kids talking about the reboot
  and im more likely to talk about pokemon black and white rather than red and blue because i grew up with the former sadly tastes become more niche based on what we are exposed to early on and the gogo reboot was what was hot when i was a lad
  i dont remember them rebranding as gogos crazy bones but i had some of the original series as a kid and they were really cool the gogos ones look a lot like vinyl figures from that trend about a decade ago would you believe i actually still have my dragon ball z crazy bones check it out
  wow thats pretty crazy i feel like all the brands from when i was a kid stuck really hard like pokemon and yugioh and nintendo games and stuff when i was a kid everyones parents took them to see the first pokemon movie in theaters and i mean everyone it was super popular they even gave out special pokemon cards at the theaters i wonder what your generations big events are and what future generations will be
i still have these gogo icecream shells cools stuff they only made these four models
these are mine someone told me the gold shiny one on the front right was rare do they all have names
  i have the original crazy bones and the reboot gogos the gogos are just better the older crazy bones are unpainted uninteresting poorly molded
  theyre both just hunks of plastic dude i find the originals have more interesting sculpts but thats subjective
  theres a gogo wiki with a ton of names and other info
  thats my gwar mug i like to use it as a background for quick pictures of toys from time to time
  youre a gen z cuck and have shit taste
  i remember those i got the rarest one purplered ghost guy from a friend a lot of the printing is worn off but i have him on one of my shelves
  pic related but its not of mine
  ozaru  turtle  ozaru vegeta  krillin  gohan  third form frieza  chichi  raditz  goku  is that right
  first one is bubbles
these were wayyyy better than the gogos shit    the gogos ones look like miniature hipster vinyl
  the rare version of the button eyed one brings back so many memories
i miss crazy bones one of the toys that reminds me of some good times chilling with my dad back in the day
these little bastards were great they were probably the biggest playground fad at my school i remember keeping mine in a small tupperwear box that i kept it my backpack
  they are featureless blobs man you cant even make out their features      im 30 years old dude i even had some of the original crazy bones when i was a kid the gogos are better
  its all just hunks of plastic man its down to personal preference
              you guys
  thats how i imagine all of /toy/ t b h
  top jej
  dunno seems like a nice dude
are those collectables worth something
bump dis
bump dat
  i thought the originals were just called crazy bones not gogos
  ye i too thought crazy bones were the originals and gogos just copies i really dont know the vid was fitting for this thread but the guy has other crazybone related vids aswell still cant tell if there is a difference or not
  damn those are neat
thread aint gonna die on my watch
go go gogo thread
oh my god gogos were the shit i remember being absolutely obsesed with these little guys yall mind if i post my collection
  back rows wanted gogos they were rare gogos that could be found in north american series 1 packs    two black ones in the middle left special guys from a danimal promotion    blue and green ones in the middle right daily mirror gogos exclusively given away with the uk newpaper the daily mirror in 2009    front row most wanted gogos that had an incredibly rare chance of appearing in any series one pack    guy in the very front qmack given away exclusively by beatboxer jbox and basketball trickshot guy qmack when they visited schools around america for some reason hes the rarest guy i own
  some guys i have from the olympic series which was based on the 2012 london olypics
  special edition golden fut gogo from the dutch supermarket chain c1000
  full fut collection consisting of 90 different soccer/football related gogos split into 9 different colored teams
  my huge box of misc gogos made of series 1 2 3 4 all stars series made of fuzzy versions of the most popular gogos from the first 4 series advance tins the two golden tins some fut gogos i have duplicates of or arent part of the netherlands edition of fut and a few giant fut gogos
  some unpainted series one gogos i forget where they come from i just know that some weird place in the world sells packs that can include series one gogos fut gogos and unpainted series one gogos the cool thing about the unpainted ones is that they have special indentations where paint would normally be so you can still make out what their faces look like also they come in different colors than their painted counterparts
  metalic series 2 gogos exclusive to israel
  these plastic guys heads open up and you can store gogos in them you can also mix and match heads with bodies
  misprints i have the first two are unpainted fut gogos that dont have any facial indentations the third one is a normal unpainted series one with a large intent in its back
  also in this picture the guys scattered about are glowinthedark gogos from the groovy series and the two tins in the back are white diamond and black diamond tins the diamond tins i believe are the last or close to the last gogos magic box int released before moving on to making disney tsum tsums
  world gogo association fuck yeah  whats up with his voice
  turkey got gold covered ones a few years ago
gogos  toptier toys
myom found a bag of these at a yard sale and gave th to me a when we were down there visiting just last week are any of these rare or interesting i dont want to try and sell them or anything i just like to know what i have
anyone have a bone cone they would be willing to sell me i live in the continental us
  everyone wanted the chef  i had the chef  these things were the perfect little knickknacks  they also make me miss the small rock shop i had nearby it was the single greatest place on the planet
the big plastic bois
  the mini bois
    the bois are all here  i fucking love these little things and would love to buy bulk off of people for dirt cheap as usually they just see them as tiny space wasters
anyone collect star monsters
  i dont think hes rare as much as desirable due to being the mascot
who /mirok/ here
  damn those are neat  why did i never hear of gogos
yyoooo i remember these  these were super fucking popular and everyone had them eventually they were banned from school because some little shit lost his favorite in a gamble lmao    anyone have the golden ones
these were never popular at my school growing up but i had a ton i used to steal them from the trading card aisle from anywhere that carried them id open the blind bags and take them but leave the wrapper there i like to think all the stores that carried them stopped selling the blind bags specifically because of me
i loved the originals one time this frozen yogurt place was giving away singles as some kinda promotion and i got a clear eggy some faggots stole my entire collection a few years later
  we played with dbz gogos in school whoever got closest to the wall when throwing won kek a troublemaker made some little 6 year old bet his whole bag of gogos against some rare dragon gogos need less to say he beat the lil guy with ease kid started crying and went to the teachers office and the teachers somehow made him to handover the bag    same dude used to come to school with only around 2 gogos but after beating everyone his whole bag would be full
some anon wanna play gogos with me
  i have the cyan one
  pls i literally have no friends
    no one 
  this guy will 
  hit him up on youtube but he hasnt uploaded since month /

immortal gogo thread
finally getting around to posting my guys
  middle one is huge is that some sort of special crazy bone
  yeah  
  damn now i want one
eternal gogo thread
okay you guys got me im gonna post my collection this weekend when im back at my parents
  do it nigger
tfw finally found one that isnt purple
        love you guys for keeping the thread alive
  cute vehicle whats it from
really enjoying this thread ngl
    thats an xpanders tank but not  thats really bizarre cause its exactly the same conceptually but not a single similar part
  its a neat concept tho
      now i want those tanks  damn it /toy/
  how do you play with these
    thats how its done
tfw when searchin my parents attic for my gogos and not finding them w
  his voice is obnoxious
  watch some of the other videos fucking ridiculous andrew should be the face of /toy/
  play the craze
there is a checklist for these things
cool to see a thread like this on /toy/  makes me remenber that i have some of these in a old plastic jar that i collected many years ago  funny thing is that im not from usa in my country the crazy bones were sell for a limited time as the ones on the op   but they alse did were sell or included on snacks 1 per bag and end up getting enough to fill one of pic related  thing is that after the campaign ended a few month after the same snack bags came with these similar type of crazy bones cousins as i call them because iirc they were promoted as crazy bones too  question is someone can identify these or have more information about them
here is a close up of these crazy bones cousins  they have a magic hologram in the from that changes according of the angle from where youre viewing them
and a close up of the effect i was talking about of these cousins  are these some kind of bootleg crazy bones  what are they called any info about them would be appreciated
    yfw
  blinku
  blinku  thanks i never have guessed that this was the name of those figures
  i vaguely remember a commercial for them
i really really like this thread
  i collected a lot of those gogos i have like 300 of them with my younger brother thanks for talking bout them
i used to have a big crazy bones bag that looked like a crown royal bag full of the series 1 and 2 i always loved the giant ones from macdonalds i would read this book religiously and take it to school to show everyone in hopes of kids at school getting into crazy bones so i had someone to trade with
  glad you enjoy this thread aswell
sup boners
  888  trips confirm that transparent boners are best boners
here are my guys series one i found them in a thrift store and that space ship guy on the right is extremely common i thought the concept of crazy bones were cool but none of my friends had any
  the black one looks super cool it reminds me of those stick figure flipnotes
i feel like crazy bones were always just a little bit too uninteresting i was always on the verge of obsessing over them but i wasnt quite there
gentle bump
  glow in the dark eggy will guide you through the night
  i had that book as well back when i was 78 had the same trouble with nobody else getting into them but i thought they were awesome used to sculpt my own out of blutac as well since my parents wouldnt let me buy them
this gogo thread is eternal
anyone remember the ones that came in happy meals i had one of the white ones
as far as im aware my one and only is this which after some brief research i now know is named eggy   thanks for the thread /toy/ i never caught another whiff of how big the scene was until today   i really enjoyed the dark purple and still think of it now and then it may even be why purple is a top contender for me even if i dont think that just anything is better coloured in it
  i had a green eggy and it was my favorite i lost it at some point and i wish i could find another green one i do have a black sparkly one but its not the same as the one i grew up with
  i can see the appeal of it heres to hoping that wish comes true
are these worth anything
  yeah this is a comfy thread not as eternal as the last poche thread but close enough
  id buy
thank you guys for this amazing thread
  damn forgot about these shit these were the hecc
this thread will live on
how the hell is this thread still going lol
thread still going strong
  going strong
  strong
  gogo thread   i fucking hate gogos  fun to collect  so are action figures like gi joe  get a real collectable worth money u cuntbags    you guys literally anger me with this stuff

  nah not anymore however you can find them at dollar trees in the us for only a 1
  tfw living in the eudssr   w
  i feel u bro
  you have star monsters
  autism    also bump
seems like this thread has more samefagging than actual content i dug up my old collection for that sake   1/3
2/3  i religiously collected series 1 and eventually i bought someone elses collection online when they stopped selling them in stores real shame
3/3  looking back now the photos i took are kind of shitty if theres any youd like to see up close lemme know i have some rares and ultra rares as well as 2 box sets i think i had the black diamond set as well but i cant find it anywhere
me and my little brother used to collect crazy bones when they were around we always used to fight over the rare ones i remember when they stopped being sold and we bought a bunch of packs on clearance for the equivalent of about 40 cents each good times
  that reminds me of when walgreens had the free single pack gogo day the guy at the counter said we could take a few since literally no one had come in and asked for them it was an hour before closing   naive me didnt think to make an offer for the entire box
  thats a really nice collection anon  where are the huge ones from
u aint gonna die now my lovely thread
do any of you remember those weird gogos clones that came out with wendys or churchs chicken kids meals im from puerto rico and we sometimes get delayed or different promotions i think but hopefully someone remembers what im talking about think they were called weirdoes but spelled differently i used to think there were better than the real thing
i have pic related in my parents house i got the pic from internet i heard its one of the rarest to ever exist even if its just a redesign of the hand one
  yeah kinda this and like 4 other sculpts had most wanted variants i dont know the chances of getting one per pack/case but the company made them out to be the hardest to get mainline gogos in series 1
i thought you boys could help me i found this metal case for sale at a local toystore which claims to have 10 exclusive gogos for 5 anyone know what thats about it has the new gogos logo if that helps
  that one looks fucking neat
we have this thread all year around bitches
mfw i own the 4 out of the 5 special/unique variants from series 1 the only one i didnt have was the guy with fire on his head
  post a picture of ur collection anon 3
  i only have the aforementioned 4 unique ones from series 1 in my possession my entire collection is rotting somewhere in storage and i cant be bothered to go find it
  damn a little scuffed up but still great  i like them
  not him but sadly it seems to be natural for gogos to get scuffed up do to them being used for games i have a few that got fucked up paint wise due to concrete
  oh i thought they were only collector stuff   what games do you use them for
  theres rounded indent on the back of them to make them easier to hold a lot of the official games from the company were similar to marbles or pogs throwing a figure to knock down others hit targets etc
  i remember they released handbooks like pic related which listed every single one and the games you could do i had one but it was in dogshit condition and probably got thrown out
  anyone have scans of one
  arent those like unofficial i remember the gogos making a big deal out of having a seal on their back and those gogos didnt have that
im fucking searching everywhere for my box of gogos and i cant find them fuck  thinking my parents threw them away
oh fuck i remember this shit
those were the shit on the schoolyard
i told you we gonna have this thread all year around
is the retard bumping this thread finally gone
  im still here
  wait so im a zoomer if i played with these i was born in 91 yet it seems like ive got more gen z experiences than millennial or 30 year old boomers
just got these three guys in front yesterday not sure what they are
  if theyre gogos i dont recognize them      i mean theres like two or three separate generations of the crazy bones line
  kinder joy do they have a loop in the back
  one has a loop the others have soft rubber buttons and those two have tiny holes in their faces maybe for squirting water
  i have those thumb and doll guy variants
  
are you unironically collecting these junks of plastic
  fuck you yea fuck you
  this entire board is dedicated to doing so
where are all mine at
picked up a couple just because of this thread really happy with my purchase so far the molds are all so fun and interesting also the sound they make when you shake them around in a bag or in your hands is orgasmic
i remember going to my local big w to get a pack or 2 of the explorers series every time i went to the shops then like a month after i stopped collecting them they stopped selling them
  looking neat guess im going to order some myself for i cant fucking find my old ones
  this thread is almost 5 month old  wew lad
  holy
i still have a bag full of gogos crazy bones d
  show us some of your collection anon 3
  i went ebaying for gogos and i saw these unpainted aliens for some reason they look like 10x better to me     now i want to buy alien gogos and wash them in nail polish remover or seomthing
  its true the unpainted ones are the patrician choice  but im not quite sure if nail polish remover wouldnt melt the whole figure maybe you have a fucked up one to test it otherwise you could use some fine abrasive like toothpaste and try if its easier to polish of the thin paint
  i really appreciate how kitschy and mid2000s these newer ones look like trying to emulate japanese kawaii faces while doing their own thing with them
    any updates
  looking fancy
saw some at the flea market last weekend dealer wanted 1 ea or 40 for the whole bin i just bought a few that were really cool that price is way too steep
  which ones did you buy  also  moonman in the left container      damn these crazybones are perfect for photos  i really need to look for my old ones
    moonman   ill be honest i never get this obsession with this moonman character why is that im not murrican so thats why im not familiar with this meme
  i aint american either   also normans away ruuuuuuuuuuuuu
immortal thread
  all those moonmans
have a little bump you lovely thread
  some dbz guys and various colors of these ones
  the red one is fucking beautiful i really love the basic ones the pink one is nice aswell tho
  okay these are what i was thinking of they had a bunch of awesome multicolored monster ones at mcdonalds for halloween when i started middle school i really dig old monster movies so my little brothers would give me random ones they got in their happy meals when they got extras i remember a white wolf man particularly as being my favorite but im pretty sure they gave me one of the bats mummies and skulls shown here
  they really are great for photography there are certain ones that can easily be themed like the beach/vacationish ones i have there but where gogos really shine are their individuality if that makes sense each one has a nice sculpt/printing and really seems like its own character they do it a lot better than say shopkins trash pack any of the current blindbag figures that all look the exact same star monsters is probably the only line that stacks up to gogos at the moment its just a massive shame that theyre not sold in the us    i also have a preference for gogos over the original crazy bones i have a handful of originals and theyre very nice but they definitely dont have as much charm
  oh hey i recognize that little fireman in the background from our discord convos nice to see you found some gogos the middle one is from one of the fancy tin sets i think the one on the left is from series 3 unsure of the one on the right but probably series 4
  look up star monsters  made by magic box and include stickers for a collector album  assuming they have the same gimmicks looks like theyre rebooting gogos again
  why havent they come to the us yet id buy a full case if i didnt have to import and pay like 50 for a few blister packs
  if i remember correctly didnt it take a few years for gogos to come to the us and be welldistributed i remember a couple years beforehand seeing them from a different distributor and then another company started doing it instead and they got pretty accessible    also  full case  heh i remember being in middle school and ended up snagging a nearfull case of series 2 i ended up having all but two or three sculpts from that series in a single go haha
  fuckkk i wish i had money back in the day i remember toywiz selling full cases for like 50 eachsomehow gogos were the one thing they didnt jew into oblivion i wish i could have snagged a case of series 2 or 3     speaking of series to liven up the thread a bit what are you guys favorite series i personally really love evolution gogos series 2 the decorations seemed a lot more refined than those of series 1 and the color palette was much nicer as well i still remember my very first pack
  are you 18
  not that anon but im 18 i was big into gogos crazy bones when i was around 12 its possible that there are fans ofage
  i like the glitter and clear stuff in evolution but i like the weird urban vinyl/pokemon look of series one much more i kinda burned out partway through s3 but a lot of those seemed p hit or miss      yeah 20 actually
    all these zoomers
  i burned out after series 3 unfortunately series 4 was hitormiss for me at the time and i only got 2 figures from it i should get back into collecting these guys     one of my favorite figures is from series 3 though targy will always be a massive bro
  i see it as a nice thing crazy bones have two distinct generations so zoomers and boomers can reminisce about it together although the lines are different
  there are a few figures i remember buying individually online that i really liked the designs for starboro and jampa jampa are ones i can name at the top of my head
  boomers im 25 and i was in grade school when the first line came out i cant imagine very many people older than 30 having crazy bone nostalgia
  gold one is plotting to let blue one drown when the flood is coming
gogos are eternal
  amen
  golden one is fancy as fuck yo
    oh noe watch out blue one
looking at these reminded me i still had mine from when i collected them with my brothers we only got them because if one of us got something from the store we all got one and my little brother got these they ended up being pretty neat heres a pic of what i kept
  hi riley
  
  anonymous 05/18/18fri023710 no6950067    this thread is now officially half a year old  say something nice about it
  jesus i didnt know there was such a hype around gogos

  its all about star monsters now
      p l a y    t h e    c r a z e  r  a  z  e

fast food toys thread cereal prizes are okay too    it seems that after 12 years disney finally decided to let mcdonalds make happy meal toys of their movies again my little sister wants the vanellope car bad shes 19
  whoa
  why does cinderella look like a sociopath ready to run over someones little kids
  its weird that she and moanna are the princesses they chose to put in the line
  cause she kinda is
  well cinderellas the iconic princess and moana still has a lot of star power moana toys are still in stores all over the place
  is that a simpsons character
  ralph simpson
  is this mcdonald promo i want that moana
the best
  avengers 4 mcdonalds toys   surely theyd be silly not to especially if it had some collectable gems with each toy that goes on the gauntlet toy gimmick
  putting feminists in charge of disney was a mistake
  i still have two of them
  i wanted frack it frank the most out of this stupid promo
  i hate disney and ralph breaks the internet but these look like the best happy meal toys in over a decade straight outta the 90s
  the fbi not shooting david duke in the eye socket years ago was a bigger mistake
  who
  david duke
these were so shit but i loved them
  just look at this fucker
  big dick coming through
  the energon ones with sounds and ir shooters were 9/10/
  red alerts head just sticking out of the hood  its endearingly awful
  armada bois riiiiise up
  im not googling that
  gackt
  wouldnt that be because theyre the two princesses with iconic modes of transporation
      damn these were amongst my favorite mcdonalds toys growing up my brother and i didnt have money for all the real sets and we eventually completed this one so it meant a lot to us    we brought them with us to the mall one day in a zipblock bag and somehow i or my brother forgot them somewhere in the theater when our mom took us to a movie and despite going back and looking in the theater for 15 minutes we never found them again felt really shitty i think both my brother and i were hurt knowing they were no in the garbage somewhere or some other kid had them
love this little guy from mcdonalds was based on a short lived toyline about robot pets in the early 00s i just really like his look and they had multiple colors for him fast food toys used to be quality stuff and thats not just nostalgia i think in a few years they will disappear altogether or some joints will make it there niche
so whats the verdict on these figs ive heard lots of comments saying that they trump the play arts kai figures but also that they carry some of their issues like really bad plastic hairugly joints     that being said im interested that theyre doing nier and ff9 figures anything else you want from this line
  anything else you want from this line  good quality figures
  at this point if they will release even a semimedocore figure of her ill buy it
  i have their 2b shesok but for the price shes not very good really id like her a lot more if the tolerances werent so scary and the paint on the skirt wasnt trash ive heard theres a 20 coming out    the friedrich/bucket boy that comes with her is really nice though i still want the machine two pack
i have sora and kaine sora is decent and kaine sucks i bought a ko 2b yesterday since i just dont want to put the money down for the actual one and ill wait to see if the revised version is worth it at all a2 and 9s look better but i dont buy play arts so their my only experience witht he line
  whats the verdict on these figs  wonky qc terrible knees  anything else you want from this line  dont plan on dumping more money onto this line unless they make aya brea ac yuffie or crono
i kind of thought 2b would be a special case because shes a 2pack with bucketkun but the single figures are the same price which is pretty shameless on sqenixs part as they are in no way worth that
  that being said im interested that theyre doing nier and ff9 figures anything else you want from this line    honestly i just want more figures of the gears from xenogears
i paid 215 dollars for this whore 215 fucking bucks for this fucking bitch with hasbrotier qc curious fact the ko is the same in quality and painting is a fucking perfect figure for 30 bucks but it is a little little smaller i dont understand why they made her downsized fucking yellows just buy the ko is a fucking beautiful figure for the price is perfect
  lol thats kind of funny i ended up selling my official one for profit i also got the robot pack preorderd when amiami was trying out their new shipping with dhl so i got the shipping for free
i think this line is decent and will improve keep the faith until we get our perfect sephiroth figure
hope neku turns out ok the lack of effects is bullshit though since the attacks in the game are quite varied luckily ive been hoarding effect pieces from other figures for something like this  lack of gripping hands is something i cant defend as well
  link to the ko you bought
  it is literally just play arts but downscaled i dont think it will get any better look at how kaine turned out
    id like a link too i see a lot of aliexpress stuff but not much id trust
  ive heard theres a 20 coming out  wait what
theyre overpriced for what they are gummy sculpting and sloppy paint i like them more than play arts because the smaller size at least hides some of the sloppiness but really theres no contest between them and similarly priced figure lines ill buy any more xenogears stuff they make and ill consider the ff9 cast if they look good painted beyond that i guess id like ff7 and 8 stuff but only if theyre gonna do a full lineup of the cast the incompleteness always bothered me about play arts
  new mold new accessories including the skirtless butt
  skirtless butt  this was the entire reason i didnt buy the first release i hope they release the 20 soon but the original hasnt even been out for a year
  
  well i have to thank all those that tested out the first release for us folks who held out
      preorder the first one because the previous bring arts all seemed good  its an expensive tiny mess with fiddly joints weak range and a skirt made of cast iron  the stuff after her seems good and oh look a new version  nuhuh nope fool me fucking once i havent felt that bad about a purchase in a long time
  same fucking bad bad knees  they are literally selling the same figure with worse paint and a piece of butt with the label new my god this is so fucking bad
  serves you right you bandwagoning piece of shit who literally shits on mls despite fapping to them
i have the machine 2 pack  the joints on these are kinda fragile and the no thigh swivels on the larger machine piss me off way more than it should
  is the ko really that good
  it is literally just play arts but downscaled  after the crisis core zack thats probably the best compliment ever
  as shitty as the first figure was the ass part will at least placate the people that bought her for the butt meme  that being said at least her expressions look better and she actually comes with multiple weapons this time which is cool but fuck bring arts posibility and qc  after 9s and a2 i am done unless they do more nier 1 and drakkengard figures outside of twink nier
  easily the worst figure ive ever owned   the only good thing was the robot but the figure itself was a piece of shit in every regard     sculpt is shit joints are shit paint is shit that fucking hair is shit   opened was terrified put it back in the box and sold it a few days later for profit never ever again a se product ive always heard bad things about them and they werent wrong     the only people who are happy about this piece of shit are just delusional   you could throw at them a figure made of litter al shit and they would still buy it just because no one else will make the same character
  im super excited for the dragon quest ones ive already preordered all of them luminary with metal slime erik erdrick and alena prototype rab has been shown too still sylvando left tba i cant wait to get the full xi team i really hope they keep making more dq stuff we barely got any figures except dqviiis
i have the luminary one that was recently released its a decent figure but well below the standards of figuarts or figma despite being much more expensive ill probably still buy the other characters i really liked but it sucks that they have a stranglehold over their licences id love to at least see nendoroid versions of things like lara croft and the ff characters
  crono  shit dude i dont like the way 2b looks at all and now that theyre doing a 20 so quickly is pretty scummy but id bite the bullet and pick up crono
dmc figures would be very much welcome theyll probably attempt to make something when dmc5 happens   aside that i really just want cheap model kits of the machine lifeforms the ones they released are okay but expensive and not much variation to them i want o do all the dumb configs tower spider floating ones at least
  shit do they still have the license for dmc i dont want a bing arts to be my only option for 1/12th dmc figs
  its not like 2b is the only thing theyve released fei came out perfectly fine
  no clue unfortunately but square was the only one to make re6 figures
since there is os many bad feedback on bring arts i though to buy this but im not exactly sure
since its basically frame arms i imagine she kinda fragile
    but she can go full nude
  i remember your monkey posting about this a few months ago lesson learned dont be a retard and dont live in a shit hole country
      link
  theyre getting better i think sora and 2b are pretty shit but i think they know this since theyre remaking toobs you could argue this looks even worse fuck it ill give them the benefit of the doubt
im just happy all this shit is getting made
  were getting based beastlord  but its sold separately
  so aside from the current releases when do you think theyll get around to doing classic final fantasy characters    id kill for a proper 1/12 scale cloud or pic related
  hell id get versions from both games
  wheres spoopy emil
  theyre first going to wrap up that ff9 line i would think if it does well theyll probably continue with ff10 or ff7 they are doing kh cloud for what its worth
  would you still buy it if it were accurate to squares derpy proportions and style from that first game ive got great memories of pe too but those models have not aged well
  verdict  who knows im sure the final fantasy stuff will get more love in any case  i took a chance on nines and  since i like their designs more than 2bs for the idea of a figure
sh monsterarts king of the monsters figures revealed
  and here id thought that king ghidorah would be the star of the figure show for me that is a beautiful and formidable take on mothra especially the head region well see what the film itself does to change my mind this way and that
    those wings need some more articulation
  got any more pics of gyaos
  colorful muto
  both are bugs  deal with it fucker loser idiot
  youre late to the party already happening in 
  long gangly arms and legs    gross
  is this for the new movie

official pics w h e n
  after tokyo comiccon
they had these out with date and price oops
  hm that price
  armor parts are rusted ok fine sure  horse skin and hair is too  thats a bold fucking strategy cotton
      oh my god ive always wanted shit like this yes
  they already put out the regular horse
  im down to fuck with some moving armor pieces
    hard pass the standard rust knight was nice but not nice enough to want me to bother with the horse too       id not be surprised to see them going for at least half the price in a sale not long after they come out hope the part swapping is amusing enough though
  its supposed to look like a statue
    its possible im just being turbodumb here but thats not the same revol horse as the one that came out a couple years ago right i straight up own the bronze armor i dont think i could have missed a rerelease of that one just seems weird to make a colored version to go with one particular colorway before a generic one
  they may be recycling some parts of it but from the picture except for legs and tail everything has armor/chainmail/saddle etc on so i think its save to guess its a completely new figure  as for the knight itself this armor has very subtle differences from the already released one and we can expect a different set of weapons    i wish the knight itself looked a little more different but im sure ill buy this set since i really love the first knight        the price itself is not even expensive considering its two figures  march is soon          they dont look bad but theyd be completely out of place with everything else i own and im starting to really run out of space in my house so i guess ill be passing on these
  t h i s  h  i  s
  jizai okimono are suppose to be made out of metals and are movable statues its what the name means    as for the revoltech one of the color variations has always been one solid metal color for the knights this was bronze iron rust for the past ones the silver version represents normal realistic coloring hence the silver knight had black parts too bronze knight wasnt a knight wearing bronze armor its a bronze statue of a knight    if theres a silver version for this     the horse itself should be a real horse colors so far we only seen the one color
    fuck me this looks cool i just hope they dont fuck up with qc like they did with some of the regular knights
    major want wish the legs were fully jointed but even so these look awesome
  getting this    and shit i need to see that new takeya ashura
    the only problem i have with these is how articulated they are the tail on the scorp only has what looks like 23 articulation points for instance the legs maybe 2 considering how standardized and cheap those revoltech joints have got to be im not sure why they didnt just give each leg the small joints for each section i mean its an insect they naturally have nice segmented parts for you to just stick joints into
  let me break it down for you the cost of the joints isnt the issue assembling that many parts like each section of the legs will drastically increase the price of this figure from the labor involved its already going for realistic indepth paintjob you cant have it all and be at this price point  originally these were meant to be almost articulationless additions to the sofubi toy box line but since their sales werent promising and will likely be over 4000 yen even as soft vinyls they changed strategy    this is a middle ground compromise having the size and paint of the sofubi with some free range articulation of revoltechs     not to mention supporting all of the weight on tiny joints of the legs could be impossible for some so all of it being solid is a good choice there are hornets and giant beetles in this line
anyone know how the yugioh revoltechs were
  as  said partscount and labour/assembly/painting costs probably factored in along with how the hell to get legs only big enough for revolmini joints to support something that big if they were fully jointed a shame but oh well
  not to mention supporting all of the weight on tiny joints of the legs could be impossible for some  could easily be solved with a support stand under the body though
  action figure that cant stand on its own wonderful     also assembling a simple human have occasional left right mishaps how much errors do you think will occur assembling that many leg pieces
  action figure that cant stand on its own  pretty commonplace even with regular figures the main reason humans can stand up is the ability to shift and maintain balance which obviously an inanimate object cant do theres a reason that stands being included is a pretty commonplace thing with uppertier figure lines i do wish that bandai would include their stages as standard with their figures
    legs are completely articulated    at least stick a fucking joint in where they attach to the body
  completely unarticulated i mean fucking autocorrect
  maybe they couldve included the option for the owner to assemble theyre own articulated legs if they wanted    overall the only other position an insect legs would be in would be reared up so im not too disappointed so long as the tarantulas legs move
  stands are common not because the action figures cant stand on their own unless its a ridiculous looking robot that cant in a real world setting stands are meant for doing some off gravity center midaction or midair posing also these are common in figure of a country where earthquakes are common its nice not having high end figures fall off shelves every few months   its entirely different problem with a floppy toy that needs a stand figma horse was shit for this very reason its not a solution or improvement to be stand dependent    and youre still ignoring the price/labor issue of articulating the legs qc for correct assembly too      yeah that option is called dont be lazy and cut and place in your own joints if youre into the hobby and cared so much it doesnt hurt to have some basic skills modifying pvc and getting grey joints are not that hard
  that new takeya ashura  isnt it this      not sure why they displayed a cutout instead of the real thing this is that ver15 one
  im good the knight was shit and i dont wanna play 100 for a another knight and an okay horse
    yeah thats it i didnt know preorders for it were out is this an almost entirely new sculpt the head the torso the skirt piece and the hands are definitely different it might just be the arms that are being reused
  why dont they sell it like a model and the customer could put it together
  slotting some parts together isnt what is going to drive up the cost if they were to do that they should have just gone full plastic model route instead
  making sure every pack has all the right parts is again lot of manpower and sales wouldnt be as good as the completed model because of losing people who are lazy for how little of the price drop it actually gets    and theres still lots of painting involved keepin price high    to avoid all of this is to ship the runners straight out no paint whats that oh a model kit and thats an entirely different market kaiyodo used to be a model kit company but not the kind people would buy today    figma is trying something like a half model kit half figma from the looks of it maybe only the face is prepainted but the rest is solid plastic colors for school uniforms and such
finally got a rider for this bike i got from bbts pretty cool stuff love how you can kind of do whatever you want with the extra parts
really good this hopefully we get a transparent carnage redeco when the movie comes out too
  where can i buy this
        bbts has it but its a bit expensive you can probably look at ebay too its a japanonly exclusive so its gonna be a bit pricey
  this looks better than the original one honestly
    yeah thats why i got two the transparent black works super well the original is still good but it this is just loads better
  does ny or any of the proxy sites have this 150 is pretty steep on bbts
  i dont know go have a look and let me know
hobby japan 50th anniversary project death ball    being 50th and all and since revoltechs are doing alright maybe we might see something beyond statues this time         holy shit there are so many characters
  lineage i forgot hyakka ryouran was in there
  i dig their designs but aint holding my breath for anything poseable
      edf
  god i fucking love baseball
  its baseball meets combat girl who caught the ball fights the runner     im not hating the idea could look interesting in motion hope we get a decent anime out of it if nothing else or a game since its action heavy it would be nice to have revoltechs
    meh  the designs are trying so hard to be sexy that they kind of lose me
  nice cammy arse
    she looks awesome i know nothing about psylocke but this is a wonderful looking toy looks like a 3d articulated illustration the hip setup makes me wish wed get proper revo street fighter characters though a cammy done like that would be awesome
      we neeeed a shot of psylocke and gwen doing the laughing supersluts pose
  same they all look like 2 bit overdesigned gatcha characters
  cannot wait to pose this bitch
  a new waifu has been discovered
  to save the mother earth from an alien attack
  right makes me wish yamaguchi had the sf license instead of bandai
the ass is nice but i dont know why they cut so much plastic out of the crotch its gappier than need be considering gwen had none of that problem
  gwen had a different hip construction that allowed for less cut while maintaining hip flexion that same cut wouldnt work as well with skin tones so the front pelvis needs deeper cuts to maintain deep hip flexion     its attention to detail like this that makes me really appreciate these revoltech figures
theyre never going to reissue wolverine are they
  my fetish is half naked girls with helmet so yeah this is waifu material
  im not sure what theyre waiting for but im sure they will
  shit crotch wow what a masterpiece lol
  shut up legendssperg
  why would you even reply to him at least you gave him the attention he wanted to inspire him to continue posting in this thread in the future
  thanks bra
  reminds me about a photo entry i did for a contest on here a few years ago
  because theyre doing xforce wolverine after iron man 
  yeah im pretty sure theyll do a weird repaint just like deadpool since both wore different designs of costumes  psylocke makes perfect sense to be repainted in black but its so subtle of a difference almost seems pointless to do     im hoping they have a plan to do archangel you can get two color variations and theres no good winged action figure out there not something that can pose the wings free range
  that bulge
  i hope they do a new deadpool that uses a joint for that bulge to allow for dynamic bulge posing
  from vicious giant insects who have once again come back
    what if instead of xforce they went with his brown costume i like it better than the yellow and blue honestly
when is this man getting a revoltech
  motherfuckin kurt wagner  my nigga do it yamaguchi you dick any variant  3 cutlasses bamf effect and revoarticulated tail please    add in pic related bearded face swap and you can have my first born
  revo wolverine has too much sculpted detail for the astonishing suit to do the brown suit theyre not even going to make the accurate xforce suit its going to have to be an xforce colored astonishing suit
  exactly what he said   itll be something like this  they cant paint without the sculpts to indicate where to paint
  it feels like their xmen roster is mostly big mvc characters so i doubt hell get one but hed be perfect id finally have a use for those shf purple smoke effects
my menace just came in the mail and has this random purple paint dot has anyone dealt with something like this and have tips
  you could try a very small amount of nail polish remover on a qtip but make sure to wash it off afterwards
  yeah good call it worked i get scared with it though because it messed up an old figure i had
  gambit and psylocke havent been in a mvc since mvc2 though
  does anyone even really mention 3 onwards when talking about mvc its always been the classic older ones from what i gathered
so is psylocke coming out like exactly at the end of the month or what
  shes in stock on amiami expect payment requests to go out within 48 hours
    just a reminder than this stuff exists
  1 and 2 are the only ones that really matters as they hit the right age group who are buying these revoltechs today      official date is the 30th
my queen and her solider  still needs an alien from first movie and predator
serious honest guessing to what the next dc ay would be    i dont think well get a female yet based on the m/f ratio we have right now mmmmmmi think itll still be batman focused for a while so some form of robin or nightwing is my guess
  i hope its superman a figure of supes with the same kind of musculature and posaeability of their batman would be great only down side would be the likely lack of trunks and the modular cape but i always just replace the capes of my ay with etsy ones anyway so thats not too big an issue
  probably a supes in the dumbass new 52 costume that i wont buy
  theres a few ways this could go but i bet its not superman    heres my short list of guesses  batgirl   joker   green arrow  harley but with an unpainted joker revealed at the same time released a few months apart
  i kinda wanted one name shouldve made that clear i did technically gave two but i really meant dick grayson his new52 robin outfit isnt so bad     i agree with not superman i think we had plenty of movie mafex and shf in a relatively short period that kaiyodo could wait a while    if you would boil down to one the next after batman and deathstroke it would be    i do hope ay does an archer character i cant imagine anything else able to pull off good archery poses
  just talking about the character design those are too monotonous on the outlook no strong visual sign which like only within a single color tight suit or the simple outfit but nothing else also have no eye catching weapons or any accessories can be with it the possibility they choose to make figures is relatively less    you can find some principals in the characters they already have  dead pool  death stroke a lot weapons  two spiders eyes catching design  batman  magneto fucking capes  venom frecking huge muscle  and so on
  we had plenty of movie mafex and shf in a relatively short period that kaiyodo could wait a while  in what world is movie shit a decent replacement for comic designs  i thought actually getting accurate comic looks was a big part of why people liked mafex and revoltech
  movie suit is basically the new52 suit without the neck so the distinction factor is pretty low talking about priority here not saying it cancels it out entirely releasing someone who never had anything are more likely prioritized in the case of ay
  if i had to boil it down to one id say green arrow   hes a character that can interact with deathstroke and batman so he seems like a sensible pick but hes also not a top tier hero and would be kind of an odd choice which seems in line with what yamaguchi does
  ive got a feeling yamaguchi would really rock superman itd be swole as heck    id honestly rather he do a revoltech gridman though than more superhero stuff just as a break
  gambit and psylocke havent been in a mvc since mvc2 though  yes those are the only mvc games that matter
  id be mad because i have to buy another wolverine but id be the first one to preorder that shit thats my fav wolverine costume and getting a yamaguchi ver would be awesome
  the figma of the new one looks like something yamaguchi made unless its the original then thats bandais turf pretty much     japanese ip ay will start coming out eventually
  gridman  or maybe he could do one of the hundred other japanese heroes that doesnt have multiple serviceable options already
  probably wont happen for a long time but i can dream
  death ball
  arent transparent figures more fragile
  no    most plastics are naturally transluscent or transparent and the dyes and such added to them actually make them more suspectible to corrosive effects    what usually happens is that the toy maker cheaps out on the plastics though so they use poorer types instead
  i think it depends on the plastics chemical composition itself acrylic plastic tends to be fragile but iirc the chemical additives determine rigidity and strength
    can the queen be posed without the stand
  no way unless you posted it turning to four limbs are all touching the ground and frankly its look not bad at all like a totally bad ass four feet monster
  queen  cant wait for the amazing yamaguchi royalty line dynamic liz action will be great
  no matter what kind of grass do you smoked just give me some
  just a guy with a soft spot for ol lizzy
psylocke is out anyone here got charged yet
  i paid for my copy at amiami
    shes up at amiami and hlj  hlj should do it tonight/tomorrow
    just got dinged for my preorder at hlj im happy to see a revoltech coming out in the middle of the week instead of on friday and getting held up until the following monday
  yea i just got my payment req too from hlj theyre getting a lot better
  dosent matter when youre in canada although the strike didnt seem to cause too much delays in my area
  real talk id go for an ay world leaders line if only for hitler and lincoln having crazy intense katana duels  id also appreciate yamaguchis take on the takeya knight im willing to sacrifice a bit of realism for sickass karate poses
im thinking of picking up a cloth cape for batman does anyone have any recs im looking at two on etsy right now i want one that is large enough to wrap around his body in a neutral standing mode with enough length to flare along the floor something like pic related
  i need stalin and hitler but abe would be nice too
    so what is it about revoltech that makes them so damned durable i collect a lot of different lines and revoltechs are the only one where i literally dont fear breaking i havent broken any of my toys but ive had to soak a few shf neca and marvel legends just to be safe with a bunch of really rigid joints
im seeing a couple of variations of danbo around but the most common one seems to be the one with an amazoncojp design  has anyone had pic related it seems like the one id enjoy most but it sounds fragile from reviews
inhand pics of psylocke when
  notices panzer cop  ive heard that their on the smaller side of 6 inch figures is this true and how drastic in size difference as compared to other figures from other lines
  here you go
kaiyodo is present but nothing new pose accessories etc to show apparently not even someone to pose their revos
      yeah fair 3 wasnt necessarily bad but i have a lot more fun with the first two speaking from a purely casual standpoint apparently theyre completely rehauling infinite to the point theyre renaming the new product mvc4 but i doubt theyll make it anything id want to play most of my favorite characters were cut anyway
  wow his legs are fucked up they didnt even try to make them look right
  yeah i guess he got revo joint knees like carnage everything is not twisted the right way
    thats only if theyre always being exposed to pressure like using them for joints in hand the translucent venom feels a lot more solid than the original and the joints are black revoltech ones i highly recommend it
starting to see some photos on twitter
    get the one that doesnt transform the amazon one should be good and durable
    hard to break something thats designed to be taken apart and customized however you wish what you do risk is the joint ports getting loose over time but thats easily remedied besides that theyre just built really solidly
          makes me wish i gave a damn about marvel because this looks superb
    eyes are abit too recessed which makes it difficult to see the whites but thats my only gripe
          how does the hair attach to the head im curious if the larger piece can be removed to make it look more like a bob cut
  cant wait to see pics of it posted decently
yamaguchi girls past and present
some ass shots i saw
    out of curiosity what did you pay at hlj i thought hlj had the cheapest prices on this line but it seems higher than other shops

swiggity swooty    im gonna need about ten minutes
  correct me if im wrong but she doesnt actually have moving eyes right
  actually she did
wow movie psylocke
    well ive no regrets not ordering her looks fine but does absolutely nothing for me id probably regret buying her
  its probably a revo joint they use for all their jointsif so it would be an easy remove  revo queens blade had some joints to connect hair peices
  the closest i got to damaging a revoltech is trying to pop carnages leg off with brute strength just ended up causing a white stress mark on the waist double barbell joint
  lol i took it one step further than you friend    believe me you stopped at the right time
  theres about a million things that make me wish i didnt give a damn about marvel
how are revoltech kos   someone is selling a wolverine for like 15 so its obviously not real but im tempted to jump on it anyway
ive seen three youtube reviews on her already they all mentioned the psy effects are super hard to get in the peg and one of them broke his so uh maybe look out
  revo wolverine bootleg is basically identical same goes for magneto and captain america carnage is good too but not authentic tier
is there a way to tighten revoltech joints    i got an old figure and its loose as heck
does the new yoko have squishy boobs    this is very important
  switch out the joints
  if the ratchets are wornout or the piece of the joint is broken and missing its pretty much done the old 3 piece 6mm joints were like 80 loose at one point    replace with revo or other third party joints or you could use super glue to add friction inside the joints take it apart tricky and coat the inside with a layer of super glue and let it dry it works sometimes its how i fixed some of the qb joints back when they were originally released
senmu has been busy promoting the new revoltech geo line previously known as arthropods  or maybe it was a temporary name kaiyodo must be rally counting on this to take off
you can see the hornet too its huge or will shrink towards final production  also the first joint of the legs might be revo jointed since theyre facing in different ways
    this looks promising there is part two on his channel its a little bit tricky and i couldnt do it in one go i want to try again
80 for psylocke including ems    she better be fucking worth it
  ems  kek
  apologies bur i cant take any risks during this christmas season
inbound into customs
anyone here own revoltech grendizer     he good i see hes being re issued
i keep hoping to see a pic of psylocke with the large hairfan removed im sure she would look good with short hair
  it looks like the big piece can be removed but the figure will still have long hair because some of it is sculpted onto the neck
  thats okay the big piece will create a large gap anyway so itd only look pay to look from the front
  the fuck is wrong with reycals backhair custom attempt
spidey up for pre order if anyones interested
  i care about the xmen comics and thats about it couldnt give less of a fuck about the other comics and actively dislike the mcu considering how nice these revoltechs are i think im doing it right
  is this the second spiderman reissue i was really hoping theyd do a wolverine reissue next but i guess theyre doing this because of the spiderman movie in a few weeks
  do you guys actually play with your toys
  second or third no idea
  more like the fourth or fifth reissue      no i eat them genius
  hair sculpted onto body  essentially eliminate headswapping  why the fuck would they do that
      its the second time spidey reissued
  mean like theyre stuck or hard to move they better not fuck up those eyes articulation
  eyes are confirmed to move  but you might get unlucky and get a stuck one im not sure whats the solution you can always pop the eye out with hairdryer maybe
kinda late to the party but the collector community at large seems to like cjesim as cloth cape seller is there anything that makes them special compared to the 1015 bucks cape i can get from ebay
  quality
  nicer at the cost of 20 dollar shipping and months of waiting id only buy cjesim stuff secondhand if i could
  60 for this  wow are they really that well put together not to mention youll be in line for a few months before getting it
    hairdryer usually works especially if you want to pop them in and out    im also reading about the shape of they eye being wide or uneven but this shit happened with venom snake you can heat and reshape the face just enough to make it look right
  im glad they did
  after seeing gambit i wanna start collecting the xmen wolverine and psylocke and maaaaybe deadpool to go with them but im on the fence with magneto he looks kinda weird and im not sure how i feel about it whats everyones thoughts on him
  i was debating on magneto too but i like the mezco more so ill just wait for that one however long it takes
  main body is really good and i dont mind the cape in theory but they didnt realize how heavy thick pvc would be after all these years so thats annoying easily solved with batman using thin abs plastic so i wish someone thought of that in the first place    the new stronger 6mm double joints would be perfect for magneto sure you can get spare red ones from carnage but a reissue would be nice i dont think thatll happen because him and gwen are like the only ay still in stock
what joints are recommended to replace flesh colored revo joints i got the menace reissue and shes a qc nightmare with the biggest problem being her hip joint not staying together
does revo have the license to make figures of the eva characters
  another spidey reissue  still no wolverine reissue  fuck this gay earth
  practically everyone that gets a magneto buys a third party cape to use instead the chunky plastic cape that he comes with makes him so much heavier and doesnt really offer as much for posing its definitely a way inferior cape to the one they gave batman
man i sure cant wait until my psylocke gets here so i can take some pictures of some poses that arent totally fucking garbage
  patience my anon
  no we cum on them stupid
anyone order psylocke for hobbysearch they havent shipped mine yet
  the cape is love it or hate it but otherwise hes fine probably the ay revo i like the least of them but its still by no means a figure i dislike outright
  is her face supposed to be that chubby
i got payment request from amy but i still hesitate should i buy her or not
  thats probably a separate line on thighs it two separate piece like on queens blade figures so you can rotate her legs

  upper thigh and lower thigh are separated with a ball joint for additional articulation like ay deadpool as for the neck psylocke is using revolmini joints entirely so who knows of the compatibility with the 3mm pegs of revo joints could be a ball joint also qb head and body are not that compatible with many figure lines because they are jointed at the lower neck instead of the upper neck like 95 of action figures this was why reycals neck was pretty valuable as an adapter

  ah fuck i quoted the wrong post  
so /toy/ anyone have this bootleg bloodborne figure can anyone attest to the quality also bootleg general
bootleg figmas
  those arent bootlegs since theres no original/official figure to bootleg  theyd be 3rd party
in terms of paint it seems to chip off easier on bootlegs but ive never had a problem with bootlegs breaking or anything but every bootleg ive ever touched stinks like toxic plastic chemicals and makes me dizzy these things cant be safe people make a big deal out of lead paints but ive personally tested a few for lead and never got a positive result but the pvc manufacturing process is apparently toxic as fuck and the plastic itself can potentially be dangerous im pretty sure bootlegs will give me brain damage in older age
  ive never had a problem with bootlegs breaking or anything  i on the other hand have ive bought a handful of bootleg figmas over the years just for fun and in more than one case things just break abruptly no stress marks no stiffness no warning whatsoever just suddenly the thing is in two pieces in your hand while posing or in one memorable case when i just picked it up off the shelf
does anyone have bootlegs of nendo kirby and sonic  any comparisons you could give or comment on their quality
20 gets you a fairly decent deku    
figma fireball drossel recently got bootlegged check ebay for figma drossel aliexpress too
  decided to get one hopefully i get a good one
does anyone have the solid snake figma bootleg is he as bad as he looks in pics or worse how the fuck do i get a real one when every listing on ebay is the bootleg
  its pretty bad but mine came with at least 5 baggies containing 10 tiny cigarettes
how are the bootleg horse figmas
i recently got 3 bootlegs    1 shf tdk batman  crap good sculpting alternate head has poorly painted teeth but that actually makes him look better because it makes his lips more obvious left leg assembled backwards weak tolerances all around i fixed up most of the issues but his arm still likes to fall off his price was cheap but still not worth it    mafex flash crapish terrible unmasked head left arm is assembled backwards torso missing the cup to hold the balljoint for the neck again issues fixed now the right arm sort of wants to fall off and im iffy on the neck but otherwise okay for the good tolerances hed be decent if his price was the same as the bootleg bats above    shf dx bodykun  decent no consistency in plastic color it was a mistake to pay extra for the dx version but otherwise good tolerances all around same price as the bootleg mafex flash if he was the same price as the bats above i might have ordered a second one
  ive seen pics of the kirby some look fine but others have derpy eyes no way to tell before it arrives     dont use ebay
just got bootleg revoltech carnage for 18 bucks shipped from ebay it is on par with recent revoltach kos and is pretty damn decent for 18 bucks comes with clicky revol joints and the paint and sculpt look very good except for the eyes the eyes are bit sloppy not sure if that is a problem with the original also his torso was on backwards but i just twisted it into correct position glad i saved my self at least 50 bucks off an original
  seems like in the past 6 or 7 years bootlegs have gotten seriously great at least ever since those neca tmnt bootlegs ive bought a few different bootlegs and theyve definitely saved me money of course they can be fairly inconsistent and id recommend doing your homework before you buy a bootleg but if youre a poorfag they can honestly be a godsend like    said though they should probably be bought with some degree of caution fucky hong kong shops manufacturing sketchy bootleg toys arent going to have the same regulations and safety measures a legitimate manufacturer is going to have
      18 bucks get you this its really crazy hiw good these ay kos are i thought fir sure carnage would be a mess
    the pegs that hold the toes and the jaw in are longer than the original for sure the eyes are a bit sloppier and paint in general is probably a bit sloppier than a legit anyone one know what other differences there are it looks pretty good compared to my other legit ays
bootleg ultimate jungle hunter has some paint issues but like most neca bootlegs not far off from the original the accessories actually look really good although you can tell they seem a little brittle nothing is crumbling or broken and seems pretty solid fir a ko
   next to a legit fugitive looks on par to me
box shots
    28 bucks shipped from ebay i also have a preorder for the legit one being released soon so i cam compare
  is the original this red and shiny if it isnt im liking it a lot more than the original it could just be the lighting though
  i got one for 10 bucks cant wait to see how bad it is i like the show but deku isnt worth more than 60 as a character
  the original is pretty shiny the big issues with the knock off are the neck doesnt look to sit very deep in the chest like the official which fucks with proportions some also the official has a subtle but incredibly striking slight metallic eye paint which causes the white portions of his eyes to pop like crazy in photos similar to the logo on official air jordans and knock offs    pic official
  why why would you buy a knockoff for 28 when the legit one is like 5 more if that i picked up the exact figure but legit from a fye store for 30
  like all figma bootlegs joints can be iffy some can be loose some too tight and some with a decent amount of needed resistance peg holes can sometimes be shallow making joints stick out a little in some spots overall though the horses are okay for bootlegs save that getting them to stand on their own is difficult due to the aforementioned loose joints here and there but it comes with a stand so that can be remedied if you need a 1/12 horse that wont break the bank then look no further as for fodder for customs also good as a base depending on your ideas i plan to turn mine into an entelodont
    because legit ones are no longer 30 and go for rape prices unless you are lucky same with ultimate city hunter they are getting re released though
dont mind shelling out for a 28 dollar bootleg since these are long gone around me anywhere retail and online they go for over 120 especially with ebay and paypal buyer protection potentially you can get them for free if you feel like being an asshole if the ko is trash i get a refund since its decent ill enjoy it until my re release gets here its 28 bucks im not going to miss it and im getting my moneys worth
    neck is the same exact piece so most likely a tolerance joint or user issue the eyes are extremely sloppy on the ko that would really be the main difference that i can see and it looks like the use a lighter shade of red for some of the parts
  ive seen pics of the kirby some look fine but others have derpy eyes no way to tell before it arrives  do bootleg sellers refund you in cases like that
    if you notify seller you are not satisfied and provide a legitimate reason they will usually always try and work it out with you so you are if not then you can escalate up to ebay/paypal and they usually always side with the buyer
  i think thats getting a reissue man
  hate to spoil your discovery but shes had knock offs since the very beginning youre a few years late sparkles
  since its decent ill enjoy it until my re release gets here    i think thats getting a reissue man      the genius of /toy/ everyone
     its decent ill enjoy it until my re release gets here    it def is getting one i just started collecting preds though and until those re releases finally come out my collection is seriously lacking i entered at a good time i guess
  thanks anon i think ill take the risk and order one
oh nononono
    np and its not really a risk more like and adventure you will def get a refund if you request one just dont abuse it and refund something you like or want to keep thats just bad juju
  deku was so bare bones he wasnt worth the 7000yen but we got people out here spending 400 for it
  bruh look at that face
    the gwens were pretty bad paint wise after gwen the all started getting better though and that has held through with carnage i bet batman if they attempt it is a mess though i dont see how they can pull the ko of that and make it work
    yeah thats pretty bad although compare a ko magneto to a legit one and its a completely different story you cant even tell the difference on most of the parts
    this is a real bad batch  i picked up a revo gwen a few months after the official release and she looks much better than these   ill try to upload some comparison pics tomorrow
  what are the best ko ranked
  magnetowolverinecaptain america carnagespidermandeadpool
  guess im getting bootleg magnetto worst come to worst i just tell ebay theyre selling bootlegs i did that do get a bootleg megamanexe to replace a lost part
     id agree with this but swap venom and gwen venom has an issue with bad joints but if you replace the torso joint with the extra one included with wolverine or wherever he is fine
    paint is not good but the posing and makes it way worse than what ive seen in other pictures also the hood is backwards
     i have one and the only really weak part is the stand which will probably break with how heavy the figure is everything else is top notch quality even for a ko even the cape has nice joints and even accurate colors his shading is even decent throughout not great but decent the faces look spot on you can usually find him for around 20 25 hes def worth that
  its more of a personal preference id rather have minor paint details than lose joints objectively they are around the same level
  ok so heres a comparison of the unmasked heads on my bootleg gwen and official gwen  ill try to upload some full figure shots later the photos i took of that came out real bad
  ooh thanks for pointing that out just went and ordered one
  more than paint the sculpt looks fucked up how about the masks
how much of a health hazard do bootlegs really pose    i want to get the effect piece from this nendoroid venusaur but im wary about going the cheap route if its kinda dangerous to handle
  if you dont suck on it or stick it up your ass its fine if its greasy or smells at all just wash it and it will be fine
  some anons have bought leadpaint test kits from home improvement stores to see if there was any lead in the paint of their bootleg toys myself included theres a few youtube videos of people testing lego minifigs and the test turning up negative i tested bootlegs of the revo jizai skeleton figma horse and figma ryuko and all turned up negative again dont put them in your mouth wash your hands after handling before touching your face or eating and any chemicals should be washed off in the process
  the only lead paint i know if is from official toys getting caught with it from factories that went cheap    so youre not safe if you stitck wif weegwe toys
  stitck wif weegwe  what        cheers lads might get it after all then if i theres a low chance itll twist my dna into pretzels
  wolverine is a fucking shit loose joints stucked claws bad paint apps in the face totally shit
how are bootleg nendos in general  just got my first official one and im impressed with how much articulation they fit in such a small package but with how tiny they are i dont think i could justify the 50 price tag again  seems like it would be easy for parts to fit together wonky in a bootleg though not to mention the tiny paint apps
  i own three and theyre all terrible clumps of plastic with parts that dont fit missing accessories and terrible paint
  corporate whore bitches are often up their own ass over bootlegs because theyre not legal and no other reason they pretend official releases are always superior which in the case of transformers is no longer true kos are often better than official tfs now even crap ones like thf soundwave are still no worse than the overpriced kiddie crap hastomy makes morons think that high price tag  quality go ahead drop 200 on a fucking leader class and tell yourself its a collectible that makes it real    now if only other ko makers sunk in as much effort
  are unlicensed third party companies still considered bootlegs i always imagine leggers as a few chinese guys working out of a basement trying to pass off their plastic turd as the official companys product most third party transformers are their own company with actual production quality though
  did i mention 3p no go back and read i said straight kos
  are you feeling ok anon
a bit off topic op but i have 2 of that hunter 1 with a fucked box and 1 misb i also have 2 of the preorder extra message guy he came with you want
  uh do you mean you have two of the bootlegs or two legit ones how much are you selling for    also if you do have the bootlegs how are they
does bbts sell bootlegs they have the revoltech ninja turtles but theyre all labelled reproduction
    no they do not sell bootlegs reproduction does not mean ko or bootleg on bbts
thoughts on this bootleg ordered him from aliexpress but hes taking forever to ship
  thanks
  do you have any pictures i can see of them
bumping with little armory weapons bootlegs search for gk 1/12 on ebay there might be cheaper ones            
  that is hilarious
  pic related is mine im happy with it for the little bit of dosh i spent on it
can anyone speak on the yamaguchi revoltech venom/deadpool bootlegs
    people have already read the thread maybe
  holy shit i have been looking for little armory weapons for cheap  which one do you recommend the most are there cheaper options
  indeed im waiting for the day of high quality ko fashion dolls
theres a one punch man figma for 7 dollars i wonder how hilariously retarded it would be and im really tempted to order it
  which one do you recommend the most   i havent bought them so i cant really recommend any just check the photos and see what do you prefer found a review though   are there cheaper options  there are 6 for cheap but im not sure how well will they work with figmas the other option is the marauder inc weapons
are the core pieces of the bootleg figmas of any quality at all do they bother to match the skin tone on the original    ive been thinking of trying my hand heh at making a shimakazekun custom but i dont want to butcher the torso pieces id need to modify
bump
  is it possible to change the figma joints on the horses for revoltech joints
  iirc the pegs are almost exactly the same size but revo joints in general are fatter so it might not fit together right
         noise do you have a closer picture of the unmasked head
  i just bought one actually the box came pretty beat up the figure wasnt damaged but it had an issue where the shoulder joint was either superglued or sculpted into the body so the arm couldnt move so i had to break it and then glue it into a pose the paint job and sculpt is good for the price tho
    i forgot to add it was the deadpool revoltech
diaclone reboot bootlegs
rebootlegs
  where can i get these
  are these full heads or just a face plate kind of thing wondering how much this head could improve ml gwenpoole
  ebay aliexpress look for dasin tom and jerry
  i can attest the yr venom bootleg is good especially for what youre paying the only issues i had with it were joints that were too loose but that seems to be something the official figure shares too especially with the abcrunch  point is it seems to have a better balance between price and quality than the official one but if you get one from a bad batch youre fucked
  just the face plate it seems to be a bit small for the figure not sure how will work on a ml
the chinamen bootleggers thing theyre getting smarter anyone else notice an everincreasing number of us sellers that are obviously chineserun accounts selling knockoffs out of of the us usually seems like cali or texas    you can usually tell because of the horrible broken engrish and if they post legit pics they tend to try to wash the colors out or make the pic dark so you cant see the obviously offcolors and the fact that its a cheap fake
  really not a rule ive bought from plenty of legitimate people using us seller in their ad its something people do to get more attention i assume because it means cheaper shipping  just be cautious of literally anyone youre buying from on ebay check their location reviews and ffs dont buy anything using stock photos
    oooh nice any idea on the quality
  is that the megatron model kit how is it im planning to get their grimlock
  its an os bootleg its okay except for having no effin knees got a review if you want
my bootleg figma drossel just arrived
buying bootlegs  ever
  its okay the real ones broke there all the time too
anyone have experience with alpacasso bootlegs im pretty sure my little rainbow one is but i can only find bootleg v official of the full sized 30cm one and want to be sure  giveaway is probably the fabric tag is just generic blue and not the yellow rainbow one no rainbows just have a blue tag right
im just here because im looking into getting bootleg figma that have been discontinued or cost an arm and a leg    seeing plenty on aliexpress of jeanne darc and of nontanned bikini sonico also looking for a fireball drossel charming or whatever her thickass name is but of course theyre not bootlegging her ugh
      theoretically could you coat them with a good clear coat and essentially put a barrier over the plastic/paint
  in theory yes but i doubt its the paint thats the problem and more likely the plastic and its manufacturing process that makes bootlegs toxic in which case i doubt clear coating will do all that much but if you plan to paint bootlegs at all make sure to use paints that wont have issues ive tried lacquer paints on bootlegs and they dry much lighter than what they should so some sort of chemical reaction was taking place id advise avoiding lacquer or enamel but acrylic seems perfectly fine and will be the least likely to have a weird reaction
    got my deku in the mail today never bought a bootleg before only heard horror stories on here about them but its surprisingly well made besides the obvious paint issues and the poor quality control over plastic flashing its a good figure maybe has a bit loose joints but nothing that stops him from holding his weight
  i feel ya i wish the figma koers would step up im still mad about my figma moon
  ive heard good things about this one id get it if i liked bnha
  yeah im not a huge fan but for 20 might as well get it
reposting from the aliexpress genos thread because no answer  is there any noticeable difference between bootleg producers does it just vary from figure to figure or is one name generally better than the others  i notice the flevans guys are pretty much the only ones who post pictures of their actual products but its still pretty disappointing
  i asume sellers get their products from the same factorie some factories have their official stores and there must be big stores like flevans
  besides  paint  flashing  loose joints  its good    what
  all of those things are minimal and are easily fixable for a 20 figure way better than spending 200 for official one
  anybody have the ko pizza spidey im not paying nearly 100 for a legends figure
  200  try 500600  at this point the bootleg is basically the only option
  try 500600  holy shit are gsc missing out
  fujos are fucking scary jesus christ
  i dont have him but hes supposed to be arguably better than official because slightly more range in leg movement
  im interested but youll have to be specific    do you have two bootlegs or two legits    how are the bootlegs
my bootleg boy came today  and so did i  hes amazing a few paint defects but otherwise hes quality
any bootleg effects for 15cm scale on aliexpress
  i hope bandai picks up the series i need a big all might
  recently got a kotobukiya carnage knockoff  the sculpt is just as good as the original  only real problem is that the paint is less glossy and the statue itself is actually smaller    wishcom is bootleg galore
holy fuck i just saw the bootleg judy figures    anyone have one with pics bbts has the legit one in stock buuuut
anyone got a bootleg kirby nendo how is it
  gsc bootlegs in general are sub par not sure about kirby
  how come bootleg figmas dont have the figma logo on their base while having it pretty much everywhere else
is taobao trustworthy  i want to buy a third party digimon figure and some kos to complete my ko dreal collection but ive never ordered from them and their aesthetic makes everything look fishy
  its a trading platform like aliexpress/amazon/ebay etc meaning therell be both legit sellers and lies payment is done through alipaychinese paypal and theyll hold it until you release it or open a dispute so theres some buyer protection there helps if you know chinese google translate is another place you can get fucked from
does anyone know what seller has the ay wolverine ko with the cigar hand and cigar alt faceplate
    my original ay venom does indeed have a loose abcrunch the upper body sometimes comes apart from the lower torso kinda disappointed
  mine just came in today and for a bootleg the hunter isnt bad at all especially for 14
  do you have the original hunter
  nope costs a fuck ton
  can you give us more indepth details than not bad how loose are the joints how shit are the paint apps any sculpt mushiness pics would be much appreciated
    bootleg indoraptor if anyones interested
  whats the point now if its readily available in large quantities
just got a bootleg figma ram yesterday hoenstly she doesnt have any weird smell or texture and her paint job really only needs touchups the joints feel pretty flimsy but they do hold poses so ill post an update once ive painted her and tightened those joints    she has the tiniest fucking feet
  do a before and after
has anyone seen a bootleg of the darts blastoise i see bootlegs of venusaur mewtwo and charizard well the figuartsbranded reissue around all the time but nothing for blastoise for some reason
  got mine its a good bootie worth the 17 i paid wish i had a baku to go with him
  thought one of his testicles was popping out of his underwear for a moment
is lead paint really a thing on bootlegs from aliexpress     i bought a square enix deathstroke action figure bootleg and lego shen yuang bootlegs    i fear for my life
  hardware stores like home depot sell 10 leadpaint test kits there have been people here and on youtube testing some bootlegs using the kit and turned up negative so far one anon said that the bootlegs of figma ryuko and the horse along with the bootleg revoltech jizai ivory skeleton all turned up negative for lead if youre concerned test them yourself
  lead paint isnt a thing for ages and is only a concern if youre a mmmm grayonstier moron that tastes his figures before playing with them
  they should do ko figuarts charizard/blastoise/venusaur
  please link the seller optimegatron looks incredible
  is the bootleg chris reeves supes as good im really eyeballing it hard now that the official release figure is getting pricey
awaken my inside  i cannot be awoken
  if i see that fucking cat one more time
    so sick of hearing about handmaidens tale fucking sjws ruining action figures now too
  the mong without fear
  so anon how do you know that it isnt bad       they wouldnt know real from fake if it hit them in the ass
  is this a boot of the mattel fig from a few years ago or a different scale
  different scale 7 its a neca bootleg
  i dont know but judging solely by the quality of the batman i got id say hes worth a gamble this figure doesnt even have a hint of that nasty bootleg chinese factory chemical smell and the plastic quality is solid if i hadnt already known it was a bootleg i honestly never would have guessed
not sure if appropriate for the thread but i didnt saw any other bootleg threads     these bdaman are pretty obviously bootlegs i think they have chinese all over them and theyre selling 2 for the equivalent of 8 us dollars i was wondering if anyone had any experience with them since bdaman are toys that get quite a bit of stress put into them and im concerned that chinesium might not quite be able to take the beating
  its just 8 dollars man just buy em and report back
  gotta pay an extra 10 u for shipping and at that point its like half of my monthly salary tho im def considering it out of curiosity if nothing else
  i have no experience with cross fight bootlegs but i bought battle bdaman ones back in the day cheap brittle plastic and stickers that wouldnt stick
  cheap brittle plastic    this is my main concern these things have to take a lot of stress     do you happen to know if the ones from taiwan and hong kong that they sell on ebay are legit
  send links if the seller is in china and using just stock photos id be weary of them
  heres a couple of examples of what im talking about        
    stock images from china  first seller has a bunch of listings for fake beyblades though also some real ones id say thats a gamble    second seller doesnt seem to be selling any noticeably fake stuff saw some good feedback for him in a transformers forum too cant vouch for them personally though
  i noticed something similar didnt think to check other products of the sellers tho not like i could tell fake beyblades apart anyway    ill have to think about it
      this taobao listing explicitly says its the ko version the description say they are simplified and average quality so yeah you could probably expect brittle plastic        the 1st seller is from hk and theres a distinction between hk and mainland china sellers he is mostly using stock images though so it does seem unsafe     official beyblades/bdaman and other nontf takaratomy stuff sold in hong kong come with this sticker mani ltd is the hk distributor
  i really appreciate the help and the interest man thank you all that information is going to be massively useful for me since id like to get quite a few of these and i cant read any asian language     so just to clarify if its in chinese and it doesnt have that sticker like the ones  here then its a bootleg right i wasnt entirely sure if it was chinese writing i was thinking the whole time that maybe it could be korean or some weird coincidental japanese with no hiragana
  hold on about that theres taiwanese version with chinese packaging
  and korean sonokong versions with korean packaging
    for beyblade and bdaman the biggest tells are the logos on the box if it doesnt have a takara tomy sono kong/young toys south korea or hasbro logo its a knockoff there are other regional distributors who might slap their own sticker on the box funskool in india does this but you should still usually see one of the above    for example  is a pretty obvious ko styled after takara tomys japanese box design their logos been replaced by that new tag the main bdaman logo itself is in english despite the majority of the boxs text being in some asian script    most telling is the bizarre drive garuburn subtitle attached to every product thats just a single specific toy lol
  god i love sonokong helped me complete a lot of my collection when the prices of the hasbro versions had gotten too high
        well i guess it was a given that a local seller in this shithole would have a knockoff at least now ill be able to identify them easier     have these gotten slightly more popular over the last year or something btw theres a ton of them up on ebay now last time i got interested in them there werent nearly any i might see if i pick up a couple at least on ebay if they happen to be knockoffs and the description says they arent ill be able to get my money back     wish there was a proper database for all the models
anyone have the one12 collective punisher bootleg  i saw it for a decent prize online and he looks ok as far as quality
this thanos bootleg        any one have it
    nigga needs to snap himself out of existence
bootleg figma bb hunter and mgs soldier are both pretty dang good
  any loose joint issues or fragility with the hunter his paint looks ok not overly sloppy
  the joints arent as tight as a real one but they arent loose enough to hinder any of the light posing ive done as for fragility other than the hands popping off while trying to put a weapon in his hand i havent noticed any
  i may have to get this one and im eyeing the keaton batman too anybody have him
  what sort of defects
  you can see the small dark blue splotch on his chest theres a larger one on the backside of his right upper arm it doesnt scrape off easily at all so paint quality and general application seems perfectly fine front side of his trunks were a little light on paint but that took a while to even notice and nothing a small touch up didnt fix a very small bit of yellow from the belt is bleeding down to the trunks but you really have to be inspecting to notice it the stuff that matters doesnt have any noticeable problems though face and cowl are spot on painted perfectly and the boots and gauntlets look great bat logo is clean too very comparable to an official release
  more pics
  it comes with the box and accessories right how much was it
  oh fuck
  i ordered mine boxless but you have the option to get a box but he came with all accessories boxless he was about 15 bucks and some change from aliexpress
  where the hell are you finding the mewtwo i didnt see anything on ebay or aliexpress
    sorry sorry forgot about this thread anyways heres a pic ill post more in a second     im aware someone posted this bootleg hunter and it looks a lot bette than mine still i fucking love my hunter     joints in the upper extremities are loose and the hands easily come off its difficult to have him pose with the saw cleaver extended     joints in the lower extremities are stiff and arent loose at all     paint is terrible but that can be fixed
  and for fun heres him next to a bootleg pyramid head
  heres a closer look at pyramid head hes not as loose as the hunter easily posable and doesnt fall apart at all
  he does smell like chemicals though and im not a huge fan of the pegs so easily visible but the paint job is good
  yeah those pegs are hideous hunters sculpt looks kinda soft in places but for a cheap bootleg hes something id consider picking up
      that ph doesnt look too bad  here is a legit one for comparison   is there a bootleg nurse id love to have several of them but thats not gonna happen with originals
on the topic of bootlegs i also purchased tracer out of all of the bootlegs i purchased shes the worst when it comes to being loose if i simply tap her she will fall apart she fell apart many times on her own her arms and legs fall apart all the time her neck is fucking huge     aside from that the paint is well done and i do enjoy one of her faces shes smooth as fuck too
  shes not that bad but too flimsy
  have you tried making the joints thicker
  damn i want the original ph     as for the nurses not yet im still waiting for the my nurses in the package
  working on that
    i dunno dude her face looks pretty bad to me hope you didnt pay much for that
carnage and magneto are both bootlegs probably the best value for what you get carnage was 18 bucks shipped and has all his accessories and extra joints everything is so close to the originals except some minor paint issues and differences hope this trend continues
    god that thing looks awful not surprised at all though figma bootlegs are usually bad heres the original for comparison
  im suprised how they fucked up so much the paint on the legs
    i only paid 10 for the bootleg her face isnt nearly as bad as the other one ill try to find it and post it up
how do these bootlegs get made do they use the same factory that made the original and just have low quality control are they using the molds that got worn out
  no idea but just a couple of years ago this level of accuracy wouldve been science fiction  i imagine itll become quite an issue for some of the og companies in the future
  some leight factories instead of changing the molds after finishing their daily quota which takes a couple of hours just keep making the same figures with the same materials and lower quality control as far as we now thats the best explanation for the higher quality of tha ay revos and also sell the one that dont pass qc for small details others use the same original molds but cheap out on qc and materials eg figuartsand in other cases there are factories dedicated to making bootlegs with lower quality molds and materials eg figmas at least thats what ive learned in these threads maybe another anon has more info
    sounds about right what i want to really know is what the fuck is going on with the ay bootlegs and how the sculpts are so accurate practically being identical it makes sense they are just using the same molds seems like they would have done something about it though as they have just been getting better with every release
just ordered one of those brandspankinnew revo judy knockoffs itll probably be a longass wait but ill update yall when i get it
  as i recall the neca tmnt bootlegs were the ones that broke the mold if youll pardon the expression i remember everyone freaking out about how amazing these things were for bootleg figures at the time i dont remember bootlegs ever having as wide of a reach as these guys did  i hear the newer bootlegs of these arent as good as the older ones anyone know why exactly mold degradation obviously but anything else in particular was thinking of picking up a set
  i was about to say that they were appearing on aliexpress also ay batman is starting to appear also saw a listing for the figuarts the mark 50 i wonder how that turns out
    contractors making extra off the side is one way     another way is by stealing the cad it may not be the toys design cad it can be the molds cad or even the prototyping cad skimmed off during various stages of production at various subcontractors    you could also reverseengineer a toy this requires the most effort the thing is the tools you need to reverse engineer something are the same tools you use to measure and qc that means almost all moldtooling workshops have the capabilities to reverseengineer a product
     i have a set of them i posted in the last bootleg thread they are legit and were like 7 bucks a piece
    someone needs to buy batman i might eventually but someone else beat me to it please and post photos here
got a captain america for 13 freedom dollars back in september arrived in the mail this morning ill post photos when i get home
  update just got home my phone is dead and the lighting in my house isnt great so ill take pictures tomorrow  overall i can just add to what other anons have said the figure feels solid no loose joints little tight out of the box but after playing with it for a few minutes everything feels great paint is clean overall  since nothing is perfect there were 2 details to note both on the left shoulder the the joint was cracked on the ball but it was an easy fix since it came with 3 extra joints the second and big one is that the left pauldron is missing but still for 13 bucks its not a big deal for me
this counts as more of a 3rd party but since theres no thread for it ill just talk about it here  i got my genos in genos design works so much better for the articulation of these guys shoulder pads block more of the ugliness of the arm swivel and butterflyish joint  i dont know what it is about the pants that make that kind of leg articulation less ugly but it does  only gripes are that a wrist was a little loose and that the joints in the arms had thick excess lubricant i had to clean out with a qtip  paint is alright overall with the arms being surprisingly well painted with a solid silver paint decals were applied nicely and are very clean  the apron is also a nice little addition to my ever growing accessory pile
  i tried to buy a dasin saitama and those fuckers sent me a figma bootleg what a waste of time i got genos and hes amazing i just wish he had more hands and an effect part
  from where did you try to purchase
jesus christ you guys cant just be saying oh yeah its good when you dont even have the original to compare it to for all we know you have bullshit standards
  where can i get a real one please and ho much will it cost me 
  thing is we already have compared multiple figures to the originals here we give advice on whats worth trying and what not eg figmas are shit figuarts is more miss than hit last 4 ay are decent
bootleg shf iron spider man any good or total shit    also i need a good black suit spiderman i like the pak design so are there any bootlegs out there worth getting id rather make venomy tendrils for a bootleg than something collected
  where the hell did you buy it from
  what is youtube  its not like we only buy bootlegs either
anyone
  yeah i just started seeing these kinda tempted to get one and make modern guts out of it but doubt the face would be any good to do that i just dont wanna have to buy another black swordsman and take it apart
  im tempted to get it just to put the face on my berserker armor one ill wait for some video reviews first i guess
    the plastic quality looks like shit
  i mean id only be using the face the lower arms and cut off the shoulder belt satchel and knife think it will be that bad to use for parts
    aliexpress my second time using that site and second time something went wrong im not using it any more id rather buy from ebay even though i got my money back its super annoying and takes forever to deal with
  ive used it a lot of times with 0 issues so far
    was the price too good to be true  or was it the going market price
  dental plan
anyone have recommendations for bootleg tamashii act stands
  get a colored one and not clear they are good and work well but are not cross compatible with real ones so id get a different color so you dont mix parts since theyll damage the official ones
  thanks any recommended sellers that wont rip me off im having trouble finding them on ebay just searching tamashii stage bootleg
  i got mine on aliexpress i got the clear ones tho idk what the problem with those is theyre fine
  not the same anon but i searched for gundam stands on ebay and accidentally ordered the bootleg tamashii ones they werent labelled as such but its clear thats what they are i got an extra one for free for some reason too and the stand arm is pretty damn stiff which is good
  as long as pak its bootlegging doesnt have a human face they are pretty close to the originals
im stuck here at work but ive got a bootleg revo judy waiting for me as far as i could tell no one else has really picked those up so ill post pics after work
    well you convinced me anon i grabbed one on ebay for 11 total lets hope its as nice as yours
  looking forward to it i dont want to spend 5000 yen on a meme
  it was 28 so i guess
hey i didnt know if you guys had anything but i made a bootleg general discord server so it would be easier and faster to discuss this 
  yeah no way youre getting a real one for that price
  she looks pretty good to be honest her crunch is great but her back doesnt arch as far as i thought it would her ear came broken off the joint and i did break her tail off on accident some of the joints feel super weak but shes honestly not that bad
  and here are some of the faces the paint job is basic i would say but i dont mind it i gotta work on seeing if my spare figma joints might fit where her others broke
  good luck with it anon ive really enjoyed mine i have a few bootlegs in my collection ranging from marvel legends to tmnt and that batman is easily the best of the lot
  does anybody know if the movie revo joints are the same as revoltech joints her ears tail i guess and wrists use the same joints i can buy fuckloads of revoltech joints on ebay but i wont bother if they arent going to be small enough
anybody have one of the chinese shinocchou seihou kamen rider kuuga figuarts that have been showing up on ebay how is it
    now im curious about one is there any bad smell to him
is there a list of all figma bootlegs made so far
  the easiest way to tell if a figma you want has a bootleg is by searching ebay or aliexpress for it several cheap listings usually means bootlegs galore
so how good are bootleg stands planning on buying some and they are really cheap    i have that one its actually quite good  but it didnt come with any instructions though
  theyre great but their plastic is a little more brittle i guess than the real deal i think
  i mean its clear plastic brittle comes with it  i would feel a lot worse about breaking a 2 stand than a 15 stand
  no smell at all on mine but ymmv
  how brittle is a regular stand  even if cheap i dont want them to snap too soon
  ive only broken one stand arm and that was the peg that goes into the base i was probably manhandling it anyways the ones i bought came with an extra stand arm thats just a straight arm so its still usable and a couple different grabby stand heads
  so if i dont go ham i will be fine
chinese bruticus being sold for around 10  how good is it
  pretty good from what ive heard someone weighed it and it was the same as the original ones
  are the sellers trustworthy enough  10 for a bruticus is pretty crazy
  10 dollars sound like per individual component is the listing clear on that
  yes it is  which is a relief since i do not need a second onslaught  still the official limbs go for more than 30  so its still a steal
  ebay uhoh ive been 3/5 ebay bootlegs are really just grab your money and run stores     now i just use aliexpress for bootlegs theyve always been prompt with returning money if shipping is slow and had like only 2 out of 40 or so purchases not deliver not all toys
  oh that doesnt sound good  what does give it away that they are going to take your money and run  i assume positive feedback doesnt matter much
    wow they look actually really close if they didnt have the scratches i might not be able to tell
  no that anon how can you make sure they arent going to just book it once they have your money
so wheres the safest to buy bootlegs
  i would say ebay since its relatively easy to get a refund directly from them or thru paypal not sure how the process works with ali
  positive feedback sell count less than 2000 and high sale numbers are big giveaways that theyre a generated account made to fish for money and account information sometimes the account information is more important to them than the 50 bucks they get from you    ebay you have to be careful if youre using their mastercard since the cards buyer protection is not as good
  not as good as most other credit card protection services i mean like theres literally no online way to file refund its paper mail form     ebay can be good and bad some fake sellers will generate a tracking number but not ship and use the extra info to fool or delay ebay/paypal or they use that super long delivery time to try to time out your refund in either case it can take 2 months to get a resolution
  well the one selling stands only gets the positive feedback they seem to have a good amount of stuff sold  and it says they only take paypal    it does say it might take up to january to ship though
ive used both ebay and aliexpress and for ebay i made sure to buy from a seller with as high a number of ratings as i could and ive never had problems the bootleg judy i bought from aliexpress came broken though and after trying to contact the seller and after giving them several business days to respond to multiple messages i just requested a refund a few hours later and i got it without question    i think both ebay/paypal and aliexpress are pretty good about giving money back and i know for a fact if youre a dick paypal can help you fuck someone over
  isnt high ratings supposed to be able to be fabricated
  no sayaka bootleg  rip
  is it i dont know how that shit works but ill usually go read the reviews since you can tell if they have a lot of bots from the generic copypastad good reviews      even bootleggers are picky at what they choose to make apparently
  theres quite a lot to go through but aside from a few duplicates it seems to be alright  so how often have you bought bootlegs from ebay
  to be fair relating to toys ive ordered a handful of times as of late ive received everything ive ordered though being joints stands figures i have revoltech joints on the way right now    i do like aliexpresss way of having itemspecific feedback and reviews ive only ordered once from there though so i cant say i have too much experience
  wonder how safe is it to get them when they are stands since paypal seems like the safest option
  does this look safe enough
  yeah most of the bad and neutral reviews are people not realizing they are buying a bootleg
how healthy are bootlegs  i mean as in how likely it is they completely disappear without previous notice from aliexpress and such    i want to get like 8 sets of the pe hands and feet sets but im broke right now
  theyve been there for a while i doubt they will get rid of them anytime soon
anyone have figuarts thanos ordered one back in october and still waiting
  pe combiner kos are still in production i think its just that the company is very low profile the stuff that comes from higher profile companies die with them like the machine boy kos
  what website
now this is just outrageous i dont think its legit at all  
just to know is a 100 feedback without negative an even worse redflag than a china account with less than a month
so this got bootlegged anyone already ordered it is it worth getting
knowingly bought a bootleg sh figuarts thanos   it was way cheaper than normal retail so wth  how fucked am i
  i havent been on toy for a while what even is it also link
  as fucked as your picture
    leaking black goo out of her nose
  sfbt3    came out several years ago they were all assembled by hand by the creator cost around 325 or so im not sure if theyre still producing legit ones it basically feels like a really neat plastic model    the bootlegs on ebay last time i looked were around 80
what was the store/brand that made the 11 kos of the combiner wars figures
  brand is 孩之星 no idea what aliexpress sellers translate that into
  thanks fren
  from the reviews i have seen its fine for a bootleg
heads up both the figma michael jackson thriller and figuarts michael jackson smooth criminal got bootlegged both are available via ebay and aliexpress    also seems the bringarts kaine figure got bootlegged too i might get it and customize it with a dick for accuracy
  fuck you anon now i have to order a kaine and a smooth criminal    ill post pics when they arrive
  i have a bootleg sonic nendo ive never had a legit one but i can post pictures of him
  please do im interested in how kaine turned out i bootleg form
      new thread
so is anybody going to be making toys for this please somebody other than pak please
  i would pay 8 grands for a toy from that rather than a coat thats for sure
maybe revoltech
  one can only dream desu
  dreeeeeeamssss
  asmus is making a ton of 1/6th figures of the franchise vergil and dmc 4 dante are already out and kick ass check those out if you want dmc5 specifically theres a good chance theyll do those too except itll be a while
  so is anybody going to be making toys for this  union creative is the latest ip holder for a lot of capcom franchise they made arthur and the demon from ghoul n goblin monster hunter etc but the line is kind of dead
  too bad revoltech is shit they cant do realistic faces give me shf please or someone similar og dante and vergil first
  revoltech can do realistic faces its only yamaguchi thats shit
  ive seen them best dmc game face sculpts but they still seem off also they have a few unannounced ones in their dmc line but it might be cancelled
  cancelled  where did you hear this theyve just been releasing shit slowly afaik vergil and dante dmc 4 sold out
  i i thought i read about this on mfc but now cant find anything about it so what the fuck do i know i just figured the line was cancelled because we havent even seen previews of other stuff yet my mistake
  fair enough but like i said you want quality get those i have dante hes top notch
  just looked at their dmc4 dante and his shoulders are way too thin and his legs too short because theyre using a stock body whereas dantes proportions are stylized in 4 their v dante should look perfect because v dante no longer has stylized proportions
  dante is spot on  vergil is spot on  nero looks like this  the fuck happened here
  thats their nero from before the line was official  they had no factories and the product was mediocre besides that was a limited release you should see the dante from that era color was nicer thats about it     when they redo nero hell look way better
  i really want to but cant find it anywhere even if i could i just ordered another expensive figure some day though or ill wait for their v dante if they do one    i thought the face sculpt looked off too but it is the best dante out there     jesus christ how horrifying
  least i know where to go if i want a figure of marc almond cosplaying nero
  i think sideshow has a preorder wait list up if you want vergil get him now dmc3 dante next supposedly i will trade inn my dmc4 dante for 5 if they make him though i need my 30 yo boomer dante plus no coyote a
  dmc3 dante next supposedly  how do you know this if this is the case then im going to be hella broke vergil is a must buy now before dmc3 dante
  there was a release schedule on one of their social media outlets  this was the initial intended release schedule but i think its changed significantly they also want to do both spardas i believe
  lady  fuuuuuuuuuck yes
  unfortunately i think were getting dmc4 lady instead
  i dont care i never thought there would be a lady figure 3 would be a best but any is good desu
   theyre wanting to do the whole cast if thats the case ill grab dmc v dante and nero then hope i can score alastor if hes even made then hope for dmc3 lady
  hes not that bad in person and vergil looks way better id say the issue is more the stock body isnt as bulky as dmc4 dante but im excited to think of what theyll do with 3 dante
any new info on the asmus line havent seen proto shots since vergil months ago

  enough to make devils cry

  why
hello /toy/ first time posting here  so its december christmas time is here so naturally its time to decorate part of my festive decor is a 1 gauge 1/29th scale aristocraft train set that my family has had longer than i can remember it started as a 3 piece set of engine flatbed caboose pretty standard weve added a couple other cars since then but its naturally been deteriorating visually and functionality wise and today its gotten to the point where if i turn the control all the up the engine alone doesnt move unless bumped and even then it only goes half a foot before stopping  ive tried cleaning the track and wheels didnt help so i thought oh ill pull the motor out and maybe replace it but the screws wont fucking budge    what do i do is there any replacements you guys recommend in the same scale could i possibly take it to a hobby/model shop and get it fixed and are there any good ones in dfw    please help i know its stupid but it just isnt christmas without it
  sadly i doubt youll find help here     not out of any malace but model train folks tend to be forum goers and dont tend to visit here     we have a train thread pop up now and again but they tend to die out after a few posts       any consolation i had very similar issue with my trains back in the day still cant tell you what the issue is      rest assured in another decade when i hit my midlife crisis and have a basement full of trains ill be back here every day keeping a train thread alive
  worth a shot at least sigh alright thank you for the help
  make sure all the connections are good depends what kind of train you have but if theres contacts that go to the track from your control box those may need tweaking    otherwise take it to a store theres places that specialize in trains so look for one of those if you can    my first goto is always cleaning contact points though those engines are surprisingly sturdy ive been running my train every year since i was maybe 10 im 30 now and the only thing ive really had to do is grease the axles a bit and make sure the contacts are sitting properly
  i made the mistake of storing it in the garage simply in a cardboard box i think the humidity and heat did something to it ill definitely be heading to a train hobbyist shop when i can both to see what they can do and see if they have any track pieces the connecting wires are also kill so i guess fingers crossed
this one is the same just a different
  you could ask some guys at /n/ theres a model train thread up and its a slow board so if youre lucky you might get some help from them
are the screws rusted or glued onto it
should i gut my track cleaning car to motorize the challenger or wait and order some lego train motors
  hi op how old is your engine i bet it has some years of rolling along the tracks all engines will suffer this problem at one point due to the use id say you better check if you can replace the engine for a new one or get a new loco
dumbass /pol/ are trying for an irs reporting push to punish degenerate sex workers  will bite them in the ass when conservatives who are also dodging taxes get reported    so long all you youtube toy reviewers who run patreon accounts solely to fund your toy collections under the falsehood that babbling about plastic is content creation you too action figure customizers who think repainting retail toys is art i can guarantee you that none of them are paying taxes often because they skirt under paypals automatic reporting amount    i bet a lot of them go to prison when they cant pay     btw you get a 35 cut of what they do pay for reporting them as a reward not sure if i want a certain nashville fuckwad i tattled on to pay or go to prison honestly
will bite them in the ass when conservatives who are also dodging taxes get reported  hey you brought the /pol/ in so im gonna say it if some (((conservatives))) get assblasted on the irs its fine with me
no ones going to jail for chump change theyre going to get a request to pay back the money on a schedule
  twitch whores should pay taxes and nobody here will miss any reviewer  if only the irs could send thew to the streets
  thots require patrolling and noone cares about your shit cobra commander custom fuck off
whys the truforce x so good bros
now to put together xs chimera ride armor if youve been debating on the super minipla ride armors stop and just get them
    i had him but i didnt keep it because the figure is too large for 6 and he isnt based on any of the games
  if only there was zero too sigh
  my mail was really late today so i couldnt finish viles before leaving for work but i love it so far however the shoulders dont connect very tightly to the body should i glue them on
pick four x series characters to make into figures    hard mode they cant have existing figures gashapon and statues exempt
  basically because they were designed and made by sentinel and truforce is just a empty brandname created by bluefin
  iris alia dynamo and x8vile
  x1 sigma  x2 armor x  axl  dynamo
finally got off my ass and played through powered up for the first time which made me realize that the mega man nendoroids could be considered tie in merch for it not officially of course
  axl has figures    theyre shit but they exist
  oof i forgot about those    uhhhhx5 sigma i guess and not the mvc redesign
  axl has figures  theyre shit  i thought that was assumed when talking about axl
  magma dragoon  boomer kuwanger  storm eagle  x8 vile
  robot
  command mission x  alia  layer  iris    how are the nxedge x and zero figures
  we have reports of an oui repeat we have a report of an oui all maverick hunters please respond
so who here loves the bandai 66 mini line
  i will never not be mad sentinel assfucked bluefin so were never getting a zero or vile in this style i hate those faggots     mini vile  nice
  whatever retard without sentinel we would have gotten nothing at all    bluefin are the incompetent retards that couldnt do anything on their own
  why even do that sentinel had a good name that was worth advertising why did they want it to be in small print only thats fucking retarded      sounds like bluefin fucked themselves by being credit hogs who wanted all the glory for the figure when they werent even doing the hard work this is like the partnerships freeing and other companies have with good smile company except those companies arent trying to remove the figma/gsc/etc branding off their product to take credit
   sentinel are scumbags they did this shit to the armarauders line and purposefully over charge for their figures because they want to maintain a premium figure prestige or some shit     if you support their tactics youre a corporate dick sucker
  and yet here you are crying that they didnt make more figures in this line for you to buy
  that was a totally different situation sentinel wasnt trying to charge more for the truforce they just wanted their branding on it at the time it came out the truforce price was in line with all their other prices dude
robot master line when
  iris  gate  red  general
  green biker dude  ix  velguarder  shadow armor x
    fuck sentinel for shit like  two versions  the second one being amiami exclusive  important accessories scattered between the two  their excuse for the above is that the mega man 11 artist was too busy with that game to finish the full model sheet for them and they went to production on one of the versions anyway  just one version is nearly twice as expensive compared to the previous mega man 4inch nels  tron bonnes figure and the entire lines future lies entirely on roll casketts success  what the fuck were they thinking but in this case bluefin/truforce were definitely in the wrong here youre collaborating with another company for fuck sake stealing all the credit is just fucking scummy and retarded
  even scummier that theyre starting with that roll instead of classic roll
  classic roll  which one because theres 3 versions now not counting spin offs like battle  chase
  theyre sitting in my private warehouse i plan on reverse engineering them to 3d print 112 scale ones
        thats not what happened and that guy was not a former employee capcom didnt want to have truforce make another non game rendition of megaman unless it was the one from the new tv show obviously thats a lose lose situation so they just dropped it    had nothing to do with this fine print stuff you are talkng about like seriously fine print how gullible are you guys to believe thats the straw that broke the camels back    also bluefin and sentinel teamed up again for the transformer model kits under another shell company called flame toys so that relationship is perfectly fine
  truforce x looks like an evil soulless megaman x copy     falcon armor x  fourth armor x   dynamo  alia x5  third armor x
  heheh no doubt if they started with classic roll they would pull the same shit of 2 releases at once     roll mega man 17 design   comes with eddie vacuum and buster/hands     roll mega man 8 design   comes with beat broom and multiple faces     have to get both to get your complete roll since stuff is split between the 2
  at least that would actually be two different designs you could display together
do you fear the curse of zero anon
  4 inch nel zero type 1  4 inch nel zero type 2  4 inch nel sigma x 1 version  4 inch nel vile     best mega man line ever even with the stupid scale
its a shame that mega man is kind of a cursed ip for toys but im still grateful that my life long dream for a good exe figure came true
  we never got anything after nx edge zero for the nx line so maybe
    we still got mega man nendoroids after zero
  needs to be a nendo of mega man zero zero in order for it to completely nuke a line
  and your source      no its for muh pattern fags hasnt even happened with the last two mm4inch tforce lines and they are still dead
  ix  shadow armor x
  ix not return x and good luck getting a complete shadow armor x even in your picture the arm is a zero one painted black
wheres my fucking protoman nel
  never ever because roll will kill the line all thanks to jewtinel
mfw nobody has made a review video for rolls new nendoroid
holy crap just found this on ebay does anyone know what the original figure this was bootleging
  anonits official
  thats terrifying  what line
  marvel universe/legends 375 hasbro put it out in a twopack with a repainted im2 iron man mkiii as a gamerverse marvel vs capcom twopack chances are your local target still has around five of them
i used to have a bunch of these snaptogether megaman toys kinda like gundam models i used to fucking love them they had these metal balls you could fire off    anybody got a clue what im talking about
    i still regret selling my iron buster protoman
  theres a few interviews with the 1 employee of truforce same guy on the kickstarter video where he just cites license issues as to why the line is not continuing off the record he chats with toyark into more detail about capcom having no idea what they are doing with megaman at toy fair 2 years ago
  guy from last thread it good but seriously what you see in the promotional material is exactly what you get
  thats the functions vs functions infinite figure m8
  nah first story still makes more sense to me capcom decided that they cant make any different characters but let 4inchnel make any character they wanted    besides truforce did literally nothing in the creative or productive process they didnt design the figures they didnt engineer them or have their own factory make them why the fuck do they deserve any credibility
  yes    it was these ones i had this exact megaman actually disliked the chrome but i couldnt find the normal one    i also had megaman x zero bass protoman and rush and im sure a few more fucking awesome
i wish the stands that came with the 4 inch nel figures werent so damn huge
  dynamo  overdrive ostrich  fucking sigma  steel massimo
  iris does she have any berkana spider metal shark player dynamo
  iris does she have any    she had a statue sold at the hobbyrock conventions you have to paint it otherwise no
  i wish the figures were in scale with the stand desu
  yeah same why couldnt it be 6 inch nel
    i wish theyd quit throwing in the stand and include more accessories ive got a big stack of their baseplates that i never use and would rather not pay for more
  reprint when
finally get exe after getting a good deal in the bst  roll pre ordered  still no sign of a volnutt on manda or a possible reissue    fuck me
  i like it its big and strong enough to use for my marvel legends nova in a flight pose
   pre ordered  fucking cuck
dont talk to me or my son ever again
  did you paint or matte coat the super minipla
  not yet just got done testfitting it looks really good right out of the box
  fuck i want the big one
  sigma w with laser cape  truforce zero mvci  magma dragoon  original steel massimo with laser rapier
is it a bad idea to ge kotobukiya proto man if i dont really have any experience building model kits but really like proto man
  cant be that hard to build
  kotobukiya  actually how are those mega man model kits does anyone here own any of them if so would you recommend them
  boomer kuwanger  storm eagle  armored armadillo  spark mandrill
  i have the mega man proto man and roll kits theyre the only model kits ive ever built but the instructions are pretty clear so theyre not intimidating to build at all as long as youre gentle with them they dont fall apart very easily i dont own many other mm figures so i cant tell you how well they scale to other lines but i think they look decent and theyre fun to build rock probably looks the worst out of them all roll and proto man look great
  i had roll  she was okay i guess  she was weirdly big and didnt scale with anything which was annoying but she was cute
  axl was cool in x8 and command mission though hell in cm he did some pretty awesome shit      speaking of which    spider  cinnamon  marino  massimo    yeah command mission was one of my favorite x games as for brand id probably want sh figuarts
  it snaps together easily just get an exacto knife to carefully shave off the little bits of plastic that stay on when you take out the pieces
  they are good kits to assemble without glue and nice articulation just be carefull when cutting the part that cover the neck and when moving the legs the pieces inside the hip that hold the legs in place are tho thin and looks very fragile
  just use nippers instead of trying to rip the parts from the runners and youll do decently
  who made the big one i only knew of the small for the action 66 candy toy
  bandai back in the 90s
can anyone identify all of these rolls
    rock looks like shit because his face is completely off model roll is way more on model and protomans shades hides his face
  this completely ended up ordering just roll and proto man kinda sucks that they dont scale with anything apparently
    articulated one in the center is the kotobukiya kit i think anyways could be wrong    that keychain looking one came from a bland pack of gachapon style toys found them at eb games a year or so ago    the one with the lego style arms came from something similar a blind pack gachapon style figure    i think the one on the far left is a nendoroid    howd i do
any love for loyal subjects i got them for four dollars a piece on clearance and my only dupes are good for repaints so i have a bias toward them
  i wish gospelx rush and skull man werent store exclusives the paint jobs and faces could have been better for most of them though
  gigantic series  nendoroid  kotobukiya kit  kidrobot  funko pint size heroes  backpack hanger  soul of figuration  rockman 10 8bit keychain  the only one im not familiar with is the little figurine directly in front of the model kit
  the only one im not familiar with is the little figurine directly in front of the model kit  those were the ones i wanted to know about the most
  ones  no just that one i identified the rest
  soul of figuration  where can i buy these
  oh yeah missed that somehow
  i have no idea they were on bbts for years     ebay
  theyre a million dollars there got into the hobby way too late it seems
fucking finally pulled a vile  and it only took 7 payments of 1299    yep never buying instore again  dont know what im going to do with the dupes
  protoman bass and snakeman when
  decent megaman zero and 4 guardians when
for anyone still looking for they 66 action megaman candy toys barnes and nobles websites is still selling some for 895 they send them out at random though pulls are pic related
  meant to say volume 1 ones
  barnes and noble has these for 799 in store and from the 3 i selected i got all buy one of teh figures i wanted  learn to shake for sound and feel for weight    also membership got me 10 off too
  wtf the na release is blindboxed arent there identifying stickers on the top like 
guess they didnt make them blind boxes for the volume one release
i can report that i went to barnes and nobles and they removed the labels ontop for the english release which is bs since all the previous releases had the names ontop
  thank god i dont want those we need some new characters already
  i dont think they removed anything as theyre either printed on the box itself or using those stickers which are impossible to take off without damaging the cheap cardboard
  i bought a case and they seem to be loaded front to back in the order theyre displayed on the back of the packs from left to right top to bottom barnes and noble looks like they kept them in the case while the stor i bought my initial ones from did not
  i have a few but have to say it stings when you get zero 3 times in a row after paying full price for 4 id take my chances though
  love the big ones size love the toonyness of the kit
  what does the box look like
  whos the lewd statueshit legs in the back for science please
do you think if we contacted true force en masse we could convince them its worth their while to develop a zero and sigma
  what for free you want 10000 people to tell a bunch of guys to make a toy some of us wont buy for free
  for free fuck you i got money do you
  it seems to be the japanese box but printed by bluefin so that everything is printed directly onto the box instead of their normal stickers    gave the boxes a good look to see if there were any visible differences to see if there was a tell on which character resided in each box but nope all identical as far as i could tell  i already threw away the other boxes so i didnt bother to check more closely now that i knew which held what
  is that the official item and not a ko nothing in that wave has anything to do with megaman 2 plus with all the moonrunes i wouldve figured it would say rockman at the very least
  its the bluefin import of 66 action rockman series 2 they changed the box for marketing reasons and nothing else
   that totty
  command mission x  already has a figure
people had me worried this dude looks really good for the most part it really is just a mega man recolor but hes just so awesome
  buying a mega man dressed like the mascot of the company fucking their mega man line with shady business practices
does the truforce have any problems like peeling paint on the diecast
  they didnt make the toy i want the way i want  do you have a real complaint
  not really    the worst is knowing the fact that there will never be a zero to go with him
  
  i mean it sucks but i dont think thats really that big of a deal literally the only mega man figure that has good quality and price is the truforce one and that line is dead as shit 4 inch nel is so far the only line that has given me figures i want with good articulation dforce was close but none of the ones i got werent shit when it came to staying together the price is high but no one else with license is doing something good ill probably end up with standard roll because its the only time ive ever seen a figure for the character so it silly to be shocked that someone would buy a figure from them    also im a mega man cuck
  getting blatantly ripped off is no big deal  well at least youre honest about being a cuck though youre still a piece of shit for supporting shitty business practices and making everything worse for the rest of us you faggot
  vile without x    for what purpose
  fuck x and those from the ds games i just want villains lots of villains
  but who else would ride the two ride armors other than x and vile
  there are lots of toys that can do that even some nendos can fit in there
where in barnes and noble are the megaman figures i searched the whole store nearest to me and couldnt find them
  soon theyre a book store hot topic will probably get them first
  i found mine right next to the comic trade section  they also used to have the toys next to the manga section or behind the cash registers    theres another barnes and noble that has all their collector toys near the middle section of the store    you need to look harder because every store is different  or just ask someone faggot
thanks to you guys now i have two of these
  or just ask someone faggot    bns budget cuts have been awful here theres been times ive done a sitetostore where i wait 15 minutes get two different customer reps and wait for them to check stock only to be told the website isnt accurate they fired all their fulltimers so all you get is people who barely know their store and arent really trained
  the site is never accurate    honestly if you need to go out of your way to visit the store it probably isnt worth it   i regularly go to bb to check out books models and the odd toys theyll get   i usually didnt go to tru just to hunt for toys but id go if i went grocery shopping at a market that was a block away  i go to an import toy store everytime i need to buy groceries too since its on the same strip mall
    im sorry you believed in the hype youll have them back up on ebay before the end of the year
  still cant see how someone could dislike such a well made figure
    its just boring i have no connection to the design and its out of scale with a majority of what i own figma  figuarts     its a wellmade figure but its shelf warming because no one really cares about it its a mega man that means nothing
  actually the one not in the box is the reissue i preordered 2 or 3 years ago i actually really liked the figure but the paint has come off the diecast over its lifetime and seeing this thread pushed me to replace it
   emgy grunt in the back  good taste
    just grabbed the ride armors for 4800 yen off amiami due to damaged box stoked
    just got back from bn and they arent labeled i pulled two from an untouched case and got x and vile so the packing order appears to be unchanged
so what kind of paint are you meant to use on model kits my kotobukiya proto man arrived yesterday still waiting for roll and id want them to look the best they could be this is also my first model kit ever hence why im asking
  enamels you better read up on them before you even consider purchasing any
    use quality acrylics like vallejo reaper or citadel if youre new to painting    you will fuck up hardcore with enamel acrylics are easier to work with and its what most modelers use so you can produce very high end results once you git gud you can produce better results than your average chinaslave though  also dont handbrush tamiya acrylics theyre shit for handbrushing
  its just out of scale and theres nothing to accompany it with but i loved it so much that i sold my darts
  2nd this use acrylics theyre much easier to work with for still very good results if you have to ask youre not ready for enamels theyre a fucking mess and a lot harder to work with
  its not megaman 2 its series 2 in the megaman action 66 line
  why cant a 3p make a zero in this style or make upscaled 4inch nels
  its untested waters beyond bootleg scams and i dont think anyone wants to risk it based on how quickly the official lines peter out
yeah but 4inchnel zero gba when
  how about a good one that isnt trash
  at least get an alt color instead of two blues
      now that i see it how did you manage to chip that much paint off
  jesus christ anon the line is holding on by a thread as is
    and any zero is better than some of the literalwho megaman spinoff crap this line has churned out
  i love gba zero but hes always been the death knell for mm lines    you get zero itll be the last figure they make if they even get to release him
  he mustve defeated sigma
    can you fuckoff with this dumb superstition you post about it in every thread and its already been proven false
  what a dreadful opinion  we finally get a little variety in a mega man line and you ask for the character with 500 billion existing figures
     how many good zeros exist theres like two mediocre approaching decent bandai figures and thats it     meanwhile 4inchnel is pumped out shit nobody asked for and pointless repaints or alternatehat versions
  literalwho megaman spinoff crap  found the poser faggot
  fuck off and go back to making shitty mobile games for level5 inafune
  sick argument bro you showed me
  the navigators plus magna centipede
  how many good zerows exist  i own 2 and id still say non darts is a fragile piece of ass and the sh mmz zero is ass too    people say zero kills the line but in reality its poor quality that kills it
  too bad the darts are still comparably better than the likes of the jazwares armor series and loyal subjects
  yeah i know bitch
  autistic screeching wont get you a zero figure either
  only autistic thing about discussing a zero figure round here is claiming that the sky will fall if we ever get a new one    my most wanted is zx anyway do go ahead and tell me what shit you think we need next since apparently zero is forbidden despite the recent influx of nothing but megaman
how does the 4inch nel x look with the super minipla ride armors
  goofy i mean 4 inch nel x is nearly twice the size of the 66 action which is what was meant for that ride armor there is no way to fit the 4 inch nel into the cockpit unless you like yanked off all his limbs and just stuffed his torso in there which would look terrible
  zx  huuuurrr literal who so it shouldnt exist
  
  read again retard 4inchnel are designs of characters that actually exist capcom didnt want them making up their own designs
  not a source
much better
  moderoid am i getting this to go next to simon in gurren lagann
  
  i just hope its round and fits kirby/meta knight
  i never cared for base truforce x but the xkai recolor looked great with the design he already looked more imposing than base x so the added height didnt bother me and those bass colors looked slick shame hes a con exclusive
funko    
how shitty is the darts x knockoff
  extremely from what ive heard
  damn the original is so old that i cant really find a copy of it for anything under like 150 anymore
      yknow that truforce x looks pretty swanky you people said its shelfwarming how hard exactly
  its almost like you can like the creative side of a business but not the financial/ business side woah
  diverse and complicated opinions about something where do you think you are
  ive regularly seen it down to just over 60 on bigbadtoystore     dont let the shelfwarming make you think its a bad toy its godtier its just gotten multiple production runs and just about everyone who wanted one has one now
  ah cool how would you say it compares value wise to the sentinel x most prices i can find for that are about the same but considering the truforce one is apparently distributed by bluefin shipping might be a lot easier
  the four inch game accurate one i mean
  plus its a collection nonstarter well never see anything that goes with it which puts off people
  it blows it away its nearly twice as tall has diecast metal parts without feeling overweight a lightup xbuster glossy metallic paint with tampographs and tight joints to hold it all together its so much nicer than the 4 inch nel despite not being accurate to anything
  well ill definitely try and pick one up then if i can it looks pretty slick     what about those 99action figures are those any fun
   tight joints    nah considering all the diecast at the boots they should have given it ratchets in the legs it can also have trouble holding up the buster with effects attached
why is this allowed to exist
  i have a fucking peg of those at my target that im pretty sure hasnt moved since mvci was released
  im legitimately shocked that theyre doing another one of these after how hard the x abomination shelfwarmed  i guess you have try and move those billion black widows the stores sent back somehow i dont see any other connection with her and ryu
  to be fair this set looks ten times better than the x abomination
heres a quicky q has anyone photoshopped the truforce x to have to original color scheme
  like fall apart in your hands or just some stray flash and messy seam lines those prices on ebay are pretty tempting anybody here actually have it how poor is the plastic quality
  loose joints sloppy molding fleshcolored neck and they didnt include the piece to plug the effect part into the xbuster despite the photos on the listings
and what are the chances of bandai ever reissuing x themselves
  they already did a year or two ago so its possible
  wow and the after market prices are still the way they are guess ill just keep an eye on ebay and mandarake for a more reasonable price
  so no
  is doing a gay talk to the hand pose
  i have that one its hollow does not have a cool energy scarf and crappy i want a decent command mission x that game and cast is amazing
  yeah shame this one is a custom
  im trying to make a gay hadoken pun but ones not coming to me
whats the best mega man to use for a smash display that doesnt have me paying out the ass for a figure articulation doesnt need to be amazing dont really wanna pay more than 40 if possible
  google the 66action fig that might suit your purpose
  barns and noble is doing those blindbox things right
    those are what i was originally looking at i decided to get one on amazon for 11 to guarantee i get mega man instead of winging it and getting x or exe or volnutt well that and to save on the 10 to go uber over to bn
  based retard
anyone own zeros nendo im impressed with the paint job and detail on his armor the bendable legs are nice touches too
just finished one of the super mini place ride armors
  yea you are trying to get people to tank a line because you havent gotten the characters you want is beyond stupid even for here now call me a cuck and stfu
  that wasnt even me the guy you replied to  trying to get people to tank a line because you havent gotten the characters you want  i never even implied that you illiterate the point was that its shameless to spend 50 on a mega man dressed like the mascot of a company thats selfdestructing the very same line with shady business practices thats like buying a darth vader with the ea logo on his chest     earlier in the year i wouldnt have really cared but the shit theyve pulled since with roll caskett is disgusting and will quite likely finish the line off since its already been limping after x came out people practically rewarding sentinel by buying mascot rock afterwards just leaves more bad taste in my mouth
    its about what you expect it looks good posing is iffy since it does nendoroid armswaps but the legs are alright
  im no where near illiterate butinstead simply find your point pretty moot im not the guy who posted the pic of it but bought the sentinel 30th mm and enjoy it the rockman base used is good the colors are sick and the armor is coolthe 4inchnels literally sell out everywhere and yet im supposed to believe that theyre self destructing it or you know destroying it bc english because u sez soo shut up
  the 4inchnels literally sell out everywhere  volnutt and star force are lowerpopularity characters and it took about a year after they shipped to get a release date for the next in line prior to that blackout we were getting a new figure every couple of months either mass released or gentinel exclusive  yet im supposed to believe that theyre self destructing it or you know destroying it bc english because u sez soo  they raised the price by a third on a roll of all characters and split her essential accessories up between two versions so you have to buy her twice to get the entire product theres upset about that in the englishspeaking community and there was clearly enough upset in japan for them to have the character artist make a public excuse to justify the decision and save face 4 inch nel rockman is coming out of a hiatus with a release that is very likely going to flop and put the line down for good all because of some shady anticonsumer bullshit theyre trying to rip off the waifu hikikos with  shut up  no you put your money where your mouth is and tell me how im wrong about this
mmega man toys are pretty cool right guys
  yes its nice we still get merchandise i hope mm11 sales were good enough to warrant more games even though inafune left
  not wanting exe and volnutt
  ill volnutt in your exe
yknow i think i am gonna go for one of the bootlegs not being able to attach the blast effects and the fleshtone neck doesnt bother me and i dont mind doing a bit of work to make the joints work better and the the flash/seams look better especially for the price even if it doesnt come out top quality  and if the real version gets reissued or becomes otherwise available i can still pick it up if i so desire i just got a wild hair up my ass for wanting an x figure
  cant say ive run into the loose joints that  is talking about unless he means interchangeable joints for hands/feet which i find arent too great on even real x but definitely right on molding being somewhat messy the neck being off color and the missing buster extension eye decals also off alignment on every bootleg x ive come across so far

  volnutt and star force are lowerpopularity characters and it took about a year after they shipped to get a release date for the next in line prior to that blackout we were getting a new figure every couple of months either mass released or gentinel exclusive  during that time you also fail to mention that the 4inchnel line started delving into other animes like getter robo fate/stay etc but yea ok  they raised the price by a third on a roll of all characters and split her essential accessories up between two versions so you have to buy her twice to get the entire product theres upset about that in the englishspeaking community and there was clearly enough upset in japan for them to have the character artist make a public excuse to justify the decision and save face 4 inch nel rockman is coming out of a hiatus with a release that is very likely going to flop and put the line down for good all because of some shady anticonsumer bullshit theyre trying to rip off the waifu hikikos with  so youre bothered because you have to buy two versions of a 40 toy to have all of the accessories from both for completist purposes where was this mitching when lan was released as a statue for the sake of giving exe more accessories hell the entire line consists of figures that come with one additional pair of hands and a face they arent flush with accessories by any means so each roll release falls in line with the accessory count of the line by basic price point and again at least we get two full on figures when obtaining all of the accessories vs having to buy another shit statue  no you put your money where your mouth is and tell me how im wrong about this  i do put my money where my mouth is literally and buy what i want thats why youre mitching in the first place as for you being wrong im not going to say that because were talking about alternative opinions and preferences vs fact
  yes
  mitching
  men complaining about moot shit to the point where they come off legitimately effeminate     and is that pic the hillbilly doll from athf thats hilarious
anybody have a group shot of all or most of the different brands of mega/x for size comparison purposes like the truforce darts nel 66action etc
  id have less of a problem if the rolls were actually 40 like you seem to think
  i have both i would go for the 4inch nel i mean sure you will get a good figure with truforce but you can experience paint chipping on the die cast parts mine has some chipping on the knees and chest i only pose him take pics and put it back to the shelf while the 4inch nel you dont get as much accessories you will get a x1x3 era accurate figure
  it was a blatant generalization of the lines pricing and i dont necessarily care what your problems are buy what you want and stop trying to guilt others from doing the same particularly using false reasoning    i agree i have all of the truforce variant and think the 4inchnel is better looking and more fun to play with i dont have any qc issues with either but just enjoy looking at and playing with it more
    problem is now im realizing i mustve been mistaken and the nels not available anywhere
  during that time you also fail to mention that the 4inchnel line started delving into other animes like getter robo fate/stay etc but yea ok  fair point  so youre bothered because you have to buy two versions of a 40 toy to have all of the accessories from both for completist purposes  its a 75 toy and one version doesnt have the hat she almost never takes off the other comes with data and hes just as essential of a character its a ploy to get people to spend 150 for a 4 figure and its ridiculous which has ironically made people not want to buy either version   where was this mitching when lan was released as a statue for the sake of giving exe more accessories  lan was an afterthought and an entirely new product that came several months after exes release    but you know what they could have made a barrel caskett figurine and packed data and the other amiamilocked accessories with it and everything wouldve been peachy but instead they packed them in with another identical roll and took her trademark hat out of the package just to try and twist peoples arms into buying the same figure twice its underhanded and disrespectful to the people who supported their line up to this point no one should be rewarding that  i do put my money where my mouth is literally and buy what i want  if this crap theyre pulling succeeds because enough people dont have the selfrespect or know the value of money you can count on more figures getting split down the middle in the future get ready for a proto man with helmet/no helmet versions with the helmet version lacking his shield and buster    that wasnt me  buy what you want and stop trying to guilt others from doing the same  buy what you want but dont be surprised when others give you shit for encouraging anticonsumer practices that hurt all of us
  fair point  ty  its a 75 toy and one version doesnt have the hat she almost never takes off the other comes with data  again essential in and of itself is subjective so im not going to back and forth with you about that you obviously read the other post about the pricing being a generalization of the line and screenshot confirming the reasoning behind it so i dont understand your attempt to correct the remark either you dont want to buy it and i am buying it i dont find the price to be overly expensive we both win i get the figures i win and you get your moral victory over a toy company   but instead they packed them in with another identical roll and took her trademark hat out of the package just to try and twist peoples arms  as previously stated both figures are in line with the accessory count of the line there was no way one was going to come with all of what the two pieces contain personally i like having both the hat and non versions of roll just to have some variants on my shelf because i dont see us getting classic roll anytime soon  if this crap theyre pulling succeeds because enough people dont have the selfrespect or know the value of money  lost me at acting like your standard of income made and value is somehow universal and self respect come the fuck on stop masking being priced out under the guise of self righteousness     and protoman between a buster alternate hands a shield and a scarf on top of alternate faces wouldnt come with an unmasked head in the first place which goes back to the accessory county stated multiple times now hed have to be loaded just to be basic  others give you shit   i dont give a shit about what people think about what i buy lol i was calling our your attempt to make a personal issue a wider company boycott youre mitching because a company found a way to make more money im in this for good toys and not some homie hookup

is there any giveaway for the action 666 wave 2 figures to show which figure is inside grabbed two and xs robo at barnes but didnt get x himself
buy my first 66 action blind at bn  get based cut man
  if i buy the full case of 10 to split with a friend will we each get one of the four with 2 leftovers or are the cases packed randomly as well
  the cases are two full sets

the nefarious dr wily and all the megaman variants went on pre order at bbts damn this is our best chance to get some decent and articulated robot masters
  ill buy wily to go with the 4inchnel megaman but i seriously doubt well get any robot masters and if they do itll just be cut man for the 9 millionth time
did 4inch nel megaman x ever get a knockoff i wanna make some customs but ideally i dont wanna butcher an official figure
  boomerang kuwanger  magna centipede  crush crawfish   axle the red
  hardly any robot masters outside of the usual mm1 group exist anywhere but axl has multiple figures
  almost every wave includes   rock   3 rock variants   blues   x   and then maybe cutman or elecman    if we are lucky we get roll and zero sometimes vile was out of nowhereeven then rock blues and cutman used the exact same body
  any update on this or is the monthlong shipping period not over yet
bluefin is having a sale on truforce x if anyone is interested    
  heres the best i got for you boss
  every company has to do this to get people to trust the line  they then die because there are already 20 versions of rock and x  its just not fair
  i am always up for more elec man  
  i wanted the armor deco one
  is this color just going to keep getting higher in price i remember two years ago a store had it for sale for something like 45 on black friday but did not see something like that last years black friday
  i remember two years ago a store had it for sale for something like 45 on black friday  barnes  noble really glad i grabbed mine then
  neat thanks
    yeah tf brand is dead and it was a conexclusive with limited distribution to stores only stores that still sell it are doing so at scalper price i think bbts is 150
  im hoping for a fireman bombman skullman oh boy 
i think im gonna sell these old mega man figures like aesthetically theyre just ugly they dont fit nice next to any other figure i have plus the 4inch nel and trueforce figures i have murder these what do you gusu think
why was the giga armor figure such a letdown the chest piece on mine also came wtong so it wont fit on x and the dogs chest    shouldve bought the truforce instead
  considering how little money youd get its almost pointless might as well use them for fodder/customs give them to a nephew or something or a yard sale
  its a shame they only did the first one a full powered up and maverick hunter series would have been dope
  if you buy blind boxes before they hit clearance you only have yourself to blame
  axl has multiple figures    he has two the shitty jazwares figure and the x8 statue
  three if you count the tiny little miniature with neck and shoulder articulation
  two more than snake man or magnet man ever got
  i want a metal man or really most of the mm2 masters
  my inner hipster demands mm46 robot masters they rarely get shit compared to the first 3 nes robot masters    7 would be cool but theyre even more in obscurity hell
i unironically enjoy the star force megaman design how is the 4 inch nel of him
  pretty good for what it is just needs a sword    and be careful with the energy effect on the buster arm it seems rubbery but its probably a kind of pvc one end of it on mine was bent out of the package and snapped off when i tried to straighten it

selling my childhood in the next month  any tips
  dont do it faggot why do it gf parents
  parent wants to clean the house
  price them based on what theyre worth to you not what theyre going for if theyre worth more to you than the going price then just keep them unless you really need the money its barely even worth the time and effort to sell your childhood anyways
  i miss mixels so much
    any tips  dont just keep theme man theyre not gonna ocucpy much space with the small number of sets just keep them in a shoebox or slightly bigger throw out something else desu   if you describe them as my childhood youre just going to regret in a few years when youve forgotten you sold them go looking for them and then remember with a rush of pained nostalgia youll scramble to remember what you spent the money on and you wont be able to recall and youll just feel disgusted with yourself for giving away a reminder of something you loved of happy childhood memories for pennies and storage space   trust me i know

post all those wonderful china version toys you have picked up over the millennia
bootleg revo judy from aliexpress i got her for under 20 but she came with a broken ear seller was unresponsive so i got a complete refund now im waiting on bootleg joints from ebay but god speedpak is the worst sometimes    and im not allowed to upload pictures on mobile data gdi
2b came in today its actually pretty nice
  4
  notbad even on the revealed face its pretty solid
  how much was it i have a legit 2b but might use this to boost my machine army if its cheap enough
  55 inches      yeah im actually pretty impressed      got it for 1845 on ali
  55 inches  i still might
   the skirt details look better than the original lol
ko revogwen and ko 2b are the 10/10 kos this year
  ali or ebay or does it not matter
  i got it from ali but if you feel safer with paypal its on ebay too
reposting from the last thread    the figma and figuarts michael jacksons and the bring arts kaine have all been bootlegged and are available via aliexpress and ebay
guts bootleg
someone ordered the 1000toys bootlegs to compare with the original i know china takes awhile but any update lord knows im still waiting for my double layer cape for a 4h figure to hit the post
caved in and ordered some bootleg stands how careful should i be with those
  how careful should i be  i mean as with any bootleg extremely often times bootlegs have shoddy qc worksmanship or crafting quality so they tend to break much more easily than legit toys treat it gently
  i mean its job will be to hold other toys wonder what will be the limit before it collapses
  the bootleg stands that came with my bootleg figures have all seemed pretty sturdy so i wouldnt worry
post cool toy robots

what are the best mortal kombat figures out there  im interested in all the ninjas and cyborgs elder gods like raiden and shinok bosses like goro pretty much anything
theres the huge neca ones the 7 inch figures that are basically all reprints of the same classic outfit  the 4 inch ones whose brand i forget and the awesome world box one s but they only made scorpion sub and hat boy

  i po her on day one couldnt resist
  ill pass this and wait for ater
pack of bs merchandise and some promotional items  think i might grab it but im not sure since im not crazy into bs but i like all the robo/mechawaifus in these different lines mostly i want the cds but at the same time they are up as torrents but with lost quality
ak garden is today hashtag on twitter is akg15
  i get that shes basically another faceplate expansion pack wrapped in fanservice but shes hella cute
  holy crap those decals on bottom right are amazing
  etc  
whos the artist that designed greifen

  o shit thanks man
  any links to more information on this
  bikini burger is cute with that haircut on the left i want to combine it with the expression on the right
  so many burgers and ill probably get the most barebones one  would have gotten the mccycle on sale but its hueg
if i were to get a motorcycle kit for dressing someone up in biker clothes and such what should i get hexagear bandit wheel or msg rapid raider
  idw  da nyaa    spas12  you know what custom md to make now gais
  if only there was a way to contact the seller so people in the thread can like buy these hip joints in bulk like organize a group buy
asking again from previous thread how often do people end up with cracked/broken md shoulder joints     its like these sorts of things with mds and fags explains why people stop bothering to seam weld
  idw  i feel like id have no choice but to throw it into a wood chipper once i got it
  are you gonna post all of it please dont
  are you gonna post all of it please do
  its happened once so far out of 8 mds or so its annoying because there are no spares in that color and its impossible to weld the pieces for some reason
  what brand is this
  new kit by orange cat industry at least their 1/12 firearms have been pretty decent      
  big fat cat tats
  orange cat industry  where can you even buy their stuff all im seeing when searching is cdjapan
  the type95 rifles up on amiami hlj and hs
  taobao but japanese vendors are starting to carry them too theyre gonna be at ak garden too
shots of raptors box from the blogthis is gonna murder my shipping
  thats a big box
  raptorgreifen in same box  fuck my shipping up bro
not the hair color i envisioned but that black and gold color scheme and massive cannon beckon me
  holy fuck thats a big gun
  they seem to have made a few changes i just hope her sister looks as delightfully edgy when theyre done
seems its painted now i wonder when will they announce the initial release date for this
  she was looking pretty dumb  with her finger and her thumb  in the shape of an l on her forehead
  good lord these things just keep getting bigger
        rip
  miku greifen kaede and raptor in one box  oh jesus have fun with that
    when  i require those hueg weapons
  soon
  petit sample  what is that a line of 1/12 indoor items
is ak garden doujin stuff mixed with official or all official
  does          look official to you
well im back from ak garden
  some items are a little too big and some are too small but i think theyll generally look good in a roombox when theyre arranged all together
  we saw that painted already still no date im getting impatient now
  they showed runners this time hopefully that means preorders soon
  metal part to replace the megami t joints can also swing the legs forwards improving articulation
  accessories and weapons excluding stuff that requires assembly
  ninja and hornet faces
  camera and headphones  i am genuinely upset
  hornet is the cutest megumi
    who is selling that i saw that inou shouten sold some according to twitter
  the weapons very reasonably could be but fair enough
      thats a nice loot pile damn i follow the person on instagram that makes those faces and theyre adorable    shit does anyone know where you can get extra parts like this in the us only place i can find extra parts like hair and hands and tits and ass is gkm is that really the only option we have
  man i would kill for a set of those hyena faces
tfw living in australia  that shipping price  goddamn bloody fuck shit cunt why cant we have something nice for a change
  hype  hype indeed i want some of those faces god damn
  because youre nothing but cunts down there
  calm down your wildlife so they can safely ship without having to hire aussies to fight off everything just to deliver a single packet
  i thought being closer to japan would make it cheaper
greifens hands are big
      id be interested but they dont sell overseas so i dont follow the seller or their stuff cause it doesnt matter what they make to me in the long run
  sail to australia   cant take plane since golden eagles would attack on landing  get past box jellyfish swarms and assorted sharks  make landfall fight off penguins and beach cunts  use prior victims melted thongs to cross nearly molten pavement  make sure to avoid dropbears and spiders near trees  emus and rabbits ambush anyone caught out in the open  abos mutter something incomprehensible as you pass its anyones guess if theyll beg for cash shit on the spot or throw a hunting boomerang at your face  hope the residents guard roo doesnt hate couriers thankfully its preoccupied kicking a dingo to death  carefully time delivery so hell be out anyway have to haul it back to the post office  distant didgeridoos play you off as you succumb to heat stroke
doesnt quite seem like this is this threads thing but since its kaede  preorders up on nov 28th  release slated for april  they had some at ak garden yesterday the outfit is already ingame for exchange
  cuuuute
  its made by tindalos and sold by another dealer since he didnt have a table this time wasnt inou shouten      i think frontline is going to be selling some of their weapons online later according to twitter which means you could use a middleman service to get them      would you be willing to fly to japan start lining up for them from 8 am getting to the venue itself takes an hour and entry is only at 11 and pay 3500 yen for them also the first 400 people to arrive get randomly distributed tickets determining when they enter so even then if youre unlucky you still wont be able to get them    he makes really few and theyre really popular      quite a few of these people do sell online which means you could use a middleman to get them though      actually im pretty sure the individual clothes have been available for some time this is just the two being combined as a set hell i have that cardigan in black
  yeah i already checked and not sold online dont care moving on
        mad jelly i love those extra faces    i picked up a couple of those metal hip joints last time i was over there theres a shop in akiba which sells some gk pieces theyre nice
  they dont put stuff up during/immediately after an event but a month or two after genius    at least one of those groups literally has a pinned tweet saying well put info on the online sales here later
    turns out i had my arnval wearing a variation of the rest its just a combination of existing stuff
    from twitter
      they have those exact 3 part numbers listed  why is the lead time until release all the way into april then
  they sold out at akg so no more stock probably that happens with azone stuff a lot and half the time they dont even bother to make new batches at all
  weapons
  megami prosthetic leg that is also a gun
  thats my fetish

  looks like it it has those little 3d printer lines
  it looks like sand paper

  is this a general release or exclusive
reminder that you can preorder option parts set 10  11 today at 1000 pm est for 8424 each from the koto online shop  forwarder required
  fuck this hobby
  80 bucks to make archer blonde and a g cup  why is koto like this
  its another koto charges the full price of a game for some 2 hour dlc episode
kinda want architect gunmetal ver because purple and extra hair parts  but actually prefer offwhite vers color scheme overall  these small plastic waifus are gonna fucking bankrupt me one day
  i have both gunmetal comes with optional green hair so if youre into epic maymays consider that fact
  im curious what gunmetal vers well gunmetal plastic is like she probably would get the green hair parts for the sake of classic maymays too
  forwarder required for making archer senran levels of stacked  fuck that id rather get her lewd top and fox ears set
  everything thats not purple is gunmetal its not very noticeable in the promo shots but in person you can clearly see it
  at least it doesnt need a proxy
  thats far beyond jew
  8424  ao_rubbing_handsgif
  theyre not made by kotobukiya and theyre not factory made
  both facts pain me greatly why isnt koto mass producing these or something like them
  probably figure its not worth it
  for one thing you cant mass produce resin easily and the colours they use for the hair can only be done with translucent colour resin
  id be more than willing to abandon that effect if it meant i could get these upgrades for less than the cost of an entire kit heck i dont usually even care for it that much
  looks shit
  well i dont want them to be resins cast them in abs or pvc for all i care give me a various size bust plate set give me a hair pack and alternative faces give me something that doesnt cost more than buying two more kits i think what most of us want is the shape because its going to be painted anyway and you can probably get a reasonable effect using other translucent plastics after painting    i dont quite get the hangup they force buying whole new kits or resin sets to get new hair parts breasts faces etc but the ethos for the rest of their lines is that they sell all sorts of extra modelling gubbins for maximum pointless customization
  really they nickle and dime like pros when it comes to msgs but for some reason these are exclusive and made in some chinese basement they could totally break them into even smaller sets too
  its all about the animal accessories
why is archer such a cute
  i dont want to be mr fox and his grapes but i dont like most of those if they were considerably cheaper i might buy them just in case i ever had the compulsion to use them thats how i end up buying too many msgs
  goddamnit cow horns archer is super tempting the fuck is wrong with me its 80 dollars why am i even considering this
  durrrrrrr they they they  these arent kotobukiya dumbass
  points already been made guy read the conversation and try to comprehend it this time
  retard
  i dont like muscutos stuff at all myself
  muscutos stuff always felt a bit off to me never got why people like it so much
  because its part of the meme hobby
  because most of the people here are perverts
man sure does stink of poorfag in here all of a sudden
  bootleg website  full of poorfags    who would have thought
  because you are a man with refined tastes
asigaru2012 on twitter is using a heat pen aka soldering pen to melt runner shavings onto plastic as a replacement for sprue goo and epoxy putty anyone else here use that technique as well     am on the fence for dropping 30 on a heat pen just to try this one off technique though
  big titties i think to me they look too much like implants so never bothered i like my big uns as natural looking as possible like ianeira s
the desktops are getting lewd
  no
i really dont want to buy raptor but these damn japan people are doing their damnedest to convince me otherwise
  its gonna be a long month
  hold me bruva
whats with the viper heads their faces are way too wide and overall freaky
  they are special and the red one i shit you not has split personality dissorder
  does that mean they have to look so pudgy and soft all i can think of is one of those fat jiggly jap pancakes when i look at their cheeks
  it means their design doesnt lend itself to the slender mms body when you look at them from an angle the artist didnt envision them making it look like they have the downs
  i didnt care for the base girl at first and just wanted her for the armor as kitbash fodder now ive got roadrunner so i dont really care about her armor anymore but the base girl is really starting to grow on me
sharatang just came in day early of expected delivery and spent only one day at isc  dog bless ems
          buy raptor sirs
  hows the discord
what kit do you recommend for a newbie like me
   this is my issue i hate huge bits of armor but i really love the base md girls and some days i truly consider selling all the extra parts
  give
  go archer or go home  everyone should have an archer for her super cute expressions
is there a difference between the two box arts of strarf mk2 lavina or is it only years they were made 2011 and 2012 was there any subtle change in quality or pieces
  dont start with archer start with some cheap gunpla so you know how to make the end result at least look decent then move on to archer because everyone needs an archer in their lives  a friend of mine started with ninja and while he didnt necessarily fuck up i really believe he couldve done better with even just a little experience
  i would start with a cheap gundam kit to get your toes wet and maybe move on to one of the girls thats less complicated i started with sol hornet who is mostly the body plus wings and alternate pieces everyone is saying archer and theyre not wrong but fucking up on her would really upset you or it would me shes adorable      listen man its tempting i hate archers bow and i hate most of hresvelgr aters parts really tempted to see if i could sell her altogether hell if i could trade all those parts to get roadrunner or raptor i probably would
bozo stinky
    but archer is it ok for a newbie
  given that weve got the boob molds for sakura oni archer well probably be seeing more of that mold or similar being mass produced in the future
  youll mess it up
  wouldnt risk it shes too cute to mess up
  its busu shitty pedo scum you fucking newfag
  that sidetail on ninja  i need it
  dont start with archer  i regret doing so a bit  good thing i have 3 more
  boob molds for sakura oni archer  where  i need me some oni archer
  pink ninja freaking when
stop motion movie of shinkis and friends when
  dont start with archer  greifen
  maybe but i dont want just big breasts i need some variety including ironing board flat we finally got those wrist joint runners i can see myself paying 1200 yen for like 3
its turkey day
  dinner is served
  architects team isnt doing so well
  and finally one last shot of everyone sitting down to eat    i had hoped to have griefen finished and a larger table built but i just couldnt find the time
  is that chinese jewcat
  shut it down the megoyim know
  it is i still havent figured out what to call her pretty armor volume 3 just doesnt have the right ring to it
  pretty armor volume 3  pav3  pave  pavel  also shes cia this is why im not allowed to name things my thought process legitimately works like that
  sylphy getting away with a slice of pie
  after spending some time with google translate i was thinking yafe zhuangjia pretty/beautiful in hebrew armor in chinese
id call her shekelina
  are those basically oob plus panel lining
is  good enough to buy something
  they are absolutely legit it will be 9 years ago this december that i placed my first order with them never had a problem i tend to order from them more than amiami these days but less than hlj
  i order with them a lot the only annoying thing about them is that you cant combine in stock items with a preorder like you can at the other big stores
  i actually got the ninja/archer set for the chest parts its muscutos hair parts that bother me theres something off about them that i just dont like
  some of them have a few details colored in like the silver lines on materias legs and the white circles on stylets chest but otherwise just panel lines
come to mama
  youre not my mom archer is my mom
  no shes not tonight shes not
  cool they look pretty ok  ive been afraid of starting mine because i felt like without the full paint shebang they wouldnt be as nice as they deserve to be but that looks fine
raptor was made for bullying
  on the same team as the biggest fucking tsundere and the actual physical embodiment of smug  theres only one way that could possibly turn out relentless bullying
  lucky for her shes not in the sm bondage squad
  speaking of i actually bought skytubes love toys 1 and 2 since i got magic girl it feels wrong in a way but still appropriate for her brand of bullying
  her armor is ridiculous but everything else is perfect im so conflicted about her
  same man i dont want all the armor i just want the girl
    pretty much this  i actually buy most of these things mostly for the armor and accessories with the cute girls being a bonus but this ones armor is so fucking ugly that it is actually a deterrent despite the girl being just my type
i see a lot of you with them so what are desktop army like i was thinking of getting sylphys
usual plastic crack supplier just opened preorders for bikini hres  also carries hres ater and recently started carrying vanilla and invert too  boy howdy am i getting close to making some horrible financial decisions
  oh and rapid raider hres too they really like her in particular
    you can survive on instant ramen for a few months anon no biggie
  easy on the cup ramen legend has it that you turn into a doll if you abuse instant noodles
  wait who is the sm squad
  one of the first pics of the asras was them doing some kinky shit iirc
  i thought it was chaos and pretty because of this picture  
hey guys have there been any new msgs in the last 4 months got an upcoming shipment from ami and might as well throw some extras in there
sol raptor is touyama indicated via aga  memes intensify
  thats not best girl archer so go ahead
  yeah well i got banned last time i posted that
  anyone
hres inverts iridescent clear red parts look stunning  comes with normal skin tone bonus parts  but regular skin tone faceplates arent prepainted she only comes with empty corrupted eye decals and the silver/metallic grey plastic looks pretty lame outside promo pics  im very conflicted right now
    fuck off tripfag
  buy two to mix and match goyanon
  actually they sell separate eye decal sheets and painting is fun so consider that crisis averted
  since when have you cared about bans
  which one normal archer or archer aoi
  you could go fuck yourself      fun pocket toys with reliance on part swapping
  normal archer is best girl  i have both though   do regret getting aoi versions instead of sol girls   still no reason i cant buy em now    i need pink archer milkie molds
im mad i cant find the pic of archer tying up ninja now
  do regret getting aoi versions  whats bad about aoi versions i like the longer hair though archers normal hair is perfect ponytail
    cute the first sylphy set isnt very fun to pose but after that the joints improved molding and paint on the figures is good but accesories can look plain promo pics show them painted  its its own slippery slope since joints are universal and accesories/faces are easy to exchange between them
    calling planelegs a newfag    /toy/ has changed
  planelegs hasnt made anything new
    frankly the main fault id hold against the line right now is that megahouse has basically been treating it as their own nendoroid instead of making stuff specifically for it you have the silphy molds and their derivative in chrom and you have the millenia molds and past that the only other normallyoffered dta set thats not licensed is the frea nabbit sisters whom have hardly anything with them the actual frea series was japanese kickstarter exclusive so most people wont be getting them especially not gaijins since the service megahouse used didnt accept overseas donations aaand then you have half the fag line done into dta and a bunch of fate/whatever crap and not even tama and now sao crap while theres nothing inherently wrong with crossover sets its kinda sad that most of dta at this point is such instead of original content
  no lewding sylphy
  yeah he seems to have left like a salty ass fag because he couldnt adapt to the new era of model kits that doesnt make him a newfag tho
  he sure is when he had a decade to master the hobby
  didnt even get the joke  fucking newfags i swear to god
  he might as well be a newfag tripfags are no longer cool in this brave new 4chan
  i also love the aoi versions they come with the original hair molds as well if you dont like the new ones look at this girl and tell me shes inferior to the first archer
  god damn do i love me some archer honkers
  purple eyes  yellow eyes i also think the originals color scheme is classier
  true the neon green and blue dont really appeal to many people     but i do love me some gaudy color schemes
  shes inferior to the first archer  the brown hair is nice but the colors are ugly as sin
  tsundere  hornet    really tsundere i cant read the md comics i thought she was supposed to be some sort of genki airhead
  i cant read them either but somehow my head made that connection just by her expressions and promo pics  though looking back brat may be more appropriate airhead i can buy as well
    guess ill pick up a sylphy set then to get a feel for the series  the amico variant looks cute
  nel
fag movie in 2019 june
  gay
  dont start with her shes pretty much a rare kit and you will surely mess up your first build  i remember ordering some rare bl kit for my first plamo and being the noob that i am i messed up everything from using ca glue to not topcoating for the decals/panel lines now the kits price already raised 3 times and my own copy is a fucking mess hurts to look at
still miffed she doesnt have courage green eyes but i really want it that badly i can just customize her later when i get her
seems that desktop army is now open for male figures this isnt exactly male but i hope they will make some smol frame arms bots
i feel like i got pranked buying the sol raptor  she looks nowhere near as cool as i thought she would
  she really needs panel lines to pop try doing that and shell look a lot better
  eukrante
  fucking hell she looks like a fighter jet and my husband is an airplane buff fuck thanks a lot
  holy shit i just realized that dalong of all people didnt panel line it
  like styko shes in need of a bit of paint and panel lines to look good
  tripfags were never cool
  dont start with her   well then tell me a kit for my first build
  some hg gundam you dont mind maiming a bit
  gundam  frame arms/girl kit please
  honestly dont listen to these people buy and fuck up whatever first kit you feel like fucking up folks act like archer is some kind of big deal i have 6 of them if you saw richigos stash you would probably think hes a hoarder   if you dont mind a little bit of battle damage just build whatever   people suggest a hg gundam because its cheap and you will get some experience
  while you can fuck up whatever kit you want there is no law saying you have to keep it afterwards you can buy a gundam learn as you build it then set it on fire in a dumpster afterwards who cares
tfw originally said itd be out in november  release is now end of december
  i recommend materia then very simple and can be used for spare parts later on if needed
  this or innocentia theyre prime kitbash fodder in case you screw up
  limited edition preorder release is in 29 december orders for the regular release starts in january    laurel limited edition preorder also starts at 29 december
want to make clothes for my fags  realize stylets clothes would burn unless she gets undressed before flying  physics conspired from the beginning of time to bully stylet
      thanks for the advice
completing a somewhat heavy mod recently motivated me to try doing the faglet mod on my stylet but ill wait for the kai and use pieces from the first one for the limbs on the mod  were the thighs and arms pieces on the gourai kai mold the same as the first one
fencer oorbellen lunaria for 19k yen on mandarake  why is she so expensive good lord
  maximum autist
  his heavy panel lines might actually look good on her too
  looks pretty sweet in an aerial pose
  those nubs
  just panel lines alone would be a gigantic improvement and not even beyond snapfag tier so anyone can do it  most mecha musume need a little touch up paint to reach full potential of course  no paint will stop her from looking like a clusterfuck though
  wont even shell out for real animation for the movie  fuck you too koto
  its a fucking recap movie  lmao its trash
  very first shot is a closeup of her pantsu with dramatic lighting that conveniently accentuates her butt  never ever ever change japan
gourai is a shit
  dammit still holding out hope for season 2 then
  koto shit why are we losing money  also koto framearmsgirlanimefilmrevealedascompilationfilmwithnewfootage
  what a waste of fucking time
  weve all been there before right right
  so no innochan
  not using superior silicone fiberglass to make cute heat resistant panties
  faggot the fags being 3d compared to the 2d humans is part of what made it so good and if they dont keep that in any future material it wont be as good      me too
  a 100yen military plamo made in the 90s    by the time you are done you will either  a kill yourself  b master the art of plamo
      90s  dont listen to this faggot 80s tank kits are the way to go
so raptor is the same height as the other mds
  its the same base body so yes she it as tall as the other mds    pic related sol raptor compared to sol hornet and sol hornet compared to other mds
in canada  waiting for november and now december order  amiami refusing to ship until canada post stops being shit    its suffering atleast i had a chance to try painting one for the first time
  no archer in the comparison because everyone would notice how massive her bust is to the rest  though at the same time they should do that because itd probably make her sales double when they see just how cute she is compared to the others
  awww i wanted a shortie well at least my wallet is safe for now
  theyve developed a short body and theres two shorties in the works the indian shortstack and a cat loli
  cat loli  oh no my money
  wondering if that will be sitaras body too bewbs aside ifc
  i might be wrong but that was my understanding that theyve developed a new shorter body to use for shorter characters across the line that fits with how they use the standard body as well
    loli bodytype  im expecting megumeme customs the second she releases
  cat loli designed by blade    well shit im gonna have to preorder that
  cute but way too much pink gonna need to come up with a better colorscheme for her
  here lies my beloved wallet a family supporter and a friend
  blade couldnt wait for ayaka to be announced and finished
  your wallet is a whore that will open up for anyone but koto loves it anyway
  way too much pink  theres something wrong with you  pink is justice
  get out
will we ever get a muscle musume
  highly unlikely just buy a goku kit and sculpt some tits on or something
  pandering to lolicons is more important sadly
  muscle loli
does anyone knows where i can find matadora stuff/models    i really like they designs
  in japan
  sadly  fuck off theres already been enough titty monsters lolicons rise up
  academics pls respond
  lolicons rise up  actually why dont you have a seat right over there
shoppan for clothes find something nice for whatever shinki/fag/md  order closed  god dammit i will never be able to get a cute outfit for my robodaughterfus
  theres already been enough titty monsters    those wordscan you actually use them all in a sentence in such a way
   cheshire catform taonyao
  does that name have some special meaning
  loli mds are the cleanest best pleasure
  its just a cute name sounds kind of chinese
  i know this dog one of the best
  shes already been announced    
  i i dont think so
has anyone bought a fag secondhand i really need to weed out my collection and like i mentioned before ive got an ater i built that i dont particularly love     i also somehow managed to shatter her wrists ive got a good collection of figures so i take the utmost care of wrist joints and i have no idea how i did that
  i shattered my architects wrist as well its a known issue koto has responded to by selling separate wrist joints    i just gave architect her fa counterparts arms
  mmm panel lines
  ive got an ater i built  post pics
  i managed to sell a couple wism mds i built it went well enough im hoping to unload some frame arms girl faces and decals soon
will the achilles kit come with any unarmored limbs or is it only the armored as they show might have to give her md parts for clothing if its only armored
  so far she does not seem to have in limbs since it is shown she has compatibility with frame arms girls it should be possible to use innos bare limbs not sure how removable the skirt is though
    i would like to have them too but its too niche
are a3 and a4 also lolis is this the age of the loli mecha musume
  i want delicious light brown a2 but i dont like how the character art has her in shorts but the kit model has her in a sort of loincloth skirt thing with the front flipping up as if in motion unless it actually is a sort of skirt and only looks like shorts to me for whatever reason
  no i think it matches her bottoms are just weird like some kind of loincloth skort
  hopefully a flat front skirt piece is included
  i know  check the konami site  post of the banner with all of the designs is from the end of december last year  aga release was late january last year  ayaka wasnt in any of the prereg info  maybe thats why blade likes ayaka so much since shes 80 similar to his own design      are a3 and a4 also lolis  yes looks like theyre being released at the same time      she has really low waistcut shorts with the loincloth in front honestly dont even think calling them shorts is correct ill see if i cant get a good angle for a screenshot
  blue on left released when
  so far it seems theyre not completing the teams so shed come out after glasses girl and redhead tomboy
  the shorts are supposed to be more straight across her thighs but thats probably not possible in plastic  i went and took a screenshot to include the back of her shorts instead of focused on the front  you can see the cloth in front isnt really supposed to be attached or bother covering anything really      she appeared much later compared to the other two  i figure theyll probably go back to do rin redhead tomboy or rei next but not really certain on popularity for that team theyd probably do a light version for rins equipment too like theyre doing for a2
slightly offtopic but  get into alice gear when the gourai event was running  got her and played a few days  link to applel gaymu center n shiet  glorious nihon programming skillz make the app shit the bed  reinstall all is gone despite having the account synced   ookay ill start again without her as the event ended  game is fucking bad playwise and a chore   play from time to time to get muh waifus   shits the bed again and all is lost   not only is boring as fuck to play but if every time theres a fuck up i have to start again from 0 how do people manage to keep going or even think about spending shekels   i like the girls but i cant bear to play the game anymore and all the announced models just rub it in desu
  theres already been enough titty monsters  excuse me what the only true tittymonster md so far is archer and maybe ninja if youre feeling generous the rest all range from modest chest to flat as a fucking board
  well it makes sense that her outfit doesnt bother covering the front when shes already in shorts so short half of her ass is hanging out its a nice decoration at least
  tfw there will never be another lbx game in the west    still probably going to buy it anyway
  my journey begins
  the gameplay is great and there are multiple account backup systems something tells me that youre just a retard who doesnt understand japanese whining about a game you dont understand
  the gameplay is great  wrong  multiple account backup systems  enlighten me aniki  whining about a game you dont understand  what the fuck is there to understand everyone knows is boring and just do it to collect waifus
  retard
  show me how to big brain 
mobage  great gameplay
  these look so good loving these alice gear crossovers and cant wait for the brown girl
bear with me here    what if what if    you mix groundup pastels into ca glue to get the color of filler you want like you know flesh tones instead of going through hoops to import that special colored ca glue or using sprue goo
knoe
  that sounds like a significantly harder thing to do than using sprue goo
  lbx on 3ds sucked though it was just a shit custom robo rip off
  modified with leftover parts from the raptor kit to be held in place
  meh koto shop should give us ax00 conversion parts or if you want to be cheap repaint some architect parts blue and give it to this figure to say this is ax00 before it got the achilles parts or something like that see just to reflect back on the story of lbx and how it will be retold as a mecha musume mobile game but in rl human size
  why did they have to make her so cute
    youll fix those nub marks on raptorchan right
  shekels definitely shekels she still doesnt do much for me though
  sprue goo takes days or even weeks to harden and even then you have to build up in thin layers so the solvent can migrate out of the plastic properly     so the question with pastels after testing it out    the answer is yes but    the chalk component of pastel sticks acts as an accelerator to superglue on top of that regular superglue blends tend to give yellow tint to the final mixture     so theoretically you should be using bsi/armskeepers series of super gold glues because they dont tint the thing yellow but it does give the final color a darker shade about two steps so mix your blends accordingly to compensate as for the instant hardening im suggesting to sprinkle your pastel mixture as a thin layer tamp it down then drip superglue into it and let it seep in then repeat the process until you get a decent layer built up if you dont build up in thin layers you will start to see little bubbles and layering gaps when you sand down the hardened mixture
  it seems like converting her into an owlgirl would work out convert the hair bits into hair wings and hair feathers etc then mod the wings to take advantage of that gatchamanlike cowl look when theyre folded down    and for the rest of you you can make a genderbent bullyable femto
    i did a thing and started a new thread  
hey /toy/ i want to switch things up with my collection i have a lot of kaiju/horror themed stuff up in my house predominately revoltech or sh monsterarts and have gravitated towards getting some sofubi stuff based on reccomended artists on ig my knowledge of sofubi is very surface level i know about realxhead super 7 and secret base from an old issue of juxtapoze that i have laying around    so /toy/soldiers can you guys point me in the direction of some online retailers or favorite artists i could purchase from hell post up some of your favorite pieces while youre at it
one of mtvs top toys of 2010 was the glyos rig a sofubi spaceship
  hahaha i own that rig
  designer convention which just ended a week or so ago has a lot of artists and things to check out im planning on going next year however what i usually do is find a collectors instagram or blog account then follow what they collect even if the item isnt interesting to me it leads me to another vinyl artist and then to more collectors who follow them eventually youll find some artists and items you like mandarake is a big retailer for that stuff mostly used though which is usually new for japans standards
i like science patrol and skulltoys

where do anons get cheap shipping supplies i just got some stuff from staples but its like 2 per bubble mailer and boxes its rediculous
  i steal mine from work desu senpai
  reuse boxes from amazon take from retailers in the morning when they toss their cardboard or you can just buy from amazon for oneoff stuff youre selling youre just gonna have to pay for single boxes from your pharmacy/cvs/wherever youre buying your stuff from
  like the guy above me says i mostly reuse boxes from shit i buy online if the box is too big i cut it down and make new flaps its not all that hard and id rather do a little work than pay for a new box    for mailing small/single loose figures i bought a bulk pack of bubble mailers on amazon it didnt cost all that much when you break it down to cost per envelope and if youre mailing stuff out often its worthwhile
  will you do 40
  come on man keep it for the meme    hed be losing 6 bucks cause super7s shipping is ridiculous
  no since you didnt email me like a normal person does when theyre interested in something in the thread
  ask stores that get a lot of smaller shipments i get them from my old job at an arts supply store or my current one at whole foods
  walmart sells all sorts of boxes from super small to huge for like less than a dollar i think the most expensive is around 150 bubble mailers are like 15 cents or something ridiculously cheap

  why is there a pringle next to morgan
  oh you son of a bitch selling cattleya before black friday
    injustice batman kamen rider black battle hopper are sold
  whats wrong with him im out of the loop
  nothing hes just a good seller
    hes a fucking scammer/bot and literally doesnt email anybody back   hes just wasting his own and everybody else time here
  i bought 2 revoltechs from him a month or two ago with no issues
    heres proof btw since i know someone will probably want it
  deku is sold
  fuck you sam you never responded to shit at least man up and tell people why you wont work with people
  i dont get it is this a real post or no he has a couple things i want to buy
  so fuckin email them jesus fucking christ
  i bought android 17 from him and everything went smooth
  alright the reason i didnt email you back about fujiko is because of this shit    some guy emails me to buy shf fujiko but cant pay for like six weeks and wants 5 off of the 40  tell him ill do one or the other and he tells me hell be back in the five weeks or whatever with the full 40  see him trying to fuck with some guy on the bst in the meantime because the guy didnt save a shinki or some other cute robot girl for him the guy he was trying to fuck with posts his email and makes him look like a fool  decide not to deal with this guy because i dont like bst drama  guy emails me back after the five or whatever weeks and says hell give me 35  ignore because he broke our agreement and i dont like the aforementioned bst drama  tries to start drama with me every time i post since then    if anyone is buying what this guy is saying about me just go back a couple threads and notice that every thread i have less figures up for sale because im selling a couple things every thread
  damn dude sounds like you dodged a bullet
  i purchased 3 figures form him no issues just email the guy and ignore the but hurt faggot
  i bought two things from this anon two seperate times and both times he was responsive and shipped quickly    just email him form your own opinions and stop taking everything posted in the bst so seriously
  i tried to email you about mezco im not the fukiko guy but i also never got a response not sure why
    i brought sub zero off of him for a great deal too
  lmao what a prissy little diva faggot you sound like how the fuck did any of that explain why you are ignoring other peoples emails    its not that fucking hard to just reply to people you want to deal with and ignore the rest jesus christ man lol
fibilugomailhexcom  wtb   any sonic the hedgehog figures   mario kart 64 toybiz figures
  still have lucina or corrin
  its not that fucking hard to just reply to people you want to deal with and ignore the rest  thats exactly what i said i did in my post
  ok sure thing        one case forgives almost 2 months of silence in the bst from him or emails    ok      same thing       samefagging isnt helping
  but you told some guy you didnt reply to him about fujiko because of some other guy    unless you meant some guy was the guy you replied tobut it doesnt seem like it was
  yea both are still up for grabs

  hey price police where the fuck can i find a bulma used for 40 dollars right now
  stop shitting up the thread i bought shf ken from him and it went just fine
  literally 5 different posts vouching for that guy  damn stay mad about fujiko you poorfag lmao      the guy that wanted fujiko was the same guy that the shinki story was about    anyways i know im not exactly helping but the guy said he wanted to avoid bst drama but i mean its /toy/ i should have guessed its damned if you do damned if you dont
  its common sense
  the guy that wanted fujiko was the same guy that the shinki story was about    i found that pretty misleading personally probably some posts here could use a good editor    oh well though carry on
  you are posting this while actively being btfo you have some balls on you no its not common sense its a flat out lie
  to be fair in order to even know about that initial shinki drama you have to be a fucking faggot like me and be an avid follower of the bst and past bst threads so i dont blame you
  was it the guy that kept offering 50 on that like 200 shinki he gave some sad story about using his money for other things
people are so desperate to get toys they expect a seller to hold an item for a month with no guarantee theyll even buy it while others have money and can pay now    these types can drink clorox hold sin general are useless and when ive tried even 23 days the buyers often vanish because they either couldnt get the money found it cheaper elsewhere or changed their minds and 99 of them never contact me to say they dont want it    you dont have the money to pay now then fuck off ill sell to the guy who does
  infinity war cap sold    bundle and save also open to negotiating
  shutup      sh ultra act sold
  when i ask someone to hold its because i am legit looking at prices pics online and qc related shit if i dont want it i usually email back within the same day sometimes i am also contemplating buying other things they have and so ill ask for a hold on those until i can have a few hours to think about it what i want to combine together    i think holds in those cases are fair because you can still line up other buyers ready to pay and arent just left their holding your dick while someone vanishes after several days of no communication im very upfront about why i ask people to hold too many people ask for holds for financial reasons and are too ashamed to email back and say they cant afford something and are sorry
  or you could you know not do that and look at reviews and all that before you even think about asking for an item
  damn that sucks cuz he responded quickly to me
  i hate majin vegeta its so edgy
  kind of the point right its a transformation for the express purpose of giving the character a dated upgrade    which he turns around and uses to try and fight his rival who has always been pretty soundly ahead of him    so after doing this and fucking up the whole plan to stop the genocidal monster of myth that a new tier of god came to warn about he has to get in a cheap shot to try and defend his ragged sense of pride    the edginess adds to all this because of how self defeating the whole process is and how that works to build the character

  meant to say updating 
  i wonder if the old nasca scales well with the ss w figure i keep hearing about some rumored or previously displayed ss nasca but that one looks pretty good to me how is the poseability and whatnot
  heres the pic of the new one there has been no news on when itll be released if ever    the old one looks ok with ss w its a little short but if you have them in dynamic poses with their legs bent a little you wont really notice it its a good figure in general with a really nice sculpt the only problem id say is that it has true balljoint ankles with a pretty limited range but anyway yeah its not bad at all for an older shf and for 25 worth it i think
  lol fuck off poorfag

when toys are not fun
  uuuuhm
when they get stuck up your ass
  well that depends on what kind of toy were talking about
  the retroblasting guy probably has something stuck up his ass
  hes boring to listen to drags his videos out does bad sketch comedy and every time he sticks his big titty wife in a video you just start counting the days before they get divorced as most couples doing geek videos tend to do eventually often because the wife gets sick of her husbands geek focuscinema snob or the husband expands his geek focus and decides a woman in his life is too distractingpat the nes punk    or he fucks someone else and she finds outalphaomegasin    and janitor fuck your warnings and fuck the conservatives you asspat do they get warnings for their altright hate no then fuck you
  and janitor fuck your warnings and fuck the conservatives you asspat do they get warnings for their altright hate no then fuck you  yikes
  i like a lot of the points he makes but sadly i agree that he doesnt seem like a great husband he seems absorbed in childhood memories and overly fixated on negative ones     also i dont like the way he restores toys hes too rough with them and his methods and materials seem too crude
  weak bait
    i was promised that the political shitposting would cease after the split
  when the guy playing it is a boring person
  she cant do that shoot her or something
  it wont until someone hires a hitman to go after miloanon
  star wars toys  being fun  an uphill battle
poopi kaka doody  poopi kaka doody
  boring to listen to drags his videos out does bad sketch comedy  literally every popular toy youtuber im honestly getting sick of it
  at least robo keeps it short some do skits that drag on for an eternity    is there even such a person as this miloanon this faggot is obsessed with
  who is miloanon
    thats not the problem with her at all the problem is besides her being even more boring and unfunny is she always wants to be the center of attention even when shes the one behind the camera if youve watched even a single live stream youd have realized she craves attention and the retroblasting guy will quit long before she does
  some shitposter that always starts off their posts lazily on topic then they aways spin into some retarded political tangent its painfully obvious that they just come here to argue and only do half ontopic posts in order to try and get around the rules if you ever see a poster just randomly start ranting about conservatives/antifa out of nowhere then its them
  and overly fixated on negative ones  hes still salty about optimus primes death in 1986 and faults the entire franchise for it refusing to get the fuck over it    that was the part where i realized hes just a whiny little bitch
the virginblasting  vs  the pixel chad
  i think its foolish to assume its one person
  when theyre fragile crap       and every time he sticks his big titty wife in a video you just start counting the days before they get divorce  retroblasting channel exists for years is there any toy reviewer you folks dont hate       and overly fixated on negative  like /toy/      the chadblasting  vs  the pixel shill
  hi michael
  at least robo keeps it short  you mean aside from the rambling tangents he goes on in literally every video
  any pictures or videos that star his big titty wife  im now interested but not interested in giving him clicks to search through all his videos because he sounds like an entitlement faggot on /toy/
  hi low effort
  and every time he sticks his big titty wife in a video you just start counting the days before they get divorced  as soon as the channel stops making money you can tell from the way shes constantly shilling the business/gibsmemonee aspects of it whenever she speaks i swear it seems like shes using his autism for profit i bet she thought shed be actual famous by now instead of moderately internet famous
  shes in any of the videos of them doing panels at cons i dont see the big titties myself
  someone make this
    i dont know why /toy/ likes to make fun rb so much    pd i can understand especially his current vid of marvel rising aka dolls for budding lil feminists
  armor figure  shoulderpads are connected to the fucking body rather than being a separate piece connected in between the arm and torso or being integrated to the arm
  dan is unironically based and always has been prove me wrong
  dan is chad
  fuck off i really dont like the president anon
    dan is a shameless shill and will never call out a shitty toy this is why he keep getting free toys and being invited to all the cons    //wwwyoutubecom/watchvn3gw7yjww4u  //wwwyoutubecom/watchv88wuh6tdlhy  //wwwyoutubecom/watchvmjlyb08iphe      based
  their channel existed for years only last year they opened patreon
  thats why he is chad
  chad  shilling  disgusting
this guy shelf warmed hard is he worth it
not really unless you are a fan of goshogun  it has a shitty articulations btw
mines arm sheared off because of the paint i sold it to a local comic shop for 40
    wow okay fuck that then
that thing and the baikanfu were borderline scams  they were basic revoltech figures sold at gokin prices with the explaination that the paint apps are expensive nevermind that theyre essentially on the same level of the old revoltech dancouga that sold for a quarter of their price
welcome to the tmnt general were we discuss all the tmnt related toys from playmatesmattelnecaetc    old thread  
are those figures new
  these were a mistake just like the wwe ones do the gimmick variants really sell
    gimmicks arent exactly new to tmnt
  first roddy piper and now pete venkman mikey gets all the best characters
  should have been leo as winston and raph with ray like they paired them in the comic crossover still cool though
    the way the figures did it matches the turtle to buster personalities and roles well    ray/leo  sincere leader type  venkman/mikey  clown  egon/don  nerd  winston/raph  streetwise macho dude
raph the most angry aggressive and violent turtle is the token black guy    what did they mean by this
has the second wave of rise if the tmnt figures been revealed yet i know the foot letuinent supposed to be in it as well as storage shell reissues but thats it
  i loved the universal monsters ones  and batman donatello
  ross and tj maxx are getting those and the wrestlers in for super cheap
    here they are
  faggot you got my hopes up for a second
  raph is the kang    seriously theres a disturbing pattern here
  raph wears full bandana others dont  what a neat detail
  yeah thats his do rag
  as a big gb and tmnt fan id have been all over them if they werent in a retarded scale
  i was so ticked off when these dropped they should have made them in their normal scale  in the style of the old toyline rather than the nick stuff dont get me wrong im a fan but this kinda gimmick way better suits the fred wolf turtles coulda had retro styled packaging and all that huge missed opportunity
  seriously playmates should be doing their wacky pop culture variants in the vein of these customs
  what scale are they
    pretty much 6 the wwe and ghostbusters figures both took this scale for some reason the wwe ones came first so i always assumed it was so they would be in scale with wrestling figures
  thats 6 not 6 scale 6 scale turtles should be much smaller
  ray wasnt much of a leader he let venkman talk him into a terrible mortgage deal got fleeced on buying the ecto1 and fucked them over with renting the fire house and winston was anything but a macho dude and raph wasnt particularly streetwise since all of the turtles were pretty alien to human culture winston was easily the most disciplined and levelheaded and a voice of reason for the ghostbusters which makes him not only a better match for leo but the polar opposite of raph raph just gets stuck with ray because theres nobody else but i guess you could say theyre both very easily excited
  yes this is the more likely scenario
  man was i crushed when i realised these werent real
  are the bootlegs of this good
    the paint looks a bit off like look at mikeys completely black arm
  ahhhh how old are you    thats all playmates sold jesus fuck
  cool remakes when    i also watched out of the shadowsits better than the first one    turtles get so much more screen time  bebop and rocksteady are great  shredder looks cool and has a good actor but underused  action was fun  story was ok and cartoony which to expect from a 80s property  kraang has a good voice better than the original from the 80s cartoon  stockman is ok  pretty good movie 780/10  too bad it bombed at the box office but they might full reboot it or sof reboot it hopefully a soft reboot because if they fully reboot the franchise then expect april oneil based on rise of tmnt
  this oots is good
  bebop and rocksteady were perfect its an incredibly frustrating movie because it has all the pieces to make something goodand it squanders it so bad everything with the cops shouldve been cut out too fuck that and the cop lady
  venkman was more sarcastic kinda cool but rude    ray was more of the goofy manchild all excited about the firehouse and imagining the staypuft marshmallow man for comfort
  i have one of these but it has no hair i didnt realize it used to be a troll doll
  when you try to bake pizza but you bake yourself
  i suggest wait since neca finally found a way to get around releasing the 7 inch movie turtles
  yeah if gamestop sells enough of the movie turtles i cant imagine the next step not being the game turtles
  had all of these when i was a kid
  evil chuck e cheese robot  yes  includes whackamole bat  i love this whole fucking thing
  why wasnt this just a new character why the name april
  neat  i am not sure about this series but i really loved this dudes episode and it kind of made me like the new april  i wish the actual toys captured the look of the series a bit better
  marketability  i like the new april a lot but she really isnt april outside of the name
  but she really isnt april  what is april though she changes every time
  because shes the superior april we need shes practically a 5th member because of how often she joins a fight
  it works because even the nuturtles are undertrained to the point where they had to replace their signature weapons with new mystical ones nusplinter is hardly seen training them even
  rise sucks so much fuck this gay series bay turtles are better than rise crap
  because of how often she joins a fight  thats pretty fucking stupid honestly
  oh so you hate scrappy doo too right fucking sheep
  did you never watch the 4kids show you know the one widely regarded as the best and most accurate animated version    april could beat the shit out of casey and beat enemies who beat the turtles after just a few training sessions with splinter     and anyway in the cg show april was a straight up mary sue with magical mind powers    try not making up totally hypocritical arguments to shit on rise
  look i am not super happy about every attractive female in film adaptations getting diversed but every april might as well be a different character and rise april is much better than the dead eyed bitch from transformers  as long as they dont go the route of every super hero movie and cast a super light skinned actress in her mid20s to 30s with straightened hair in the part and they dont try to make her 80s april but black i am good
  the way they mashed the characters together looks disturbingly ugly if they had just put the turtles in suits i wouldve been all in
  five nights at freddys reference  how fresh and topical maybe theyll do a minecraft episode and in 5 years they can do a fortnite parody
  these nuturdles probably love minecraft
  okay i hate the new tmnt as much as anyone with common sense but the 2012 series referenced things all the damn time and no one complained i think youre being a bit biased here
  youre not annoyed the fact that mutant turtles are ninjasbut putting wigs on them and into ghostbusters suits is somehow jarring to you
  april was caucasian last i checked
  ive seen the first episode i dont need to be told      i have seen every movie animation majority of old and close to caught up with the current comics including the one shot manga and weird anime ova japan had and ninja turtles the next mutation fuck i even used to own the fucking coming out of our shells tour vhs when pizza hut was promoting that stuff ive seen it all alright  so yes i have seen the 4kids show and i dont care what anyone else says majority of people are idiots just because the majority claims its the best of something doesnt mean its not subjective is the 4kids series good yeah til the later seasons   april could beat the shit out of casey and beat enemies who beat the turtles after just a few training sessions with splinter  to be fair casey got his ass kicked because he didnt want to hurt april thought that was a little obvious but whatever i guess  and anyway in the cg show april was a straight up mary sue with magical mind powers  okay first of all how are you complaining she was actually useful in that series and yet not shocked casey wasnt fucking dead he was an idiot who skated around and tried to hit something without realizing anything no training no discipline no knowledge that gave him some sort of edge but no lets call april the mary sue fucking give me a break i love the 2012 series but bitching about april being important and ignoring people like casey who seemed to survive whateverthefuck was going on should of been the thing that made you go okay come on now   try not making up totally hypocritical arguments to shit on rise  i dont need to make up hypocritical things in terms of plot it completely makes sense how april can handle things its casey that didnt make any sense and you would of went that route had you actually gave the series a chance without making hypocritical arguments to shit on anything not rise
  are you replying to the wrong person my statement had nothing to do with her nationality or identity i wasnt even talking about april fuck are you going on about
okay boys get them halloween figs out heres some tunes to rock to  
  i dont know why you think im defending casey in 2012 i totally agree theres no explanation as to why he can hold his own at all in fights against trained ninja and gangsters and aliens its bullshit we just werent talking about him we were talking about april    to be fair casey got his ass kicked because he didnt want to hurt april  sure but thats one of the many instances where april can suddenly kick ass and fight enemies two or three times her size after like one episode worth of behindthescenes lessons    why is it so much more of a problem when a niggerette can do it    for the record i also agree it was good that april had to train for ages and work hard to be able to fight with them in 2012 i didnt call her a mary sue for that i did because shes this super special magical half alien whos immune to mutagen and so powerful at her strongest she can literally just evaporate people with her mind and then put them back together her powers were deus ex machina shit that made her hardearned ninja abilities largely irrelevant and only served to make the series worse    had you actually gave the series a chance  if i didnt give it a chance i wouldnt have known she had mind powers jesus think a little ive watched every single episode i generally really like it i just think its stupid to ignore its failings but shit on rise for the same sort of thing
  five nights at freddys reference
  1/2  i dont know why you think im defending casey in 2012  because you only mentioned april for starters  sure but thats one of the many instances where april can suddenly kick ass and fight enemies two or three times her size after like one episode worth of behindthescenes lessons  we do not know what she was taught youre forgetting that even real martial arts or any form of fighting that knowledge about countering people bigger than you is actually the easiest thing to teach april displayed the fundamentals of judo when she was first training again youre also forgetting she was taught by an actual ninja so obviously she was taught things normal people couldnt just learn from a guy from a local dojo or someshit he was a fucking ninja master like come on  plus you act like she was never beaten or captured or in peril before she had her fair share of that too  why is it so much more of a problem when a niggerette can do it  because that niggerette claims to be april oneil not an original character because heaven forbid sjw culture make their own characters i was just as annoyed when this is applied when any character gets this treatment imagine a world where tchalla black panther was white wouldnt make much sense would it or if oroku saki was mexican none of that would make any sense its funny how these days asians get pissed off if their characters are white washed but whites have to accept their characters turn black this is not an isolated case either this is pandering if the new aprils name was may odonal or some shit then id have no gripes besides where the fuck is april
  2/2  because shes this super special magical half alien whos immune to mutagen and so powerful at her strongest she can literally just evaporate people with her mind and then put them back together  first off no idea where magical came from shes part alien she has no magical abilities to speak of they even explained why she was immune to the mutagen shes part ultrom/krang they are not affected by it either so its not like shes the only one who has this immunity   and as for the putting people apart and putting them back together was done by a alien crystal that housed a bad entity that was possessing her she didnt do that shit on her own just like how casey basically became a god during an episode because with the assistance of wyrm   her powers were deus ex machina shit that made her hardearned ninja abilities largely irrelevant and only served to make the series worse  i dont think you know what that term means also really april had deus ex machina powers to you but no one else cant think of any other characters who pull shit from their ass spare me  if i didnt give it a chance i wouldnt have known she had mind powers  yeah because google and wikis dont exist right  jesus think a little  i just did youre an idiot for not realizing internet is a thing i know all sorts of shit from series without fully indulging in them all the time  but shit on rise for the same sort of thing  but its not the same thing at all
i think its been proven that rise is the new low point in tmnt next mutation held the crown long enough so its good to pass it along
  so youre really just mad they made april black    its ok i get you its obvious sjw pandering theyd never racebend an iconic black character to white oh wait
  it doesnt make it right then and it doesnt make it right now april shouldnt be black
  new tmnt figs have been in stores for a month now its not moving off the shelves walmart had ads at the front door and the aisle display is still 80 full this show isnt making kids want these toys i may pick up the 4 main when they get clearanced
  but that always happens and new waves still come in every period while it mixes with the others
  iconic  fucking retard
  not true at all the last series figures flew off the shelves they had a hard time keeping them in stock
when are the movie neca turtles hitting gamestop
    i went to gamestopcom typed tmnt into the search bar looked at the figure listings and read the release date from there
sotmnt will get a sof reboot with michael bay as producer right
  i never said it was okay baxter stockman being white was okay youre just pulling assumptions out of your ass
  february of 2019
    not him but i hate how not only is black april a radically different character in both looks and personality but she is also a character that can stand on her own there is no reason for her not to be a june or meryl or something and be remembered as a fresh new character
  but she is also a character that can stand on her own  get the fuck out of my safe space
    piss off you larping reddit homo im /pol/ leaning and i say black april has character she carried her scenes just fine in the birthday robot episode before the turtles arrived she had jokes she had trouble she was entertaining overall the va conveys emotion well and the writer has written her alright the only time she goes sour is when they try to present her as a badass like when she smashed the birthday robot and the turtles were shocked
  nope shes a trash character on a trash fire show
nu april is a cute    i get that ppl dont like her but i like her she better than last incarnations april
  this will probably be my first villain from this line      what do you suggest a show do every show references current popular culture in one way or another    this pic is you this is how you look right now
  i actually agreed with you and you still got mad go to hell
  she better than last incarnations april  because fuck story telling and character development right
  she should die thatd be a good direction for the show to go with her
  do you really think that game invented creepy animatronic bears
  comparing a few episodes of story/character development with years worth    ok      were all gonna die anon thats all our direction
  it popularized the concept of them as a horror style antagonist yes
correct me if im wrong but wasnt april black in the original eastman  laird comics
  her skin was simply dark because limited paints/common comic printing issues    similar reason why the simpsons are yellow
  i dont know why youre pretending to defend rise of the tmnt but its clear theres no character development what so ever as each episode is supposed to be a funny thing that happens and zero things have happened since the first episode
  
  nu turtles were ammistake
  i find that reasoning logical
bump
  any idea where alberto can be found to purchase
  and adult age sorry to the pedos who prefer nick april for their sex fantasies      just as with shera or current star warsas if the lucas prequels were any goodthe show is not really good nor did it need to be made but watching actual bigots cry a river of bitch tears simply because it exists is fucking worth it    the same fuckers who insist you have to like doom 4 because zenimax owns the ip now and you have to accept its their property also those were jokes how dare you not think the racism was funny and free speech their hypocrisy shows
  as if the lucas prequels were any good  they were fuckhead
  this
  this
      no they really fucking werent regardless of how shitty the new movies are  the only one that wasnt complete garbage was revenge of the sith and even it wasnt very good
  target is suppose to get the exclusives of these so wait
  ot was trash too but nu wars is worse now fuck off this is a tmnt thread gtfo to your star shit containment general and never come back but if you want to discuss about tmnt then yes80s cartoon only 
  horror style antagonist  oh youre a zoomer you never saw the actual bears at showbiz
  no they really fucking werent  yes they really fucking were you underaged sack of stupid quit sucking disneys cock for a few minutes and think for yourself
  this nick turtles look like fucking trash
  donnie is drac    based
bay turtles are kino apologize
  at least their april was caucasian and a reporter
black friday is over and the pegs are still jammed full of nutmnt toys like it was a green lantern movie hopefully this will tell nick and playmates they fucked up and cancel the show and try again in a few years
a good tmnt wave no old movies no new cartoons  when pls 
  fuck you rise is good    the figures are standard playmates garbage though i would have bought the whole wave id theyd put in a minimum of effort
  what does black friday have to do with anything people use that to buy things on sale not stuff they can get whenever
  but no tits    not that you mind you masturbate to underage nick april tits turn you off
  the show is meant to sell toys if toys arent selling show get canceled it goes for any show that has a major toy line tied to it
  oh youre a fuckin retard who cant grasp the difference between unintentionally creepy designed animatronic and popularizing the concept of using a creepy animatronic design as a horror antagonist
  april was black in the original comic you mong
  oh youre a fucking piece of shit that supports this awful ass attempt at tmnt      no she was not you can quit using that meme response
  no it wasnt    i would take literally any april over fox april
no new toys
  yeah how dare people point out how terrible a terrible thing is

say cheese
my little twin stars dolly room arrived in the mail
  put stuff in his mouth
  hot glueing is against the rules
  ew
what about just war
  this works because the lego or bionicle or whatever those are called is earthtoned so its easy to picture it belonging to a forest nice pic      but whats the motif here a random robot girl sitting on a treetrunk
  nice one
  i have a figure coming in thatll work better then the robot for nature pics i definitely see what you mean she definitely works better for urbanthemed photos
  than oops    have another picture of her i think i might have posted it before but im not sure
    thanks
  nice
any chance for some funny freddy krueger photos
  wow great pic anon like the colors
  this is honestly a really solid pic i thought about bringing a figure or two to the beach before but never got around to it
anybody shoot with colored lighting ive seen some people do it with those phillips smart ones but once you add on a hub thats a pretty expensive buyin for something id only use to take pictures of toys with
    im too cheap to spring for colored lighting so a trick i sometimes use is to pull up a full screen image of whatever color i want to use and use the screens glow to light with
  is that chair from lupin/jigen
  try dmx lights maybe theyre super cheap i got myself a small one and its fun to use for photos
  if you have a five below near you they sell 5 full rgb bulbs that have a remote to wirelessly change the color    they arent super bright but i used it for this photo and the xenomorph one further up in the thread
  yes actually good eye anon
  maybe im dumb but the stuff googles bring back is all highend lighting for stages      ill check them out next time im around one thanks
  maybe im dumb but the stuff googles bring back is all highend lighting for stages    check the ones on aliexpress thats where i got mine

  where can i find this horse
    figma horse you can get it at any number of places if they even have it ebay amiami amazon people in bst etc     i got the brown one from akiba soul and the white one on in a bst thread
  beware tho as its too small for most figures and i hear that the legs are too weak to support most figures/or itself without a stand
  thats a lady droid
          horse a little small    correct more of a pony than a horse works fine with smaller figures but i have to do a lot of perspective fuckery to hide this the bitch part isnt that its a little small its that its a little small for figmas that would go well with the horse link guts etc attack on titan figmas arent too bad though     an alternative that would be better scaled and somewhat easier to find is the lord of the rings deluxe rider sets    weak legs    yup it cant hold its own weight at all without a stand when i shoot i pike it into the ground with piece of wire hanger going into the peg hole in the belly and edit it out
  love the santa hat on freddy great lighting too anon
xevoz / stikfa thread what is your favorite kit    favorite xevoz for me are definitely the elemental kits the clear plastic looks beautiful in the light and really impressive    favorite stikfa for me is the black ninja kit simple and iconic
my favorite stikfa is one that doesnt turn to dust
  op here is that a common problem with people here ive had stikfa joints break after taking them  out of storage but i assumed it was from  being in the climate of my garage xevoz have the same issues do they not
  i dont own xevos but from what i know they are made with better quality plastic and hold up fine     stikfas however are garbage nearly across the board some of the earlier versions have worthwhile plastic that holds up but the ones that people are more likely to have or had access to are trash plastic that crumbled     its a shame because stikfas were incredible but buying any of them is like gambling at a casino and hoping for a jackpot the odds are youll end up with a lemon
xevoz was such a wonderful line  my favorite xevoz figure is probably shield breaker or hemo goblin though i love most of them almost as much  i wish i could get a hold of a predacrawler    i have a nearly complete set of xevoz with no issues with brittleness  the only big issue i have is joints eventually getting floppy
  really wished they release the turtle and beetle  anyway my fave is this guy
is there anywhere to get these now i was obsessed with stikfa as a kid id always look them up online qnd beg for more but i only had one and nobody else i knew had any
  xevoz / stikfa thread  yes i first stumbled upon xevoz in a lego fan magazine in 2011 and wanted a few ever since  got my three favourites from ebay about a month ago even with sticker sheets and brochures  these guys are really cool
  heres some custom combinations i made with them the armor for the flame elemental is supposed to be an oven or a forge and i really like how the electric parts look on the back of the robot
also what are these grip pieces for are they used in the game
  ive got a sledge trooper and omega guard prefer the sledge trooper  dam shame about modibot      theyre supposed to be the things xevoz use to scan parts so they can xevolve
i had the thunder shaman and i remember cutting pieces of him up to use for fixing other figures i regret it now because its easily one of the cooler figures
  unfortunately i dont even bother looking at my stikfas any more because it upsets me how much of it is broken
  i had an army of stikfas they were my favorite toys for quite a while even though they broke fairly often i customized pretty much all of them to help create characters for stories id write in college of course my art skills are lacking so they look terrible now theyre in several boxes at my dads house
i kind find my pics but yall need to get into modibots  
  cut what a mess of text i discovered modibots at dcon i bought 4 i love them    theyre jsut like stikfas but not fragile
    modibot shills  yikes
  yall dont like me trying to get you into someting new and affordable thats like stikfas idgaf
xevoz goats were the ones based on the classic movie monsters so hemo goblin franken punker moon stalker and crypt curse we were one gill man away from the ultimate lineup
old   years winding down what releases do you hope make it out the gate next month
i hope iron factory gets their tarn out before cny
  heres how you link threads op    
none desu  i got gifts to buy but i hope we get fanstoys blurr and hot rod soon my tftm shelf needs them
  ive just got ft hoodlum on po for this month was considering getting koot even though his transformation is awful and apache to round out the crew but i can make do with rouge and mp magnus for now
  nothing in particular that im looking forward to immediately as a release though im always looking for that next itch to scratch with my paypal account if you know what i mean laser prime  gi prime just got their handoff to fedex spoilersmartpost/spoiler in la so maybe ill have them by weeks end  ill post a family photo when they do
i ordered px08 asclepius hoping it arrives before i have to move next month     never bought a 3p before but im practically salivating at the thought of that beautiful science murder tank in my hands
  being this salty i made the thread again with my format and not yours that you simply had to point out a minor mistake  go back 
  not him but i think that anon was just trying to help using the full url is very newfagish its like linking to imgur instead of uploading an image dont be so cynical anon
  i dont know or care what other threads you post in but if you act like a newfag people will call you a newfag
  your probably right im sick and high on cold med so i more than likely took it the wrong way
i wouldnt be bothered by it anon that other anon was being a little dickish now the other anon is correct the format with the numbers is nicer    but instead of being an asshole how about sharing the coding on how to set up that hyper link instead of just pasting the url
  im just waiting for rushbeats mass release its holding back all my other chinese plastic theyve said that its out this week hope theyre right
  what else is in the river held by that dam
  ms trailbreaker and huffer there was tw exhaust too but it got delayed to next year so i cancelled it
  ill assume that trailbreaker  huffer arent your first ms purchases how have the others been so far
  i only have red alert so far its really good the transformation is intricate enough to not be annoying the tolerances are tight enough but not scarytight like some of ifs the flaw on red alert is that theres no weapon storage in vehicle mode
  my only problem with this mold is that the head cant look up or down seems to be a running issue with most of mss stuff
  other than the head being a swivel it does have pretty good articulation compared to their other figures    if anything the big problem is not having any storage for the shoulder cannons in vehicle mode as someone who like transforming their guys and leaving them in alt modes it makes me not want to bother with it which sucks for a main visual feature on the character
  tfw you have mp29 cloud9 blackblast ponder getting a quakewave and still feel burned about mp29 being a thing
  mp29 imo looks really off and way too dark
  isnt mp29 itself a 3rd party remake of a toy that takara doenst actually own they only get away with it because toyco is out of business typical of a major company to be hypocrites
  ironically yes but im pretty sure hasbro bought the molds and rights from toyco long ago
so are there any other perceptor options out there other than tesla not saying i wouldnt get tesla but i cant find one for a reasonable price at all
used the flash sale to pick up the old fansproject breakdown purely on a whim     what did you guys get
so i have a striker noir i love it very much but i wish to share that plethora of weapons with someone else  im searching for something which has roughly the same bot size as sn posses hands capable of holding by tension has nice articulation and a simple/fast transformation preferably a nonoptimus autobot  which options do you guys suggest so far im considering mmc drift rioter despotron maybe mp hot rod
  rioter actually has hands that can hold those weapons without fidgeting to make it stay in via friction so its worth considering
  molds maybe rights probably not at least not permanent ones they likely licensed it for a few years as they did with every other mold same deal for omega supreme and sky lynx those were toyboxsl was never released by them but they planned to the only reason those 2 got reissues was because tomy actually owned the moldsthey created them for toybox and it was found out tomy owned the rights to them when they merged with takara     takara is not hasbro either hasbro does not own the brand takara does hasbro is a licensor they may own domestic trademarks and have a master license that lets them sublicense to other companies but that produced under license stamped on every toy since day one says that hasbro is not the sole owner yet morons keep believing otherwise    mp29 is getting no domestic release so hasbro doesnt even factor in no doubt they figured since toyco went under long ago and no one is around to challenge it they could just go ahead with it even so radio shack released the original toy domestic before hasbro and didnt end up with ownership of it either it was another license    not that hasbro has ever had an original idea they take everything licensed or not every toy line theyve done from the 60s onward has been a follow the leader deal of recycling ideas some just blatantly stolen
  hasbro does not own the brand takara does hasbro is a licensor  how does that work when hasbro created the brand
  440 dollars    wait american dollars or chingchong dollars are they mad
i found someone who wanted to split the foxwireni set so ill be getting nickel after all    its everything i like about a cybertronian design nonhuman robot proportions utilitarian transformation and an unfamiliar yet completely coherent alt mode
  i havent decided which if any of the 3 upcoming primes im interested in but im really hoping infinite transformation does a ko of mp44 and sells it without the trailer i hear their mp36 ko is very good
  i cant speak for its ko but the thf one is fantastic easily better quality than any mps i own
  the sad thing is that price probably makes sense due to the presumably way overblown parts count and excessive paint
  takara is not hasbro either hasbro does not own the brand takara does hasbro is a licensor    this doesnt make any sense hasbro created the brand how would takara own it
  hes clearly retarded ignore him
all these retards screaming muh 440 yooessdee    3rd party buyers of all people should be aware that the msrp is rarely ever what you pay for an item on preorder or one thats sitting in stock this is the same shit as people complaining about the 330 price tag on bw megatron while ive got 3 of them preordered at aj for 208 each dont bring this shit into this thread if youre going to actually be this stupid and take this leak at face value    as for actual 3rd party figs when the fuck are we going to get a real car line
    i thought shed be a multichanger
  wow so the 440 figure is only going to be like 350 what a bargain
  208    still a pretty retarded price though
  only buys 3rd party and doesnt buy both  doesnt scalp retards who cant preorder from import sites    yikes
  208 each    yeah nah i remember when mps were probably the most reasonable priced collectibles for what you got    now you are just better off buying 3ps and this is coming from a takarafag
  i agree until an official version comes out for some reason 3rd parties will always irk me on aesthetics regardless of how great the figure is fanstoys in a great example of a company that makes solid figures until an official comes out and makes theirs look off although thats totally subjective to the person and the toon focus on the mp line leaves a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouth which is why i buy a lot of 3p stuff that wont ever get touched by tt unfortunately theres not a whole lot of that though
      the poorfag switcheroo to 3rd party fans from officalcucks is not going well by this guy
so while thats going on ms sideswipe pretty much comes ready for the g2 repaint
also oddly enough his chest fits together a little more tightly with the wheels out since inside the chest they keep the chest plate sticking out a fair bit
  aside from preferring slim shockwave to the thicc boy what has takara done better than fans toys they seem to nail the g1 aesthetic
  to be honest i stopped keeping up with ft a long while back so ill have to get back to you on that when i have a minute to really look into ft latest releases or at least the overlapping ones the only other one i can give off the top of my head is their soundwave that never made it but thats so long gone i dont really count it    they do get the aesthetic down pretty well i actually own a few of their figures but i stopped midway through the dinobots because im too hopeful for official ones maybe im just stuck on shockwave because i specifically remember being shit on so much for not jumping in the quakewave bandwagon and after waiting fucking years it kinda paid off
flame toys tarn is starting to show up to us retailers for anyone interested
  theres subtle differences to notice but the 3p in the image is actually cloud 9 i dont have ft to compare him but i do have mp29 aside from the slim factor he has a simpler transformation to him and not the risk factor in snapping off the gun barrel because of the choice of barrel extension
    tell me what you know and how you know it
  uhh
  that guy in the last thread who thought it would be 250  i told him itd be 350  they were even more retarded than i could have imagined    rest in totinos takara
    no tfsource got it first i just checked tcp for tarn and was stunned to see a kfc junkion reissue in a bourbon induced body buzz i bought that shit instantly and it felt good like the old times last year just buying slutty 3p mp tfs because i can i fuckin caught the dragon tonight boys     in the mail or soon to be to me     kfc junkion set  flametoys tarn  sh figuarts qui gon gin  infiniti wars hulk  infinity wars black panther  mmc thunderclash      apparently ive been a good boy
is there a good toy colored astrotrain    i like the way chiurgh but i only want a white space shuttle/black train astrotrain
  there are no good astrotrain toys
official mpm baricade is 47 on amazon    is the black mamba version actually better or just more economical
      i think fanstoys has done a good job of nailing the hasui aesthetic of the middle mps everyone seems to love for the 84/86 guys i much prefer that look in fact for the rest of the original cast im just going with ft however long thatll take because itll still be less time than takara    for the movie guys however i dont think theyve hit the mark at all except arcee and blurr and maybe hot rod galvatron and cyclonus still look really cool and galvatons compromises are more for the sake of coolness so i cant blame them kup and springer are the worst offenders to me they lack character and just came out like blocky slabs kup in particular his animation robot design is full of curves and rounded edges ft koot looks too flat all over apache looks too wide compared to g1 springer the most perfect attempt theyve done is arceeand of course its at the expense of her playability    its a point of contention since a lot of people hate it for being so but mp36 megatron is the perfect example of modern mp design its floro dery as fuck for the 84/85 guys and the combiners i think its ok to drift away from the animation aesthetic but the movie characters except ultra magnus were designed in animation first so i think the fans toys look for a lot of them doesnt quite hit the mark    maketoys is the other company that manages to ape the modern mp look well butt hey committ o it even harder than takara does i feel like takara still includes just enough detailing to make them work as toy versions where as mts seekers and jazz look like giant heroes of cybertron pvcs
  mmc btfo    i hope if goes all the way as usual and packs in a nickel and pet bonus
  i was gonna say something but mmc has been working on the djd since 2015 so whatever
  i always heard transportation captain was a good chug astrotrain
i sold my entire transformers collection over 15 years ago only keeping a handful of figures i decided recently i want to get a single figure of a few characters third party wasnt a thing when i quit tfs any recommendations for a good ko optimus prime that isnt a bayformer the only prime i kept  still own from my old collection is takara hybrid style convoy so ive got a g1 style fig already chug / idw style is probably what im looking for but theres so many now
  well probably the ko youd be looking for as a chug would be this        ko of maketoys striker manus
  i think youd like make toys striker manus
    3 idw style primes exist but only two are still noteworthy gc ultima maximus and gt op ex theres also an upgrade kit for cw prime to make it more idw and does a great job the third was toyworlds orion     chug style doesnt really exist bar a few interesting kos and maketoys cross dimensions style line
  imo best prime best priced and the most dynamic ive owned a lot of fun and very sturdy
  it doesnt exist    just like idw transformers comics
  isnt that official art in the corner though
  eh talk to alucard about that one i got nothin
  is this over sized pretty pricey for a ko
  no it comes with a fuckton of weapons
  anyone who doesnt like this figure has the most plebeian of tastes
i really wish they stop with the enlarge ko and just make figure better in their original size
  i wish ut would get off their aoe/tlk ride and make an attempt at early moviebots but takara/hasbro pretty much has a grip on that right now
  oy vey
  wtf    us arm forces logo are copyrighted so they to use (((greatest ally))) logo
  i might regret committing to mmcs nickel if/when if announces their own but meh thats what ebays for i guess
  of all the characters to complain about them enlarging
  i really want ut to try their hand at nitro zeus because his official toy doesnt have the correct alt mode and aoe galvatron i think their black magic could manage a nonshellformer with minimal vehicle kibble
i just looked into power baser i mostly ignored him since he was kind of expensive and i have no real attachment to powermaster prime but once i saw the retro head upgrade i was kind of smitten    bearing in mind that fanshobby god bomber isnt out yet is he worth it for what will end up the price of lgex ginrai i really love the fatter body of baser and the head upgrade makes him look perfect but i also like how the hastak one transforms without partsforming i also kind of worry its size would make it hard to fiddle with as opposed to the takara leader
  what will end up double the price excuse me
  they cant     blackout looks great big though
  just pretend its grindor instead
  i mean wei jang succeeds at size and affordability
  i like blackout so much that i may buy this just to have it  and if a great mpm of it comes out ill just turn this one into its vehicle and have both forms
    power baser is a really really big boy so yes hes in a slight class of unweildiness you are looking at improved engineering of a core and combined figure though but you absolutely have to be aware that transforming into combined mode can be a bit fiddly bending him juuuust right i do love how he stands out on my shelf above my desk though just being big and all and i dont even have any nostalgia for the character at all    a small thing to note is that in your picture they made use of both of the upgrade kits released the one with the head comes with all red hands and theres a second set thats just the updated red  blue hands something to consider if thats the look you want to go for personally im fine with his standard head so all i did was get the new red/blue hands to swap out
  in a bourbon induced body buzz i bought  anon no be careful doing drunk shopping ive bought so much weird stuff that way
  its art done by an official artist but she did it on her own time so its not technically official so i guess if thought it was free game to use
  yeah i went ahead and just bought the head upgrade kit just in case i decide to bite the bullet on him once godbomber is out im cool with the all red hands since i guess its accurate and saw that the kit is out of stock at some retailers i figure if i decide down the road i dont want him i can just sell the head to someone else    i know baser has an interior prime figure which is something the hastak one doesnt i take it theres no way to just keep them connected while transforming to the combined mode right
  sadly there isnt the trailer has to transform into the main body separately then the core robot folds up and around on himself and slots into it i do recommend him as a purchase and you should be aware that godbomber is going to be some time out overlord is going to be out early next year and hes even bigger than power baser is and numerically roadbuster then g2 megatron precede godbombers release they did show very very early prototype work for him back in august though
  ah well i guess thats the tradeoff for a core robot i looked into picking up a couple upgrades for the hasbro one to give it a core robot and the marvel comics head but itd end up being cheaper to just buy the full power baser than to go through all that    i had no idea they were doing a roadbuster though hes one of my absolute favorites and while i like the mmc one the shoulders are a bit of an issue not sure i care for this vehicle mode though    god with baser godbomber what looks to be the definitive overlord and roadbuster on the way my wallet is going to be hurting
  thats basically their preliminary render of him so id bet dollars to donuts hes been reworked they did it with overlord so it seems only reasonable they just havent shown anything off at shows other than the timeline of overlords progress most recently the colored tank prototype at tfcon back in october
  also i wanted to make sure that if sd things appeal to you master made have their own releases in the pipeline after they do devastator
  sd overlord   i have reservations and a mighty need all at once
  mm have captivated me with all their releases so far even if d scorpion was weaker than it could have been so i am interested to see how they develop but i cant ignore that im more interested in how their devastator is going to shape out first
  i almost just want that mega and giga
    theyre both way worse than the official actually the only thing they do better is the not chipping the paint during transformation
  i want that bigger blackout how much does he run normally
  theyre both way worse than the official  how do you figure that
  yeah thats not even close to true the it version is superior to the official in every conceivable way except having to put your own faction symbol on him
we live in a timeline where we have screen accurate toys for overtly complicated 3d renders for high budget movies at reasonable prices and reasonable transformation sequences  all the while toys that try to match a budgeted and poorly drawn cartoon are extremely expensive and extremely complicated for what they are
  theyre nowhere near the screen accuracy of the g1 mps though
i eagerly await another one of bobbys youll just have to work harder and get more ot vid when he discusses this whopper of a price if neither ms or te dont pass the qc test mp10 is pretty much safe on my shelf
nani
its a transformery dancouga by beast king model expected mid 2019 at 800 chinese yuan
ok maybe i shouldve posted it in some other thread but i guess it still counts as a 3rd party unlicensed transformer    24cm combined so around a tf leader class
  a whos making this  b while i like me some super bots ol dan there isnt a transformer
  is this a recast of the sentinel version
  to be fair multichanging for her is literally just  extend wings and tailfin while magically shrinking wheels for airmode  and extend our periscope and deploy armswhich the toy has for watermode
  oh looks like it is didnt keep up with sentinels stuff at all the item description mention that the catshoes have added joints guess thats what they were talking about
  fuck yes dancouga
  ms is definitely looking like the winner for me but even then i dont feel the need to upgrade from mp10 right now hell i still have mp01 sitting around   id rather spend my money on something more interesting than another optimus
  i cant decide if i want black mamba or tf dream factory more
something to look forward to
    got the knockoff recently very nice        not me i think its brilliant
  haha papatoys managed to sneak into the nonko convention that would surely piss mft off
  no maketoys    ow    poseidon    for fucks sake god neptune  possible fixes when
  no maketoys  yeah i was hoping to see either cross dimension rodimus or remaster galaxy convoy    no fanstoys either
  by owning all of them  magten and by actually being objective and not simply mad at takara for ruining an otherwise perfect figure that is so expensive
  no i think he wants to know what the official one does better from what i was aware of the only real differences were paint and softer mold detail
gt  frame arms or is it megami device
  paint apps are better joints and moving parts are tighter soft plastic parts dont turn green
  i know the 3p process can be described as glacial at best but it feels like maketoys is struggling a little bit maybe im just crazy      rolling thunder  man i cant wait for him to arrive
  i definitely like this bot mode more than the first two but i can only imagine what nightmare transformation they have in store
  mine might might be here by the end of the week and yeah im looking forward to his redness to get here
  wonder if pt will release an updated version with faces closer to the cartoon thats the main reason i went with mft but then got the diaclone deco by mistake
  fa girl
  i went with mft but then got the diaclone deco by mistake  that limited version is actually limited unlike mfts all other limited releases
  yeah im not complaining already ordered another purple ver
im not quite sure this works
    neat i think you kinda have to redo the head for it to work though
  heres hoping he does better than maketoys groove
  him being such a weak link is probably the reason guardia never saw a proper rerelease      it really looks like he doesnt even have a head
  if they would of made the dicast plastic everything would be fine
  also have fh laser prime with him do i need this as well since its still on sale for today 
  i gotta get the trailer for archenemy some day
  its also 80 so someday might have to be today
  fuck it did it fool money parted guess i just love my fans hobby stuff too much cmon 1214 be the firecons
  im waiting tfs
  i want to but i already spent my tf budget
  sounds like you need a loan
  this is just a trailer not a damn misb overlord
  yeah misb overlord is due for january
  i love my carnifex but that double evil looks great      thats awesome i was indifferent about this until now
  sentinel is getting outpriced by takara  ft tarn the most impressive and well engineered transformer ever made in nearly 100 usd cheaper than a nutakara paintflaketimus    l m a o
    thats cool as hell does it come painted like that
  and we dont even know what the factory flaws will be yet since most mp figures being more highly massproduced usually have linewide flaws of various types  so far from watching all the available reviews ft tarn only seems to suffer from tight ankle rockers
  the fingers are also incredibly loose
well it seems showz shipped gunfighter and tactical commander separately so the former got in today and the latter just got into nj today at 3 am      as far as it seems no its either some guys custom work or a separate release for down the line
          oooh thats awesome i own a sentinel dancouga and its in my top 5 mecha toys but the possible issues with joint qc makes me apprehensive to really play with it since at the current price its irreplacable to me this would be a nice desktoy to play with if its sturdy enough i recommend everyone look into this if theyre interested in that classic obari aesthetic the original is by sentinel who also engineered flame toys tarn    also id love a magnaboss made out of dancouga
  so did mine curious how much longer till it gets to arizona
  well since it seems to be in possession by usps now id like to imagine it would be relatively quick but i assume that it needs to go through customs first i want to make a guess somewhere in the realm of saturday or monday
big and little lasers
  i love archenemy so im always so tempted to double dip on this i love that design and while i dont like a few nitpicks on the fh version its still worth it i do wonder if well ever get a g1 color version
ko company decides to make something original   immediately gets kod
the full squad as i have them      well youll get the best pricing with tcps 100 preorder winter special and then of course their own 85 pricing on the trailer with a little bit of handling the nitpicks i personally have are 1 the covers to hide the hands plug in just a liiiitle too tight and 2 the guns dont seem to really sit securely in vehicle mode but maybe i was just doing it wrong sure the shoulders are limited but i feel its not a point you can hold against them  its just part of who they are
  i think id only get carnifex to pair like this to fuumawhich is if i get fuuma but then id feel like id be double dipping in a strange way
  i just ordered their doublecross and grotusque really hyped about getting them in
anyone own open and plays big cannon bbts has it on sale i want to get it for my 5 year old nephew because he wants a big bad guy figure and he lives tftm  he can handle titans teturn leader optimus for example think he would do ok with this figure can it stand up to play like a retail figure can
    yeah i handled one at tf con but dont plan to get it because i dont think a galvatron that feels like a retail toy needs to be quite so big its probably at least as durable as the retail titans return galvatron was and feels pretty much the same or better in terms of quality    its good for 35 either way thats cheaper than retail hasbro leader toys and its slightly larger
  theyre a really great trio imo you just have to be ok with grotusque being 50 doublecross and i always feel like theres never quite enough clearance to be happy in transforming the legs but getting grotusque gets you all the extra accessories for the other two extra faces for repugnus and doublecross hands for doublecross and 4 fire pieces so hes definitely worth it plus out of the 3 he absolutely has the best colors    let me help you out a little bit more  because you definitely want a full set      i think in terms of durability youre definitely ok though theyre always recommending 3p releases as like at least 14 and yes im pretty sure leaders are still ranked at 8 its just something to be aware of the one frustrating aspect about him that i can imagine coming from it is that op releases dont have instructions of any sort theres for sure plenty of yt videos to be found for him but then i cant speak to what internet privileges he has but for the price bbts has him going for it cant be beat
i honestly know nothing about transformers let alone 3rd party transformers but what is wrong with immortal series ace01 and ace02 i saw them on bbts for 80 off and just got a little curious
  ive heard some general build quality issues but nothing specific comes to mind i picked up the hubcap because at 15 i can take the risk
  while i dont know anything myself about the release poking around a bit i did find it was the companys first release and i dont know if they did anything since    
  their qc was crap and the figures joints degraded and they became floppy messes if you want a good cj get either xtb or mmc both are solid offerings
  we live in a world where some 3rd party options are now cheaper than the originals theyre based on  how the fuck did we get into this timeline
  ya know what i honestly think takara saw what we were willing to spend on 3rd party products so they figured wed pay soc/sentinel prices for official products
  i still remember the early days all those ultra magnus trailers to wrap around mp01
    i think honestly takaras designer offices must have had some kind of gas leak and that everyone working there is slowly going brain damaged    i seriously just dont understand how you can make literally everything wrong in a figure
  i did see that yeah wasnt that on purpose though to prevent then from being broken
  by religiously following a low budget childrens cartoon from the 80s and trying to recreate those inconsistent drawings in 3 dimensional space
  so mp prime version 3 is pretty much not happening    what are the third party options as far as a masterpiecescaled g1 design not idw optimus go
  i have always wanted this but never knew anything about it just a really interesting design
  your options are either magic square who have up to this point only produced legend class figures their solid mind you and have nothing but good word of mouth but this is their first mp  more pics here   transformation vid around 5 min mark 
and transform element   more pics again   also see the previous threads for comparison pics and discussions  boards4channelorg/toy/thread/7254420    
  eh transform element feels too blocky to me
  having just taken ol mp10 off the shelf for that quick photo seeing this just makes me think how much more vibrant he is in his colors maybe its part of the difference between takara and hasbro but ms seems to have a bunch more life in it
  its the brighter almostwhite of ms vs mp10s silver paint and grey plastic
  i feel like te has the most showaccurate head given that it looks like an animation error
just booked my tfcon toronto hotel room for 5 nights    fuck la
  ms prime looks so good and then you get to the knees and its like what the fuck were they thinking
  it seems like everything make toys does that isnt their seekers jazz or cross dimension has struggled even in the case of jazz and the seekers they basically abandoned their old mp aesthetic they used up to despotron i think theyre very cautious because of that now
finally a lewdcee
  those curvy bouncy seats look comfy
    is there thread anywhere with all the photos of this guy
  where can i buy this
anyone bought this yet and can give a review
  theres a few reviews up on youtube by now mines in the us and in theory will be in my hands by the end of the weekend hopefully by then really looking forward to it apparently is a beefy and well ratcheted lad
  im down she would look good on a wreckers shelf
    anon want energy
  i ordered the metal variant
    where can i find the metallic version
    have mercy
  i literally linked them in my post
  im still uncertain about the real thing but this just might tempt me to get one of those optimus knight figures   and with  here i can think of another articulated knightly figure that ive yet to get after all these years that might appreciate a car over a bike but i doubt that shed be able to sit in it   over all its  thats making me look forward to it between the notquite pauldrons sword stored guns and the shield to complete it all paladins looking tempting even with those hip parts that reminds me of the franxx suits
  about time        im also waiting for mine in the mail and should look great fighting archenemy
and a lolibot
  nice who are those
  whenever i see posts like pic related i cant help question if the tard making them is serious or just going out of their way to try to make a mockery of people cursed with hardware/software mismatches
    yeah they got some real cool stuff
  any time i see a post like this it just reinforces my belief that not everyone deserves a voice
            is fire bird the company thats making this figure i dont see any site that sells their products or is it sold exclusively on chinese sites
            well fuck count me in for the 3p side now  how much are you expecting it will cost
time to get that toilet robot and start an ntr shelf
  dont post that shit here
    original ips  sort of want hope this company actually produce something and not just cock tease like so many
    so far they havent actually made anything yet who knows when this will actually be made
    fuck off kiraposter
  report him you idiot  yous are what he wants
  i genuinely want to see the elita figure this sicko is bitching about
  i want to see how the lolibot looks
  has that company even made anything if so ill like to see some of their work
  ive always thought bobby was a whiny autistic fuck but ive never seen him go full sony did this really happen if so hes a bigger piece of shit than i thought    also somebody in the hastak thread that he hates legends class toys is this true
    does it have a trailer or is it compatible with the mp10 one      i just pulled out my mp10 too and i guess all this talk of a new prime made me really fixate on that gap in his chest panels for as much as i dont want a new prime that issue kind of drives me nuts
              p h e w
  tfes optimus is mp10 trailer compatible with plans on releasing their own seperately apparently but i dont know if mss optimus will be compatible
  i kinda like it maybe for that reason i really liked mp10 too with his longer abs and shorter pec windows now seeing this with the larger windows and shorter grill and it still works what i dislike on both 3rd party offerings is the hip/skirt area especially on transform elements the face sculpt sucks as well id also prefer the leg vents be painted silver but muh toon accuracy overall though i think i prefer both to takaras offering at this point not even counting price although we havent seen a painted version of the new mp yet i never came around to mp36s aesthetic and prime seems to be going in the same direction long legs diaper squashed torso so i dont think added color will make a difference in this case
  thats kind of interesting like a transforming droid
semiannual reminder that where the fuck is my g2 megatron fans hobby      the takara version was designed with the toy colors in mind because back then mps were about incorporating all elements of a character into a singular design and not just a fucking ugly cartoon      i guess all this talk of a new prime made me really fixate on that gap in his chest panels  do you have the hasbro or takara version i owned two hasbro versions of mp10 until i finally found the takara version on sale and the overall qc fit and finish was like night and day i tried fixing one of my hasbro ones the issue was that the chest doors were pinned crooked and couldnt close securely enough with the extra mass of the bumper behind the chest in robot mode i did a bunch of shaving and sanding and got them to close somewhat decent but the ankles and arm joints were also weak as fuck and the plastic just looked cheap in comparison looking at both together side by side it was such a contrast it was like seeing the difference between toy and collector quality in materials alone my takara version fit together perfectly with absolutely zero chest gap too    this was the exact moment that i pretty much stopped paying any heed to anything online toy reviewers claimed i watched and read all kinds of comparison videos for mp10 and none of them mentioned all of these obvious contrasts in quality as well as the fact that most of takara mp10s red surfaces are actually painted and look 1000 times better for it instead just focusing on hurrr hasbro has painted eyes and lights and is colored more like muh cartoon that makes it better made me realize how fucking tasteless most tf collectors are
  did this really happen  
  for the time stamp he starts his money rant around the 4min mark
  i still cant believe he recorded everything for that video looked at it and said yep this looks fine and not crazy at all thats a step away from the kind of thing someones family would think about staging an intervention over
  i guess im glad only optimus looks good and that i dont care for anything theyve done to begin with    also fuck you guys for getting me to listen to this fuck
  per accordance with monkeys paw you must deal with it being designed by cassy sark and also definitely never being produced
  mp10 is pretty much safe on my shelf  i dont think mp10 will ever get dethroned for me i cant imagine any company making a g1 prime that panders more to my preferences hes a bit clunky articulationwise and his arms are too long but thats easily fixed by not extending them all the way and his overall aesthetic is just so keen its clearly g1 prime but his proportions and headsculpt are immediately recognizable as being mp10 i like when a toy has an identity of its own instead of just being slavishly accurate to something else especially transformers who came from being toys in the first place
  theyre made in the same factories youve convinced yourself of something just because you want to believe it
had to pay scalper fees to get this but im not regretting this at all    the design that went into this is just outstanding
          
  ive been told the voyagersized ko of mp10 is worth getting    but then a friend who was demonstrating his to me was trying to show me a supposidly fragile piece that if broken makes it untransformable and broke his while doing so
  every time i dare to tread deeper into the toy collecting communities of the internet and worry that im getting too absorbed in my hobby i thank my lucky starts that im not this much of a complete fucking tool
  ive been told the voyagersized ko of mp10 is worth getting  the problem is that people almost always have an agenda behind their opinion people were specifically supportive of the voyager ko of mp10 because it filled a gap for those who obsess over specifically having a voyager prime for their generations collection since there hasnt been a legitimate official one since the outdated classics version
  those who obsess over specifically having a voyager prime for their generations collection    well that is what i was looking for that prompted them to mention it in the first place    cw prime was crap tr was the wrong generation and leader prime was too gimmicky for me everything older is out of reach at this point id either go for the kompy or the siege one and the latter would need modification
  how does being made in the same factories preclude them being made of different materials or to different qc standards its already obvious that takara will occasionally change parts of a mold or the way things are cast/painted because while it may add steps to the process it ends up looking better ie the lg line factories are just facilities are you going to tell me that rhapsody in blue played by a professional pianist and chopsticks played by a 7yearold are the same song because they played them on the same piano
  figures its pretty much the only option available for a longstanding gap in most collections its not surprising that so many people convinced themselves it was somehow perfect they were desperate
  so its not a wise decision then    that fragile parts the only thing thats been stopping me from buying it
  thats why im leaning ms theirs is basically an updated mp10 which is all i really wanted
  i dont own it myself i just didnt think it looked particularly good and i already have actual mp10 so i see no appeal in owning a smaller chintzier version of it i suppose if you can find it for cheap enough it certainly fills the role i mean like i said there really arent any other options unless you want to modify the siege one which does look like a pretty fun figure despite the questionable design choices
  they are literally the same molds though     you bought multiples of the same toy and one of them was more expensive so youve hyperfixated on that one its all in your head
i know there are multiple versions of the mp10 ko whats the one with the extra paint apps pinned finger and the hole in the crotch filled the only kos ive seen seem to have the normal grey thighs and the crotch hole      i think it was peugh who tested how easy it is to remove the battle damage paint apparently it comes right off with rubbing alcohol
  scrolling ahead through video  stop at a random point  the first words i hear are shelf presence  close video    holy shit i didnt think anybody could be worse than optibotimus
  he doesnt collect legends but hes given iron factory and magic square really positive reviews
      my favourite thing by far about bonobo skilletface is that he insists on wearing a mask to protect his identity yet parades his wife and young children around on camera at every opportunity
  its not to protect his identity its to keep him from being bullied
  t buttmadpoorfag
  i actually paid more for my hasbro one
    i thought it was just his gimmick it and his skits are what helped differentiate him from all the other reviewers i honestly liked bobby when he first started out he was pretty humble and was the voice of reason when many reviewers were pretty much bought and paid for hell i think he even browsed /3pg/ at one time cause he happen to bring up a topic we were discussing at the time     sadly over the past two years hes gotten more arrogant over his little bit of fame he thinks himself as some authoritative figure in the community now he dosent even review really that much anymore its mostly discussion vids now
  ironically bobby shills more than even the literal shill reviewers ive never seen other reviewers try to browbeat people into getting an extra job to support a chink toymaker
  doesnt have to pay for his flame toys tarn  advocates other people take second jobs and overtime to afford their own    this guys a real piece of work
        i think what kills me the most is he has this rigid and fucked up idea of what collecting is he doesnt even seem to like toys he just wants one exact version of every character from the tv show and thats it
  those two are mine fans hobby gunfighter ii that had just come in yesterday and maketoys battle sentinel which at this time is on preorder sale at bbts for 80
  in my experience thats what most franchise toy collectors want there are very few actual toy enthusiasts people just want a real thing that looks like the fictional thing they remember from their childhood stick it on a shelf to collect dust and call it a day id say that among tf collectors especially its more common    i have a friend like that but at least he has the sense to stick to statueshit and keep his crap tastes from influencing the market
  ill assume gunfighter ii is the big one and battle sentinel is the little one  how are they
  gunfighter ii is my preferred mp prime g1 is so boring id still love to see a good mp take on armada prime    the more i think about it i like almost every design of optimus prime more than g1 apart from bayformers
  im willing to give fh a little leeway on their projects since theyve been putting so much focus on getting overlord just right of course hes shaping up to be just about ready for spoilerprime/spoiler time for early next year so it could be about the point that something new is shown off theyll be at the upcoming sgc in middecember and being a chinese company id say this is the best opportunity there would be for them to show us something new theres also their roadbuster to consider which numerically comes before megatron      you identified them correctly for my initial thoughts on gunfighter see  i only got him in yesterday afternoon and had work early on this morning so have only had a little bit of handling sentinel is a bit of an odd duck firstly hes a core robot gentoo thats similar to the hasbro generations g2 prime the reason for that is they initially developed a trailer that broke down into armor pieces for that particular release theres a partially armored mode which hes in as well as a fully armored mode using all the trailer pieces pictured here which i find just a bit too busy for my liking
  different anon but i absolutely love gunfighter very high quality materials satisfying weight without being too heavy and a clunky yet fun transformation that feels like youre transforming a tonka truck his alt mode is a bit big but still looks cool despite some poor kibble management and he comes with two different guns and a massive sword despite his unwieldy shoulder proportions he poses very well and has excellent ratchets qc was flawless on mine with tight joints and perfect paint apps hes got some diecast in his feet and lower shins for stability and is not top heavy despite his looks not sure what hes going for now but a while back you could get him for 100 shipped right from fans hobbys store which is an absurd bargain for his size and quality hes easily my favorite 3rd party figure
  id say that among tf collectors especially its more common    which is bizarre because transformers more than almost any other franchise is about the playability we have decades of different versions of these characters with tons of unique takes on them but people keep wanting versions of character from a show that aired like 40 years ago    fuck im almost 30 and i wasnt even born when the g1 cartoon was airing
  119 at tfsource    so clunky but still nice for both of them
  thirding the gushing for gunfighter although i have archenemy    that molds great nuff said       i really want someone to ko hypernovae
does anyone know where to find the second version of wei jiangs mpp27 with the improved face sellers retailers etc
  i cant speak for other versions of prime because i only have a handful  classics g1 reissue universe laser wfc mp01 mp10 gt gorilla and now power baser  gunfighter  and the last two definitely have a lot more going on for them than 01 and 10 have if it wasnt so much a struggle on folding power baser in on himself the first time around perhaps id be more keen on flipping him around more but im just not sure it would be worth the hassle personally gunfighter has his vibrant colors going for him in contrast to the dark red and blues of takaras mp10 thankfully that transformation is simple enough to do disregarding the issue i noted with hand hiding arm flaps pegging in just a little too tightly      theres also a preorder run at tcp for 100 at the moment as well as a number of the other fans hobby releases and the trailer listed for 85      sentinels shoulders are a bit funky because its really gentoos rolling around inside instead of the whole piece moving together      well in terms of nonlegends companies maketoys is definitely getting kod the most almost exclusively by yes model
was trying to figure out why ms sideswipe had a wonky looking face and i noticed there was a bit of mold flash over one of his eyes and that really sucks because the face is painted
  tried cleaning off the excess very carefully and now it looks like hes criyng    hes so small i can barely see the face anyway i dont care
    if anyone has 40 minutes to spend this guy went through the three final victory releases i glanced a bit over the warpath bit since that would be the one id be most interested in doesnt seem all too bad
  based hope if they actually release its a big success and they become dedicated to making sexy transformer chicks
  which is bizarre because transformers more than almost any other franchise is about the playability we have decades of different versions of these characters with tons of unique takes on them but people keep wanting versions of character from a show that aired like 40 years ago  yeah that is totally unique and uncommon something that happens in no other fandom especially not star wars or marvel or dc or various anime properties or    fuck you cant even get a new original blue eva unit anymore because they just refuse to fucking make them instead going for the shitty designs from the various remakes they keep sharting out for example
  same shit
boners over butterfly joints
  t seething takaracuck
    not my bag but im very happy for the dozen or so people who this is a dream for
  imagine this hes probably going to be cheaper than the awful looking takara prime
finally managed to find this big broad for a decent price and todays ebay coupon brought it down to just a hair above her retail cost glad to add her to my extended decepticon collection i dragged my ass on a lot of mmc stuff from 2017 and im still playing catchup still tempted by tyrantron for the miner megatron look but thats reached ridiculous prices
  todays ebay coupon  i must have missed one how much we talking
  10 off its still active but only for things listed under the toy category sp basically only really worth it if youre spending 100 or more
robotoybase has gt gorilla available now at 75 a damn fine price for a damn fine toy
  lucky ive been scouring for a long time to find one myself
have we seen magic square primes back pack because this one is ridiculous
  i will be honest and say i like how his knees look everything else looks awful
  put those knees on ms prime and you have the perfect op
  heres hoping magic square sees this and adds all these niche accessories just to make it an even better purchase
          
  not bad honestly what is it
  haha forgot picture
  everything at mp44s crotch and below i like but the upper body aside from the smokestacks arent really doing it for me
  looks like all the truck parts fold up to form the backpack much like sunstreaker bbts also pulled their pre order so a possible price correction maybe incoming
    yes pic related        that exposed elbow gap    eeehhhhhhh    potentially fucked truck bed    neeeeeehhhhh    mp44 really needs something like the silver trim around the chest windows to make that pop more
  it was me all along megatron
  preview of starscream attempt 2 i hope so
  get mt meteor dose the job and cost less than takara will
  mt meteor  nah tiny head
  battle sentinel is pgood barring some hiccups like the tab thats supposed to hold his heels together for truck mode needing to be nipped down to make it not get in the way of armoring up although you cant really do much with the trailers leftover chunk other than have him wear it like your pic which is pmuch a fixed pose scenario the rest is nice enough you get some room to set things to your liking with the way they reworked the truck nose/shoulder mountains and options are good  mines got an oddball tolerance issue tho for whatever reason the handles for the big guns they show him using in combined form dont get any grip in the big hands for that mode despite being nice and snug in their sockets in the trailer and the hands holding the sword hilt good and tight im not totally sure what to do about it
wasnt iron factory teasing they were going to reveal 10 things on some day in december
  its not really that bad in person
  ah i think i just dont like its proportions in general more power to you if it works for you though
    do his legs just turn insideout
  man up close the paint on this looks like such shit compared to mp10    why did takara forget how to do good paint
  transformation starts around 6 min 
  you have to remember this is a hand painted sample and mp had very little paint anyway
      theres a reason we separate the transformers generals for me it just depresses me to see this official stuff and its wallet raping price   worse yet its subject to the same criticism 3p has been subject to for years over engineering to achieve shit looking but aa accurate robots
  sunstreakers backpack isnt that bad its basically just the very back of the car folded up a bit as well as the hood and front windshield but they hide better it just doesnt clean up very well    mp sunstreaker unironically has a smaller backpack made up of less unincorporated vehicle parts than mp sideswipe    thats compared to this v3 where you can very much tell theres an entire peterbilt folded up in there at least its clean but its still not great
    i cant get over how bad this is i think the various headsculpts and the enhanced articulation might be the only good things about it but even then the elbows and waist are ugly as fuck that backpack is just reprehensible
  they dont turn inside out but the legs open up and do a neat little unfolding thing to get the wheels and vehicle tanks out
migrate when ready  new   new 
      thank you sempai
remember this is a general to discuss transformers toys report any movie or comic discussion that does not involve the toys    where to take movie/cartoon discussion    where to take comic discussion      previous thread 
where to buy              
so how much of bumblebees run time do you think will be on cybertron will it just be the opening scene or do you think they might show more
  hopely the first few minutes since those designs are awful
the op of this thread vigorously enjoys getting his ass pounded by the mods its a sick fetish for him do your part to get him off by reporting his shitpost threads
  yeah do your part by posting more comics thatll show him
i dont understand why you even do this still its been over a year what are you getting from it  why dont you just leave if /tfg/ bothers you so much nobody wants you around in the first place
  i dont see whats that bad about wanting to discuss toys in a toy board
  if they were going to put molded detail across two seperate panels on the legs youd think theyd make a better effort to make sure those leg panels are flush against each other or maybe even slightly adjust the detail so it isnt very slightly on two seperate panels making the gap look worse    also i just noticed the cab lights are very slightly coloured orange and that the arrows on his arms are a darker shade of red wtf this isnt toon accurate anymore
  remember this is a general to discuss transformers toys report any movie or comic discussion that does not involve the toys  literally the 2nd post 
  nobody wants to talk to you
  its a painted prototype so maybell see a production sample at the next convention
  ok buddy just keep seething over there
  or maybe even slightly adjust the detail  and ruin the sacred cartoon accuracy there shall be no deviations from the model sheets allowed you heretic
  imagine the day takara invents shapeshifting toys that cost 5000
  where are you talking about
    this board is 18 only baybies go elsewhere
  oh god that backpack  ill stay with mp10 or go with a third party figure any suggestions
  forgot to post pic
  ms toys for a highly refined mp10 with a slightly more cartoonish look and a completely real transformation in the chest no fake grill or windows    transform element though you may want to recolour the windows somehow theyre very dark on stock for a prime thats a bit more like the cartoon model just from better episodes or perhaps the movie than what they based this weird alledgesroundedoff new mp on
  theres literally no reason to complain about links or redirections in the op most only use it to find the thread in the catalog  and i dont want to discuss current media anyways because it all looks like shit cyberverse couldve been good but the animation is ugly and they turned it into the windblade show idw is just garbage who knows or cares for bumblebee
  people are fine with links its the antilinkfags that get triggered by them
here linkfucker have another    
    500 bucks    yeah no
  shut up      im assuming it will just be used in flashbacks or used to explain the whole war between decepticons and autobots
  its upsetting that this was the first figure to actually make a decent optimus head
  i dont want to discuss current media  therefore nobody else is allowed to
  aside from the other two mp optimuses you mean
  hopefully
  for that price you can also get a dx soul of chogokin combattler v and look at what you get in the box     
congratulations on killing /tfg/ op  you finally got what you wanted
  buid one yo self ya gitz
  not really i just wanted to discuss toys in a toy board
  and you ruined it with your unbridled autism   well done
  the new mp optimus is 50000 yen but that one is 40000
  be careful anon your autism is showing again
    fuck the more i look at it the worse it gets guys
  yeah it must be difficult for you to grasp the concept that a transformer can actually have that much articulation dont blame you its understandable if you only buy transformers
looks like op is trying to do what i once done but being overzealous with the whole /toy/ only rule    what hes doing isnt wrong but i know the thread aint gonna like it op you do know if the thread likes literal kids toys over mps they aint gonna stand for this
  that pic illustrates why i love official takara shockwave so much quakeblast is also cool and i like him but laserwave is such a little dork and i can imagine him pleading for them to stop in his david warner impression voice its so perfect in my head
  laserwave is such a little dork  obligatory 
  pretty much exactly what i was thinking of really i like having pathetic nerd shockwave along with murderkillbeast shockwave
  out of those three shockwaves i like the way the takara plays most not to say the other two are bad far from it
  anon you are the only anon who gives a shit whether or not tfrelated tv/comic stuff bleeds over or not look now at how inactive and slow your thread is because nobody wants to come here and talk to you nobody likes you and everyone agrees youre a blight on these generals
  its not what people like or not its the rules if you want to discuss things other than toys go to other boards
  he is an allspark/tfw poster that gets triggered by kira and archer should give you a clue who he is
  these scenes were probably a late production thing when it was clear the whole thing was a reboot so dont expect much
what did i do wrong i was under the impression ft08 grinder was taller than mp10
  you got an oversized mp10 lad
mp10 the remix is 400 usd    w h y
  son of a oh well i tried but im retarded
  let the janitors do their work then youre not in a position to be enforcing rules in fact every single post of you bitching about muh rules is less related to the topic at hand than the transformers comics/tv shows posts
this guy isnt too bad the combined form is nice but the individuals that make him up are pretty bad
    just a real shame they arent smart enough to do high end animation movies like dc entertainment
best buds
  its impressive how the consturctions ended up better they suffer but their issues are nowhere near as bad    by the time takara released the uw version the only real flaw was that scavenger and bonecrusher should have been larger arms
  so who is this for what would compel someone to purchase this over mp10 which is cheaper and has been readily available for years now
  well they dont have the backing of a hollywood powerhouse like wb    paramount has been the short bus of the major studios for a long time and now they dont have based robert evans to bail them out of their fuckups either
  the fact that this new optimus doesnt have limited articulation range helps    i own mp10 and really like it but im going to buy this new one too because even if im not a g1 kid optimus cartoon design is absolutely iconic and as an action figure it seems to be miles better than mp10
  not to defend mp44 but mp10 has become outdated and this also panders to people who wanted a more animation acurate op
  mp optimuses  optimi
  i recommend waiting for a black convoy version since that will probably be super basic and much cheaper
  at the risk of being off topic does anyone have the image like this but its like a 3way brawl between 3 different 3p mp refelector teams  you can post the pic on the 3p thread and then just leave the link here
    i mean the more i see it the more i like it pic related is neato but then shots like   snap me back to reality i suppose i am satisfied with mp10 and on the whole my collection doesnt need another optimus
  or just flat out ignore the mold and go for one of the two 3p offerings
  mpp10 fuck i forgot oh well
are we going to see predaking discounted    ill pick him up for 50 bucks why not
  hes already being sold at discount a few days ago he was at 95 and toy he was at 83 bucks on amazon    even if he drops to 50 i wont buy it since the toy has way too many issues to warrant a purchase
  i remember shitposters coming in into the turd party thread telling us how mmc predaking was done and how much better the official shitpile would be
  i own the mmc and its really not great either theres a reason everyone is kinda anticipating the mp attempts now
  chug scale combiners are out of fashion with goyworld making the 2ft partsforming messes that are popular now    fuck combiners desu id rather have good team transformers that dont combine and then a fuckhueg action master so the individual bots arent dumpster fires
so what is the best titans war powermaster prime to get     should i pay out the ass for the takara twopack with godbomber with the rest of the masterforce heads or the us release or the takara version or its us multipack
  i recommend just waiting for someone to post theirson amimami ive seen both godbomber and ginrai posted for 3500 yen each on the preowned section    they currently arent available but theyve consistently sold them for way less    buying them new is insane
    you can get regular titans return optimus prime for about 4050 normal price     if you are wedded to the original us pm prime you should stick to the us version the takara version is basically retooled to make it masterforce accurate      godbomber is pretty crappy but thats just my opinion unless you really want hosehead there is no reason to buy the super duper box set with him and minerva
so the jet still has a pile of crap underneath and the combined mode looks nothing like it should    at least the people who loved jetfires robot mode will be happy
  the combined mode looks like shit again
    on the other hand the jet mode is still less bad than the original the transformation looks alot more fun and the combined mode will atleasth ave basic poseability    its an improvement in every way
  twas shit to begin with ive made better designs with tinfoil and crayons
  yeah but those werent in a movie when i was 10 so i dont care
  he knows he does this on purpose as a shitposting tactic everybody is aware of this by now
  oy daz a fast un cuzza itz red
apparently you can push out the blue translucent pieces on primes grill and headlights to give him a more earth form look
  nice what about the bot modes backpack
  the gatling guns and greebles just makes it look alien
  that undercarriage is nasty but im loving that robot mode
found this sucker at target along with some seige deluxes vw bee is perfect though tlk bee has some issues
    someone cut the hinge connecting the backpack/truck hat and unscrewed the gatling guns it can still transform without it but it looks a little silly
  from the top i cant help but think hasbro is planning to sell a retool of this later down the road as the earth version
  i perfer the original look than that
i finally found a scoop for cheap to start my slicer custom  the shoulders will be the biggest issue
  you posted in the wrong thread friend
  no he posted in the right one
  nah senpai this is the kira thread made to trick idiots like you   the real thread is much more engaging
  guess who also has more posts /v/   you want to be like like /v/ thats gonna be a yikes from me
  then do it on the right board stupid no reason we should have 2 boards
hey tfgen where can a get extra weapons compatible with the titans return toy line a lot of the guys have extra places for bits and i wanna give them more guns and stuff
  we dont have two boards anon there is only one /toy/  but if you meant the right thread i am in the right one already
  looks like a shitty video game
  you have my sympathies both are shit
so the toon version of sunstreaker and the upcoming hound are meant to complement mp44 as the two last companions of optimus prime    i heard that mp39 sunstreaker is getting reissued next year as it is currently sold out at the normal price
  looks like a really cool video game
  honey get in here he got down from the rock
  you can put a little plastic dude inside it that you cant even see because the windshield plastic is nearly opaque since it needs to hide the clusterfuck of fake chest parts inside  lol      this alt mode looks more like a futuristic earth truck than a cybertronian truck like kind of what prime should have upgraded to by 2005
  cartoon pandering has hit such maximum saturation that they are now planning mp releases to match character appearances in famous scenes to try and sucker gewunners into buying figures just so they can recreate le epic scene from muh childhood  although i suppose if i were desperate for sales id aim at the lowest hanging fruit too
im still not seeing what makes mp44 450 about the only thing its doing different from mp36 is coming with a big plastic box    like seriously unless theres a fucking autoblow in that trailer this shit is 200 extra for no reason whatsoever
  big plastic box 100  sense of completion and satisfaction for autists to finally have an utterly awful optimus prime that looks like it stepped right out of a shitty cartoon 100  thats about it takara caught on and realized that the mp collector market is full of fools and money just begging to be parted
  i think mps are just going to be these exhorbitant prices now this is the third one in a row thats more expensive than the previous they obviously cant just keep driving the price up but i dont expect well ever see a return to the 90 ones
  return to the 90 ones  lol and those were the fucking bbts prices importing the carsized mps used to cost under 70 bucks depending on exchange rates and shipping costs
  getting minibot mps for less than 100 would be a relief at this point
  the reason is that theyre reducing mp releases to 1 or 2 a year    this year we were supposed get 2 but beast wars megatron got fucked up and delayed until may
  those days are long over now funny i actually bought old mp red alert for 80 shipped from mandarake last week though glad i found one cant deal with the painted over headlights on the newer one
  the siege leader optimus prime uses the siege ultra magnus cab and new trailer armor but this might get used for another nemesis prime

  my uncle is aaron archer
  you have my profound sympathies james roberts is my godfather
how was your first black friday without toys r us    as a former tru employee im very bummed that i was replaced by a cardboard display in a kroger store
  exactly the same as every black friday before it
  we have tru still in my region and its shit even on black friday
  this
  i thought id feel bad but gamestop and target stepping up their game has kind of helped ease the loss still not perfect but im okay
i miss the overnight parties at tru but i dont miss how many bikes they made me build    i miss getting high in the back room with teenage girls    last year a guy tried to steal a bunch of ps4s while disguised as an employee and i called him a cunt good times
i remember lining up at my local tru during the wii boom i got there like an hour  a half before opening and was fifth in line the wait wasnt bad and the other people in line were nice i was expecting a worse time but it turned out to be a fond memory due to the cool people out there and the friendly employees inside i still feel wistful about it even though less than a mile away at the walmart someone got trampled to death that year
  how much yah getting from that 20 mil settlement if it was split evenly 20mil / 31k thatd be 645 an employee but id imagine not everyone will be on equal footing when it comes to paying out time
never forget that tru was killed by a pussy     named mitt romney
i went to tru on black friday because im not an americunt  there was fuck all just like every black friday before it
who the fuck cares dude you going to make a whats your first christmas like without shitty giraffe store in a month
  yes probably
  cant remember tru ever having anything good on bf or at least more than 2 things they always had unbeatable deals on skylanders though then the shark bite ship for 30 other than that it was what they had every other week that was great    5 toybiz ml apocalypse/onslaught  10 leader class tfanimated toys  bogo 50 off lego were more constant then  b1g1f off all action figures before last years black friday
  and what would be wrong if he did fuck you
  i dont understand why people are so obsessed with a store is this the same thing that leads to all these shitty brand loyalty wars that people like subjectanon creates its a fucking store do your shopping somewhere else
  youre so fucking stupid it must hurt
  please explain this juvenile attachment to a buisness for me then
i worked and then i came home and went to bed
        if you need it explained to you then you are either a husk of a human or a literal robot
i very much noticed that tru big book of toys not being in the thanksgiving day paper for the first time ever
  legit had not even bothered with that over priced filthy hell hole of a store since mp10 came out    it died for a reason
why do people here hate tru and why is 2 considered overpriced enough to complain
  so nostalgia
geoffreys toy box in the fredmeyers near me have the signs ripped from the ends of the cheap cardboard shelves stocked with 7 cheap generic nonbrand junk toys in some sort of debranding effort  the toyrus reboot apparently has failed
  i was actually hoping the toy boxs idea would rebrand the fred meyer toy section with colorful tru graphics what a retard i am
it hurt actually the toys r us near me hasnt been repurposed or stripped down so it still has the signage up had to go by it a few times on friday had to buy all my shit at target and meijer
  step out of your basement for once and youll understand that tru was one of the few places that carried a ton of toylines /toy/ collected in a single store most people like seeing what a toy looks like before deciding to purchase it which leads to less buyers remorse this prevents delusional fanboys like yourself who need to pretend a toy is better than it actually is    tru was such a big store it could fully support a toyline and toy companys success  with trus demise its left a ton of toylines without any outlet to be released in go see the megabloks thread to see them constantly worried that the line is dead because theres very little to be found in stores and online various waves that were announced havent been released    tldr youre a whiny shut in without a clue
  kroger has toys i thought it was just grocery
  or shit romney oh wait you already said robot
  because theyre poor as dirt and bad at math
  i liked working there also its sad to see american businesses shit the bed
    most newer kroger stores are kind of like classier smaller meijer or walmart stores now
  how was your first black friday without toys r us  we still have tru in south africa
  the one near me has a jewelry store not a lot of toys though theyre trying to break into the home goods and clothing business
maybe if you manchildren spent more money and scalped less your dumb babby store wouldnt have gone under 
the shit fucking sucks man i miss tru
  glad its dead    shit operation from top to bottom
  we never had toys r us nor black friday where i live so the same as every year i guess
  im perplexed there are buildings in africa like with bricks and paint i thought they lived in small communities in the wild hunting copulating and making rituals
  that wouldnt have stopped romney form buying it up to unload his personal debt onto them so he could walk away a rich man as he did with kb    but please tell me that a toy brand that took up 1 of store shelf space killed the chain because wimmin  black people
better than ever found some halo rc cars for 15 at 99 cent store for my gfs nephews
  also disney killed toys r us with star wars
  you are the stupidest mother fucker on all of 4chan you that
   ahh skylanders my brother was 5 when it came out i was in change of christmas shopping and i went to black friday at toys r us just because i never had the skylanders starters were on sale and they were flying off the shelf like crazy i grabbed one because it was the last one left he loved that game for years it was the first video game he ever finished
  youre the biggest moron here if you think he was being serious holy shit
  black friday has never been this literal
  kroger is awesome for hot wheels apparently      fucking kek
  as a former tru employee that worked in a midlow income neighborhood i dont miss the fat smelly niggers and the stupid spics that cant speak english at 5am on a cold dark morning
  that looks like your typical tru in the depths of hell known as chicago
  as a russian toy collector its weird to see americans being sad about some greedy ass store overfilled with shitty star wars toys died it even had classic dumb looking mascot that often getting laugheat at in modern tvshows when they mock guy in cartoon animal suit with googley eyes sells crap to you stuff     tells a lot about your mentality and culture
  well maybe if you elected him instead of obama he wouldnt have had all that free time to fuck up toy stores so its your fault if you think about it
  im stuck with ralphs i saw one fred meyer a couple years ago and was impressed with what i saw
  didnt even notice tru was nothing but an emporium of employee / ebay sniper opportunity
  go eat potato vlad
  greedy  im sorry you cant afford 2 more american dollars back to the borscht mines with you comrade
  chill out fatso
  oh i can afford my toys amerifat not to mention being russian means im also paying for shipping that average american cant afford  you crying over shitty store with dumbass looking mascot is fucking pathetic
  its better because you have to pay shipping while we just go to a store and pay for just the toy
crush everyones collective childhood by running tru into the ground and forcing bankruptcy on it  fire all employees and dont give them severance because dude chapter 7 lol  make the stocks of toy companies plummet as well as fuck them up because tru was their major retailer  months later  dude we can totally pop up back again lol  liquidating assets was just a prank bro    the more it unfolds the more it gets suspicious    im happy the brand isnt entirely gone but i doubt i can really trust it enough to give it my money
  lol poorfag rooski off to the gulag with you
    hey man when i was 8 years old back in 91 two saturdays a month my dad would take me and i was given 25 and let loose at toys r us for 2 hours by myself    of course looking back im 99 sure it was because he was cheating on my mom banging some slut at the motel across the way but hey we would go to pizza hut afterwards so good times good memories
  fucking this   tru used to raise the price on most dolls and figures i wanted a few months leading up to black friday than theyd lower them back just slightly below what they normally cost all year round with their black friday sale     20 barbie doll   goes up to 2399 in september  goes up to 2699 in october   goes up to 2899 in november   they place a 30 door buster black friday sale sticker above it on black friday  end up pay 20 for the doll  two months after the new year the doll gets lowered back to its normal 20 price point   they do this crap every year   fuck tru
  fuck off with your triggered sjw ass
  the stock drops are the fault of the toy companies they willingly allowed tru to buy toys on credit despite tru having cash flow problems they pissed away hundreds of millions in free merchandise     some of the investors were not happy about that bullshit during the hasbro call
  reminds me of what happened to blockbuster    blockbuster video used to be owned by a jew owned company named viacom  viacom are moneygrubbing whores  viacom buys all of blockbusters rentals and merch with loans instead of profits  every year use profit to pay off loans take out new loans to buy new merchandise  blockbuster decides to split from viacom because they are tyrants  viacom takes all of blockbusters profits from that year but does not pay off the loans  the loans were taken out under blockbusters name not viacoms so the loans technically belong to blockbuster  viacom does not tell this to blockbuster corporate  when blockbuster finds out there is already a shit ton of interest and viacom has all of their profits  desperately try every quarter to pay off loans  1 mil loan becomes 3 mil then 5 mil finally tens of millions of dollars are owed  go chapter 11 file for bankruptcy  dish network buys blockbuster video because they want to use the iconic blockbuster video logo to sell tv subscriptions plus wants brick and mortar stores to sell tv subscriptions  closes unprofitable stores that were still around after chapter 11 closings  has 300 locations left  all are profitable  blockbuster is profitable as a whole again especially in the north east  fast forward 2 years to 2013  dish decides to go exclusively to streaming  considers selling bbv  no fewer than 3 companies are interested in buying  but dish wants to keep blockbuster logo for streaming service cant do that if they sell the company  decide to liquidate stores put 3000 people out of work all over the rights to a logo  tell employees they are being laid off after telling the news networks    blockbusters problem was it was owned by two shitty corporations
toys r us is still alive and well in canada bitch   pours maple syrup on nipples
  what the fuck who do they think theyre fooling trying to use blockbuster to become synonymous with streaming
  good point im actually visiting family in british columbia over the holidays so i might be able to pick up some neat stuff
  i worked at tru in my early 20s fuck ever going there on black friday after i quit    actually i did go there one time because friends wanted to go fuck that
  dood what are you doing this tread for stupid ameritard kids i mean look at this ugly autistic mascot have some pity for those brainlets  also shipping prices killing me too sucks to live in third world country
  i elected obama to punish him for murdering kb hell die knowing he failed not once but twice to win the presidency because america didnt want him
first of all if you dont like mezco doll clothing then fair enough still im curious for peoples thoughts on the two designs from anyone whos into the line while it has come out yet the upcoming sovereign knight looks like a great modern batman along the lines of the arkham games or new 52 and you even get the choice of short/long bat ears that said as an original design i find the ascending knight more impressionable with the homemade laced boots and short gloves along with the 1st appearancestyle cowl plus that young bruce wayne sculpt is perfect    so thoughts on the design and accessories also which one do you prefer between the two
their only good batman is the dkr bats
im waiting for my px this might be my first mezco still thinking if i should get dredd and lawmaster im honestly still unsure if i like mezco or not what is /toys/ general consensus on mezco and this specific batman figure
  speaking of is the mezco the best version of the dkr batman what is the best alternative
  liking the disgusting miller brick design
  the sovereign knight doesnt have a clear superior version for me like the ascending knight did i dont like the stitching on the normal release and i think the emblem on the px is a tad too big but both look good enough for me to get
  nothing if you missed out you are fucked
  i really only have plans on buying horror 112 but ascending knight has been tempting me forever its just a gorgeous design thats part burton and part year one i would have bought it if catwoman wasnt so lack luster
  its just a gorgeous design thats part burton and part year one  i was thinking the same thing really gave me that vibe of year one as well    i would have bought it if catwoman wasnt so lack luster  incidentally i have similar issue except its with the sovereign knight batman wherein id feel more comfortable ordering the figure if catwoman didnt turn out to be a lackluster release
  if they ever decide to do 1989 or 1992 batman ill be all over it
  they sorta did with the yellow belt variant
    i have ascending knight its one of the best mezcos imo
mezcos in general are pretty solid but i wish they were more comic accurate their movie figures are generally disappointing because they cant get proper movie accuracy at that scale sometimes its ok bvs batman still works as a cool generic batman figure but next to a hot toys its very apparent how much they missed the mark for the comic inspired designs the lines and panelling they add always ends up hurting the look of the figure everything ends up looking much cheaper and toylike and misses the point of making it look realistic space ghost and captain marvelshazam are two of my favorite releases from them    if ascending had the headsculpts and gauntlets of the sovereign releases itd be much better in fact im tempted to get a spare ascending and give him a sovereign head boots and gauntlets      im excited for this release because im a sucker for the yellow oval but they made it just slightly too big the oval works vest when its smaller
  theres a image of the sk with the px suit and regular release emblem from the conventions speculation is either exclusive or update to the regular release i hope the latter
  there was an early prototype of the keaton figure that has been all but buried
u noe
  i dont want the mezco i want to know what the best alt is and also if the mezco is really the best version
  this
anyone have mezco ash is he good
i have about 20 different mezco figures i bought the dkr batman on release and have been addicted since i have the original armored and knightmare batman from bvs i really liked the designs from that movie i dont have any of their original designs the black and yellow ascending knight is cool but its expensive the blue sovereign knight could be a good standing for hush batman with the purple catwoman ill have to see what he looks like when he releases i do generally wish they stuck closer to he comics
anyone see this guy yet looks pretty sweet
  goes up at 1pm on a monday  of course a toy i want goes up when im working to make money to buy toys
  im jsut waiting for number 3
  the only good ones are ones that try to emulate the comics     their first original batman design was crap and the second one is better but the more comic oriented variants destroy it
  scalpers are going to be botting this shit hard therell be people buying a dozen plus of these
  id argue most everything they have produced has been good to great    the biggest miss was the comic superman especially when you look at the red son figure    darkseid and hulk are going to be the interesting ones to see how they actually turn our and if mezco will finally produce a batmobile
  luckily they reduced the limit from 6 to 2 on preorders not the perfect solution but it makes things a bit more difficult
  luckily they reduced the limit from 6 to 2 on preorders  this hasnt meant jack shit i still see people ordering huge amounts of these from them and mezco still ships them all to the same address their system is bad
  the biggest miss was the comic superman  he was so bad they advertised him with heavily photoshopped pictures that made him look like he had better body proportions     people were telling him that figure looked bad from day 1 they delayed it a long time and changed nothing
  address restriction would be notably better mezco seems to be chaotic with the amount of delays and feedback on the service side for ordering other things    the customer base has undoubtedly outpaced and outgrown what mezco predicted which is probably why we are seeing so many issues and lessthanoptimal solutions
  they 100 have been aware that demand outstrips production since almost the beginning    they choose to do this as they want the products to be seen as serious collectors only things that hold value which is also part of why they  a dont to rereleases  b keep making iconic variants as low production exclusives    they make less of some of their figures than guys making garage kits in their literal garage do its intentional and its stupid
i myself am not a fan of mezco since i do not believe the price is justified for the lack of articulation they do have nice accessories and some of the figures look amazing with cloth i just feel that the cloth limits articulation way to much and they do not look that much better than a 2050 dollar figure     though if you are dead set on mezco batman not including the dkr i would say i prefer the look of ascending knight but the accessories of sovereign they knew what they were doing
whoa mama
  that thing is fugly px is still best version
  i like the black/gold because of how close it looks to the 89 suit but im still going to pick up the px version i dont know why they didnt do the same armor design on the normal black/gray version it looks so much better
  only made 400 of these  mezco is fucking retarded
  its now waitlisted after 20 min but at least i got mine in lets goooo
  ordered 2 of them  not even going to scalp the second one
  just by being the only one without those tacticool garbage details makes it the best by default
  where does it say its 400
    i think the only site exclusive figures they limited to 400 are classic punisher and maybe purple catwoman limiting classic punisher to 400 is still mind boggling
  when exclusives go up people add a huge number to the cart and it gives an error message that reveals how many were left and people extrapolate from that     later when cases are shown they compare the numbers and they always match     people on the facebook mezco groups say it was a 400 piece run
  ah figured it was the update cart method
  yeah i love him hes a much better action figure than the neca releases but with only 2 head sculpts it kinda leaves a bit to be desired like a cocky smile or a scared face would make it the ultimate ash figure
  limiting classic punisher to 400 is still mind boggling    it was an early release and i dont think mezco grasps how much people like the classic looks
  they are still doing that shit    they keep making iconic looks exclusive and doing really small runs     they know exactly how much people wanted more punishers and they still made the new one that looks a lot like the classic look a con exclusive with a low run this year
  to be fair it wasnt that low a run which has btfo of scalpers who have to resell it at 140 now i mean still fucked up and it sold out in seconds but still the market corrected that mistake
  last year they had the classic comics red skull at a run of just 504    there are even general release figures they only made 2000 of
  apparently theres an image floating around of the regular release with the same armor look as the rest someone mentioned it in this thread
  the px has the same armored type sculpting on it but for some reason the chest emblem looks fucking huge on it
  thats sort of a running problem with mezco stuff proportions on costume aspects are all out of wack emblems look either too smallcaptain america superman or weirdly hugepx/onyx sovereign
  that looks so much better than both regular and px releases wtf
  but they do do rereleases  there are waiting lists which do pay out months after shit has sold out   this seems fairly normal because they would hold off from making a rerelease until they get enough orders to cover expenses if people arent joining the waiting list they shouldnt complain    their variants are another way to do a rerelease like the sdcc exclusive punisher which i think is far better than doing a rerelease its a cool redesign which is a minor redeco of a previous release and you also get more designs if you didnt like the previous one
  there are waiting lists which do pay out months after shit has sold out  waiting lists arent in any way the same thing as a rerelease wait lists are literally just redistribution of excess and returned stock which is why theres literally zero guarantee a waitlist will be filled you can get on the wait list for some of these ten minutes after it goes to wait list and get nothing ever     they dont go back and order more to be produced     their variants are another way to do a rerelease    you shouldnt need people to explain to you why a variant and a rerelease are different
  not that guy and this is 100 unrelated but do you consider the shf frieza that came out this year a rerelease or a variant
  he has some resculpted pieces different paint and some different accessories so hes a definitely not a rerelease
  so a variant is something that comes out at relatively the same time and is mostly the same as the thing it is a variant of whereas a rerelease is something that comes out much later and is identical or nearly identical to the first release
  a variant in a mezco case is something like these two punishers same character some accessory overlap but otherwise distinctly unique     a rerelease is literally in its name its the same thing released again as it was before the same way rereleases are listed literally everywhere else in the market
  no theyre not they know exactly what theyre doing its scummy as fuck but its smart      they knew exactly how much demand there was for classic punisher the buzz around the prototype was huge most forums were filled with comments from prospective mezco buyers saying that was the figure they were looking forward to the most delaying the figure and drastically artificially limiting its availability was a pr move pure and simple they knew it would go stratospheric on the aftermarket some collectors are paying nearly 1000 for that figure at this point they know by repeating that strategy every so often people who see insane aftermarket prices on classic punisher black ascending knight etc will jump on preorders for all their upcoming regular releases due to fear of missing out
  they pull low wuantity shit on some regular releases a lot of them theres nothing smart about leaving money on the table or pursuing strategy that might pay off briefly before crashing your market
if you missed out on todays onyx exclusive fear not a proper one12 1989 keaton batman is coming next year for the 30th anniversary its been in the works for years and it looks amazing ive seen the prototype it blows the neca and hot toys versions away    id also recommend saving your money up now if youre interested in the 89 batmobile   
    im not saying that variants are the same thing but theyre so close enough to the original release that it does fill in demand and are sometimes practically interchangable    as for the waiting list i dont think its returned stock or anything like that because shit has gone sold out for months and months in practically every store and those that you can find are going for rape prices on ebay   its happened with dkr batman punisher and joker not sure about the rest because i didnt follow them closely and were in stock for months after being released
  it blows the  hot toys versions away      unlikely that said even owning the hot toys batmobile id still double dip on a 112 version
  i dont think its returned stock or anything like that  mezco directly tells you on their site that waitlists are things like cancelled items non paid/declined payment items etc    its not a second production run the reason shit takes them a long time to fill is probably the same reason everything takes them longer than is reasonable the company is fucking inefficient as shit     they charged for shit almost 3 weeks ago they still havent shipped delays are a norm for them slow response is a norm for them
  this is the closest we are going to get to the keaton batman they said they were going to make
  
  strange i havent seen this variant before its essentially just the previews one but with the bat symbol from the regular
im hoping mezco doesnt go bust before they release john wick
that mezco you let get away    whats her name /toy/
  lacc iron man but im not that broken up over it since most of my other iron men are shf
  im beginning to doubt that this is a variant and they just redid the regular release this matches ascending knights suit more
  sdcc wolverine i will forever be mad i missed out on the tiger stripe costume at least the xforce one is good too
  god damn that looks hideous more over designed garbage
  go back to playing with your mego figures
overpriced chunky boys in doll clothes with dkr being the exception hes supposed to be a chunky boy
  yeah i want daredevil immma just get it i think
  how about a source there buddy
  i believe you are correct the likely redid the regular release
  even with all of the problems the body has i still regret not preordering their catwoman variant when i had the chance the figure itself looks mediocre but i love catwoman and ive always had a soft spot for the purple costume i got into the wait list pretty early so maybe ill be able to grab one eventually
  i wish it came with a green cape
  brother    im in the same boat even owning the ht and the revoid love something between the two with some some more paint and gimmicks that mattels ultimate release go justice league its still great but less rc gimmicks and better paint apps would have made it a much better collectors piece    even assuming the 30th anniversary thing is true theyve been 0 for 2 on batmobiles and its been early 7 months since they showed off their batmobile with gordon    who knows maybe hot toys will have a a rerelease of dx09 as well shit could get crazy
s1 daredevil went up today but it seems pretty barebones especially compared to their batman and punusher figures 80 for one alternate head two sticks and some hands
  the sour grapes over onyx knight are making people buy this waste of money its unreal how people are defending this awful release
  damn they should have included extra hands and slideover wrist pieces for the hand wrappings/ropes while im still keen for it i hope one of these companies tackle his season 3 suit since i liked the slight adjustments to the costume eg addition of white parts to the mask red undershirt and actual muay thai ropes
  theres at least 3 months to bitch about the lack of accessories on social media and encourage a delay so they can redo packaging tooling and make the new parts
  theres no time to do remolds and production on new pieces
did anyone pre order popeye wasnt he supposed to come out this month
  you really think mezco would put out a figure without a few months of delays
if mezco sets a release date as novjan    whats the typical time frame for mezco within that window  can i expect an item to ship early in that window or is mezco usually slower in that regard
  march
  i bought one on ebay for 100 thriugh the best offer system when they first sold out people were paying too much because they were overhyped now she is going for about 120 you might be able to find a good deal and keep your eyes open for coupons
  lol kinda figured lookin at past conversations about the company
  had the chance to get frank at non rape price when it came out and now i regret it
  im so sorry anon i managed to get the regular and spec ops releases at retail i only wish i got the px version because i need a good coat and pistol holster for my regular frank
when the fuck is the netflix punisher coming out
are mezco ragnarok figures ever coming out
  no those things were slated for july its been 6 months and not even a word
  hes out in hong kongtheirs pics on facebook he looks awesome
fu king mezco and their delays i have 3 pos apparently coming out this morning that from them popeye logan and ascending knight what are the chances logan and batman get delayed to save my wallet some money this month
  fuck logans supposed to drop too  im almost at a point where i want to cancel that one because i just dont give a fuck about the glut of wolverines batmen and punishers theyve made    they really need to branch out a bit more with their character choices from the big 2 and maybe look at licensing some indie names that would popular enougheven if they just remade the entire run of legendary comic book heroes mezco doing marv from sin city savage dragon madmaneven the tick would sell through enough for one of their smallmedium runs
  well youre in luck because theyre releasing literallywho diabolik next
  diabolik  65 figure at most  80 w/20 nrd  15 shipping  no thanks
  but this is what you wanted
  mezco doing marv from sin city    i would buy this in a heartbeat    theres honestly so much potential with this line that its frustrating they stick mainly to capes id kill for a mezco neo from the matrix or a mezco marty mcfly
hahaha mezco charged people for purple catwoman then didnt ship shit for a month and today sent out notices that they wont ship now until march because of damage from international shipping which is obviously just them trying to cover up for their qc nightmare     oh cherry on top no full refunds store credit only     they just took everyones money and ran
  literallywho   diabolik    casual trash    actually not even casual just dumb and/or ignorant
  diabolik is niche as hell outside of europe
/co/mrade here did any of you ever buy the treasure gaust catcha beast in the west i remember when these were unveiled they looked really fascinating at the time but it seems like their popularity fizzled out pretty fast it would be cool if there were still online communities dedicated to it
    wow didnt realize it was cg anime also    growing up in china  me and bro at chinese mall  see tv with commercial of this series next to product on display  some sort of convention full of children is show with the children doing this    
  where i live it was marketed as catcha beast and the anime was never translated but yeah the concept is awesome but i always found that it didnt work very well     it should make a return though especially with how popular conceptually similar stuff has become pokemon go is kinda similar when you think about it something interactive like this with a better lcd would be insane
  i have one of these they released them here in britbong land but i got mine a few years after they died out after a sealed one showed up in a charity shop i worked at its really fun you had to spin around to aim for the monsters then reel them in and then you could battle them reminded me a lot skannerz
  i have the strap gunner and the gearlet hunter and both are pretty fun games especially the strap gunner nothing says fishing like shooting the fish with a gun
  i never realized treasure gaust had any sort of release outside of japan
wow i had this
  i have fun its like fishing and kinda embarrassing to play in public since you gotta spin around  mine is the blue one also i worry the reel might break
bandai has a new toy called bakutsuri bar hunter thats a mix of barcode battlers and this
  bakutsuri bar hunter  wow just looked this up very cool but cant find anything on a 2ds version of it they seem to only do it for the regular 3ds model i dont have a japanese 3ds    i was thinking of making a subreddit for this niche as it may be the amount of information about treasure gaust as a whole on the internet is startlingly lacking
  the 2ds userbase in japan is too small for bandai to justify that    if kids werent shown to not care about phone toys id say the game would be better off as a phone thing certainly would make it less unlikely to get a localization
  just made a subreddit for this feel free to post stuff ask questions etc there 
 i have the commander one and itd be nice to get my friends into it but on amazon its 225 and ebay had a few cheap
talk about transformers did you get any deals on black friday    previous thread  
  no nothing of interest was on sale
  i got abominus off hts and shattered glass mp10 off bbts
  hasbro had a sale on ebay so i got studio series starscream    nospoilersits the first transformer ive gotten in 15 years/nospoilers
what a manlet
  hes a good figure
  really wish i had gotten the movie best deluxe one i like chickenscream but want a tiny good version hopefully february will have us seeing a toy of this guy if not before
  i have both and i prefer the ss it feels like a better size for that design
anyone have gun suggestions for lg kup that arent the generations kup rifle and the hasbro tr guns im giving the targetmaster to another figure
  pick up potp predaking for 99 gonna pick up the the dna upgrade kit too
  nothing didnt see anything interesting probably didnt look hard enough
  q arcee/lockdown are the only ones i really was interested in
  look closer it absolutely is the same guy made a knight optimus out of tsubasa dont have that picture saved though
  thats not a deal you got ripped off for 99
how good is t30 chromia should i get her or wait for the siege one
attentiondropkicks face may fall off if you try to pop the head off so be careful whether this is an isolated case remains to be seen
  the backpack is kinda shit but its still better than the siege one
  shes ok doesnt really have any issues but some areas might break with time mostly the front whee since it uses clear plastic on a very thin piece that you need to move to transform
  its still better than the siege one  dont you think its a bit early to judge    that doesnt sound reassuring at all  is it worth the risk for 14
  dont you think its a bit early to judge  just look at the convention pics
  well you could transform the figure without moving the front wheel but its going to look awkward with the wheel sticking out far back and you can negate the breakage danger by grabbing the extension thats connected to the wheel instead of the wheel or the thing clear piece
  the siege one seems to have less articulation in some pics and the greebles are as bad or worse than starscreams
i was shot through the heart and your to blame
  shes alright her skirt flap can get on the way but just move it other than her back kibble she looks better than the siege version unless you preffer the extra gribble
  by less i meant related to the moonracer version sorry for the confusion
  which jetfire is this 
  you give love a bad name
  i think i see your point    yeah that sounds safer  i have been interested in getting a proper female transformer and shes cheap
  surely you can find a rid windblade shelfwarming somewhere
  he cant be that bad for that price the combined mode anyway
  but some areas might break with time mostly the front whee since it uses clear plastic on a very thin piece that you need to move to transform  gonna say you dont own one i got mine back then when they were released and havent had any issues with the clear plastic it is sturdy af  dont be afraid about it
  i own one but i never take chances with thin clear pieces
  nope i got every rid shelfwarmer in the store except for strongarm and there was no windblade in sight    that is reassuring thanks anon
  the combined mode is maybe worth 50 purely because of its size and assuming all its ratchets work
  nope i got every rid shelfwarmer in the store except for strongarm and there was no windblade in sight    especially now i dont know about other places but in north ca that shits gone forever replaced with cyberverse
  yeah and cyberverse windblade is shit at least the warrior one the scout is a cute actionmaster  and i could find a way to shove the legs so it looks at least decent
  cut the legs off
  mine doesnt seem to transform quite right but it might just be a qa thing i lucked out on the arms are the trouble spot i find
  yeah i popped them off and it looks good but it feels like cheating    whats the issue
  the scout is a cute actionmaster  true my favorite windblade would be the headmaster has the cutter face
  how good is that one the only one im interested in getting is the combiner force one
  not that great the face is really good but the proportions are weird lacks a waist swivel and wrist joints the other version have one or the other    the other issue is that the hasbro is expensive since it never showed up anywhere and while the takara is still easy to track down its still 30 bucks on the plus side you get a targetmaster and a normal windblade sword instead of the trs weird sword thing
  no he hasnt stop being such a npc on predaking its a perfectly good toy even if you genuinely dont like it its not remotely bad maybe its not great depending on what qualities you value and its certainly not perfect but its not bad at all
  is the rid one good since the combiner force is a minor retool it shouldnt change much
  the combiner force one is a straight repaint its probably the best windblade mold the jet mold is the cleanestlooking and the robot mode looks like an actual fembot not a tranny plus theres like 4 color schemes you can choose from including the cf one
  i hear it has problems standing but is fine otherwise   besides the paint problem anyway
  the cf colors look the best for me  and i did find one for a semi decent price    because of loose hips or tiny feet
  i really like it myself and i never owned the primearcee original dont know if that factors into anything    my only complaint is how ridiculously easy it is to get the white paint on her head scratched off due to her transformation    also could never find a decent ironhide to stand with her people told me to avoid universe ironhide and all my efforts to make the cw ironhide good flopped horribly siege ironhide might be the one but very much on the fence about replacing t30 chromia with siege chromia
  a thing may happen that you dont want if you do a thing you shouldnt do  thanks for the info
    i dont see any issues with the rid one standing it was the generations version that had problems with that and the rid one actually fixed it by simplifying the feet transformation
  other than the lack of waist she has no issues
/tgf/ are you excited for my inevitable toy during the wfc trilogy
  fuck off you miserable mary sue
  if they include the correct weapon for her then yeah maybe
  murderpirme got him
  and she looks far better than the other 2 especially that first one  that face is hideous
  sure can we finally have another slipstream repaint
  movie the best was the rotf voyager youre probably thinking of the dotm deluxe which the ss was reverseengineered from
  especially that first one that face is hideous  yeah the takara version had better face deco but the mold isnt that good anyway
  it looks like its breaking apart or its a granny
  im sorry you spent so much on him but predaking is dog shit
still waiting
  already cancelled my preorder
  thats why the chinese sites require nonrefundable deposits for preorders
  back wheels dont stick together at all the arms dont want to fit under the thing i dont know nothing really tabs in right i think it was qa but hell maybe i just cant figure it out but im pretty sure theres just stuff not fitting together right the instructions are pretty lousy too but thats hasbro for you
  go to store  see the limbs  no core  go to another store  see core  no limbs  my tism makes me want to buy them all at once
  the bbts listing had october as release date
  you got qc hell sorry for your loss  the instructions are pretty lousy too  i still wonder how can hasbro be so shit at telling you how to transform their toys they constantly forget steps extra features or even in some cases following the instructions will lead to you breaking something
  mines exactly the same as yours but last time i brought it up here i was told i was in the minority   maybe we both just have shit luck when it comes to this toy
  84th of october is still october
  new color photos were recently released so it should be arriving soon      another one of those the head is the wrong color types huh
  oh sweet
  the head is the wrong color types huh  nah just tired of waiting ill get it whenever it gets released
  i wish we had an answer about wether or not this can still use cutthroat as a leg because it feels like those popon faux dragon heads wont let that happen
    good god i didnt think people would care about this line but here we are   i just wish the effect parts could be their own thing instead of bundled with their respective figures
  good god i didnt think people would care about this line    why
  why almost everything looks good theres no forced gimmick ankle articulation is standard and most figures hide their hollow bits
siege is the first line ive been interested in collecting since i bought the uw aerialbots
  is dropkick as bad as he looks
  good god i didnt think people would care about this line but here we are  what did he mean by this
  they really shouldve colored the thighs
  he thought siege would be a big failure because it doesnt appeal to his tastes therefore nobody else would like it either
  i have him at home and paid 300 dollarydoos for the privilege    pretty good toy
hi guys i want to buy the biggest transformer i can get for my sons birthday hes turning 4 his favourite transformers are optimus bumblebee grimlock and sideswipe something like 50cm tall any suggestions tia
  antilinkfags btfo  idwcucks btfo  bayfags  bumblcucks btfo  based and redpilled
  chomp and stomp grimlock hes huge can transform in only one step and you can find him cheap online 
  anon you can like the toy all you want we cant fix your shit taste but that doesnt mean that predaking is in any way worth its asking price  300  even when it was new it didnt cost that much please tell me your baiting  not that retarded if not why did you overpay when there are much better 3rd party options of predaking for the same price
  whoa thats cool as fuck thanks
  i think he was thinking of the movie advanced one i always get them mixed up too
that predaking shitposting reminded me is it any good  i like the predacons but most third party predacons either look like shit in one mode or straight up dont have the proportions and weight distribution to pose worth a shit potp only looks slightly spindly and the leg guys have huge backpacks
  its probably the most playable one mmc is the edgelord brick tfc is the unstable one ut is that one that scales with cw combiners
  i have him at home and paid 300 dollarydoos for the privilege  why are you bragging about having brain damage
extreme sticker drift  
  deja vu ive seen crooked stickers before  shitty quality is what you can expect from hasbro
  how many cogs do you need for this
  i do like the figure it got some problem but consider the way it transforms and a near perfect vechile mode i say it is decent if not a clearance pick up figure    as for the new line the deluxes and the smaller scale figures are perfect but as good as the new op is it got some problem here and there and they add up and feel it could be better in terms of the qc and i am really digging into the gundam style body propotion
  i cant imagine trying to brag about buying a toy for double price let alone a titan figure let alone the shittiest of them i can only conclude youre underage or living off neetbucks
      i was looking forward to him at first particularly for the excellent looking alt mode but the more ive seen of him specifically the hideous face id have to headwap out and the terrible forearms im not gonna go out of my way for him    if i can find him for sub 15 in a month or so maybe
  he is christian
  im excited for this also excited for the improved knock offs
i got tired of waiting for takara to announce a leozack repaint of poop starscream so i went ahead to get one for my leftover liokaiser limbs i supposed poop starscreams not bad as a combiner torso its relatively stable     oh boy i sure hope takatomy dont announce a leozack heavy retool that fixes everything about the poop mold and even combines with a jallguar
  a leozack heavy retool that fixes everything about the poop mold and even combines with a jallguar  i dont think it could do both if leozack is a retool of starscream then they might include a legends class jallguar maybe a retool of beachcomber as a non combining partner alternately they could make completely new deluxe class leozack and jallguar that combine into the torso i think the first is more likely but i hope for either
    that gay box art
  if takara decides to tackle liokaiser i would hope they modify killbison and drillhorn as well they could retool killbisons turret into an antiair turret and just use the uw nosecone mold for drillhorn
  some idolfag could make a functioning liokaiser in his basement with the change left after whaling aikatsu mobage  with deathcobra as an optional limb  hastak couldnt
i cannot for the life of me figure out why jazz wont fit together right
  me neither   im glad i sold him before the hype died down
  i didnt think people would want shitty drybrushing on their toys   like why would you want some halfassed battledabage to justify the price/size of the figure   it just looked foolish to me
  wait what what does the paint job have to do with the size of he figures
someone post a pic t30 starscream with the sword from the titans return optimus mold  i need some help to get myself hyped to finally buy black convoy
  yeah but he used hotspot for jaruga jaruga the buggy that should be the smaller on the team as a voyager
  i remember he managed to make it only slightly taller than the average cw deluxe but i cant find the picture now
  theres a tab that goes into his butt that you gotta align just right
  just mistransformed the knees still impresive he has done accurate ginrai doubledealer raiden and powermasters too 
  well shit thanks anon that did it
  mistransformed  thats the actual transformation for the knees
  nothing you just cant understand context   the drybrushing couldve been omitted altogether to allow for more plastic or better paint apps to me battledamage isnt something you can halfass without looking awful  just for future reference size isnt the problem its an observable fact justified by oil prices and market research gauging how much a consumer will spend for a toy
  waist is flimsy combined beware breaks     beast modes are not very good bot modes are pretty good but have the usual hollow parts and sticker issues to modern tfs     all in all the potp predaking is basically g1 predaking with a far superior combined mode and ball/socket joints has a lot of the same problems and a lot of the same strengths also lacks a sword but the plastic is more durable     3p ones are better on the shelf but for play are not as good
  context is difficult to suss without coherence work on that
why are decepticon combiners given so much fanfare  devastator release is an event high pricetag  predaking is given the only way to complete the series gimmick and given special releases and at a high pricetag    autobot combiners are all single release redshirts sharing sculpts with starscream or onslaught
  theyre usually the most populars but the autobot side got the most stable pair computron and superion
shoulders so shit they cant hold its gun  how would you have done the shoulders
    because all g1 autobot combiners were scramble citytypes except for raiden but he never came out in the usa    devastator and predaking were special
  when is he out
  buy mpm bee for cheap and love him but said i would call it quits for this line here   end up buying mpm barricade because i thought bee should have something fitting paired up with him  now i want this big bastard   fucking hell i fell into this trap ill probably end up with the entire 2007 cast at this point
  because superion is the only cool autobot combiner
    superion is pretty forgetable imo they all are white and red or black jets     at least defensor you can tell them apart more     hell id argue computron is my fav autobot combiner
can she save the transformers brand anons
  i dont get it   also arcee was insulting to trannies so i call bullshit on that post
  superion is pretty forgetable imo they all are white and red or black jets    hes great if you are into color coordinated squads the combiner also gets some symmetry
hasbro never made an eject from rewind  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  i really need to get him again
  isnt silverbolt incredibly fragile though
  not really his hips can get shitty ratchets but that doesnt affect torso mode
  according to tfwiki the superion head can snap off really easily during transformation
  nice dubs but this has bot been my experience sounds like someone is pulling on the very end of the head panel rather than sensibly moving it near the pin
is she correct /tfg/
  maybe if you ham handle it i have silverbolt scattershot and betatron never had any issue with them getting stuck or having any stress marks
i got overlord some new hands so he can finally take some selfies with his shopkin buddies
  about arcee banging shortstack jetgirls with her feminine penis while spike is forced to watch hell yeah
  serious question rebel colonel overlord or branch devil zdian mecha overlord     whos the best
  as long as it isnt james roberts overlord it doesnt matter
  he needs longer forearms skyshadow fixed it getting better proportions
  so you want the one thats still gay for megatron but has botox lips too
  ahem
  maybe theyll get around to it we finally just got a frenzy from rumble
  isnt that black shadows head
  nah that one looks better pic related
    the cultured sadistic thug with luscious lips
are you ready for even gayer robots in 2019 youre gonna love the reboot
  based  redpilled
  inb4 the stupid tweets from that tranny that worked with barber get posted
  hello there
  dude made the horrorcons  literally the only guys i want updates of besides the triggercons and the sparkabots goddammit hastak
  honestly i will give the reboot a chance but as soon as it starts turning into gay robot drama im out
  dude made the horrorcons  twice he did a deluxe and voyager set
  well never see updates of   raiden  landcross  road caesar  star saber  victory leo  deathsaurus  dinoking/monstructor  blue bacchus  star convoy  sky garry  grandus  galaxy shuttle
  more like well get one every few waves spread out throughout years and years   i remember a greentext just like this that included duocons terrorcons etc a few years back i guess well never get them all at once in a single wave
  star saber  deathsaurus  nope
  road caesar  victory leo  deathsaurus  dinoking/monstructor    there are perfectly good 3p iterations miles better than anything hasbro could produce    star saber    he got a mp not too long ago
naw but i did get my hands on cybertron landmine and the new siege line looks fuckin great
  there are perfectly good 3p  id give you deathsaurus but the rest are pretty mediocre most over designed with stability issues or dont look at all like the characters theyre supposed to represent
  we are going to see them anon ya just gotta have some damn faith
  thats the icing on the cake  things like these make me wish hastak would be willing to employ skilled fans for their figures until i realize theyd probably fuck the poor guys up one way or the other
  anything is possible
   convoy  what size would you want that in
  leader im still holding out hope that the rumored leader optimus from siege is a star convoy update
  titan class but unironically
  i can see them saving him for after they do all the obvious figures that would be titan class   also a giant truck your other autobots could drive would be really funny in a kinda awesome sort of way
remember this is a general to discuss transformers toys report any movie or comic discussion that does not involve the toys also be nice to one another like in pic related we want to set an example on 4channel for the advertisers    feel free to post pics  reviews of your recent hauls    if you want a recommendation then remember to state your budget /or the character/what type of features are looking for in a toy    where to take movie/cartoon discussion    where to take comic discussion      or just use /m/    where to buy                feel free to suggest more places to buy  add to the list  your thoughts on them
ok anons assuming hasbro releases scorpnok after omega supreme theyll have done all the giant g1 guys that arent unicron a repaint of a previous titan primus technically theyre suppose to release skylynx since hes predakings rival and devastator got his but lets ignore that for now    what else can they release in this class that i havent already dismissed in the previous sentence
  they could make any of the sixpart combiners from anime g1 raiden landcross dinoking or liokaiser
  tidal wave and star convoy   star convoy really isnt even that big but neither was devastator so whatever a giant optimus looking guy might make normies consider it
  grandus
  animeexport if youre desperate to be first
  fuck off your first post here got deleted for a reason bot
  if its not a 1984 character its not happening
  its either really stupid armor parts like shockwave or a trailer for the voyager one    why is it so fucking hard to give us an optimus with a trailer
finally got around to opening this dude not bad so far it is very heavy which i like
  it might even be a repaint of seige ultra magnus or maybe the same inner robot with new armor bits
  i must have missed cog flywheels micromasters and ultra magnus in the first season of the cartoon not to mention all the obscure characters that got updates in the prime wars trilogy
  road ceaser from tfc is great dinoking/monstructor is iffy its very chug styled and kinda simple which is a downer victory leo also only has that weird zoids looking figure and could use a good one but is a great figure nonethless if you get the reissue
that too that reminds me that well never get a delta magnus despite him filling a nice hole in the leader slots by adding an easy repaint to a wave
im no anti3p zealot but this thing looks awful
  its also like a recolor of a 5 year old figure set made by a company that wasnt so good
  someone actually got this  fucking madman
  this  also    i wouldnt even be mad if in 2020 we get skylinx instead of scorponok but hell need a bit more than just himself to measure up  hes believable as two leader classes but i think hed need electronics to get that coveted 150 price point    either that or they package him with a minigrandus who acts as his landing pad
  please report any/all stress marks because im getting stressed just looking at that thing
  ive had mine since he released at canuck retail shoulda waited on those discount sales soundwave himself has developed zero stress marks the only stress mark ive seen so far is on ravage with the hinge his tail is attached on
  it always bothers me when i see a combiner that doesnt have the proportions to even move  whats even the point of combining then to puff up like a frog and wait for your enemies to run away
  ive owned this since tru in the us clearanced it for like 40 back in i think it was 2016 mine is finenone of his joints are honestly tight enough to cause a stress mark and the clear plastic isnt the same as the glossy plastic that toy windshields are made of its more rugged
just bought a grinder tell me i didnt make a mistake
got moonracer and ended up modifying her a bit to better suit my tastes
  the only mistake would be if you paid 200 for it instead of the 160 or 170 or whatever tfsource has it on sale for for cyber monday
  got it for 160 needed one to go with my mp10
so just got the optimus/orion pax 2 pack and  up to what point is reasonable to just suck bad qc up  cause these 2 have some issues that im not sure if it applies to the same set in general
  such as
  lets see loose hips on both of them  plastic defects such as scratches and burr on both wfc optimus vehicle mode doesnt seem to close up correctly even after checking  and the paint on orion pax bleeds into the back of the back part of the leg that makes the back of the truck mode  cant take pictures since my camera is refusing to focus
  that all sounds like normal every day things any chug figure has
  really up to this point i didnt knew bits of plastic hanging off were the norm  still a bit annoying when the scratch is on the panel that has the autobot symbol on it
  i got a titans return overlord that was covered in those little sprue tabs and had some slopped blue paint on his neck it happens
  so i lost qc lottery and should just suck it up  got it at least the scratch isnt on the symbol
  cant you return it to the store
  got it online wanted to see if that was worth a return
      yeah hasbro qc is just generally shit i havent bought a single tf in the last year that wasnt badly painted and/or didnt fit together right because theyre such cheap junk    you either learn to accept it and become an apologist cuck or you make the move to superior 3p tf
  hard to move to 3p when 80 is the standard  im not a hardcore collector i just want neat looking toys not masterpiece figures
  then be ready to keep your receipts and return figures over and over until you get one that isnt trash or just live with the defective figures you pay good money for and pretend thats okay     given time youll learn to enjoy taking goldners dick in every hole
  so this is why 3p elitists were told to fuck off
  3p products arent that much 70 sure but their are several around the 50 mark and 3p legends are anywhere from 1540
  hasbro is an sjwleaning company and has been pushing liberal ideas since the 80s anyone buying their toys knows this and does it anyway they also know the qc is universally shit its safe to say these addicts arent giving up their plastic crack anytime soon    30 for cheap plastic voyager siege prime with crap smear paint and nobody asked for this new alt mode  40 on ebay for mp10v g1 prime with die cast and many more accessories    they give us no real incentive to buy their shit anymore
    i hate thing  which explains why i am here stewing in my own juices hating thing  i thrive off my own anger  brilliant
after not buying any transformers since foc jazz i picked up the siege sideswipe and hes great i miss anything good in the past 6 years
  nope
  mp10 is ugly as fuck so who cares about the accessories they are but lipstick on a donkey
  battletrap and triggerhappy are neat
  itll only be as gay as the pushback against having females in the beginning given the fucking live action movie soft reboot will be having prominent fembots i dont think well get trannycee again     that being said i fully expect lug/anode to at least appear to check off the representation quota and blast off to be a creepy gay stalker since its the only way to keep interaction between combaticons not involving swindle interesting     i also really hope autobot megatron and supreme leader starscream with bumblebee and windblade shows up again in something i really liked those
  not that guy but what is your idea of a good prime figure
  mp10 is ugly as fuck    grate bate mait
  approved       im apparently in the minority of thinking most of generations is great
what characters do you most want to see get wfc figs who have not gotten a figure in the last ten years from any continuity any degree of obscurity
  you stoll have foc jazz i was wondering how tall it is beside siege sideswipe
  it really is once you start comparing it to better proportioned ops the head is too wide or short not sure which the torso and arms are too long and the lower legs down to the ankles were shortened up to compensate i generally like seeing tires on ops legs but they shouldve collapsed into the legs after extending the thigh otherwise it just accentuated how short that area was and the gun looked godawful and short because they forced in the storage gimmick it was a sidegrade to mp01 and all of the upcoming successors blow it away by correcting what it did wrong
  can she still transform like that
  didnt get any deals but i did find the starscream g1 at a backwood walmart
action robo fb page  oh my god    mp44 コンボイ ver30  2019年8月下旬  盛惠 50000 日元    genmontcracker toy photographer  i normally dont post news and information but i think this deserve some mention    for those who are waiting for takaratomy masterpiece mp convoy 30 pricing is out  approximately usd440    source action robo fb page    aaaand there goes any desire of mp optimus prime 30
  but it comes with a trailer that doubles as an onahole
  so did mp10 but im guessing your prime master too small to get anything out of it
  thats odd most people lost interest after we actually saw pictures of it
  fuck
  how the fucking fuck is mp36 half the price even when having that stupid toy gun tax thing
  for me i learnt from mp hotrodimus color helps thus im still uncertain though it is a step in the right direction for cartoon accuracy    increased complexity material cost theyll use the trailer as a damn hostage since its a new mold and what i suspect is a speaker box in his back so he can rap off with mp36 mp36 had that gun stock as well as its own engineering madness would have been cheaper if he was made in mp10s day and not a scratch magnet
  usd440
  the only reason i can fathom for that existing the way it does is to get rid of a overabundance of those plastics
  hi jobby
  i wouldve gotten that 3rd party if it came with a non translucent hand but no luck on the aftermarket got my shipping notice for the mp shockwave so im quite looking forward to that
  i bought him but never cracked him open ended up selling him for a profit mine was on clearance and bought the reissue of the hasbro version the regular ones are slightly heavier because of the solid plastics fyi    in my case i wanted a soundwave and got the cheapest one and regretted it    that and the g2 laser prime reissue weird way of celebrating the year of the goat
    whyd you guys get it the price not knocking your purchase but i just dont see why anyone would buy that
  barely unpainted plastic is a virgin thing  people cried about mp36 being painted let alone 36 being chromed  significant diecast use where it makes sense  all mps after the first 9 have had the correct amount shockwave has it in his feet mp01 was one of the worst offenders while mp36 has bits and pieces in his legs and feet    also i believe people seem to forget the original intention of this virgin vs chad meme and use it to praise the chad rather than point out the flaws despite the appeal to them    btw best 3p products are the improved/oskos not the ocs
  lmao takara has gone fucking insane
  not really takara has and always been the other end of the scale when it comes to their figures hasbro appealing to the western market has to contend to price points and budgets and as a result their collector figures are poor quality in comparison to their japanese counterparts thankfully westerners dont mind but this could be due to the collect them all mentality although siege is a step in the right direction since theyre actually fun but how long before we get stuffed with head only retools into characters that dont fit    meanwhile in japan they do whatever they want make less production runs and see who bites knowing who theyre aiming at also has that collect them all mentality but without the budget constraints remember japan has a declining birthrate for a reason no kids means less money to spend on more unessential stuff     i say this as a guy who buys into both lines and i know whos aiming at who we may not have takara versions of main line figures but were at the point where we dont need them now we just need the factories that make mps to stop treating these figures the same way i can forgive a store bought figure for a missassembly like cw skylynx but not when my mp ramjet comes with a chipped nose let alone all the other problems    short versionfew of us in this thread arent the intended consumer
  okay but turd parties target the same demographic with smaller production runs and theyre cheaper than this so your its premium so its okay argument is bullshit
  no licensing   engineers/designers arent paid the same rates  complexity is often simpler although tastefully so    really licensing is the biggest reason for the cost its why the ohko of mp10 from weijang works out cheaper than a real mp10 in that ones case they have the mold they just upscaled it and improved on it and less out of pocket and they dont have to pay anyone else other than themselves to get it done    while theyre 3p they are almost in the same legal freedom bootleggers have less red tape to cut why do you think 3ps still manufacture in china wheres hastak have moved their shit to veitnam because of cost concerns why couldnt haastak use those factories    i suspect those factories are just backyard outfits that happen to be run by fans of the figures rather than a business outfit told to do a job
  neat my first ko
missed out on blast off yesterday due to work  sold out now    fuck guess ill never get my 5 shuttle combiner done now
  you can literally buy 3 magic square primes and still have enough money left over to buy a 4th better looking optimus with that fucking asking price    like what the fuck 440 is it going to be life sized      dude nothing is going to save this gangly clusterfuck they havent shown off anything that makes it look good
  there are no g1 style ops that have better proportions its honestly that simple
  weve only seen prototypes color accessories and the transformation are whats missing cant judge a book by its cover especially if said cover is just a napkin
  really stupid armor parts like shockwave  im sorry are you suggesting that giving oneself an entire extra set of arms neither of has an actually second functional hand all so one might assume the fabled stance of mechashiva is anything less than the suppreme pinnacle of logical achievement  because if so i believe i have a pumpkinbomb i have allocated specifically for application to your face
  b r o t h e r
  it better include the trailer and tons of accesories beause there are similar books coming and they are way cheaper
  shockwave is both green goblin and doc ock  impressive
  reminder that through the glory of convention posing this happened
    i dont think colours are going to save the terrible chest and youre not going to make accessories worth 200 on top of the figure itself
  for the price and compared to mp10 it should be mandatory unless they want to change the game and release dlc packs like what bandai does and fuck us up the ass even more    could hide it better but youre right about the accessories and their cost there just has to be something driving the cost    maybe the whole thing is painted like mp36 again and thatd be their excuse maybe as i suspect its got a voice box which if paired eith newly recorded lines/licensing and shit could be a factor
has anyone gotten this for potp primal is it any good
  okay so why would anyone ever buy takara products since theyre worse and more expensive
  its not out yet planned release date was september 2018 and were only 86 days into september if i had to guess itll probably be out by 150th of september
  same anyone bought the original g1 prime because its there i dont need to spoonfeed that to you
mmmm yes please based takara please charge me more for worse toys i love you so much  shall i lick the soles of your boots too daddy
  
i always rifle through my boxes when i go down to my parents for the holidays one of the ones i brought back this time was tm terrorsaur who i think is a very underrated figure    ive also only now realized you can rotate his chest halves around in beast mode to give his wing arms better posing and pull them closer to the body which looks better
  i do wish he had somewhere to plug his swords onto his back though i like keeping his weird goblin arms unhindered     i also wish the armada version had better colors because ive never been super keen on this deco and i dont like vacmetal i just wish he had ended up a little closer to his original colors
fucking apologize to travis now  
  those both look like shit you third party shitters are the definition of delusional
  honest question do you like mp10
  kind of love it especially the proportions
   give yourself 4 arms   not an face or a second functional hand    logical
  im on board with these designs but    decepticons were always aircraft
  war machines would be a more accurate statement but when you got so many aircraft many being seekers i can see why he said that
  i might get that ms based on the proportions alone   plus the alternative being 500 doesnt hurt 
  i already have the titans returns soundwave and while i really like it the altmode and colors kind of bother me    is the takara one better enough to double dip or should i go for the bumblebee movie one or just wait for siege    i have the mp but dont really like him much as a toy and id really like a soundwave i can actually play with
  skipped out on leg day
  byoodiful
  different anon i quite like mp10 but i also think the 3p primes look better than takaras upcoming one especially the magic square one    but ultimately i dont give a fuck about sunbow prime which is why i prefer mp10 over all of them
  shockwave finds no need for a face or more than one hand making armor with features he doesnt need would be most illogical
  nobody bought potp primal
hey anons casual transformers fan here i read these threads and i realize youre all a lot more informed than i    so i have a question for you whats the deal with this all metal optimus prime that i keep seeing on ali express     is this just a masterpiece edition in metal heres some pics sorry for the phone screen grabs
    its a chinese ko kbb is a ko brand they love adding diecast to their kos this particular one is downsized to 7
  thats mp10v a knockoff of the masterpiece optimus prime but smaller about voyager size hence the v    its not all diecast but a few more parts are diecast compared to the original    the quality on them is pretty good apparently a lot of people recommend it as a mainline scale optimus
    thanks for the fast and informative replies anons the down scaling is good to know about    has this company made any other good bots
  take a look at magic squares op or transform elements  mp01  it and mp10 do their own things right and fuck up elsewhere mp01s thighs and upper arms were a little too short the head just a hair too large and the chest stuck out too far  siege op  yes  classics op  the legs and forearms were too long but it wasnt that bad  because none of them are better proportioned than mp10  youd better look at mp10 again  nor have as many accessories  i never even brought up the accessories what are you smoking
  color helps  maybe for you i dont think ive ever seen a toy that i hated as an uncolored prototype but liked enough to buy after seeing it in color    and if anything the color on prime 30 isnt going to do it any favors its going to be a lot of flat colors that dont do anything to disguise the plethora of panel lines as well as propagating the lazy sunbow design elements that should have been forgotten in the past such as lacking the yellow wrist arrows or silver shin vents or using flat gray on metal parts instead of silver making a highend transforming collectors toy try to look like an animation cel that some gook spent approximately 23 seconds scribbling out is and always will be a mistake as someone who values a good toy over accuracy or nostalgia i just see it as a waste of plastic    ultimately i think the thing that pisses me off most about new mps is the price inflation although thankfully since they look like shit my wallet can breathe a sigh of relief fuck can you imagine how goddamned amazing a 400 mp could look if it wasnt wasting all of its potential trying to look like weirdlyproportioned cartoon model sheets i wish takara would take the same approach to transformers as they did with their diaclone reboot
  the funny thing is that before i even went looking for this i knew with 100 certainty that this had to have happened at least once in comics  it happened more than once
  yeah its an undersized ko pretty good if yours doesnt brake during shipping make me wish there were other underscaled mps like the datsuns
  is this not you  nope
  they must have or hed have been dumped at 40 off on monday with nemesis and predaking
  trannies are sadder than basement dwelling transformer fans but both at once i wouldnt wish that on anyone
  dont reply to the shitposter its what feeds him
  holy fuck i was trolling months ago that it was ging to be 350 i never thought in my wildest madman dreams that takara would shoot for over 400 fucking dollars
    report and ignore the screencap retard got himself banned for two weeks for spamming them awhile back
  what in the goddamn fuck are they thinking and i thought beast wars megatron was going to be as expensive as they got but here we are now
  sure you do
  transtech
  thunder thighs windblade is my favorite
  that faggot was shitposting all throughout thanksgiving so im guessing hes either not american or even more pathetic than previously assumed
    
    he must have hated them so much  or he would have if he were capable of feeling emotions
  is that supposed to be bamboo
  yeah pretty much this
  440  they actually did it  those crazy fucks really went and did it
  is that with the trailer thats with the trailer gotta be right
does anyone here have any experience with cobi blocks their tank kits do things to my nethers but i dont want to put money down on shitty bricks are they at least mega quality
  most folks consider them superior to mega my mega fanboy rather say that mega is just its own style of bricks its still not lego in terms of clutch consistency and engineering precision id say clutch is slightly less than lego but not enough so that flimsy mocs on your part would fall apart    cobi blocks are quite flexible and ductile which makes the bricks hard to damage cant say the same for older mega bloks or a top tier pbbg block like gudi ive accidentally dropped an entire kit from a metre high without so much a scratch before    brick finish is top tier smooth and vibrant well mixed colours this is extremely pronounced due to the amount of unique snot and tile parts in their arsenal they use a different palette to lego though    of interest is their standard tracks are kinda oversized for anything short of a heavy tank or cold war mbt but they are powerful and seamless as long as your build has enough weight itll roll as smoothly as car wheels    finally the kits are pretty large and scale better to mega bloks figures and vehicles good thing for me and shouldnt be a problem for a lego person as long as they want a big klocki tank
  thanks mate thats won me over
  also that doggo looks nice
so cloud is my favorite character ever and i want to have a figure of him  what is the best option i have
  any of the ones you just posted but bring arts are coming soon to dethrone them maybe
  well all the playarts are so old as to probably be really hard to find and expensive in the aftermarket the kais are giant expensive and most people agree ugly i cant thing of what the bring arts look like off the top of my head but they apparently have promise
  is it possible theyll release all partys advent children outfits in bring arts as they did with kai i was really wanting to have the whole party but kai are expensive as hell
some new items on display my personal highlight are the somewhat new synths though i know some are definitely loving the hellboy figures that were displayed     that robot from the punk drunkers line looks a whole lot better imo with that regular left arm and makes him a whole lot more appealing to me theyre all looking great     previous thread 
so these are starting to pop up on ebay at absurd prices and i saw in the glyos thread that buildman doesnt have the pheyden head so i guess pheyden wont have the alt head either when we first saw him he was just in pheyden colours and had both heads displayed     while looking on ebay i can across this listing and a few other similar ones have the synths been bootlegged or are we looking at potentially factory rejects    
  yeah i saw the pic in the glyos thread these are gonna get scalped like no others it seems i saw the punk drunkers guy on ebay a day ago for like 250 and the glyos one is 200 god knows theyre not going down i cant tell if im more mad at the scalping pieces of shit or the company for supporting this behavior with an endless onslaught of exclusives
  so i guess pheyden wont have the alt head either when we first saw him he was just in pheyden colours and had both heads displayed  
      those are definitely bootleg i own cyclone and he has a white belt and that bootleg looks like shit
  ah ok disappointing the least they could have done is had the price lower if they were at least factory rejects it wouldnt be too unreasonable      im not sure what youre showing me in that pic he seems to have 4 extra hands and an alt regular arm no extra head i was referring to his appearances at 2017 cons where they had a blue buildman i assumed this was showing what was in one package displayed next to him    and did the robot and shark not also see release at this event or are they also at a later date along with ninja
  looking at that pic they just have cyclone and fusions belts swapped idk im not sure if these are bootlegs theyre not on aliexpress either 
  yeah they are but there are some bits and parts that are way teeth are colored and inside the mouth
those glyos guys look cool id pick some up
  enjoy paying ultra rape prices along with the rest of us who couldnt attend
  why can you buy them are they only available at a fucking convention
hellboy abe and lobster are freaking neat
  awesome      is bottom middle going to be available for purchase online im not that familiar with the line so i cant suss it out from discussion in the thread so far
  that looks like its going to be the regular release with his coat off im assuming youd just have to take off his coat
  meant the white cyborg in the bottom middle of ops pic definitely going to pick up hellboy
      already posted in the glyos thread i talked to the 1000toys guys at dcon today the glyos molds will apparently be sold online later only the colorways are conexclusive im sure some of you will still be salty because you wanted that exact one but im more certain that most will be relieved to hear this news        we have no idea the cyborg and shark guy havent been released yet
  thanks ill keep my ear to the ground
    are there any pics of 2017 cons version
what is the difference between the different listings on 1000s toys amazon shop    there are 3 different 112 synth listings at different prices and someone mentioned the cheapest on is 3rd run
  damn that other head is nice maybe a more regular release will get the extras it would be neat to get other characters heads for these like argen sarvos phanost and exellis
  i cant imagine that the pheyden colourway is exclusive hes essentially the main character who started it all glad to still see something will be available though itd be cool to see some of the more odd ones like translucent red though that would probably make more sense as a con exclusive than pheyden
new knights of the slice on the way  
  ill be passing bofffa those are hand painted so the production shoudl be nicer but ill pass
the line makes six figures i actually want  only sells them at a con on the opposite coast  thanks guys  this is some medicos tier bullshit  at least the scalpers and exclusivityfags are happy
  chill if youd actually read the thread youd know that the molds will be reused and only the colors were con exclusive
  which shop beware of cheap bootlegs even on amazon
  its even closer to medicos tier bullshit that i initially thought  oh well i wanted the punk drunkers dude and the blue glyosynth but maybe the one we get will end up looking nice
  i agree with this the min price youll be looking at is probably around 60 for the 3rd run     im still not sure about these  the seller looks pretty legit in that he sells expensive figures even without boxes and yet he has 12k feedback and mostly positive so people are buying them at these exorbitant for bootlegs but usually a bit cheaper for legit yet still giving positive feedback any more thoughts on the matter
  theres no official statement other than hearsay from the con for all we know the pheyden buildman and punk drunker were the exclusives and the glyninja and remaining two punk drunkers will be public releases still fucking anyone who wanted any of those other three
  theres no way that would happen they release essentially the main characters of those lines as exclusive then the scraps are a wide release i would personally think theyll all get a small release like the other nusynth lines did buildman might not come back but theres no way these see a general release and pheyden isnt a part of it
listen up they are exclusives to multiple events this season there are some set aside for each show and some set aside for the onell store in these colorways     ffs they were selling 1/12 test bodies at this show
  then the scraps    this entire line is literally whos
  not untrue but with regards to where theyre from and thinking of it from a niche perspective pheyden is basically the star of glyos for example using their hellboy line as a comparison itd be like releasing hellboy himself as an exclusive then having a wide release for maybe enemy troopers or a blue hellboy variant       isnt the point of the discussion going on in this thread that we dont have any actual written proof of any of this
  lol    spend hours at the show where the director of marketing for one of the companies and the head guy of the other who are good friends talk about what theyre doing with the rest of the figures and future releases and pass along this info to people panicking about scalpers and availability    prove it faggot11     never change 4chan
  i mean i can say i spoke with hasbro and that they said theyre going to make a full 6 inch glyos figure line and are going to start it by buying 1000toys or i can say i was at dcon and spoke with 1000toys and they told me theyre going to make their 12 joes in 1/12 just because i said something doesnt make it true    im not saying what youre saying isnt true but you dont exactly have a name to fall back on on an anonymous message board if you had a video/audio interview or were a reputable poster on some board not saying you arent again i just have no idea who you are or if you might want spread misinformation just for the fun of it or for whatever reason then sure we could take you at your word but as is i dont see why you should be so appalled at skepticism or people not believing you it isnt like 4chan isnt full of insiders some are indeed real and some spew made up nonsense and theres no real way to know until theres some hard evidence to either affirm or deny the claims     and no one called you a faggot
  this isnt fucking /tv/ im not posting about the end of games of thrones or which stars have raped little kids im on /toy/ about a toyline with a couple of hundred fans crawl up out of your own ass theres no conspiracy here you moron
    christ this picture alone makes me want to go to dcon next year
  not sure why youre so mad some people lie on /toy/ too and it isnt a big deal either way and certainly no reason to get upset that some anonymous posters might not believe you for the record i do believe you what you said from them only makes sense in my mind i just see why some might not or want further proof       that links been floating around this thread i wonder what the deal with those are the seller also only has 4 of each apparently
      as someone who has bought convention exclusives and talked to the guys at the booths hes not lying  it all depends on how many left overs they have    btw since im too lazy to check and forgot the name of the store that handled the booth sales do they still have those model kits for the secruity box droid thing just built mine and i want another
  for the record i do believe you what you said from them only makes sense in my mind i just see why some might not or want further proof   dawg just some general life advice this is called being a devils advocate and it will without question make people fucking despise you wherever you may roam dont argue for the sake of arguing shits stupid and gets us nowhere
psa    do not ever purchase anything from fye i ordered a synthetic human with them on october 7 didnt hear a thing about my order or any response from customer service for over a monthi had to submit a fucking complaint with the bbb to get them to finally send me a message saying my order is shipped    if anyone else needs to do the same fyes parent company who you should be submitting to is transworld entertainment located in albany ny
did any of you guys get drunker or the glyosynths  post pics please  i wish to live vicariously through you
picked up a glyosynth buildman and a test body
  ive been working nonstop since dcon that black friday rush is already warming up so i havent been able to really open or enjoy my glyosynth does this pic mean there are glyoscompatible connections on the figure that would be incredible
  3 glyos connections all on the canon arm
//wwwebayca/itm/2017acgtoaheavyindustries1000toys1126inshfmaskedknightfiguresnobox/323554260487hashitem4b55563607mmnqfos6r3tbestuscgkayga    alright i did it for all the people wondering about these i ordered cyclone ill report in to whatever 1000toys thread were on at the time about what if anything i actually receive i do have a couple others so if they are legit and maybe just factory errors i should be able to tell
  if we only talk about regular color 1/12 scale theyre exactly the same except for a mark on the back of the neck telling you if theyre first second and third run     another difference they may have is that some of them the ones sold for the american market or something have blue eyes instead of red     the difference in price comes from the fact that when you get a new run the previous one becomes older and rarer   but if you dont care about that kind of collecting just get the cheapest non bootleg one
some new mft robox pics     they say that more variations are on the map theyre probably going to make new colourways as well as new parts for it no pricing or anything yet
  weird
  for context mechfanstoys usually knocks off official and 3rd party transformers or diaclone and occasionally makes original figures too looks like robox is their next pick for what to work with
  mft the true mvps now i can finally afford to army build roboxes the way god intended hopefully theyll release some coolass colorways
  ya for sure looking forward to these im expecting the price to be around 20 to 30usd and even for those who want to customize a robox but are scared to ruin an actual 1000toys release these would be a good canvas i wonder if this will be a oneoff or if they intend to do more 1000toys products kind of doubt it but it would be pretty cool to see someone use that base synth body to make various characters at an affordable price thats easily accessible
  eh theyre all different shops i guess      but whats the difference between the production runs
  as someone else previously mentioned just an indicator from which run they were a part of on the backs of their necks
  i wish theyd hurry up and sell them online already i know were going to have to wait until they get done doing con tours though before that ever happens
  no difference for 1/12 scale     exact same figure just reissued     same materials and parts ect     just on the back of the neck if theres no symbol is first gen if it has a circle with two lines its gen two if its 3 likes its gen 3
  were getting our ducks in a row to offer the glyosynth pheyden and buildman here on the site very soon just hammering out a few more details before we make the official announcement the whole family is beyond psyched about those figures     both 1000toys and onell want the glyosynth figures to be available to all those that want them    on some occasions special limited editions may appear at certain events but the general standard styles were designed to hopefully meet any potential demand were just locking down the final details now
  niice i may just have to end up getting all 3 of them i wonder what colourways they have planned id probably be interested in a coloured transluscent one though would likely never be able to get it due to it likely being a convention exclusive     for those that have ordered from their store hows international shipping
  hows international shipping  on the more expensive side ones with tracking and insurance but also comes faster assholes couple years ago kept claiming lost mail to get extras and so this was the result nothing slow  untracked
    yeah a few bad apples ruined it for everyone on the upside if you have a trustworthy contact in the states you could have them buy for you repack without the packaging then ship via the cheapest method at your own risk i used to middleman glyos for a few international people this way it still ended up being cheaper than the official shipping and luckily nothing got lost in the mail
  this is not entirely true they made some minute refinements after the first run
    ah too bad i sure do love my cheap untracked shipping i suppose i could always use a middleman service my family in the states arent very receptive to my asking them for help with shipping i remember i won a prize once worth around 100usd but it could only ship to the us they declined to help me and the prize was forfeit im still disappointed about that excuse the inadvertent blog post    theres always middleman services too
woot woot  iron giant just arrived anyone hear any info about the other one with weapons act a possible release timeframe perhaps
        hey this one is for you faggot      eat a dick
  that guy was nothing but nice to you i dont know why youre still hung up on this that also still leaves the punk drunkers as an unknown but if the tenacious toys one found a way out i assume they will too
  that guy was a fucking loser and so are you
  lies and slander
  alright bud     that aside looking forward to getting the glyos synth possibly the shark and robot if the chance arises
  another post from onell  well be offering the same versions that were available at the conventions    originally they were each supposed to come with both heads but in the end the decision was made to keep them dedicated characters for this initial production run    plans are in place for more characters so we may see multiple heads when those surface
    i was one of the anon who talked to the guys at the booth and they confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that these colorways were conexclusive only even told me i would be wise to buy since they were almost out and that would be all for the us so either the guy i talked to skinny white guy with midlong blond hair was lying to drum up sales or he was misinformed himself as you might be able to tell by my description he was clearly an american hired to help with the booth not an actual 1000toys employee there is a chance there was miscommunication there too
    im pretty sure at this point there is one single manchild on this board whose only goal in life is insulting whoever has a slightly bad opinion about anything 1000toys related    this is always an otherwise polite community even if not always positive regarding the companys choices     do everyone a favor and stop posting   youre just ridiculous
  i would say misinformed because you cant really deny comments straight from onell themselves maybe that was all that 1000toys were going to sell directly through conventions       im glad we will get the chance to get them in these same colours it is too bad they didnt come with both heads since interchangeability is a big part of glyos and basically having a blue buildman or red pheyden is entirely possible i suppose you could say that in this nusynth universe they are unique but for the sake of playability it would have been a nice addition    its also great to hear that there are plans for more im hoping to see more unique pieces to differentiate them id also like a new mid torso piece to replace the belly button stomach and more kinds of weapons as well as more glyos pieces to customize them a bit cyclone came with 3 optional gun attachments so itd be cool if these guys had more than one cannon attachment for example
  i was also at the show and they changed their plans for the line while talking in person so that could definitely be the source of some confusion however there was always going to be some blues and reds for the onell site but it was going to be way later onnow its quite soon
  if theyre out making new addon parts id be down to deck out my white robox custom with more shit
mattels coming out with a new ultimate line starting off with the ultimate warrior and wrestlemania 34 rowdy ronda rousey    now i normally dont give a roodypoo about wrestling figures because the articulations often hindered by the sculpt and the sculpts dont always look good either not to mention the whole body recycling thing but goddamn is it me or does ronda actually look like ronda complete with that little mole under her eye    on top of that double jointed knees and elbows and toe articulation on both male and female figures although im eh on using a ball joint instead of an ab crunch there are pros and cons to both hopefully there will be enough range of motion to do a proper octopus stretch
  one warrior nation
wake me up when they announce the release date for the tanahashi shf
  his finishers the genki dama bomb
that will be my first warrior figure his wcw run sucked but his halloween havoc outfit was my absolute favorite
a cena figure that can actually do an stf    the irony of wrestling figures is that most of them are too poorly articulated to replicate the wrestlers signature moves elites are really disappointing figures in general so im really jazzed that mattel is finally stepping up their game
  how are the defining moments i kinda want a defining moments crow sting since i think it looks good but have no idea on wrestling figures
these look great never bought any wrestling figures but id love a good macho man and roddy piper
i dont think the ball torso and double elbows are going to be nearly enough im really only satisfied with kinnikuman figuarts when it comes to pulling off wrestling moves
  more like ronda lousy
eh i cannot buy into this as my old figs are all elites i dont want them to look like shit vs these guys
  these ultimate figures come with a lot of accessories the smiling ronda faces dont look too hot but the mean mug face is perfect    i also love this jacket option really wish more figures would go this route rather than making the coat part of the sculpt or using soft goods
  mean mug face is perfect  yeah and it helps that it even resembles her    im fine with soft goods though alternate parts are probably the best option in rondas case i might actually buy these i mean not ronda or uw but depending on who gets made i wouldnt mind grabbing some
  its a handpainted prototype whatd you expect
  if theres anything to nitpick this definitely aint it
it should be easy to pop and dremel out the waist joint to get more ab crunch and thats where i finally become interested i dont expect these ab crunches to be any good as is
seems like mattel actually looked at their competition with shf and storm and tried to improve themselves good on them but its definitely going to alienate people wholl have to rebuy guys
rousey fell hard is she still a thing
idk why they did toes thats not gonna help me do a sharpshooter or a sleeper hold      its one of the better ones if you can get it in the box for 20ish that wouldnt be bad i dont think theyre gonna go back and redo it anytime soon i dont like the way they did the face paint his whole head is white and the bat is wood when its supposed to be aluminum but thats nitpicking and the unique torso and trenchcoat are really nice
  they should look to the old toy biz tna figures if they want to do proper articulation
  checkmate  lol prototypes arent molded in the flesh color
still waiting on a carlito elite figure
  new elites and regular figures are getting face printing theyre already making the old figures look like shit
i love this rollins head sculpt i wish they kept it
hows the funko collection going
this shit again
  what the fuck is this
  post your contract
  some cuck made a contract with his wife because hes such a geeky nerd he has to collect all the cool funko toys  
  its the new where can i buy this pepe plush
  i dont know what cuck means  but muh popular usage changed the meaning    fuck popular usage  george carlin
  happened with gay it can happen with cuck
send pizza to 122 1/8 bleecker st you have 30 minutes    ohh and no anchovies i mean no anchovies
mikey you cant do that to ryu because youre already dead he killed you ten seconds ago
  why are anchovies a topping were they supposed to be a joke and society just went with it its no different then eating it on its own and ruins the pizza itself
  better than pineapples at least
  its one of the oldest toppings for pizza people in italy have been putting salted fish on bread for literally centuries
  twoooaa
  i swap out pineapple for anchovies
hey guys a quick question im starting to get back into macross and would like to know what some of the best representations of some of the valkyries are    the ones im most interested in are the yf19 and 21 from plus the fire valkyrie from 7 and maybe fockers from the original sdf macross     what say you all
okay this is epic
  not painting it black  pussies
  black   scar
i think it is strange that they have the balls to make nerf guns of fortnite guns in this climate considering they are pretty directly based on real guns but the fact that theyre using these weird colors which dont even resemble how the guns look in game explains a lot    also how the heck are nerf guns still a thing dont kids just play video games instead of running around with toy guns
  not knowing about 556  
  they dont make them for kids anymore theres an adult nerf community that obsesses over these as if they were real guns and organize nerf tournaments with each other
  scars arent black and are never thought of as black    to say not thinking about irrelevant gun variant makes zero sense
  are you dumb irrelevant for fortnite kids
  couldnt those people just do paintballs instead
  uhm yes please
the whole point of nerf guns based on real weapons is that you paint them
  not office friendly
  more painful less whimsical
  are you trying to troll me
  available in flat dark earth fde or matte black  matte black  sure
  you need to be over 18 to post in this site
they have two color variants in game nerf just went with nerf yellow wtf are you all going on about
  does this mean we will get a bunch of nerf versions of real weapons now im not too keen on that part of the appeal is that sci fi look most nerf guns have
  kids still play with toys just not to the same degree i always see people talking on here like they really do think no kids at all are even vaguely interested in toys any more and i have to wonder where they get that impression yeah tablets and video games are huge but they havent completely killed the appeal of toys
  i work at a kids group home and the younger boys 1214 are sometimes still into action figures and nerf and legos unfortunately girls are pretty much only into makeup and social media afaik keep in mind we dont take kids below 12 who are likely more toyminded    im always the staff who gets to take those boys out for rewards cuz my coworkers know i can be trusted to make smart toy purchases and its so great to get paid to take a kid shopping for toys then help him set them up
  wheres consthicctor
  her name is penny
  a lovely name for a lovely person
  what the fuck is with that redundant industriallooking brace on her leg
  im with you some dipshits is going to paint it black and get his ass shot and all the angry moms are gonna put a bad view of nerf into the mainstream      theyve generally avoided making anything too realistic and being fortnite branded doesnt make it not based on a real gun      cant shoot paintball inside the house  and its alot harder to get places to let you hold a paintball match say in a college field house or public forrest/park than easy cleanup not as dangerous and brightly colored so the police dont get called nerf
  i thought the same thing but i saw some kids legitimately excited over fortnite monopoly figured they would just play the game instead of that
  probably something that enables one of her abilities i dunno off the top of my head what it would be but i do know that ninjas have springs on their legs and its because they can double jump
  are moms really stupid enough to blame nerf for that nerf makes their shit outlandishly colored realistic or not for this exact reason
  are moms really stupid enough to blame nerf for that     outstandingly and unquestionably yes
  crazy moms will complain about anything i remember back in the early 2000s how moms complained that 1/6 scale military action figures where all a recruitment tool for the us military brainwashed little boys into glorifying war violence and made them desensitized towards blood and violence and turned little boys into cold blooded murderers and obviously wife beaters in the future i still remember how one lady started berating my mom because she dared to buy me a gi joe soldier i also remember my mom telling her to fuck off back to her mothers cunt too
  let me guess republican

  using epic the way they have proves they are    no kid in the past decade uses epic like this they just dab or go yeet instead idiots
  um the name of the company is epic
  okay this is epic is a meme based on a tweet from some politician late last year grandpa its usage here would even have a modicum of creativity and humor given that fortnite is made by epic games if the joke wasnt so overused already including as the op of a thread about necas action figures on this board that was up about a fortnight ago
  ben shapiro  some politician    hes just some farright nutcase twitter personality who the rightards like because hes jewish so they can say see we dont hate all jews
  think about how fucking embarrassing is that youre a /pol/tard who regularly browses the fucking toy board literally manchild tier
  you have to go back spoilerto /leftypol/ /spoiler
  everyone that makes fun of me is /pol/  even if i was and im not it still isnt as embarassing as being a manchild leftypol faggot that comes to a website they hate just to try and turn everything into a politics debate there even on the board for toys stay on /co/ where you fuckers filtered in from in the first place
  iim not from /pol/  immediately uses the leftypol boogeyman that /pol/tards love
  only /pol/tards can ever know of or reference leftypol  therefore any mention is by a /pol/tard  bystanders and third parties do not exist  youre not serious are you
stop replying to miloanon fucking christ how new are you guys the fucker comes crawling out if theres even whiff of something right of trotsky
  i thought the same thing but i saw some kids legitimately excited over fortnite monopoly  its like you retards just figured out how branding works    why do you think they put star wars characters on packages of fruits and vegetables because kids will more readily eat the food if it comes in a package with a star wars logo on it
  remember when people would unironically say epic win  where has time gone
  times change like troll faces and wojacks
  remember when people would unironically say epic win  where has time gone  those people dont matter anymore
  i miss when 4chan was full of edgelord teenagers pretending to be nazis instead of actual white nationalists  real nazis are significantly less fun to talk to
  i miss when 4chan was full of edgelord teenagers pretending to be nazis instead of actual white nationalists  real nazis are significantly less fun to talk to  correct    honestly this is one of the worst parts about modern 4chan i could deal with the unironic nazis but theyre so boring every conversation they hustle back to the same soundbites as quickly as they can no wit no humor just trying to get the topic to whatever it is they think we need to hear about theres nothing worse than trying to have a fun discussion and realizing that the other participant is only interested in redpilling me and isnt even interested in the board theyre posting on
  ahaha give it up dude youre a toyloving manchild and you just failed spoilers because youre a newfag
      i mean people are now unironically saying cringe so if anything its gotten worse    this site has always been inhabited by literal children with undeveloped brains
what a badass
  nerfs nstrike lines have always been sorta realistic but then thats why they have several lines on different themes
        you niggas are way off topic talk about toys already or take it to /co/ or /pol/
  wow this place is as bad as /co/umbler if you want a hug box        is that way
        case in point  how come you arent happy about my bringing up racial issues and immigration on the board about fucking toys that obviously means you just want open borders for everybody and not want your hobbiesrelated boards to be hobbyrelated because youre a snowflake who needs his safespace not that im being completely offtopic since i just wont ever shut up about stuff thats completely unrelated to the discussion at hand by the way have i told you about the jews yet  you have a board for that stuff if i want to talk about that ill go there so should you  and if you think contentrelated boards  muh safe space then maybe you should rub your two neurons before you open your mouth
  retard they just do it for yous you always see posts brining up race bullshit on other boards and you always get the retards like you that get upset and reply which causes them to reply back just ignore it and dont reply if you dont say anything they dont do anything else
  this is true but its also important to remember to report them because the mods are real tired of that bullshit and they will delete it fast
hopefully this thing has full auto it does have the rev trigger so its at least fly wheel powered the grip looks like crap and the stock looks fixed so theres really nothing about this gun worth getting for me shame too cause i do love the way the scar looks but judging by the star wars stuff this thing will probably shoot like crap       mcfarlane needs to make a figure of her if they do a second wave
  i genuinely doubt any of the figures made will be save the world figures that game is just not popular and considering theyve left it for dead at this point i can see why its basically only good for earning vbucks that you can then spend on battle royale instead of having to directly pump another 20 into the game
can we get some mods in here
  are the magazines going to be intentionally fucky looking like it is in the game
  why would republicans complain about military shit
  dont try and restart that shit
can we get some more mods in here
  you know i live in russia in my country conservators hate every ägressive toys videogames cartoons and other stuff we have some fanatic redhead in our big guys list he tried to ban monster high dolls in our country cause cult of death we call people like this cottonpants
who likes fortnite
  well i saw frozentm ham slices so your right unfortunarely
  why cottonpants
  conservators  cool
  because hes such a silly billy over reacting to child safe media
  are you the potatoes cooked that way guy
  that guy was romanian i think some gypsies probably stole his internet by now
  big guys list  tell me more
can nerf guns fire more than 10 feet yet i would love to get some nerf guns but they have terrible range and even worse accuracy last i checked about 9 years ago
  a yes they have for quite a while    b modding depending on the gun and what you do to it you can hit across a gymnasium without too much trouble
  base fps is around 70fps for darts rival rounds shoot 90fps companies like buzzbee and dart zone try to get a piece of the pie by sometimes offering higher fps the of course theres modding for rediculous fps usually by changing batteries and motors
  your best bet is to look into the nerf rival line its mainly aimed at older audiences and focuses on competitive performance they use small dense foam balls so they have far better accuracy then most darts and the blasters themselves boast a lot of power the spring based ones especially required some effort to prime and fire but pack one heck of a punch    with old fashioned darts however theres still many blasters that work well and offer consistent performance some dart blasters will focus on specific gimmicks or visual themes and their performance will suffer because of it though they can still be fun to play with but a few specific ones are just consistently good and are a great gateway into the hobby     if you think youd prefer a battery operated semi auto fire blasteryou should pick up a stryfe if you want a spring based pistol to plink with grab a disruptor/strongarm/hammershot all of them are good and offer similar performance if you want a spring powered mag fed blaster with accessory potential then you should get a retaliator a bit awkward to use at first but a solid blaster and with the right add ons it can look pretty badass
  i can never take the retaliator seriously     recon sucked balls  for 5 or so years every other nerf was a reshelled recon and therefore sucked balls    retaliator is new guts in the recon skin  sot it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth
sigh
  id like to see you to do a spoiler on /toy/ show that newfag how its done
  for years the only gun i needed was my heavily modded maverick did the russian roulette mod the air restrictor removal gluing in fast food drinking straws in their place to focus the air and pennies behind the spring to increase the tension it wasnt til the stampede that i started getting interested in other blasters
  i never bothered with the original recon so the performance of the retaliator was always top notch in my eyes though a bit wonky to use that said i originally got one because i saw a mod that slimmed its profile down and trimmed the mag itself to sit flush in the blaster making for a pretty sexy pistol i havent attempted to recreate the mod myself but i have plenty of spares to work with so itll happen one day     though its still a fantastic versatile blaster due to it having a full range of accessory options a personal favorite build for it is the barrel attachment it comes with combined with the missile launcher tube and stock from the tristrike it makes for a gorgeous rifle with easy transition between dart priming and missile firing pumps the relatively large stock from the missile launcher also makes for a very comfortable shoulder rest when priming the retailator
  no no after you sir
built up nerf collection since 1st grade  buy into the newer equals better mentality  kid in middle school asks about my longshot and offers to buy it  oh thats alright i just got the upgraded version the longstrike ill just give you my longshot for free  months later find out his dad fucking destroyed it as punishment  then learn what its value was  id be lynched if you guys found out how many rare toys i had that ended up being destroyed thanks to my dumb ass
  hopefully his father also found out the value and felt dumb about it as well but then again hes probably a republican and they will bend over backwards to justify their nonsense and never admit fault about anything
does this thread count as a nerf general  im just going to act like it is    for those who care about overwatch blasters you can see firing demos here    mccree revolver     reaper shotgun     dva pistol 
  absolutely this
  this is not in any way shape or form limited to republicans parents strive so hard to   be better then their horrible stupid parents that they fall prey to all sorts of alternative quake bullshit certified baby psychologists spout out of their facial defecation holes so when these parents do screw up they are so adamant they are not the failures mom and dad were that they will blame anything else other then themselves    its not a party issue its a human nature issue
  damn that dva one is actually really cool and faithful to the ingame one i guess its no surprise that the character who says nerf this is well suited to a nerf gun    also i dont come here much but do we really not have nerf threads that often id think it would be the number one thing to discuss on a toy board
  draconical  good lord he is so annoying he beats around the bush so fucking much
  there isnt always much happening to keep discussion going so sometimes theres a lull in threads
  republican  destroying a gun    lol no
  yeah i cant really stand to watch his videos he takes too damn long to say anything and anything he does say isnt really that substantial but thats true for many youtubers
  does this thread count as a nerf general    well there is a big yellow foam blaster in the op thats good enough for me       not surprising theyre not the most effective blasters out there but the dva and reaper ones at least seem decent enough to hold their own the mccree one however is a total let down its a one shot rival blaster shaped like a revolver of all things it instantly went from must have to piece of crap      i agree 100 hes just so offputting that i cant stand to watch his videos anymore he just rambles on about nothing and its hard to actually learn anything from him as a reviewer throw in his wannabe edgy vamp guy stuff and he just becomes cringe worthy       the fortnite and overwatch stuff makes for good thread worthy news but there was also a new super huge modulus pack revealed not too long ago using the demolisher as the base blaster its a set loaded with lots of new pretty fantastic attachments and a few mediocre returning ones im more psyched for that set then any of the licensed brand stuff especially since i never got my hands on a demolisher when it first came out and i do love my useless attachmentsthough some of the ones in the set are actually really useful
  its not a real gun so its ok
  just watch coop he can be a little cringy sometimes but he moves so quickly and thoroughly that its easy to move past  i used to make nerf videos as a kid and almost considered getting back into it but i feel like i wouldnt be able to offer anything he doesnt already provide and more
  the toy gun had satan in it  republicans
  boys do mostly  mainly the hell cod but irl crowd is still relevant
  yes but paintballs hurt more and arent as budget friendly as nerf guns  ironically some of the nerf game mods are crazy   ive seen people add blow back recoil
  i dont get why they choose the realistic ones as opposed to the goofy looking shotguns
  im looking at the mechanics and the proportions and im 80 convinced they could have gone with an actual revolver design with 34 shots in it if they had gone with a hammershot like setup onlywith the plunger tube moved back into the handle with the spring so the cylinder is still in the back    im 95 sure they could have made it hammerprimed and a revolver if they had just used darts instead of rival balls
  uh mods
  i remember one time i got permabanned for posting a dumb creepypasta that starts with my name is alice and i am 5 years old and felt so stupid typing up an appeal trying to explain the joke
thank you
  i feel like i wouldnt be able to offer anything he doesnt already provide and more    you can wear a sexy sexy bra coop wont wear a sexy sexy bra no matter how many times i email him its like he doesnt care about his viewers anymore
  they have a list of figs for the second wave already / more battle royal skins i only remember itll have streak if thats what it was the fox mask one and some graffiti chick
  where did you see the list i tried googling around using the names of the skins i presume youre referring to drift and teknique but i could only find stuff about the first wave     side note i am so disappointed in epic for never doing a female version of drift it would have been so cool
tfw modelfag  tfw unironically considering buying some nerf guns and repainting/detailing them as scifi style weapons  am i a bad person its just the base designs are awesome and without the nerf branding and safety colours theyd make pretty pimpin display pieces like even the old rebelle stuff that was aimed at little girls looks like if you repainted and maybe added some extra parts/sculpting you could make it into a pretty cool covenantstyle alien gun
  why not hollywood does it
  you should absolutely do that the modding community is really prominent with nerf  
    it shows the wave on the back of that pink bear thing which i think is kinda nice letting people know what to expect
  oh thats useful thanks i see that the girl is actually brite bomber so that might explain why i didnt find anything    no skins i really like yet sadly but they are all very popular skins so the choices make sense although i really cant help but wonder if theyre only popular because they all fall under the category of being inexpensive or among the earliest released skins designwise the newer skins really blow them all away
yep good stuff
think i can get away with creating a thread on /sp/ about the nfl crossover or does that not fall within the rules
  you could at least post a better example from a real holllywood film  not some crappy example from a failed scifi series  yes i recognized taht from that series with time travelers and dinosaurs and quaritch     like in guardians of the galaxy 2
  what happened in guardians 2
  rockets guns that he picks up in gotg2 on yondus ship are literally a nite finder and a shortened recon that just had a bunch of shit slapped on them    its hard to notice while watching the movie but its very easy to spot when you look at stuff like the hot toys
quite epic
    yeah  just try to look for the weapons that the ravagers  sometimes its just a black paintjob nerf with some gunmetal drybrushnot that they look out of place but if you know the modesl it ruins the suspensieon of disbelief a little
  but not a talking raccoon
  nah man those are real
  the right spoils everything
  they really do
i live in somewhere far away from you  my occupation is being an unnecessary existence  i am a nobody
yes yes well done epic well done epic however
  well  a shitalking orange made president i no longer doubt there are some talking racoons on the wild out there 
  yep you are right
daft funk
so my grocery store has the sharpfires in the christmas toy section im trying to figure out if the barrel extension actually does anything  i know why youd want one on a real gun longer barrellonger burn timelonger distance and stability  but none of this applies to foam darts so is it just aesthetic
  starting a sentence with okay  unironically saying epic  sure is circa 2000 disney channel in here go fuck yourself
  the sharp fire barrel does the same thing as the sharpfire stock takes up too much space raises the price of the gun and kind of looks neat     the whole platform itself is a pile of trash not worth buying     at least on normal blasters barrel extensions can add the purpose of increased rail space and a better grip
  this whole post  genuine yikes
walmart has major online sales for nerf guns fyi  saw a prometheus marked down to 11999
  its just aesthetic with almost every nerf attachment barring stocks on springers
  what do those do
anyone has used those black panther gauntlet guns cause i want to take one of those wrist mounted ones to weaponize  nerfanize a swat kats glovatricks shell
  i imagine they suck for whatever reason licensed products means license to suck
  they give you a potentially better bracing point for when you prime them like when you pump a shotgun youre putting the pressure into your shoulder rather than your firing hand  its pointless on flywheels because they have no recoil
  but the nintendo seal of quality
anybody who wants to pick up an xshot regenerator can get one at aldi starting wednesday 25 kinda want but i might roll the dice and wait til after xmas to see if it goes on clearance
  next summer  kids will have completely dropped fortnite
  not at this rate people have been saying fortnite is dying for the better part of the year and its playerbase keeps increasing
in lego store brick friday  older couple comes in asking for fortnite legos for their grandkid
tfw no tf2 nerf guns
  ha even hollywood kitbashes
  either their grandkid saw a clickbait youtube video and took it as fact or came to their own assumption there has to be a lego version of everything they like
  i mean its not exactly an unrealistic assumption especially since if their isnt a lego of it there is probably a megabloks of it
      i feel like ive heard theres at least going to be a lego set of it if my mind isnt making that up so maybe they heard about that
its been neat watching fortnite evolve from a game with barely anything to do into a game with lots of modes and fun items that even casual players can enjoy the decision this season to always have a mode with respawns available was a stroke of genius that has been highly effective at keeping the casual audience playing the default mode kind of wears on you since seeing the victory screen is so rare so i think a lot of people appreciate having modes where they have room to mess up but can still have the satisfaction of winning the match
  its a fortnite licensed product so why would it be colored like the version of the scar thats not in fortnite you fucking mongoloid
  actually i think that scar has been added in fortnite since that post was made conveniently enough i dont know much about guns but i think its the heavy assault rifle
  considering how big of a faggots the guys managing nerf are im even surprised that they approved this i guess money trumps morals every time
  im a landscaper and i cant begin to tally the number of nerfstyle foam darts i find strewn around peoples yards they look like the dollar store knockoff versions but still i was surprised as anybody that they still make these things
whats the best dart for unmodded blasters  i got a bunch of ekind waffleheads which i really like in regards but the tips barely are able to stay on which is annoying as hell when using flywheels
  spray it black   run down the street with it     profit
  see a red door  want it painted black  no colors anymore  want them to turn black
  see the girls walk by in summer clothes  see people turn their heads  quickly turn away  feels bad man
  wasnt overcuck making one of their characters guns
  overcuck  wow check out mr witty over here
  i think everyone agrees that the only real flaw with the retaliator is its top prime they make awesome primaries if you install a pump grip kit on one though    i usually do coop for actual review type videos he can be a bit hard to watch but usually cuts the fluff pretty quickly    the sharpfire sucks ass when used stock bought one from a goodwill recently and im modifying it as a christmas present apparently if you install a 7kg orange mod works retaliator spring and drill the air restrictor out then they hit far harder the same could be said for a lot of blasters though    for flywheels koosh darts arent bad and are relatively affordable the foams a bit stiffer too so they dont deform as easily as official darts havent had much experience with any other brand of dart so i just stick with those if i need bulk ammo
jurassic park is frightening in the dark    any word on when dino rivals might launch
previous thread 
having a lot of fun with these guys might make a lighting setup so it doesnt look like shit    wish theyd stand up easier
i love these dinos theyre pumping out although these are unlikely heres some id wanna see  troodon attack pack  attack pack pachycephalosaurus  jptg tylosaurus extreme chompin  megalodon extreme chompin  pliosaurus action attack  ophthalmosaurus attack pack  seriously id love to see the aquatic line expanded on
why are the people on the jp toys facebook page so insufferable
  man i would sign up for all of those    also really want an oviraptor with a little nest
  me too that would be awesome i feel like the aquatic section is rather empty and in need of more species i would love to see liepleurodon or kronosaurus made    you exited that were getting a mega duel quetzalcoatlus  i honestly never expected them to attempt a large pteasaur this early
  what happend this time
  just obnoxious folks acting arrogant as if they are a king of the community
  who was it if i may ask
  megalodon is eh as a figure its just a big shark
  im a phoneposter so ive got no idea how but put this thread in the last jpgen for christs sake
  the last thread is archived man you cant post in it anymore thats how this board works
  ikr i never uynderstabd the big deal with the megalodon
  yeah im one of the regular posters here im just fucking retarded sorry
  like dont get me wrong i love the animal its a cool creature but its got pretty much zero figure potential the mattel aquaman line has some big sharks so just get one of those
  oh no i completely agree its an awesome animal but it would be a waste of resources to make a jp figure out of one great suggestion on the aquaman line i want to get one now thanks
  you have literal shit taste sir
  edgy
  i was gonna say give the guy a break but i reread it and all id be down for is troodon and opthalmo jptg tylo would be based but wishful thinking
  its just stuff i wanna see sometimes yall are real judgemental about what dead animal i wanna have a tiny action figure of
  i know right i totally dig your choices dude
update on the target exclusive spino  the spinosaurus has not been cancelled on a almost daily basis about 20 spinos are being released about 5 at a time online while still somewhat difficult to get one locked in before they sell out it is important to note more and more individuals are able to purchase one as the scalpers quit their bull shit realizing they wont be able to ask an insane amount selling their 2050 on ebay i expect everyone that wants one will be able to get it real soon for the 2499 msrp check targetcom throughout the dayi was able to purchase mine around 930am central time
  when is it going to be available in stores
  it wont be
not technically jurassic world but the lego movie 2 sets have some neat raptor colorations
  oh wow sweet
    yes it will be shut up
  target website said a store near me had it gone now
  it wont be sold in stores the ones that are getting it are receiving excess stock and are the exception to the rule it wont be an item you can consistently count on to appear if youre lucky you might find one but thats a heavy chance youd be taking
  yeah its the only store things dont randomly get rolled out in florida    it was just someone returning a bunch or the distribution center near by just moving product    there is no plans in 2018 to have spino in stores  i doubt 2019 but doubt it they seem to be just pushing forward with new product not re releasing anything that has already been out for months if you step back and actually think about it it doesnt really make sense from a retail perspective
  yes it will you fucking retard youre a dense faggot trying to shit on peoples hope
  you can pick whether or not you wanna believe me im just trying to give a heads up ive leaked stuff before and i have connections to mattel again you can choose not to believe that but i cannot tell you what to believe spino will not be receiving a sustained mass release that is a fact whether or not you choose to accept it is a decision you get to make on your own
  destructasaurs any news on them
  amazon picked up exclusivity after tru but has seemingly dropped it so the american distribution is in jeopardy once again they are still to be mass distributed in other countries though really just goes to show that whatever contract mattel is using for the exclusives is awful
update on the lockwood set wont be sold in the usa sorry
  america gets fucked over again
  why are muldoon and grant bullying that poor galli like theres fucking murder happening behind you and you two feel the need to harass this poor innocent dino who are the real animals here
  so glad i got it a few months ago on ebay    eurofag here paid him a little more than it costs but i knew it wont come out in my country     received the tlw raptor from the legacy collection mattel is doing a horrible job with their promos shots that thing looks amazing irl
  has no reason to believe this  will be the dumb faggot still waiting for spino in stores months from now    if you want one for msrp start watching the target site as people have been suggesting
glad i think jp3 is a shit movie i have no urgency to get the spino this way
  why dont you show us your zip anon
trying to do a nofrill dilo
  cool anon keep us updated
  its not the spinos fault the film is shit though great creature
  first layer of green is drying pics soon will probably finish this by tonight
  nice keep pics coming i wish they made the frills removable like kenner
  shaping up nicely the dilo without frill from the first kenner line the water spitter is still my favourite dilo to date although the mattel one is a close second
    not a modder/painter myself but this is the type of quality content we need together with wish lists like  simple reviews and news of course make the jp general great again
  np bro
      thanks guys ill try to finish it well im not a professional painter so im not great at washes and making it look realistic but itll be at the least accurate
workinn
again not professional but heres my try at an accurate jp dilo i probably got minor details off i think the lower jaw isnt meant to be light green but i did my best to make it look good
  using shitty acrylic paints from walmart  you fucked up anon
  this your sculpt was fantastic but the project was really impeded by your paint choice a professional paintjob goes a long way even if your brushmanship isnt perfect next time id use better paint for the job otherwise good work though
  im looking to make some customs myself what type of paint do you suggest i was thinking of mostly using an airbrush since i feel that the results would look more natural
  looks good nice work
  it all depends on the material acrylics actually work really well for mattel figures but you gotta get some quality paints make sure to use primer first again acrylic primer works well on mattel figures but certain plastics require different paint types to help everything go a lot smoother an airbrush is a fantastic choice as it does get those natural colors perfectly but youll definitely find yourself having to do more and more detail by hand as the figures get smaller cause even the smaller airbrushes cant do detail well or at all on tiny figures
  definitely i was watching a teb brothers video and it would be absolutely impossible to do things like teeth or eyes with an airbrush though now that i think of it you could get a nice color effect if you did try to color those small details with an airbrush albeit with colors meant for the shin and not for claws eyes etc
  skin  not shin
  really just goes to show that whatever contract mattel is using for the exclusives is awful      mattel in general is a really awful company so it makes perfect sense no matter what line it is they always seem to screw it up
  attack pack deinonychus from jurassic world evolution
  respect
  please tell me how they are so awful because they took over this brand from lazy ass hasbro and are actually killing it yeah go fuck yourself
    i used mostly shit like apple barrel from my craft stores might not look the best but its all i had before i go on vacation with my family today so yall wouldve had to wait till sunday to see any finished result it looks and feels fine irl and im happy with how it looks on my windowsill
  yeah it looks good maybe give it a light gloss
  update back from the airport when i come back on sunday ill gloss the claws and inside of the mouth a little
down home for thanksgiving and my dad drug out all my dinos for my little niece so many good memories and so many jp figures i forgot about
  any ideas on a good color to use for the claws ive been debating on whether or not to paint the claws of all my 375 not sure if going black is the sure bet
  and even barely giving her body a once over ever so slightly glossing it and she wont look so painted good job dont listen to the haters
  i know this feel senpai i know it all too well  i had that t rex and brachi in the bottom left corner like youre copy pasting my childhood
  black or a mix of black and satin dark umber is what i usually use used plain black in this case
  thanks shes a bit glossier irl but ill go over it again with a spray
  please tell me how they are so awful    you mean outsides the horrible distribution and questionable qc    yeah go fuck yourself    the truth hurts bitch
quest for indominus isnt selling terribly fast at my walmart so if you want one go and git it
got my alpha training blue just curious had anyone here seen this in actual stores ended up getting them off amazon when the tru cas in my area still hadnt gotten some innot sure if the cpost strike could have affected this
more dino rivals spotted on ebay  
  not technically jurassic world  i mean action hero chris pratt owns blue raptors in the lego movie thats pretty on the nose as far as related to jurassic world goes
  america gets fucked over again  america has never been fucked over  try buying literally any toy other than lego outside of the us without using the internet
  yeah poor distribution on the part of the retail shops dumbass bitch
anyone up for selling a dilo i wanna try some more nofrills price is negotiable
  you should of waited those cheap acrylics go on thick and hide all the details go to hobby lobby they should have testors model master and vallejo paints they are in the models section make sure you grab the acrylic paints not the enamel i like using testors as it adheres to the plastic very well so i dont even need to use a coat of primer or a coat vallejo has some great color choices but you will need to use a primer or use it over a coat of testors for detail work  oh and for the love of god thin your paints
  the paints are thinned i think the paint works fine its thinned and irl it doesnt go on thick its very flat ill take that into consideration though
  yeah they workif you want your figure to look like its made out of playdoh
  okay i like how it looks might not be the best because im not experienced and i didnt use the best materials but its satisfying enough that i like it thank you for the tips but the insults get a little annoying after i tried to post something i liked this is why i rarely post on 4chan again i appreciate the tips but im happy with the results and i dont need the you fucked up lol or looks like play doh lmao ive finished the figure and its done and i think better than it looked at retail thanks
  you can still be proud of your work and accept you need improvement anon if you put time and effort into doing a job then you have a right to take pride in the end product no matter the quality but even with that pride theres no harm in saying that you arent a pro at this yet and that with a bit of practice and better tools one day you can get there everyone has to start somewhere this is a fantastic start and you have absolutely every right to be happy with your project but i think youd be foolish to say looks perfect finished done and stop trying to improve
  i completely get that and agree and i love the constuctive criticism but what i dont like is lmao lookks like playdoh and you fucked up lol and that got on my nerves
  lmao would you believe it the ebay scalper a throwing in the towel it seems and have listed the spinos starting at 099 for bidding
  i hope you know what they mean by that though its your choice in paint that inhibits your project they say it looks like playdoh or you fucked up not because of your brushmanship but just because your medium doesnt let you express the full potential of what you can granted they could be nicer yes but they arent making fun of your paintjob just your choice in paint
its finally here
  ah i just got mine a few days ago i honestly never thought id never see one lol    just need the spino legacy pachy jp3 raptor and legacy dilo than im set till 2019 as far as the legacy line goes anyway
    legacy or bust
  all the way for sure cause bd is meh and dsaurs are just not available
anyone know how many of each attack pack dino is in each wave ive heard blue has been put in several waves i mean is it like 2 blues cause they figured shed sell well and 1 galli for example
  i really want the attack pack dilo or 2 pack dilo but i cant seem to find one lately or any for that matter any tips one could give to a fellow anon
  i never really appreciated it till it was gone sadly now its too late no back cs
  dadgum photo
  2 packs are at smaller retailers look for kohls and shit like that youll have to get real lucky for an ap dilo tho
  2 blue  1 minmo  1 green raptor  1 proceratosaurus   1 protoceratops      at least cant remember if there was any more doubles off the top of my head
  just fuck off okay  i am a pretty good custom maker i like the way my dinosaur looks why dont you show your work then huh  show us how much better you are than my playdoh dinosaur   yeah thats what i thought little bitch
  no you are not you are delusional if you thing that work is great not with those paints people are just trying to give you constructive criticism and you are flipping out
  shut the fuck up nerd he can do what he wants
  totally not same fagging right lol its alright i understand you cant take any criticism we wont say anything next time you post your playdoh dinos sorry we hurt you feelings anon
  if you cant take criticism dont post your work it isnt a 4chan is mean thing no one has said that it blatantly sucked and you did a bad job you picked bad paints no one here is going to argue with me on that but you     and yeah youre half right do i do any customs on mattel jurassic figures or jurassic toys in general no sir i do not i am interested in doing so one day but i havent taken any steps towards it yet i am however quite skilled at repairing toys i work in an actual toy shop and ive even fixed up a few of the mattel jurassic figures that have broken on us point is i havent worn your exact shoes but i know what the hell im talking about kid you can choose to ignore me or say hes perfect to me all you want but youre gonna get criticism both good and bad if you post your work online just a general rule
ever notice how close in color the wave 2 raptors are to the trex kinda like in jp1
  naw im somebody else sick of reading your bullshit if you have a thought sometimes keep it in your head it will take you far in life
hey anyone still have the list of figures for 2019 dino rivals line the ones with the skus 
  thanks man any chance you know where to find the info for the other waves or what to google in order to find it lol
          okay except i didnt post that thats not my style of writing and ive never cussed someone out here they changed their name to my name i have a name now i guess and wrote that thanks for making me look like an asshole and getting the thread against me really appreciate it bud
  isnt there a way to check whos the same poster like an id number or something
  not my knowledge sorry someone is creating trouble for you
  like an ip address
  i guess i want to prove that guy isnt me because i do like constructive criticism and theres no reason to cuss people out because they dont think my dilopho was perfect
  also if youre gonna try to impersonate me to make me look bad try using the same writing style next time
were is the sku anon i need that list for the 2019 line i swear i saw a mussasaurus on it but want confirmation ie i need that list scuse me sorry i mean we need that list
  yeah to my knowledge ihave no clue how you would go about doing that or if its even all that legal to be honest   btw good work on the dilo forget the naysayers and keep up the good work
  thanks i know its not perfect and i do like the criticism the only person im mad at is the impersonator not anyone else for giving tips

i havent been in jo gen since all the wheres spino threads these dunno rivals are new to me what else did i miss
    posted this before seeing that post i guess that answers that
  da allo is not cancelled
  ok i didnt know if i should change that part since i mostly copy  pasted that info
  why does it still have speaker holes
  kek    we had so many quest for indominus sets left over from black friday management marked them down to 30  finally broke down and snagged one
  getting a decent color scheme on this sculpt is like pulling teeth
  well the indominus skeletons legs instantly snapped and had holes in the mold great
  not real doesnt have tail action and the final one has no blue around the eyes
  i was thinking is part of a bundle or something
ss dilophosaurus same as legacy
  no sir literally just a fake or a mockup at best this one isnt real despite the fact we have a similar looking one on the way
working on a sucho now again sorry about the guy trying to make me look bad id never act like that
  has it grown
  ooh watch ya doin with it
  nope ss has a biting feature the legacy one squirts water like the og kenner dilo
        yeah this is absolutely fake not even that its just bad photoshop
  the jw website sucho  also i took some advice and i redid the dilo a little more neatly
i appreciate the advice from you guys while i didnt have time to get better paints i redid the white and black on the back more neat as well as the red underside of the neck
so is there a way to bend the grab and growl arms without having them snap off
  yeah dont be a hamhands
so anyone have any luck with the battle damage raptor and pteranadon     found the quest for indominus set picked it up for the skele and sub the mosasaurus is getting gifted to one of my students
  the mosa in the set is better than the single mosa
  explain
  not really is there even a difference
  yes please do
      check out the victorias cantina video paint app is better jaw moves smoother
  she said there was no noticeable difference between the 2
  i think mattel improved the paint and texture very slightly since it was first released in the spring if you get a real feel or an indominus quest version now they are both exactly the same
  maybe it was a different video idk the mosa i got in april is slightly less quality than the new one in the set
  can you show pics we would love to see it if that is the case
  in bed right now but in the morning sure
  np good night anon sleep well and do well
  whered you get him
  looking 1000 x better incredible work
  source just wondering cause my info says its the legacy model with new paint
  i guess its just speculation on my part really im just going by what i see in the rest of the ss line/sub line
  though i have a theory that the ss line might be a line reusing the legacy line sculpts but haveing the sculpts available to the mainline of course some modified bd figures as well
  with that theory would we still get the target legacy male jp3 raptor and the water dilo in this line or in dino rivals
so destructasaurs are never coming to america even online
  never amazon didnt take it  btw this guy     not me  needs more underscores
  literally why   these are shelf warming everywhere i see them walmart and target along with the tnt rex why continue selling it
so what do you anons think the second concavenator will be a repaint or a mega battle damage figure like the albertasaurus
  is this supposed to be the dino rivals indoraptor or will be seeing a new sculpt/figure
    huh thats a shame they seem to be all over mexico well except for the dimetrodon
  probably battle damage version
i like how the mbd have two layers of damage the alberto has the skin that folds up but the ribs also fold up to reveal the guts
  i dont understand why they repacked this guy not even a subtle repaint or something neat
  probably just because theyre moving to the time where theyre selling jurassic dinos in general rather than specific movie tieins and dont want stupid parents/retailers thinking something like that movie was ages ago why get a toy from it
  i wouldnt say theyre shelfwarming so much as mattel flooded em with the initial stock indos over the summer    think someone ended up top stocking almost 50ish of the bastards over the summer and only room on the shelf for 3 or 4 at a time granted they sold like hell over the weekend only about 15 more to go
  targets around me all had them go clearance we only have the gng indo and they are not on the com gotta go to walmart for the super posable or anywhere else      thats what im wondering in the facts app there is a new indo correct and it doesnt match the lockwood battle one so im wondering if its something completely new or are they just going to do a solo battle damage indo
  upcs show two different versions of dual attack ditto allosaurus and trike      sounds like nuindo is just a straight reissue of sp with new box and apptag pity woulda been nice to see the storyboard white version for some contrast even though i hate these madeup monster freakshows
  2 packs are at barnes  noble as well fyi
  body is fine but would like a better head sculpt
guy who bought the indominus set here so it does seem that mosasaurus in the set is improved from the standard release one with a better jaw but i found the paint to be lacking on the newer one oh well
is the target employee anon around seems as though the legacy humans assortment dpci is broken and i would like them to confirm it  this used to work 
found the new dino rivals repackaged figures today at walmart theres 2 dino trainer owens 2 baby blue owens 1 merc w/dimorphodon and 1 claire w/stegosaurus that come packaged together
jurassic worlddino rivals new attack packs review of 2019 figures   dracorex   delta   ramphoryhchus   and   protoceratopsrepaint    
so the wave 1 humans repacked in dino rivals branding have started hitting stores more owens to clutter the pegs but at least it gave me a chance to finally snag a claire
    god not more owen figures why cant we have other or new figures instead of the wretched peg warming figures they only should have made only 2 kinds of at most not 3 or 4 unnecessary figures i honestly hope this line wont be flooded with repacks of figures that werent all the popular to begin with cause that will i hope we can at least see some new figures humans or at least get some of the figures dinosaurs that got phased out early on like the   ap dilophosaurus   wave1 dimorophodon  ap gallimimis  roarivore  allosaurus  baryonx   and others that were lost due to being phased out and not restocked
  theres 2 dino trainer owens 2 baby blue owens  why would you do this mattel
  ap gallis hung around here for a while im not even sure how we got rid of them i think those can keep taking a break but the rest of that list is pretty solid
  thin your paints    no really especially with white do multiple layers instead
    more repacks of the same peg warming figures from wave 1 that no one was all that into man its gonna suck if this is all we are getting for the main line human figures that we are going to be getting for the 2019 dino rivals line what we need are new human charactors from the jurassic world movies to freshen up the mainline human figures like dr wu masrani lockwood or some expendable characters like jw acu workers any of these would be better than repacked meh  
  somewhat late to the party whats the top right dino supposed to be
  it seems like theyre not really making any new humans whatever happened to that franklin figure i think hes the only human weve been shown that hasnt had a release of some kind so has he been cancelled
  monolophosaurus looks like a repaint of the one that came with the battle damage trex in the walmart set
  savage strike monolophosaurus  it will have an action feature much like the legacy baby rex biting action or snapping jaws gimmicky stuff
    so who is in on the new mono figure
  i like the colors on the new one but i prefer the mouth on the bd version the new one looks like it has big puffy cheeks which is the same reason i dont like the young rex
spinos up right now if you hurry
  dang it its gone
  is this true i didnt even get an alert
  there were about 10 in stock at that time i think target turned off the alerts to try to stop bots or something
  yes target has turned off alerts a small way to fight against would be scalpers and give a chance to anyone
  fuck me guess its not happening then no other way to know unless i check this thread every five minutes
  hes cool af so i wouldnt mind another
  but there is so many of them around and the head sculpt sucks or is just not all that movie accurate in appearance
   wouldnt mind another  like a new sculpt or an additional sp indo
holy fuck these better not be repacks
  what was it its gone
  oh i have no doubt they will be did you actually expect mattel to put some real elbow grease in the 2019 line with all new species and not just repack everything
  a sealed box of the mini blind bags
  i bet theyre the new species we never got a mini gallimimus either
  dont think we will either  would be to hard to make it stand up with its thin legs    my attack pack galli cant even stand
so uhmm    any thoughts on the anatomy trex i can get one for relatively cheap but video reviews dont really seem to do it many favours can anyone convince me otherwise
  too soon to say there are no more coming be patient
  well what has you interested i personally passed on it for various reasons including the lack of articulation high price and the fact i honestly dont need another brown t  rex but those were my reasons for not getting it it does have some neat stuff going for it on the other hand like if your into gimmicky toys like its beating heart and lungs and muscles on the legacy and tail unfortunately on the downside of things those rubber pieces can be an absolute pain in the ass to keep on the said parts  so do what you will about it as far as your reasons for getting it or not its up to you really but im sure that you already know that
  what species could they have in mind or think outside the box to bother making new minis
  if theres a nontransparent indominus in that batch i will loose it  still dont understand why the first time they put out the mold they decided to make it clear instead of making it a rare or something in the mystery packs
a year plus later and still no sign of this one yet where is it
  thanks i appreciate your comment very helpful actually i was just about to buy it but wont now i like the heart gimmick and such and the figure could work well as an eaten corpse but this amount of money for a figure that would only really be used a corpse is a bit too much
  no sign thats literally the upcoming legacy one
  i have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to do that i hope they actually give us a proper indominus when the time comes for the main line  i really hope they make it large proportionate and with proper paint and detailing
  big indominus confirmed at least part of it is transparent in some capacity as it uses lights to show figures that it swallows
  i know i feel like we should be seeing it already along with the jpiii raptor i dont think theyre cancelled though just delayed for some reason  whatever that may be
  oh no not super gimmicky figures sounds way too imaginext to me and i really dont like the idea at all i just want a natural looking indominus rex is it so much to ask for mattel
really digging the savage strike line and all its neat little action features reminds me a lot of kenner  what do you guys think
  one of these things is not like the other
  whoops my bad but the point remains 
  try every species thats about to come out plus the ones they didnt make minis of like the gallimimus or herrerasaurus
  confirmed how where and when
  how exactly but her and the sky bro arent dinosaurs if that is what you mean
  oh i meant the ss line thats all
  that evil hand is holding the dimetrodon back from some snacks
    cute isnt it cant wait to get it when it comes out
got a rex ambush set that was only in canada in the mail today its so sweet
    im confused  the description on walmart site said indoraptor as if they put the description for another figure in its place    im confused lol
  the item description had some indoraptor aspects but rest assured i can confirm it is a mistake and that the figure is an indominus rex
     arms and slick black scales    cant say that sounds too much like the indominus rex to me more like a colossal indoraptor honestly  like you i have no idea what to make of it
  cant give you more than my word right now but i assure you i rex not an indoraptor not a t rex but indominus rex hopefully some pics can surface soon but for now i dont got more than this
  gimmicky hate it already sounds like some imaginext figure or some wackedout hasbro figure sigh guess well see when we get pictures but it doesnt sound too good we all know more gimmicks means less poseability
  ok would really love to see some pics cause that will be pretty exciting i just hope they got the sculpt and size proportions scale  length right i have a lot of anticipation for this figure and hope it completely kills the old jw hasbro one by comparison
recently picked the revoltech trex and its great anyone know any other dinosaur figures that are as poseable also anyone know of any raptor figures that are in scale
  say what the best price i could get this little beastie at
  i got it for 5400 yen at mandarake had to scour the site for awhile though
  beasts of the mesozoic   very poseable needs included stand for support  walking with dinosaurs ultimate gorgon  solid figure if a little doofy looking  resaurus dinosaurs/carnage collection theropods need their included stand to support rubber body bendable tail  primeval raptor  similar to resaurus but can move neck up and down and a soft unposable tail can stand a little better    stylized  beast box pic related  transforms into a cube    skellingtons  rement pose skeleton dinosaurs  small also comes in other animals  skeleflex  older ones have fragile joints
  what does that come out to in usd      similar but not a dinosaur though it is rather saurianesc the revlotech monster hunters vulkonlog seems pretty cool
  nvm thats not bad have a link by chance and how much was shipping
  they dont have any in stock currently your gonna have to check periodically if they get one  
  thanks ill look into those
  thanks do they restock often
so hows the quest for indominus set
  its random mandarake are physical stores in japan that randomly get stock and each individual store could get one i think i checked for about a month before i saw one
  ok good to know thanks anon
  isnt this the one that was using bucks colors in the photos    i actually own that brute tigrex  its fun and posable though the joints on mine are a bit stiff  it wont scale well with jp toys though  tigrex is supposed to be pretty big and it comes with a mini hunter a stand an effect piece to replicate its slam attack and an optional severed tail tip theres 3 variants that i know of  the one in your pic is brute tigrex but theres also the default orange one and a red molten tigrex repaint another saurian monster hunter revoltech is the rathalos in pic related also posable comes with a fireball accessory mini hunter pose stand and severable tail tip like tigrex and comes in 3 of the 4 variant colors  standard red azure and silver los is a bit more difficult to get on its pose stand due to where it attaches but its a nice posable wyvern that scales well with tigrex but again not at all with most jurassic park figures
  what does that come out to in usd  about 4758 usd im assuming that price doesnt include shipping and handling
  anon if you have so much anticipation you know the stuff is good please practice patience and optimism on release dates and products that havent even come out yet i can   promise you we will be getting many things we havent been shown at all yet and nothing has been cancelled the line is too hot for that
  theyre all so beautiful thank god they are coming out slowly to give my wallet a chance to recover
  all about the indo skeleton and if you dont have a mosasaurs you have to
got those paints you guys recommended got a couple battle damage blues gonna try making the jw raptor squad starting with echo i did a test on a mini first to find a color scheme i liked i did two probably gonna go with the color scheme on the right
  good deal make sure you thin em and use several layers that will retain the detain in the sculpt michaels has the testors washes so you can start trying dark washes on your customs to really bring out the details then some dry brushing to really make em pop
  wow thats neat never heard of them before till looking up the revlotech trex how much do they usually cost
  its speculated that the buck doesnt actually come with the generator piece    the original shot with the buck in box was part of a quality sample of several items you can see a bunch of random stuff around it loose  the generator can be seen sitting almost loose on the edge of the box  suggesting its not part of it     also we have a pic of the rex with a yellow junior variant suggesting they come together     hope that helps
thinking of doing a lil bit of customizing on my indoraptor   any good ideas for the color of the pupils thinking some shade of red yellow or orange with black pupils    maybe a slightly lighter shade of black for the claws    thought about doing the custom teeth ive seen others do but kinda hesitant to drill holes to put the new teeth in because knowing my luck id fuck up and go through sonewhere    whenever the indos finally go on clearance in my area ill probably get one and go buck wild  dark metallic body  bright metallic or neon blue or purple
  thinking about an indo custom too i drew the head i liked gonna sculpt a little and repaint itll be   larger eyes both of them cataractish one of them with a scar similar to the troodon  allosaurus like crests  horns on the back of the head  maybe larger quills  small head shape tweaks  paintll be the same with a light beige underbelly

  i got both my azure rathalos and brute tigrex for between 4555 new off of mandarake a few years back theye getting a bit harder to track down for a reasonable price these days as they came out theres a new box opened for inspection otherwise unused original color tigrex on mandarake right now search the japanese version of the site and use its japanese name ティガレックス going for 6500 yen 5729 usd both red and silver rathalos are on the english version of the site red is going for 6000 yen 5289 usd and silver is going for 6500 yen or 5729 usd look for リオレウス both with boxes opened for quality checks but otherwise new condition  if mandarake isnt your thing theres currently a vulcanlog brute tigrex on amazon us going for around 6646 the original color and molten versions are both going for over 110 as are the rathalos variants though  tldr youll have to look on the secondhand market for them now and they should average between 5565 usd though they can be as high as 130 if you dont dig around a bit    ah ok  that makes sense so still no sightings of him in the wild yet
okay current projects  allosaurus repaint  raptor squad repaints  suchomimus repaint  indoraptor
mfw i underestimated the size of everything in the quest for indominus set  got the mosa sitting on top of my bookshelf but until i get my room rearranged and a display case put somewhere the skeleton is gonna have to stay in the box not sure what to do with the sub
  this will happen
  if the posability is done through wire and not articulation it will unironically drop from the top of my wishlist and onto the not gonna waste my money list
  mattel isnt gonna be doing actual real feel figures textured semisoft platic like the mosasaur is what theyre sticking with
  why
  same difference
  ive owned dozens of wire articulated figures probably close to 50 in total and none of them were ever great some of them were straight up awful but even the best ones werent even above average
    will never happen like this its not durable or practical for a figure this big and its never been done by kenner mattel or hasbro in the history of the jp toy franchise nor is it common for large mass production toy companies to go that route the most likely thing we will see is solid plastic like the collosal or semisoft plastic like the mosasaurus there is no major reason for mattel to start randomly making some of there figures rubber with wires for articulation or real feel for that matter hard plastic is often the easiest cheaper and more practical way to go with a toy line as most companies know   articulation is not a huge thing it seems in this line with the exception of the the indoraptor for some reason many figure have the basic 5 points of articulation but nothing particular complex or dynamic about them as for as poseability what they lack in complexity they make up for in sculpt and paint job on average which has been pretty good so far honestly it would be nice to have more super articulated figures a good example is vivids walking with dinosaurs 3d ultimate gorgon figure that was loaded with articulation it would be nice to see mattel try for more figures like that and it would really sell in my opinion
is target actually starting to stock spinos in stores or are all of these flukes in their system
  i dont know but the amount of online stock theyve had recently makes me hopeful its definitely more than just getting rid of the scraps
   arthur tx  hey thats not too far from were ill be on vaca in a few months
  i recall mattel announcing 112 scale blue and owen figures not too long ago designed to have the same level of articulation or close as the indoraptor figure has has this been scrapped or are we still getting these
  these have yet to get officially license yet do its a maybe set for fall of 2019
oh so it does exist   
  dun dun duah
  what are you doing to that poor thing  common fixes are the teeth so what on earth are you doing
  delta  fuck yes more raptor squad  shame its attack pack though and if they had to pick one otheer than blue makes since its delta since she had her own lil sub arc    also echo  no sign of charlie    wtf where is best girl
  dunno just fucking it up wanted to make my own indo and see how it turns out
  were indeed im sure many who saw this including myself were wondering the same thing im sure they have plans to do one and its under one of the mystery upcs they got there         glad we have official confirmation on the indominus rex via the link cant wait to see what it looks like
  this sounds rad but even without that the albertosaurs so amazing looking that id grab it ahead of any other upcoming figure a shame that ill bet its going to be one of the longest waits of the upcoming lines for some reason maybe because of its weird size
  wonder if the albertasaurus is the only mbd figure in the line i personally doubt it though but who knows
  interestingly enough it bears some resemblance to the the albertasaurus from primevalnew world
  actually buying a figure of that cancererous power fantasy mary sue zia rodriguez  you are everything wrong with the fandom
  how do you guys sterilize figures that come open like this i can only imagine the filthy kids and adults that finger the figure trying out its features with their unwashed germ ridden hands
  very similar it seems interesting
  there might be another mbd since the price for bd5 is 2199 instead of the usual 984    
  no zia rodriguez is a much bigger problem nobody likes those political messages they are ruining our childhood with this pc garbage wish we could go back to the days when a velociraptor and t rex was enough to scare us like the magic of spielberg even dennis nedrys computer saying nuh uh uh gave me the creeps not making up dinosaurs or having a dude who can train raptors and escapes death every second like its a game zia is a garbage character to the jurassic franchise
  my problem with the character is this she never worked at jurassic park so all of her medical expertise is pure theory since i doubt they teach dino surgery in mainstream educational facilities she also possess no sense of danger even if shes an ex marine you should have the necessary training on assessing a situation and taking the necessary action to deescalate a situation instead she walks around like someone who enabled a godmode cheat and doesnt need to worry about dying
  not that anon but one of my favorite aspects of this line is the humans i bought zia specifically from the completionist slant of it but shes a terrible looking figure its like they translated her characters personality into the sculpt
  i would have posed her getting eaten by raptors or a trex but in current year people will just screech at me that i hate woman and im an incel
  curious if its not the 2nd concavenator or a carnotaurus by chance
  i just use lysol wipes the ones that come in a big plastic can       im not sure why the medical part is a sticking point since the movie itselfthe character herself in fact makes a point of saying she doesnt have handson experience being a vet student who interned at masrani and was preparing to enter to field doesnt exactly make it that crazy that she understood the basics of what was needed to deal with blue and that guesswork and luck would probably play a factor     as for the danger part i just kind of assumed she was generally also a slight lunatic which makes her a funny counterpoint to frankinwho gets to come into his own competence in a more lowkey way
  hope its a carno
  no most of us agree movies nowadays have to touch on every gender and every race for the cast blows
ok this is new how could someone not notice this seriously how
  haha wow walmart doesnt care about security
  lmao
  from what i hear from my friends in retail theyre not paid enough to worry if poor walmart gets ripped off
  typically what happens is  asshat buys toy  switches it out with something else typically something cheap  takes it up to costumer service with the receipt and wants a refund  95 of the time even when said item has obviously been switched out and the person at the desk know it aint kosher the managers above em will tell em to do it anyways  its few and far between to see any real brass balls from mangers when customers start wanting a refund usually takes the same person bringing in shit all the time wanting refunds before the foot is brought down
  this is why i come here that is hilarious
  dr wu has gone too far
  sad part is some parent would probably get that for their kid for christmas
  oh god poor kid will never know the joy of a collosal trex 
  poor kid whos parent is that dumb lol
  do you guys even read the description talks about an indoraptor
  wtf its a colossal indoraptor    where is the real indominus rex
  what he made a foraptor and callled it a trex
    its a poor description that recycles elements the figure itself is confirmed an indominus rex
  oh ok this is weird i hope there is more than one indominus rex figure though something like the ec rex or spinosaurus i hope lights and electronics arent my thing and doesnt really make a figure collector worthy at least in my opinion
  im thinking it will be in scale to the spino and ec around the size of the thrash and throw
sorry for piss poor pic but the dino dna book comes with a better baby blue and this beauty right here
  well technically dimetrodon is the only synapsid and the rest are diapsids
  former walmart associate here its all true no one ever bothered to check if merchandise was being stolen unless they were asset protection or supervisors typical associate parttimer response walmart makes billions a year they can afford it    and its no surprise that the store i worked at had over 2m in shrinkage for several years straight
  were be the rest of da pics
  i love this persons art do you know where he/she posts their stuff would love to see the rest of them
  the artist is benjamin mackey he has done drawings of almost every jp/jw toy thats been made it seems i love the art soo much just makes me fall in love with the toys all over again     if you want i can post what i have so far
  raptor quad lol
  cant help but admire his style
  here is a link to one of his sites if you want it  qvfevlq0mjfjsmw2c0g2q0nlu19nz21icgfdwex4n3zermu4d1zcdhvjnlnvynvpcmngqwtmu2zitnhgshjsm2iys3fitny5wuf2oxrmngrya1pur1p0aq
  im not sure an indom at that scale is big enough to swallow full figures     plus the leaker did say we are getting another colossal of some sort
  pics      a mattel rep might come by before that and remedy the situation ive seen them take away 1 arms indos at target
  i could see a colossal indominus and a colossal triceratops plus normal scale indom rex demand is there
  any way to buy that book in stores
  are the baby blues feet separate or are they stuck together
  wouldnt lysol wipes be too harsh on the figure material
    what would you like to see in a 118 scale indominus rex for starters
      they are stuck together there are some cringe kid reviews on youtube dino dna book    i got mine from targetcom for 10 its on amazon as well
  besides that honestly they have made the main dinosaurs i would want if they re did chaos effect and made ultimasaurus that would be a dream come true i also really want the jungle explorer more playsets would be cool too    in another note i just found masie today at a ghetto meijer of all places
  oh god get out you saboteur theres so many more real dinosaurs they can do sorry youre bored
  thanks for the info i picked up the only copy at a books a million and the girl said they must be new shes never seen them hoping for more hatchlings
  i would like them to keep it simple maybe make an extreme chompin or thrash and throw version for the regular scale mouth and tail action then when it comes to the super colossal indominus i would like to keep it basic will probably have a translucent stomach where it holds the swallowed figures       on another note would like to see a massive mini dino release covering all new species from dino rivals and any species missed that the indominus could counter the super col rex and the first wave minis throw in the explorer as a play set with lex and tim and lets get hammond and nedry and more large herbivores like the iguanadon with the brachiosaurus and apatosaurus a roland tumbo with elephant rifle and ingen humvee with the pachycephalasaurus capture claw would be great
  im not bored im still loving the line heel they are coming out with 2 dinos i didnt know i wanted there just isnt any specific dinosaurs i can think of that i needin my life     but jurassic park 2 vehicles now that would be a hell of a line especially an updated mobile command center
  sound effects some chompin action  good articulation this line has proven its self so i know ill be happy with just about what evertranslucent guts sound cool though
  with curry eating action
  are you from india or something
   guts    never that would be absolutely ridiculous and in accurate no offense
  
    so your referring to simon masrani
    funny story the i rex didnt eat simon
someone make a meme out of this its asking for it
  wow photo shoot on drugs
  dilo blocking carno  carno can never catch a break
  assuming all dinos have killing claws on feet    some might consider that racisss
   you just assume my genus
  kekekekek    i identify as a maniraptoran not a bied thank you
  bird dammit
  dont talk nonsense nothing is confirmed
  hes really amazing these two herreras are so cool love this one as well our poor cancelled destructasaur
i typically only buy jp/jw stuff but as i dont think we will ever get an oviraptor i went ahead and got myself a chap mei oviraptor feels kinda dirty but it doesnt look half bad and scales pretty well 115x75 centimeters    do you guys mix with other brands
  forgot pic ffs
  looks cool could always be an attack pack in the future
  not too bad for a cheap chinasaur right wouldnt look to off next to the mattel offerings    and true they have already covered bunch of lesser known dinosaurs like minmi proceratosaurus dracorex
  yeah i was just looking at a couple but i couldnt bastardize the mattel collection like that just shows the possibilities with this line though right attack packs galore you need to check out the dino dna book by scholastic that just game out there are two dope hatchlings inside
  i hear you it does feel a little wrong and indeed endless possibilities big fan of the attack packs good bang for your buck not even bothered by the several repaints good way to do a little pack building     cool thanks for the heads up need some decent hatchlings actually the small ones that come with the humans dont quite do it and the minifigs arent the best for that either
  ugh it sucks so much that not only did they not see full distribution but were canceled as well    i love how his art just makes you feel so much more love or nostalgia for these figures and pain at the ones you may never see or are to poor to get your hands on    rip legacy ec spino
  this is true
  i have every dino galli and raptor repainted i say bring on more the jurassic world evolution deinonychus would be a great attack pack
  how great would it be to see some hatchlings in the surprise bag or at least the babies as a legacy package
  meant dilo but every dino too
  feels how you say how you say photoshopped
    say whats your fav peice of his so far
  it is quite obvious i with the mattel one would be as asceticly pleasing i know it wont but i am ok with lowering my standards its mattel
  wish not with
  just go with the flow they have been doing well and i trust it will be next years spino
i hope the second mbd is something different wouldnt it be amazing if it were a kronosaurus or some other large pliosaur great companion to the plesiosaur wouldnt you think
  i am with you on that 100 good sir i wouldnlike to see them do every species real no hybrid shit from jw evolution it seems some of the sculpts were almost more modeled after evolution than the movie and some sculpts were more scientifically accurate than the on from fk it seems
  god i love pliosaurs so much i always wanted one as a kid like the lipluodon from bbcs walking with dinosaurs
ok it the last month of 2018 people we need the final assessment of the mattel jurassic line   what are the best figures from this line and what do yall hope to see in 2019
so what is the best roarivore of of this line
  really wish the allosaurus was after the game not the movie lol
  gonna go with baryonyx
    man i would love it if they did a massive pliosaur like kronosaurus or predator x  dont you    rex btfo
  as long as it feels like the mosasaurus
  damn feels like it was only yesterday with all these time flies    carnotaurus and tnt take the cake for me love that they went with the jp3 pteranodon over jw as for the future may they bring us some cool dinos and since repaints are inevitable may they look fantastic
  o god some here it looks like shit especially the sculpt and design i hate it so much never bought it for exactly that reason       hanging teeth and the inaccurate overbite wtf was mattel thinking
  i am with you on that  minus the tnt though but carno and so many more are my favs for sure
   shit sculpt
    i would love to see it have more sculpt detail than the mosa presently has than i would be on board for sure     poor plesiosaur 
  doesnt even have binocular vision    suchomimus is very fun
  ikr its shit want a new allo   ya hear me mattel new allosaurus new sculpt new design new everthing oh and bigger too
  oh i love that bad boy so much fun and beautiful too not a fan of the dino rivals one though looks bad and paint job looks unnatural hope the make more than one for the line id be down for a well painted bd suchomimis for sure how about you
has anyone seen the yellow battle damage raptor or battle damage pteranodon in walmart in person
  have pteranodon inhand from a shiptostore raptors avoiding me like it owes me money ditto the additional one of each im trying to find for a friend    desu while the paint is nicely done bd pteranodon is really nothing special nice if you can get it but nothing worth hocking a kidney over or anything
  yeah i caught the yellow one at like 4 am randomly weeks ago wonder if they will ever hit stores same with the legacy dilo and jp3 male raptor
  allosaurus didnt have binocular vision though
  lmao
old thread     it accessory pack announced target stocking predator wave 18 hornhead seems to be hit or miss at locations
full details coming soon interesting
    toyark has a photo shoot of the elm street accessory set too
    ultimate gremlin photo shoot
  still no deadlights head  yawn
can i still preorder the turtles from gamestop instore i wanna save money on shipping
  yes you should be able to i havent heard about any cut off on the orders
  frampt
  pretty much i actually hoped for an it accessory pack and now that theyve shown it im completely underwhelmed
  i mean the street scene is cool not really an accessory though    then the 2 clowns were shown in the background for like 2 seconds in one scene and the rest of the accessories we already have kinda lame as a whole to be honest
  order the 4pack online and get free shipping plus a 2 coupon itll take up to two weeks for delivery though
  can we just talk about how 3 of these accessories are already included in other figures hell anyone who owns the fucking standard pennywise already has 2 of these
request can someone place pennywise next to a bionicle any bionicle
  depends tim curry or bill skarsgård
    they couldve just put the new heads and hands from the well house version into an accessory pack cant imagine a reason to buy this unless youre collecting every single piece of merch
  love the sewer base/dio but the rest of the set feels uninspired
  gonna suck my own dick for a second and say that i prefer the stuff i came up with a few threads back that sewer dio is awesome tho but the rest is rehashed or lackluster plus including these heads and hands wouldve prevented me from having to buy yet another 2017 pennywise
  same  repackaging the balloon and boat is some really scummy shit to do and having to buy whole extra figures for expressions is a big part of what bugs me about their noes line  hell at least the elm street figures had the excuse of being based on different movies
  doesnt matter
  gib release date cunts
  holy shit i didnt think snake freddy was that big
  having to buy whole extra figures for expressions  i mean thats how it works thats how these lines thrive and stay afloat there has to be some reuse to offset costs yes it does suck but if it doesnt happen somewhere then the amount of variety gets cut way down
is the neca hawkins figure any good not a fan of the character but the body serves as a good swap/cannon fodder any pics of the removable backpack
  odd but ive got you 1/2        these would have been preferable eh 30 saved i guess
  2/2
why does it come with another ss georgie and balloon
  the backpack isnt removable at least it sure doesnt feel that way on mine but yeah its a good figure though if you want it for customizing not sure if itd be worth it
  you mean like it is glued/connected to the back directly i thought the backpack is hold on by just the 2 straps just pop both arms out and remove it
  neat
  another thing that gets me is neca has pretty much milked the cow dry with the first movie theres no telling what will be recycled for the next movie and its very well possible well get another pennywise with any/aloof these accessories
  thats how business works strike while you can
    thanks
daddy wants his gremlins michael myers and chucky 2 pack b4 christmas
fixed these
    i like how i made a custom rose box for my t800 which neca retweeted and then two years later ripped it off for the 3d t800
i have a 20 off coupon from target what necas should i get bros
  what do they have that youre eying
  oh shit i was really hoping theyd make a sewer curb like this definitely gonna buy it    balloon and boat are pretty shit accessories to include though would have liked the flute woman painting or maybe a burning easter egg or something they could have at least put the i heart derry print on the balloon
  neca are scum and your surprised
  oooh the flute woman painting wouldve been cool its a nice set though and for 30 that aint bad i wouldnt have minded some more things but this works
  how is it ripped off its not an original concept of yours
  so randy said that the ultimate t800 has been reissued in stores in a tweet at first i assumed he meant the t2 arnold t800 but i havent seen any sign of him so now im assuming he meant the endoskeleton has anyone here seen the ultimate t2 arnold figure in targets or anywhere
  hello neca
  you didnt answer his question      i havent seen the ultimate terminator anywhere yet myself no i did see the endoskeleton at targets though
    i went and checked their release calendar and theyre calling the endo the t800 endoskeleton so i think thats what he was talking about
does anyone have experience with the rerelease of ultimate gizmo did neca do anything to fix the issues with the way the faces fit    id like to get it since ultimate gremlin and spike are coming but not if its still a problem
  spike  fuck me stripe obvs
  whats wrong with the way the faces fit i have the first release and i hadnt heard about any issues there nor did i run into any problems
  they dont fit flush leaving the eyes looking really sunken in
really excited for this one
  why cock so small ive seen goats with larger cock than that
  because screen accuracy if anything they made it bigger than it is in the actual movie
  pale man too  guillermo was on some clive barker shit when he came up with these designs
      looks great but why didnt they leave the blood splatter on guess its easily fixable at least
  not sure im looking at an old ladys saggy belly or a vagina
  blood splatter is gay and scene specific ruining a figure and those who wanted it are gay and want to ruin figures
  huh they always fit on mine did you try using some heat maybe
big boy is still coming and has an alternate head
  the figure looks really good but man that movie really killed any interest i had towards this figure
  is it really that bad almost pulled the trigger on buying digital the other night
  if you like the idea of predator hunting an autistic child for dna and ruin everything that made predator cool then go ahead if that sounds completely retarded and insane to you then keep away i personally would just watch it to laugh at how bad it is though
in the last thread someone posted one of the new ultimate aliens figures with a really badly warped leg i just received one as a gift and it has the same issue is hot and cold water the best way to fix that
  i liked it for what it was ignore this whiner here hes boiling the movie down to the simplest point to bitch about  its basically the action hero predator movie everyone wanted that ends up getting completely tboned by another predator thus making it follow the predator formula perfectly in a weird way
  it nowhere near follows the predator formula what movie have you seen that boiled down plot point takes up the whole 3rd and last half of the 2nd act of the film and its completely retarded not to mention all the editing problems weak character motivations or matter of fact lack of any all the characters basically boiling down to being the same a jokester all the completely bad dialog and jokes that fall flat turning the franchise into a generic alien invasion series or maybe the basic point that preds are taking dna from their prey which doesnt make sense as their prey lost meaning theyre injecting themselves with something inferior to them     just because this is a dumb action movie doesnt mean it does anything right with predator the only thing that they really kept true too was the predator not killing olivias character because she was unarmed how in any way does the fugitive pred getting tboned by another one follow the formula perfectly is that seriously the only aspect youre looking at that small little point and not the rest of the film bet you love transformers too objectively bad film is still objectively bad
but anyway lets keep on the subject of necas toys
will they ever rerelease their rocky line and has anyone ever asked about creed figures i would buy all of that shit
  i think i read on their twitter that rocky is a no go
  thats a lot of words just to sound retarded anon shouldnt you be happy the predators want your brain oh wait never mind you cant even fucking read
  wow turning to insults like a true faggit i can also go to that level too didnt even actually respond to anything i said i see claiming that i didnt read when i responded to your shit response repeating the things you said but hey you be you maybe next time actually respond to someones response with a counter argument instead of calling someone a retard youll look better and smarter
  same anon as  and yeah if youre interested in preds in general i wouldnt stop you since it had some okay things going for it    the fugitive predator was pretty great some of the cast actually had decent chemistry but what little the movie had going for it died when the bigger predator comes into the picture its even more jarring when you have the fugitive predator as an example of predator with practical effects done right in contrast the big predator is this cgi monstrosity that feels like a bizarre caricature of predators     that said the figure still looks cool but ive basically lost interest after seeing the movie
  oh yeah the fugitive predator was the best part and there was some good chemistry between some of the cast but the writing editing etc problems really brought it down still want that assassin pred figure though
  sound like youre the next step in human evolution
  yep boiling water will reset the plastic real quick
    toledo ohio saw a few t2 arnolds at target
  learn to spell faggot first
its okay to buy toys from terrible franchise ruining movies    i own the alien covenant figures after all
  bitching about the predators is kinda dumb anyway people hated avp as a movie and even sorta the way the preds looked but loved those figures
  is that the only thing you will talk about a misspelling pathetic
  oh definitely i own the alien covenant figures as well even though i thought the movie as terrible honestly its just a matter of how much the source affects your view of the figure or not
  i only got the neomorph and its accessory pack kinda wish i got the other alien too
  i agree i love my ultimate alien warrior
is there a trick to identifying fake necas
  nothing full proof just stay away from everything thats listing is based in china
  okay will do i dont know if you or anyone else has bought fake necas but are they generally bad i just bought sylvanas windrunner from ebay and im worried that its fake its coming from nevada i think and it wasnt cheap but i saw a ton of them super cheap that i assumed were fake i plan on opening it to pose it and stuff but ive never had a neca figure before and dont know what to expect with the joints
  honestly not bad some paint apps are off and they can be stiff but a heat gun or boiling water will loosen those fuckers right up
  alright thanks ill try that if its an issue i was mostly worried that the string on her bow looked loose but i just realized i can retie the string to make it tighter ive got high hopes for this since its my first neca figure
  neca has great sculpts but they are more limited to possibility when compared to other brands so keep your expectations reasonable they are know for sculpt over possibility
  those heroes figures were surprisingly nice never played most of them but i really liked the toys
  i watched a review before making the purchase and i agree with neca having great sculpts thats the main reason i wanted her     i actually never played heroes of the storm but i really wanted a sylvanas figure after watching the battle for azeroth cinematic
  really wanted a sylvanas figure after watching the battle for azeroth cinematic  gross
  it had amazing quality and detail im not a fan of the expansion but i really enjoyed the video i actually havent played in years
  i just feel like wow completely ruined sylvanas as a character turning her into the most boring evilbut not really badass stronk gurl
  full proof  i guess i just take it for granite that for all intensive purposes its a pretty doggy dog world with bootlegs on ebay a lot of these figures are the spitting image of the real ones and ebay needs to nip it in the butt
anyone know when ultimate gremlin will be hitting targets i might pull the trigger and get him and gizmo together as a personal xmas gift
  take it out of the package if its already broken or breaks just from moving a joint its real
my fiance bought me this as a very early christmas gift and i just absolutely love the detail and overall look hes 18 inches tall and hefty as hell absolutely love this figure
  wow havent seen you use that same joke before over and over again so original       oh nice their current 18 figures look amazing the last one i got was the redone big chap i was so tempted on their spiderman though
all the stores around me that carried necas have shut down my local target doesnt have one single neca sad times  i miss toys r us
  feed me seymour
  he really is the picture might not do him total justice but in person hes quite terrifying more so with the mask off they really nailed the eyes though when the mask is on you can just sense the dread its crazy
  you got a good fiance    and i lied i forgot all about my 18 tmnt that i goti guess getting the 7 made me temporarily forget about them i need to find a good place to pose them and still allow room for shredhead
  how do the 7 turtles scale next to other neca figures i havent seen any pics yet are they taller than the old comic turtles they did a decade ago
  yes much taller than those but theyre pretty well in scale with most of the neca figures id say
i think noes2 freddy is a solid version might get the dw one and still debating the accessory pack
  god damn it i hate how it flips the fucking images when you upload from mobile
  edit them first
predator monkey never
  neat ive got the gamestop ones on preorder and ive been wondering if i should display them with the rest of my neca stuff or do something solo for them
so since sh monsterarts has revealed mothra godzilla rodan and king ghidorahs figures how long do you all think we will see something from neca with their king of the monsters line
  give it a year
  well get godzilla and thats if were lucky
  you do know theyve already confirmed theyre doing all of them right and weve already seen the mothra prototype
  hes definitely a gem in a world full of rocks thanks though    consider me jealous i want to get my hands out those so damn badly treat them well       pretty certain i own this version i have yet to open him still working on my horror themed glass cabinet and i have plenty of baddies to open    really cool pose and effect
  i give it a week 2 at most    cats outta the bag now so no huge reason to hold off showing em    really interested to see how their legendary ghidorah and rodan will stack up to the monsterarts
  i havent so thats actually news to me pretty cool then
is anybody else waiting on the prior ultimate jungle hunter to come back out on one of the thirdparty websites very eager to get a prayer for some of my set ups but i would really like to get the original before the end of the year
  im getting the feeling that the predator movie was massively recut
  she was so good i got two
    what the fuck is this how out of the loop am i
    how predators get aids
  the offspring of alpha predator after he fucks the autismo boy being that autism is the next level of evolution  all that shit
  good also  multy  christ why cant artists spell
  apparently the movie was going to involve more hybrids and would have actually helped make the movie make a hair more sense as to who these particular preds were splicing themselves the dogs the ultrapred and various other animals with their dna     
  this   movie makes much more sense as the preds of the movie just being a radical scientist fringe group like godamn dr wuu with better gene splicing technology and a higher budget
  i recently bought a big chap knock off its honestly pretty good same sculpt and id say arguably better paint work than the original or at least a more realistic shade of dark however the articulation is a lot more limited due to the different joints they used and the figure isnt nearly as poseable as its original counterpart like others said try to avoid things that are listed as based in china   from what i know some of the knock offs actually come from the same factory that they do the original figures just with some minor or not so minor defects i also have a leatherface knockoff and its pretty much 100 like the original but one of the shoulder joints is lower than it should be and its noticeable
  it made me appreciate p2 and predators even more its okay for one watch and it is an entertaining movie but thats about it
  think of it as an r rated marvel movie
  think of it as an r rated marvel movie  logan and/or deadpool
  predator was this original slasher where instead of faggy teens the monster butchers rambos and action heroes now he kills literal autists and retards
  marvel like disney marvel not the cool part marvel like fox and venommmmmm
  foxmen  venom  cool  man /toy/ has the worst taste imaginable
  is this what happens when you grow up on the mcu
  name one mcu shit better than logan deadpool or venom ill wait
  guardians of the galaxy winter soldier civil war ragnarok etc
  logan and deadpool are great but the rest of the xmen films past the first two have been extremely hit or miss so theyre hardly what should be considered the average quality fox film
  nah more like the banter an structure of one but just more vulgar and violent its dumb but a good type of dumb
  venom was mediocre at best dont even act like the film was even good
  guardians  ragnarok  shit taste quipshit detected
  name one mcu film worse than x3 f4ntastic xmen apocalypse spiderman 3 or tasm 2 ill wait
you guys can argue about marvel movies in the marvel thread thanks    pale mans gonna be in a big ol box

so long before hentai was a meme hentai was a pretty important thing to me i identified with hentai in a lot of ways and so i acquired a fairly large hentai collection it sort of became a part of my identity people knew me as the hentai guy in recent years i havent felt the same the collection hasnt been on display for about seven years now is it time to let go i dont want to sell it and then end up missing something that meant so much to me
  is this your collection

  take your copy paste shite back to the shrek thread
lets have a thread about /toy/ advent calendars  do you have any what did you get today  do you remember any great ones from your childhood
ashens is doing his calendar opening with nerdcubed again        sadly no crappy poundland calendars
my son has the 2018 star wars lego one and my daughter has the 2017 ice skating in the forest playmobil one  last year i had the tmnt one from megabloks    i didnt get one for myself this year but ive noticed heaps of different toy ones in stores compared to other years like matchbox car ones and ooshirs etc
previous thread     this thread is for the discussion of scale plastic and resin models kits  post photos of your builds in progress and your finished builds  have your builds critiqued or critique others  discuss tips and techniques  ask for advice or give advice to others        some helpful guides to get started                        plus there are tons of people on youtube with pretty good videos on techniques etc    sites to purchase models extras and supplies   us   us   us   hk   hk   jp   jp   uk   pl   aus   us carry mr color and gaianotes paint   uk  
done for the night the hull had some rough spots for lack of a better definition that with the grey primer where hard to see but with the green became pretty clear so i have to retouch two small areas im undecided if i should bother with modulation because it will be hard to see unless i exaggerate it quite a bit and i would rather not waste time and paint  as for the camo scheme i asked some more people and theres a tie between 2 and 3 from  but ill go with the 3 as its easier and more contrasting also more useful to try to camo the barn sized tank    they look neat but seeing it in grey im definitely going camo with my prince the day i find the will to continue with her
  also more useful to try to camo the barn sized tank  well    as for the ship yeah it is a lot of grey and that even with the two quite dissimilar grey tones used here to liven things up somewhat
  thats pretty interesting also something they should do in the upcoming gup movies desu
anybody have any decent guides on how to paint up a mak kit
  just paint why do you need a guide for that its really straight forward
i finished dot filters and then kinda lost interest
im just having all the luck with der sockelshop back in spring i bought a modellecollect t72 from them and got the wrong transfers now i bought a heller m4a2 got the wrong transfers and only half of the instructions      thats about where my brain would kick into full get it done mode
    how is that sockelshops fault
  its not just bad luck but when bad luck strikes twice in a row with one seller and never with anyone else alanis morisette puts on her english mauling shoes
  that looks really good
anyone here into 1/24 model car kits
  id like to but im not comfortable with my ability to lay down smooth paint coats with an airbrush
  this  i weather my kits for a reason
does anyone else think testors dullcote is shit it always leaves this hue on whatever it touches it makes things look like they have dust or cobwebs on them
  i got revells starsky and hutch car for 7 dollars out of hobby lobbys clearance bin     hopefully the youtube tutorial im following works out
    sounds like you need to build a few for the practice then
  maybe i should have you built any cars what paint did you use
  not in the last quarter of a century or so
oh wow the caproni ca313 is a aircraft with a really cool history lets check the kits  its all italeri     should i just bite the bullet there is some aftermarket photoetch
    youre welcome
  i appreciate the effort but thats a 311 the engines are completely different
  whats special about the 313  t know nothing about italian planes
  go for it following your heart as far as subjects go should be a great way to improve your modelling skills or at least youll get plenty of training as you end up building a bunch of short run kits from some ukranian basement ancient frogripoffbyacademy and so on italieri cant be all that bad in such company can they imo the baseline is generally to be happy a kit exists at all in whatever scale you want it in
  theyre outdated poss bought by the swedish airforce in 1940 right before italy joined the war because the swedish armed forces suddenly woke up and realized there was a huge war next door so they bought a bunch of outdated aircraft and four outdated destroyers from italy  would be a fun little project and honestly it looks pretty nice
  a few pictures from flygvapenmuseum in case they turn out helpful
      what a hot plane something about italian 3040s designs gives me boner and that glassedin nose in particular
  very appreciated i feel obligated to share the operational history of this aircraft in swedish service information take from the swedish wikipedia page    the caproni ca313 was in service between the years 1940 and 1940 and had the swedish designation b16 s 16 and tp 16 when the royal swedish air force materiel administration kungliga flygförvaltningen kff failed to buy recon aircraft from the us and uk 1940 an opportunity to buy outdated war materiel from italy materialized a deal was made for several ships aircraft and engines that no longer fitted the italian armed forces    at the capronifactory there was a number of unsold engineless ca313 planes meant to france sweden ordered 84 planes that were modified to fit the italian aircooled inverted v12engine from isoota fraschini kff chose to buy complete aircraft as there were no domestic engines to put in them already during the delivery flight to sweden the planes showed problems italian engineers from caproni traveled to germany to repair the planes    the aircraft had a short service life in the swedish air force due to constant malfunctions and failures in the press it was called the flying coffin negligence during the production and deficiencies in the materials were some of the reasons but also faulty use by the air force the negligence was so prevalent that it was suspected that they had been sabotaged as they were orginially supposed to be sold to france     cont next post
  the aircraft was originally used for dive bombing which they were not designed for several incidents and failures could be ascribed to lacking cockpit discipline but especially the fuel system an additional cause was the wartime fuel called bentol which corroded the varnish on the fuelseals in the engine carburetors which led to fuel leaking and engine fires   to correct the worst structural faults 300 civilian carpenters were called in to repair and change among other things water damaged wood in the wings   the caparoni got a unjustly bad reputation a total of 21 aircraft were made completely unusable 3 were shot down by the luftwaffe and a total of 41 crewmen were killed during the period 194045 a statistic that doesnt show more problems than what was to be expected of a aircraft with that amount of flight time during that time   the last flight with the b 16 was made in april 1945 and the remaining planes were scrapped burnt during fire exercises or used as targets     not a single plane was preserved    the aircarft at the museum is a replica made for the tvshow tre kärlekar but is a proper representation of how it would have looked during the war
  adding what i can the museum replica was made using original blueprints and a few original parts as the nose camera shows us it was a recon one which seems to be what they all ended up as after the dive bombing thing failed to pull up    as for the reputation loosing about 44 of the original fleet every year of service is indeed not all too terrible we lost about 475 of our mosquitos j 30 and 67 of our re 2000 j 20 every year but as the ca 313 had a four man crew it did rack up the fatalities when it came down so thats probably a large part of the bad name it got of course the other three here in the comparison are also about the worst of the worst in the swedish air force also worth noticing here of course is that all three of these crash queens are by and large wartime production aircraft expected to be riddled with bullet holes or shrapnel not too long after entering service ensuring a long lifespan through high build quality simply wasnt worth it but as the swedish air force didnt get its aircraft shot to pieces on a regular basis but also couldnt get new ones very easily things were dire enough that the shit we bought from the italians included 60 cr42 biplanes to be used as fighters so we ran them far longer than they had been built for the re 2000 had been built for a 75 flight hours life expectancy but somehow the swedish ground crews kept them going until they averaged 200 flight hours
    the reconnaissance bombers we bought from italy barely function and we think they may be sabotaged  lets use them as dive bombers  t some dumb son of a bitch
  when its dive bombers you need but ca 313 you have well at least they tried to make do
  i feel like you could more easily rig up other less prone to not working planes with bombs especially when said plane has issues flying in general let alone dive bombing
  the assumption there is that you have a less prone to not working plane available this is the point in time where the swedish air force was having a bunch of notairplaneengineers developing a fighter made out of steel pipes and plywood because saab was already turning every last scrap of aluminium we could find into dive bombers and employing basically anyone who knew what an aileron was in the process we bought biplanes to bolster our fighter numbers
kalinin k12  neat
heya /toy/ ive got a couple questions    a is it fine to start with 1144 model jets if youve never painted before or will they be awful messes    b im looking to get some cold war fighters in 1144 specifically f15 f4 f18 legacy hornets not supers su27 mig29 mig21 panavia tornado adv etc
  b  whoops    what are some good sites for ordering those kind of models what manufacturers have good/bad reputations for such things
    we have said it before and i guess im gonna say it this time your first models will always look like shit so dont be supprised or disappointed when they dont look so great as for finding modes that arent over your skill level but also not trash  is probably your best bet always read a review or 2 unless a model is under like 10 bucks  as for buying models i prefer scalehobbyist us shipping only
  roger thanks
  that it is      depending on prior painting experience theres a pretty good chance your first kit will be a bit of a mess no matter what scale its in looking at 1/144 unless were talking really big aircraft i think those kits are often and sadly not all that great more cheap stuff for kids than anything else i havent really looked into it much though and exceptions do seem to exist ive heard good things about sweet for example though you wont find much postww2 in their lineup as for makers on the whole though i wouldnt really look for manufacturers with a good or bad rep as much as id look for the aircraft i want to build and then go look up reviews to see whats good or bad specifically for that many makers have both good and bad kits in their lineup as for how to look shit up well theres a reason scalemates is mentioned over and over again in the op or you can just google thats the best 1/144 fairey fruitbat or some such and see what if anything you get
  ah thanks for the tips anon im mostly looking into painting up a stable of these for an rpg that im gonna run next year gotta have some stuff for the players to fly in
  i would recommend 172 there are some really cheap one and they would be easier to build and paint compared to 1144 due to their size
  id do that or larger for display but the 1144 is kind of necessary for the tabletop game im making them for
  yeah i missed that  in my opinion the biggest problem will be to make the models to look attractive if you simply paint them in their base color small kits tend to look like small tokens figures even when they obviously arent   i would recommend to paint them one step brighter than their final color and then give them a good dark wash to make stuff stand up also dont miss to paint the nozzles in metallic colors before the wash stuff like that really make a difference
  hey thanks if youve got any more tips im all ears    since its not set in the real world ill probably be using the best looking combat paint schemes i can find
  if you are looking for crazy looking paint schemes take a look at aggressor squadrons japan and the usaf have some really nice ones  with that said keep in mind complex camo and patterns do not really came up well on small scales you end up too clustered and lose the shape of the aircraft
  or you could just go full otaku with some weathering you could nail it good
what kits make a good detailing up purchase im thinking doing original models you want to add fast detail too like how star wars kits are all detailed up with old ww2 models    whats low cost but full of bits
  that red gripen    gripen deserves better than that anime shes getting but you gotta take what you can get    the splinter camo hornet aggressor is awesome
  wait a second whats that yellow eagle abortion it looks like the worst parts of a mudhen a flanker and a yf23 all on the same airframe
  f15janm of course  reminds me of patlabor f15s without the canards or a f15 active with angled stabs
if i am planning on using a wooden deck on my battleship is it better to paint the ship first and then apply the wood sheet or lay down the wood sheet and try and mask it
  paint first
anyone have advice for painting/weathering scale figures
picking up hellers m4a2 for a quick and easy interlude before viggen a bit of flash some slight fit issues details seem pretty nice not a top end kit but far from a short run or some ancient relic it works at least once i tried putting the inner mantlet piece on the inside and the outer mantlet piece in front of it instead of vice versa      sadly i cant really provide any support but moral there
  a is it fine to start with 1144 model jets if youve never painted before or will they be awful messes  start with whatever the fuck you want and thin your paints for paint brushing i recommend enamel and lacquer paints
  for paint brushing i recommend enamel and lacquer paints    の ʖのﾟ  p e r f e c t a d v i c e 
  scale war machines has a pretty good guide    as for clothing ive been experimenting with priming in black an then basically dry brushing the clothes on it creates an interesting shading effect if is its done just right only problems are the method makes things look like your pic so more like cellshading then anything realistic persay my camera is shit so i cant provide photos worth a damn to show it off and like i said still experimenting so some areas look pretty bad while others are perfect and most are in between
find out world war toons has model kits from meng  buy a few    theyre decent enough but way too many super tiny small pieces for my liking and overall they feel too small for the cost theyre nonscale but they could honestly be bigger than they are    the pinky cute recolors they did also use lower grade plastics than the main tanks the sherman already has brushguards that are super easy to break now imagine those in crappier plastic the new orange tank has almost bootlegtier plastic theyre intended to not be painted but having a silver paint marker on hand for a few small details helps and you will want this to go over the inevitable stress marks some thin pieces will get and of course they didnt include figurines of the animals they put on the box art nor can i find anything remotely like them anywhere    i dont care for the water slide decals either some are really hard to get on their intended spot i think the type stickers from their warship builder line matte finish plastic decals would have been better      on a side note owen of yt channel quick kits come on 1 part water to 7 parts paint as a thinning ratio theres no point in even doing it you should be doing 1 part water to 13 parts paint at most 7 parts is 12 thinner and your finished stuff is still a mess of brush streaks
  it depends on the price you pick them up at really i picked up the sherman for like 5 bucks and it makes a nice little desk topper and was good for getting the mojo back up
  they didnt include figurines of the animals they put on the box  thats a shame that would be the main selling point for me who cares about the plastic color if you are painting it anyway    1/7 ratio  to be fair he is painting straight to the plastic and from his sherman build it seems he was aiming for the cartoony look you are still right tho      not really fan of these chibies but filling it with some lead for weight and with some meme paint it can do as a gift
  on a side note owen of yt channel quick kits    not even once
how are tamiyas 1/48 tanks   at a first glance they look a bit hit or miss with for example torsion bars moulded onto the tub  anyone got any experience with them i am eyeballing a stug 3 g
  not too many companies make military vehicles in that scale and its tamiya expect high quality tooling and ease of build even their older tooled kits are fantastic imo its only when you start looking at their stuff pre1990 that the tooling starts to get dated i expect their 1/48 kits are up to the same standards as the rest of their stuff
i see a grey tank and i want it painted well truth to be told im largely testing out the mr surfacer 1500 before viggen but maybe i can get some modulation out of it while im at it
how good do i need to be at painting to get into models i dont want to buy prepainted but im not that good do you recommend any other tools that isnt listed in most starter guides
  you dont have to be good if anything you have to get good   first model will be a fuck up ect ect ect start with cheap kits and dont be bummed out by that   buy a cheap chink airbrush ect ect ect   acrylic paint is your best option ect ect ect   not trying to be ass we just get this question a lot also if you have any particular interest we can point you towards some good starter kit
  i understandim still looking into it and everything i saw self healing mats for sale and accidentally bought a 2 by 3 instead of a smaller one im into alot of military/mecha stuff    so theres a lot of starters im looking into buying something i wont have to constantly upgrade for air brushes if you have recommendations thatd be nice
  that looks looking great good job with the building
  how good do i need to be at painting   you dont unless you want to do some fancy freehand camo you dont its all techniques practice and no selfpity also dont cheap out in the things that matter its comparatively a pretty inexpensive hobby so getting good paints and proper tools is the least you can do and it will make a difference
  military  tank planes or ship those are worlds apart     im looking into buying something i wont have to constantly upgrade for air brushes if you have recommendations thatd be nice  just get a chinese airbrush  compressor from ebay and learn with it you can upgrade later
  everything military and thanks again
  acrylic paint is your best option  but acrylic paint is shit water thinned is awful and if you are using brand thinned may as well use enamel/whatever mrcolor are even more important if using a brush  guess you could recommend acrylic  paint retarder but then again you could choose anything at that point
  tamyia would probably be a good place to start for military stuff especially 1/35 armor and 1/72 scale aircraft they might be lacking in smaller details but fit great and are reasonably priced as for mechs i dont know what your taste is but a kind of obscure table top called dust tactics/warfare has some kind of neat looking tank mech hybrids there is also warhammer that has things like sentinels dreadnoughts deffdreads and killa kanz to name a few  its also probably best to start with a cheap no name brush like master airbrush for just figuring out whats what of course its not a terrible idea to start with something around 100
  everything military   man throw me a bone here  regardless stay away from ships check your local store for either 1/72 propeller planes or one of those cheap tamiya armor kit most importantly pick a kit that you like you gonna invest some time into it so pick something cool  tools hobby knife cement glue sanding paper tweezers if you find thin cement go for it that thing is gold
  acrylic is just more user friendly especially to beginners and when you do screw up its less of an issue    dude may just like military stuff in general i know a guy like that and to him as long as its big and has big guns on it he is a fan
  is more user friendly because you can clean stuff easier using tap water but the finish result is awful thats why so many new anons end up with those awful brush marks all over
    im very ocd with scratches and scruffs but i think ill be okits more about how the vehicle gets used for war and war itself not just big guns
tun tun tun
vallejo 4bo with a touch of khaki brown in it to start out the shading ended up pretty nice despite the vallejo bit id say then to beat down the green a bit i mixed up some proper blackochre olive drab with oil thinned out to about a thickish filter and slapped it on not great news for the underlying modulation but cest le vie being somewhat generous with the application it seems i got a bit of a dusting wash effect out of it as well i suspect the black pigment fell out of suspension a bit it certainly likes to do that when i mix black and burnt umber for my main washes but well see whether or not that survives the steps to follow and a touch of varnish so i wont end up just rubbing off this filter maybe ill just do it all over again after the main wash step to get the dust back
  they dont have all the neat stuff like individual tread links like the 1/35 kits have but theyre all relatively new tooling and they have barely any fit issues for their scale theyre pretty detailed theyre a nice cheap alternative to 1/35 scale tanks and pretty easy for beginners
just got my airbrush compressor today after waiting an extra week turns out i need a 1/8 inch hose connector and the one i have is 1/4 inch    why are the adapters as expensive as an entire damn air hose
  you brought a kit or separately and yeah its retarded
  the kv2 in the op is a tamiya 1/48 easy build that came together well but itd be nice with some more details overall a good kit i would say if you want more details you can add some photo etched parts
  separately guess ill just buy a new hose     other problem is i totally forgot about ventilation i only have huge sliding doors in my apartment no windows guess i can rug up and just paint on my patio
  depends on the paint you are using as long as you are using a respirator and you ventilate afterwards it shouldnt be too big of a deal     new hose  check the connector on your airbrush first that said most connections are 1/8 wonder why you got a 1/4
  i love them but they are clearly aimed at beginners   the potential for details from aftermarket parts is there though    the earlier kits in the range up until 60ish came with a diecast lower hull which is a bit uncommon but its not that bad once you got used to it   the later models have regular plastic lower hulls    for me they offer an excellent compromise between price if i order from asia on ebay they are usually around 1520 with shipping size and detail
be airfix  new kits are actually pretty well engineered for stuff that shows up at hobby lobby  however the plastic can get brittle making tiny parts break right on the sprue
do you anons buy from a certain website or what evers convenient  i noticed websites have promotions and some have point systems
  new airfix is great but they still use the same really soft shitty plastic and they still dont know how to properly gate parts also their qc is still garbage and they frequently forget to pack sprues/decal sheets    but man 6 bucks for a kit that builds up nicely is hard to beat
  i usually buy locally if i want an exact kit that isnt available here i compare price between amiami and ebay and get the cheaper one keep in mind i live at the end tho
  its 1/4 on one end 1/8 on the other the smaller connector is for the airbrush and the larger is meant to connect to the air compressor found a 6 hose thats 1/8 on both ends so no biggie just have to wait until wednesday before trying to paint something    i have a pet parrot so fumes/particulate of any kind are a huge no they have super sensitive respiratory systems so yeah gonna paint everything outside not worried about glue since ill be using tiny amounts at a time but an airbrush blasting vaporized paint yeah nah not gonna risk it    side note  tamiya he219 or revell he219
  i see hope the hose works  pet parrot   well that was unexpected    he219  148 i assume revell but just because its a newer kit
  i dont have any hobby shops near me so the best i can manage is 15 shipped per kit online and if a us seller dosnt have it then im at the mercy of buying from overseas      its neat they have working treads in theory    in practice you have t push down a bit to get traction enough they can be a bit hard to get on with a small chance of snapping a wheel pegmore so with the pinky kits since they have crappier plastic and depending on the specific kit they may or may not work well the 07 panther has really odd wheels and treads that dont seem to really work with their layout its too wide    then you have the fake tread sections on the bodiesspares that would be used for replacement/repair on a real tank that dont match the details of the rubber treads    the 12 m5 stuart is a bit better than other kits in the line they seem to have learned a bit here and there and it has less really flimsy parts but even the 11 panzer 38 still suffers from thin bits that stress mark easily especially tiny pats you have to press into place a middle body section box that has to be glued because it does not peg together at all and a big antenna that interferes with turret rotation    part of me wants to get more another part doesnt want to fiddle with more super tiny pieces at the prices i have to pay
  sockelshop is my usual to go shop  but some things i order directly from japan because german stores usually ask 200 of the original price
  whatever mostly with an obvious bias to whoever has what i want in stock sockelshop modellbau könig superhobby alfahobby and rebell is the usual suspects the last being the largely local option for when i dont want to be at the mercy of the postal service
  i love those kind of jets too get a propeller kit the cheapest most random japanese ww2 plane you can find to be your first so you dont feel bad when it turns out bad you really have to do it once to get a handle of things
just received my new air compressor today and damn its a huge change to my old mini one last one didnt had a manometer but compared to this i would say it was putting out about 5 psi by now no wonder i had problems it did good the last 3 years but it was time to invest in a good one and i dont regret it
  point zero
  it was sold by a local importer without a brand so i cant tell but yeah the design is identical so i assume its the same ones   built quality actually feels really good but but only time will tell how reliable it turns out to be
  i just got one of those this week first ever airbrush compressor well find out together anon
  we will i congratulate you on your acquisition once you get a hang of it you never go back to brushes
    its the standard chinese noname one youve got there probably wont live terribly long but mines lasted for two years so far and has only started to sound a bit funny
  does it get hot after half an hour of usage i bought one of those chinkshits 5 years ago and mine did get really hot after using it for half an hour returned it and went back to my shop compressor
  it gets hot but not so bad since it has got a 3l storage it isnt working all the time i got told that hardware compressors arent really the best option but i guess that with a storage tank and a good pressure regulator it would work wonders      i have been using pic related for over 3 years so yeah i dont expect it to last a lifetime but it sure feels like a step up  was about to get a locally made refrigeratorcompressor one but it felt jerrybuilt and at least this one has 6 month guarantee
  huh i thought the little desktop ones were supposed to be pretty junky glad to hear you like yours
  they are since the air comes directly from the piston to the airbrush the flow of air isnt really that smooth also no real pressure regulator that said for base paints and varnish it does its job mostly
might weather it some more  not sure yet  probably needs a flat coat
new camera now i can show off how shitty my models are miniarts lap7 rocket launcher coming along
  could use maybe a little paint chipping and a blast mark or two
  i would add some chipping and yeah you cant go wrong with a flat or a satin coat      bbut where is pilot
  throw it away or take this to the star wars toy thread
  always wanted to do some of these little soviet trucks but the price has always thrown me off
  still whining about it
  looks like the panel lining is struggling to show up against the red      nice and clean so far      as long as it gets him replies
  yeah just dont respond to him ive got more sw kits so its best to let him wander off on his own
what do you guys use for panel lining
  tamiya panel line accent cause it is the easiest to use     ive used pual budzik technique of scribbing but im usually too lazy to do that
so the me262 has these two round cap things near the cockpit that i filled while sanding and im now having trouble digging back out without scratching the whole thing up should i leave them filled or is there a better way to get the putty out
  oil paints and white spirits
  get one from zvezda
  tamiya panel line because its delicious
any good black friday deals anywhere
  plastic soldier company does 25 on everything among their own 1/72 and 1/100 kits aimed at wargamers they also sell zvezda stuff as well as smodel and a few other things    sockelshop does 10 off on everything if you spend 50eur    modellbaukoenig does a sale but everything is discounted individually in that category so its hard to tell if there is something for you   ive seen discounts between 20 and 55 there    i also found this valkyria chronicles tank from zoukei mura at a high discount  
  20 off everything at alfahobby
  ak interactive has 25 off everything at their website  hlj also has a sale ranging from 10 off to over 50 on some kits
the m4a2 is ready for decals but those havent showed up yet which means that instead its go time    now viggen basically came in three basic variants first out was the aj37 attack/interdictor fill the nose with cameras instead and you get an sf37 photo recon plane or you can keep the radar and bolt an ska24 camera pod semipermanently to the right fuselage pylon to get the sh37 naval recon one then theres the double seater radarless sk37 trainer a few of which ended up as electronic warfare sk37e and finally the ja37 fighter with new radar avionics engine and a few minor changes tarangus kit here is a ja37 and the specific plane i want to build is an sh37 now special hobby its a coop between them and tarangus has tooled their sprues with the parts for all the different variants but business is business so they remove the aj37 style fin sf nose and sk37 front fuselage here and with the complete absence of any ordnance were also lacking the ska24 camera otherwise some creative deviations from the manual will allow you to build an aj/sh by and large a few of the details we cant change out this way are actually aj37styled instead of ja37style so apart from the fin this kit may actually end up being more accurate as an aj/sh than as a ja wingtip position lights being one thing i can confirm    so a resin ska24 bought along with a pair of rb04d asm a sidewinder donated from my j35f2 an aj37 fin shenanigand into existence some third party decals and paint masks and im all set and just about broke    so far fit and finish is quite good enough but no bandai/tamiya well see when its time to weld the big bits together how things go there detail levels overall seem decent enough having intake trunking and engine faces are sadly a nice exception to the rule for 1/72 jets not having that would also have felt extra wrong since ive actually crawled in through an intake and out the arse of a real deengined viggen
loose interest in ongoing project and scale models   get instead into nospoilersgirls frontline and azur lane/ontoy and waste all free time on that  get the mojo back today  pic related    that viggen seems like a nice project will you do the 4 color splinter
  always liked the color variation from the gup tanks
tamiya jadgpanzer 8200  tamiya js2 5400  bear in mind the js has photoetched parts while the jadg is a rebox from the 70s
got myself pic related  cant decide between 3tone ambush camouflage russian blackwhitegreen camo or standard but preshaded cardboard color any ideas
  i would go with either cardboard or just russian green with moderate to heavy weathering and a few soviet marking to make it look like some weird soviet robot ambush camo just feels like it would look like a cluster fuck on something like that
  the pricing of kits never ceases to amaze me
whelp used the wrong colors and forgot to add decals  clear gloss coat prior to panel liner     also did a completely shit job with filler     i knew from the getgo that this model would turn out shit since it was my first since high school but damn im determined to make a decent g6 but maybe not airfix 1/72 again     also is it just me or are the airfix pieces super fucking brittle
  the paint job looks good just dont fuck it up next time  whats the white around the cabin and around the fuselage
  it would look like a cluster fuck  i agree thanks   decided on going for the classic cardboard color will be rather hard to make it attractive with its simply design just putting my trust into the preshading and drybrushing will stand up enough
  will you do the 4 color splinter  yes got some pre cut masks and everything      trying to recall the pair of airfix kits ive built the plastic itself didnt leave much memories behind but the sprue gates were often really thick with that its hard to avoid putting a lot of stress on parts during removal and so small stuff starts breaking
  a crappy attempt at drybrushing loght grey to simulate chipping      currently trying a 109 e4 just painted the cockpit and noticed a fucking pin hole at the top should i just leave it or file away and brush paint over that spot
  fix and paint over that one needs dealing with
  sometimes squadron will have the hobbyboss ones on sale for cheap this one i bought for 40 something so it wasnt bad and with miniart kits theres a shit ton of parts so the cost vs bench time gives a good return on investment even though the cost vs size may not
  isnt this just 1/2 of /hwg/
i have a problem really dont know how to fix it  wanted to step up from my chinese airbrush and brought a badger patriot 105 tried it once but had problems with my compressor cleaned it and kept it in the box now trying it with my new compressor if i let go air bubbles start going up at the cup slowly but constantly when i let paint go it comes out fine but it get interrupted at intervals  google says its a dirty clogged or broken tip assembly but mine has almost not use isnt clogged and i have cleaned it a lot you can tell it isnt new but isnt really dirty  dont know what to do dont think i can send it back but it sucks to have invested in this fancy brush only to keep using my cheap ones
  is that m4a2 in 1/72 which manufacturer
    any issues with it yet im looking into getting a airbrushcompressor and point zero is the best seller on amazon
  given the amount of use im guessing it wasnt reassembled properly after cleaning if you get air up the cup when you arnet pressing the trigger at all then it sounds like somethings up with the trigger assembly possibly the air valve if you ever went messing around with that otherwise for me air up the cup while either just pressing the trigger down for air or down and back to spray means somethings wrong at the front dirt on the outside of the nozzle on the inside of the nozzle cap or just some misalignment in the nozzle/nozzle cap/needle meeting and if it cheers you up any tripping over any number of tiny little things that makes your airbrush not work seems to be a pretty normal experience when youre starting out it certainly was for me at least it gets better      heller 1/72      ive run the same compressor for about two years now its starting to sound a bit funny at times dont expect the longest of lifespans form cheap chinese noname stuff but apart from that it does what it should
  thanks do you like the heller kit im looking for an m4a1 in 1/72 to do a diorama like pic related but it seems like m4a3s dominate the market in all scales
  its ok a bit funny fit in the arse with well whatever the big extra piece there is supposed to be but a bit of a squeeze and that came out alright they dont have any m4a1 though if i remember the reviews correctly your best option there is probably dragon or trumpeter 76mm gun only it seems if you dont like to pay dragon prices    possibly helpful 
  yeah airfix plastic is pretty soft and brittle compared to the blends hasegawa/tamiya/academy use kind of reminds me of the old revell usa plastic at least airfix plastic doesnt craze when you hit it with mineral spirits
a fuck after fuck up the build  i really didnt think this part a lot and ended chipping pretty mindlessly too but meh before doing the ambush pattern dots and putting decals but its okay as i can paint it but god damn i need to pay some fucking attention and not look forward all the time to the winter wash  after the decals set down ill paint the tools/misc and do the ambush pattern if i can tonight and fucking plan the next steps     how big are they or the brand im going to paint muh waifus in that scheme and everything to ease the pain of masking the splinter will be held if high priority    pretty much this but specifically when that happens to me is the misalignment/not tight enough between the nozzle and the main body will post a pic
  the union in blue needs to be airtight and clean usually tightening the nozzle cap correctly solves it to make sure i used to put a bit of liquid masking there so it was airtight whatever i did but since i changed the body oring to a squishier one i can just depend on mechanical force  clean everything and check for defects or obstructed air conducts on the nozzle assembly and try that hopefully it will be just a poor tightening or dirt
  a fuck after fuck up the build  ah yes one of those ive been spared that since draken i think    i got the maestro models masks the masks are specially cut for viggen so the shapes are somewhat irregular in 1/72 the also exist for 1/48 each wing is roughly a rightangled triangle 95mm long and 60mm wide and the hypotenuse slightly convex fins a bit over 40mm high and 55mm long main body sides 150mm long and 20mm wide strips one 85mm by 20mm strips a few smaller patches  a quick look around and it seems dn models also make masks in 1/72 and 1/48 and gator models at least has had masks in 1/48
    thank you for your replies i plan to let the whole assembly rest in isopropyl alcohol in order to remove any remaining primer that may be stuck and give it a second try everything seems unobstructed tho i wouldnt know how to fix a misalignment have tried with both the nozzles included and different tightening for the   nozzle cap and while everything fits fine it keep happening   will give the liquid masking a try wouldnt be ideal but it should at least be proof of what the failure is   mine doesnt have an o ring between the nozzle cap and the body should i get one
  this should be for  too    ill check all these as doing them with tamiya tape is not something i look forward to do main issue is that the area i have to do is quite small probably like a 1/72 wing of the viggen per body at most and curvy so for the pattern to work ill have to plan it well and look at the m90 field jackets/pants for size ratios  colors are also something ive been thinking for a while i like the original ones but im thinkig of more like a olive drab variation of it perhaps ill do some color swatches when i have free time and see
  theres no oring there if not buy a box of assorted orings amazon or hardware store have boxes of hundred dollars for dirt cheap and put one there as it helps to not overtighten it and make a seal there might be te cause but using the liquid masking will solve it anyway if the problem lays there of course
  it doesnt have one only the xtreme version has one even contacted them when it arrived and they confirmed it apparently its not needed will try to get my hands on one tho  i will try the liquid masking sound like a really good idea
  mine was the regular one afaik and came with one as for being needed i dont think so but its much better to have it so get one when you can
decide to finish painting marder 38m   almost have dark yellow coat done   notice little cocking hairs all over the model   too small to be anything but eyelashes if they are from me   hairs also too numerous and thick to be eyelashes   realize the hairs are from the doggo that was just sleeping on me before i went to the hobby room   into the super clean the marder goes       you may not have to paint the tools as apparently germ tanks had tools added then got painted of course you would still want to add chipping to the tools to show wear
    thanks for the tips
what chemical would you recommend to remove dry acrylic primer from an airbrush  pic related a relabel of badger stynylrez
  also pic
  in case youre not aware 1/8 fittings for airbrushes are available in npt and bsp pipe threads theyre not really compatible so make sure you get the right one for your compressor/airbrush
  warm water or windex
does anyone have any recommendations for a compressor for an iwata eclipse hpcs price range would be about 100150 eur it would primarily be used for painting garage kits of characters casted out of resin though occasionally 1/24 plastic cars aswell i know that this general is more aimed towards scaled vehicles of sorts but i could find nothing on 4chan aimed towards gks thus far ive only painted with brushes and tamiya cans though the cans are getting rather expensive
  my general hierarchy of solvents is water denatured alcohol ie ethanol based isopropanol alcohol tamiya x20a/vallejo airbrush cleaner and finally lacquer thinner for cleaning out stynylrez id start with water and finish with the booze that usually does the trick if youve found some dried in remains id skip the water probably go straight for the isoprop and if things are stubborn grab the lacquer thinner      odds are you want the same thing out of a compressor as we do hell if you cant find a home anywhere else i dont think anyone but the usual trolls would mind the garage kits here either anyway in that prie rnage youre probably going for the standard chinese noname one    available in a few different paintjobs form a number of different sellers it gets the job done wont give you tinnitus and will probably start spitting out bits of important seals into the moisture trap after a few years of use
  thanks im guessing i should just type in as186 into ebay/amazon and just pick out a random one or are there any manufacturers to look out for
do any of you have tamiya decal tweezers how are they im thinking of getting them i only have the pointy ones and am afraid of ripping the decals while getting them off the backing paper
who can rec best 1/72 sr 71 blackbird out there or are they all just repacks of the same model
    thanks a lot threw everything isopropyl alcohol and after 10 min i was able to clean it really good
50 tamiya acrylic   25 lacquer thinner  25 retarder   paint still sandpapers   fuck australian summer
  they are all reboxes of 80s kits hasegawa seems decent
  i have never used tweezers for decals usually slide them from the paper with a brush
  they are most probably the same factory branded or unbranded by a bunch of sellers just pick the seller with better rating i have the same and so far i love it
  mad cause bad
  ive always used a toothpic but then tried using tweezers and got much better results no silvering at all
  i doubt neither of those have something to do with silvering tho specially when using a decal softener
working on a revell b25 and i cannot get the glass lines correct despite the guides really struggling i can take pics in a bit the detail inside went seamlessly and probably more than necessary as you will never be able to see it but damn this clear plastic     i usually paint acrylic figures but i got enamel for the plane and would like to do more aircraft or older wooden ships
  anyway does anyone have tips for those glass lines i thinned the paint quite a bit but i guess i could do 510 really thin coats if necessary
  canopies are usually bets painted with the help of extensive masking getting coverage on te bits you paint after that isnt really any different form getting proper coverage anywhere else thin as far as needed then paint as many coats as needed though if were talking half a dozen coats or more especially over something as completely neutral as transparent parts then you may have thinned a bit much which also increases the risk of paint leaking in under the masking tape
  thanks makes sense but i wasnt sure if any spill over would be easier to clean up after painting but it sounds like its just worth the time masking it     i guess i wouldnt want to spend all that time painting inside parts that no one would see and werent even on the list and then take a short cut on the canopy which makes the plane look really sloppy when done poorly     doing a finito benito style
  isopropyl gets stynylrez out pretty well may need a bit of scrubbing
  well i bought an air hose that was made by the same manufacturer as the compressor and its worked so far so
  you know what happens when a pressurized hose fails
  it worked flawlessly thanks
  is the benito a stencil or decal
  stencil or decal  mine is a revell so whatever is cheaper probably
  just checked amazon hose and air compressor are both bsp not sure what the iwata neo is though
any idea where could i find pic related at reasonable price remember seeing it at 20 usd when it came out
  hasegawa with extra licensing sauce on top for twenty bucks that seems rather optimistic id say thirty plus shipping if youre lucky
  remember seeing it at 20 usd when it came out  in 94 with inflation that would make it 34
    its a two year old kit i remember seeing it at hobby store at the time and now i regret not buying it
    both hlj and 1999 list it for around 20 dollar its sold out ofc   ebay has listings for around 30 though
      nailed it found it on mandarake box resealed but item unused 26 usd included shipping i am happy
man i love these ibg 1/72 kits fast to build and have pretty good detail
  that looks pretty good those rivets are gonna stand up really nice    whats the deal with the frontal sprocket
on todays episode of stupid shit i bought on the enternet  nazi space orcs from poland
  i have never tried one of those warhammer figures but looks like they really shine with a wash and drybrush
  if your interested pick some up on ebay you can get them pretty cheap also these guys are meant for warhammer but are made by kromlech a third party company
  no really into the fantasy/scifi setting but i really envy the texture and creative liberties those figures provide
  the are honestly pretty fun just as a display piece   yes ive considered several what if dioramas with these figures
  i would find it attractive the idea of a diorama involving fantasy elements contrasted with modern equipment would be a lot of work tho
  ive been thinking about making a fantasy meets modern diorama and i think the difficulty depends a lot on what you want to do   for example i had an idea of a tank meeting a knight at a crossroads and the tank commander asking for directions this wouldnt be that hard to pull off same with minor sculpting like maybe adding elf ears to a miniature  taking a fantasy model or miniature and changing all the equipment sounds like a real project though
  oh yeah i was also going to take the opportunity to ask about to viability of using 25mm/28mm miniatures with either 172 or 135 scale kits do they correspond well to one of these and if not what miniature scale will work best  obviously 172 and 135 scale miniatures works perfectly but beyond that
  they would work best with 148 models if they are realistically proportioned   warhammer and warhammer inspired stuff from 3rd party companies is usually not really 28mm in the original sense they call it heroic scale depending on the models they can work with 135 kits just fine 172 would be tiny    pic related is a warhammer 40k imperial guard sdkfz 135    if you are using smaller miniatures true scale 28mm then 148 works best i use alot of warlord games ww2 miniatures to go with my 148 vehicles for example
  this is a converted wheeled transporter next to a space marine tank
  and finally a former ba64  you get the idea
  noticed it myself when i took the picture i glued it at a slight angle and it made a gap i glued it back after taking the picture
  alright those are some nice models btw
internals largely painted up cockpit detail is a bit sparse but ok a decal for the dial wouldnt have hurt but as im making an sh instead of a ja it might not have been much use for me anyway reverser petals are pretty nicely detailed on the outside but completely flat and featureless on the inside quite a shame as youd only see the inside if built in flight and parked on the ground its only the top one you get to see the outside of some detail in past the reverser and a pretty nice engine arse since the rear can here is almost as wide as the intakes both together on a harrier thats very much a good thing front compressor fan wasnt bad either but good luck ever seeing that this thing basically has full sducts    next comes gluing the fuselage together some peculiar engineering there inherited from the 1/48 kit front fuselage is an upper and a lower piece rear fuselage is side pieces on top and the wing bottom and then in between the ring you see at the end of the intake trunking shows up while theres one panel line panel line running right around the fuselage there the rear end of the ring doesnt match real world construction oh well if it doesnt end up perfectly puttied the camo should help draw attention away from it      i did like the one i built pretty neat selection of subjects as well      ah yes the tank that barely changes anything about its turret in 1 egg scale might play nice with       nice to see some scale models in 40k converted to actually look like 40k vehicles as opposed to just a cheapout
  almost as soon as they came out people stared using world war toon tanks as a substitute for grot tanks pic which are like 100 for 4 along with needing a 35 book aside from the 35 army rule book and 40 core rules to even filed them on top of that they have way more character then the shared basic shape of the gw models
  tank meeting a knight at a crossroads and the tank commander asking for directions  yeah i like that same as fictional marking and minor details on modern vehicles  not really my taste when they modify vehicles with nonsense modifications in the sake of fantasy i mean they look cool but the fact most of them dont make practical sense throws me off
  sounds really gate like
and all welded up this thing is remarkably close to a tornado in size now for the filler party it isnt a patch on the tsar bomba but its still gonna take a good deal of it to sort things out some panel line mismatches around that joint ring as well that well see what i do about
  a really interesting build what camo is it gonna be
  full splinter
  the harem in gate is really cringe
  most harem settings on anime are also mid season the conflict become so one sided it was actually boring  even with all that the setup was so interesting i cant but smile at it
been trying to unfuck my badger 105    used it paint a rafale paint gets accumulated in the interface between the paint regulator a1 and the tip b and it shotguns it from time to time ruining the paint job paint comes out at times as soon as you pull the trigger and sometimes it begins to show up with the trigger half way through bubbles still come out in the cup liquid masking  decreased the problem a little but did not fix it rather angry had to strip the paint of the whole plane because it was full of fuck ups    i decided to invest on a brand airbrush looking for reliability and less splattering yet this has been way worse than my chinese ones sent badger customer service a mail asking for technical support / guarantee it has a one year guarantee but they wont answer my mails    gonna take the airbrush to my local hobby shop and ask them for help maybe i am the only doing something wrong but so far i really regret buying it
  gonna take the airbrush to my local hobby shop and ask them for help  that seems like a good idea the kind of behaviour youre describing isnt how these things normally work so either youre doing it wrong or you got a faulty specimen
  as it should be
is limonene cement less toxic than thin cement i work in a small but well ventilated area but im too paranoid about that stuff
  limonene cement less toxic than thin cement  it is not  but then again it isnt really toxic to begin with just smelly why do you think they put lemon aroma for just dont eat it
  really the only think you should worry about is for airbrushing and dont eat glue
  like i said im paranoid i work next to a open window yet i cant help but think im damaging myself
  and like i said dont
has this been scanned yet
  when the issue is in your head changing things around outside of it is unlikely to help but if youre that fucking worried why not wear a mask while working on your models that should make a real difference as opposed to mostly just changing the smell of things
  limonene tamiya is just glue with a perfume  its the same glue they even make normal extra thin and extra thin qs  also anon u are demaged if u posting on 4chan
  are those mig books worth it not sure if pure meme or actually legit
  published by mig so perhaps similar to the weathering magazine a bunch of those can be seen here   if nothing else seeing a review or two of the book might tell you if its a supersized wm or not and if it is then those issues should tell you if its for you or not
  alright ill keep that in mind
  the over the top magic anime girls ruins it for me maybe thats part of it but its too much for me
hi /smg/ im not really into scale models because i prefer my stuff ahistorical and mostly do /tg/ stuff but does anyone know where i could get lots of scrap sprues and incomplete kits   i love kitbashing stuff and fancy the idea of building stuff from assorted kits
  ebay is pretty good for that   just a few up at the moment

  what shite link is that
  why not label the thumbnail liek the other thread this thumb is so forgettable and losable in the catalog do you not know ps
  you have to copy the whole thing and paste it into the url bar
  its 4chan spam detection its better that putting spaces or dots in the link like some people do just copy the whole thing and go      there is a search bar on the catalog for a reason hope that helps
looking forward to participating this year i sat the last two out what a fast year its been 
form sent im hype to do this again ive already picked out this years helper
  i remember you from last year that was some fun shit glad to see youre doing it again
havent done one of these yet with /toy/ only boards that do it through amazon lists    how do you know what to get a person how do you know youve bought them something they dont already have
  how do you know what to get a person  in the google docs form you provide specific things or suggestions of what to get you    how do you know youve bought them something they dont already have  thats kind of on them to not put something they already have also you might be able to work with santa to communicate with your giftee to better decide on a gift
  for amazon lists i always put it in the notes because some people prefer to do it that way
  basically what  said if you are having trouble picking out a gift no need to get nervous just ask and if i spot a list that seems really way too vague ill ask them to edit it youll be able to pick something out just fine
  signed up so stoked as my home business toy sales kicked off and im sitting on some decent stock i can send
  boy do i hope i get you cus that bludgeon is on my list
          works for me
  ah maybe it was because of me using the shortened link my bad then
is anyone even doing this its been 2 days
i will we got til the 12th dude chill
  ive already signed up still over a week to go until people can do anything except fill out the form
  7 entrees already and counting sign up any time before the 12th you have plenty of time
its that time of year     its the season of green
if i want to use my work address because im there 90 of the time this is where i always send mail would a photo of the shipping label on something ive already received showing the address and my name be enough proof op    ive always wanted to do one of these with /toy/
whew made it completely missed the deadlines last year im glad these are still going     thanks santa
  yes that would be fine
finally sent in my info
only 10 days between the end of the sign up and when all of our purchases would need to be due what if we want to order stuff online and stuff    also do you have an update on how many people have signed up 7 isnt very much and last year werent there only 1820    i only took part one year and that was two years ago where there were like 80 people who took place what happened the organizer that year wasnt that great so maybe thats what discouraged people from wanting to take part againseems like past years used to get much much better turnouts
  does having a higher turnout mean the people participating enjoy it more  why
  would a parcelly work im quite a quiet guy and its what i use its a local buisness to me and it makes me feel much more secure
  10 days is ample to order online this isnt the 1980s where youd have to trek downtown and visit several stores to find said item and if not have to travel to the next town over etc    google said item  scroll through stores that have it in stock  compare prices and order item  done  takes minutes pick fast shipping and it will arrive within 7 days at most and that gives you three days to pack it all up nice and ship it out again or you can skip that step altogether and just have the website ship it straight to your recipient
  i want sofubi and bludgeon
  only 10 days between the end of the sign up and when all of our purchases would need to be due what if we want to order stuff online and stuff  i only need a proof of purchase meaning a receipt the toy doesnt need to be in your possession by that date if you look the shipping deadline for domestic is december 15th thats plenty of time for online orders to arrive and be sent out again if youre importing which is expensive anyway be mindful of how long the shipping will take and order asap    also do you have an update on how many people have signed up 7 isnt very much and last year werent there only 1820    last year was 16 including myself so far the number is 11 most people signed up towards the very end like the day of i expect to get many more sign ups by the 12th if the trend stays the same working with a small group is not only easier but it shows who is dedicated and who isnt not one person was grinched or unsatisfied with the exchange i remember years where we had tons of sign ups and lots of confusion i was only participating then mind you this is my second year running it      thats an app right isnt that for retailers you would have to tell me how youd make that work for someone unfamiliar with it otherwise as long as you can prove you can go to that location to pick up the gift itll work hell even a picture proving youre there at the pick up point is good i just need to be sure its a valid address and not a throw away
  you pay a shop to let you use their address its quite easy to use and i could get proof of going there this weekend
ive been putting off updating my drivers license with my new address but i guess its time    merry christmas alex in nz
  i mainly get my mail at my po box i understand people taking advantage of po boxes a lot but is there any way i can send extra proof to prove i genuinely use it
  whatever works ill let your assignment know what youre doing assuming i can confirm your proof of address      you would have to tell me howd you prove it im really kinda against po boxes but if you think you can prove it its fine throw me your idea
want to join this   major postal strike has started until who knows when    still on the fence but had fun two years ago dont know if i could hit the shipping deadlines
  take a picture of me next to it with a picture of my name on the mail and a censored id
  litterally 75 of my daily sales lately
  an offical piece of mail with that address and your name is fine
how do the spend limits work i see its a list of 5 items in the range of 2535 are we expected to at a minimum purchase one item but if feeling generous buy more than that
  i answered this question in the faq  the recommended price point is 2535 dollars but you can go over that if you like that is essentially the minimum though be as generous as you like or keep it simple this way everyone can do whats comfortable for them    having one item in the price range is for the folks that want to stay in that range give the gift youre comfortable with as always secret santa is about the fun of giving not receiving but obviously everyone should get something on their list you know what i mean
pussed out last year for being scared of being swatted pranks etc due to mental illness  probably cant do it again  can i just sign up to get like a christmas card through my email or someshit i dont even mean like a gift card itd just be nice to get some sort of eholiday card since i cant get over my paranoia about it
  /a/ basically does this but im sure sign ups ended already by now
  what if i sign up but dont expect anything material back but eholiday card that has no currency attached is that acceptable
  sorry i meant i would send them something physical and pay for it and all that but ask nothing but a holiday digital card back
  they would see your return address so i dont know how you would keep that hidden and id rather not do that because that complicates things people sign up to send not just a toy but a fun gift decked out with fun surprises either big or small the gift making is part of the fun id be giving someone basically half of that experience secret santa experience like i said /a/ is for that type of exchange you could also try /co/ too that goes all the way until the 25th with random amazon wish lists
  they would see your return address so i dont know how you would keep that hidden  i was planning to order something online and just have it sent to them and have no receipt attached to it  and id rather not do that because that complicates things  how if they dont send me an ecard ill just accept nothing then how does that throw things off  people sign up to send not just a toy but a fun gift decked out with fun surprises either big or small the gift making is part of the fun  but you also said here that gift giving is part of the experience i want to give i just cant handle asking for anything in return    like i said /a/ is for that type of exchange you could also try /co/ too that goes all the way until the 25th with random amazon wish lists  i just checked /a/ and /co/ they have nothing regarding secret santa or anything remotely like that
  huh thats weird youre right i dont see their /ss/ threads yet thats good then because youll be able to jump in not sure what is going on with /a/ theres should have started i think /co/s would be perfect for you though basically anons post their amazon wishlists pick one out you want to fulfill and then just send them the gift you could do that anonymously too keep an eye out for it theres usually start later like in the beginning of december
  you could do that anonymously too  i never said id sign up anonymously i am willing to sign up to your terms showing my stuff to you my address and even tracking/receipt i just dont want them to know i still dont see the problem here nor how this would complicate your plan
  i believe i already explained that and gave you an ample solution im sorry you dont like the answer but this is a gift giving exchange its not meant to be onesided /co/ however does this and besides why are you comfortable showing me your address but not anyone else im just as much a random person on the internet as anyone else participating  again im sorry if this upsets you but it is what it is
  thanks for taking the time to answering my questions im done trying with you i dont see what the big deal is if i should have the option to not get anything in return the fact you want me to get something i want is weird to me   why are you comfortable showing me your address but not anyone else  you did last years ss and now youre doing it again last year was a success and thus makes you have a positive reputation now for these things when i saw the other ss threads earlier last month i wouldnt of bothered until i came across the post that you offered to do it again and since theres been no accounts of people being shafted under your supervision i find you more reliable than random nontripfags who need little to no reason making someones life harder its just not something i want to sit in anxiety about very few people know where i live as i have very few people associated with me i dont want the attention or feel like a potential target with swatting doxxed grinched or other weird shit it doesnt bide well with my condition i wanted to participate with this because i do not get to have christmas like i used to simply wanted to give something back to this community   i dont know why you set these rules against no one cant just give something but i tried and i have accepted that im not going to reply anymore as you have made your point
as a reminder guys were nearing the final few days for sign up im closing the form at midnight on the 12th make sure you get your form submitted in time
  i just checked /a/ and /co/ they have nothing regarding secret santa or anything remotely like that  /a/s signups ended a few weeks back and the actual secret santa threads are limited to the weekends because the mods are fags there are a few alternate card signups that may still be running though check the archive for that information    /co/s exchanges are done through amazon wishlists and thanks to this there isnt much of a rush by the people involved to start threads until sometime around thanksgiving but once those threads do start its a nonstop thing until the end of the year
  thanks for the info anon i thought it was weird /a/s ss wasnt in the catalog or archive hopefully he can work something out
  it doesnt bide well with my condition  than you should probably not participate sounds like youre too autistic for this
signed up hope my poa is good enough as i havent recieved mail in 3 weeks
high key i might give away some toys ive been trying to sell mib
  what are they
a couple of days are left for sign up folks you have the entirety of the 12th to sign up before it closes at midnight    also i sent one of you an email about your proof of address check your emails guys and as a reminder double check your forms for mistakes and/or edits you want to make i already found a couple forms with some errors in the addresses they wrote down i can use your proof of address to correct the problem but it would save me time if you guys take the time to check for mistakes    thanks
  because all conditions must be autism right
want to sign up  dont know what i want to put in my wishlist  aaaaaaa
  a weird hermit who doesnt like human contact has anxiety over someone on the internet possibly knowing his name and is convinced there may be a conspiracy against him to dox/swat/spill his information    sounds like grade a autism honestly or tinfoil hat living off the grid
  you can just make suggestions instead of actually putting specific items
parcelly dude here all signed up and ready  any other uk anons if not i will do international just to be helpful
  hey i did not get an email its adam btw
  i sent one person an email and they already replied it wasnt you
  nope do you have the right email address
  its adam s
just submitted first time doing secret santa through /toy/
  same im pretty excited to see how this turns out
does anyone know if theres a limit of how much a present to the united states can be worth without having to pay customs i know for sending to europe theres a limit im thinking of participating this year but if theres too many limitations for sending a present overseas id rather sit out then having to compromise the present for the other anon
sent in my first ever time doing secret santa tonight looking forward to it
did my submission at around 8pm and got an automated reply cant wait
  autism has nothing to do with anything you just said i think you might be retarded
  thats paranoia not autism anon
  my best advice is just to google it sorry im not much help in this case hopefully someone else in the thread can give you an answer    to everyone else a little less than 24 hours remains to get your form submitted folks going to try and get all assignments out on the 13th so you guys can get as much time you need for shopping whos excited
  how many currently signed up
just edited my response fixed the address idiot me psyched first timer
submitted christmas hype building
  because all conditions must be autism right  and sand in your vagina as well from the way youre acting you must have wallowed in the sahara for days without your knickers   im not going to reply anymore   sure sure you arent sparky at least until you think youve won at some nebulous contest
  sounds like full blown psychosis either way kookoo nut anon probably got the shit beat out of him very day as a kid especially if he acted then as he is now
  its some kind of mental disorder and youd probably be better just staying away from interacting with people like you said     i was thinking about signing upfor this but between captain paranoid and the apparent other retards in this thread that cant understand that santaanon wasnt talking about them means im out even though santaanon has proven himself to be a good organizer participation is a risk because you all are just retarded
  20 and counting    also guys if it wasnt apparent from the op im on a us eastern time zone so there is still time to sign up until 12 am tonight i kinda should have repeated that in the thread for anons not in the us
  no where did i say id stop replying and i have no idea what contest youre speaking about stop shitposting and samefagging already
  gets offended when he had nothing to do with any interaction previously  declares not to participate even though he wasnt going to anyways  what was the point in this reply
  to point out how retarded some of you are i feel bad for santaanon he must have to deal with a mountain of nonsense
  things are pretty chill on this end honestly
  one person asked something because im assuming of some condition everyone else has been fine what are you talking about this may shock you theres assholes on the internet you shouldnt quit something because of them
  is there any guideline for our wishlists  i listed some general themes im interested in plus a bunch of figures i obviously dont want them all i just wanted to make it easy for the other person to get something from that list without too much of a hassle
  what youve written sounds good just follow directions on the form with at least one item being in the price range your santa can decide what to do with the list from there
  ok thank you sent out my form
first time taking part in a secret santa if i buy online can i just send the present to the address on amazon
  yes you can do that but i encourage everyone to try and send the item to themselves and then repackage it to add in your own little touches like a card or some candy but if you dont want to thats fine too    also there is a little under an hour left for sign up guys
about to sign up i got 20 minutes left gotta move quickly
going to close the form entirely in about 20 minutes so that gives everyone an extra 10 minutes after 12 in case anyone is panicking trying to get their submission in at the last minute    more importantly though everyones proof of address is fine except for one person who i emailed a couple days ago with no response    plastic if youre reading this please check your email im going to give you until tomorrow morning if it dont get something from you im going to have to toss your form i have to get these pairs assigned and distributed
anyone rushing to get their form done going to close it in about 5 minutes or so
form is officially closed  we have 26 participants this year an increase from our 16 last year and it makes 27 officially when you include me    good range of participants here and a majority of you signed up as replacement santas which once again warms my heart to see lets hope for another great exchange this year    assignments will be going out by the end of the day tomorrow
  ahh can i join i thought i had until the 14
  youre lucky you caught me right before i went to sleep ill leave it open until i wake up tomorrow
  no where did i say id stop replying  oh    im not going to reply anymore as you have made your point and yet you kept on    im just coming in on the end of this as i just read the thread and you are the one coming off as a shithead/trolll no wonder people in real life dont even want to give you as simple card much less a group of nameless faceless anons especially if you act like this irl
  nice work santa i really didnt have confidence in this anymore but seeing the number go up is pretty cool hope everything works out
  so i left it open for several hours and ive seen no new responses so im sorry but i have to close registration now i have to start making pairs    for everyone else please watch your emails today i have to email some of you in regards to shipping requests etc and the sooner you reply the sooner i can match you up so reply asap
another reminder for folks to check their emails today assignments have not gone out yet but ive sent some questions to some of you i need replies back so i can finish preparing assignments
  whoops i forgot the deadline because i kept forgetting to take a photo of my address on an actual piece of mail
  i think this is really great what youre doing i cant wait to participate i feel like im a part of something
yeah im jittery with anticipation hearing which anon i get to spoil
  im the same its kinda scary doing this with people from 4chan but at the same time its really exciting and kinda gets me in the holiday spirit
one last reminder about checking emails i still need one of you to reply so i can finish sorting pairs    marc please check your email
good luck you bunch of faggots
  thank you sir good luck to you as well
  fascist
still havent gotten an email santa
  same  i dont want to be left out
ok i can now get pairs out within the hour now that ive gotten the info i need from the few clarifications ive sent out    just hang tight guys the only thing holding me back now is typing out each email to 27 separate people gimme a bit
be patient   this is going to be a good year
sorry for the delay i pulled an all nighter to get all the emails written and sent    however 2 were not assigned yet due to an issue im addressing no matter what though everyone is getting their assignment before the end of the day tomorrow     regardless pretty much everyone got an email be sure to reply to confirm youve received it if i dont hear back from you in a few days ill be sending you a quick email just to confirm youre good to go get shopping guys this is the fun part
  oh and also for proof of purchase you can send it in at any time you dont want to wait until the deadline to email me sooner is always better
im so hyped
got my assignment now i just need to get paid
get assignment  its all shit over 50  fuck you guys
  proof hoss
  got my assignment toys have been ordered
  i tried to check every wishlist and i didnt catch this please email me asap so i can contact them for a revision sorry this slipped through
  i hope it wasnt mine i specifically said to ignore everything on the wish list and do as you please since ill probably just buy what i want     mfw when my candidate has literally the exact opposite tastes as me but has easily obtainable shit
  send expensive shit to lucas
  uk
  hope it was not mine skeleton and skeleton accessories are cheap
  you know what needs to be done    
  for the record i still havent gotten an email about this do so and we can fix the problem without any trouble the sooner the better
    uk
  aw fuck i cant believe ive done this
got assignment this morning ordered all the items for my anon sent in my proof of purchase now what goodies to add in
hey santa i didnt get any email its matt h any word
  thanks santa
  id rather just grinch them and teach them a lesson
    trolled
  you really shouldnt have made it so obvious you were lying shitposting is a craft after all    anyway time for an update everyone should have their secret santa assignment now and some of you have even sent me your proof of purchase already keep up the good work guys
quick update before i go to bed i received a plethora of questions and requests from anons and emailed them out continue to check your emails so people can plan our their gifts    and as a quick reminder since someone else brought it up if you plan to make any homemade treats to include in your gift let me know some people are comfortable reviving them and some are not dont go to the trouble of baking a nice treat only for them to get thrown away its totally cool and even encouraged because its a nice surprise but please ask me to double check first    and thats it so how is the gift planning going guys
  its difficult as my anon had a pretty smol wish list
  im waiting for an invoice then i can send along proof of purchase
  you can always email to request some more clarification on his list dont be afraid to ask you can even ask for suggestions in the thread too
  you gave me such a boring giftee
  the gift is only as boring as you make it creativity is everything
  the stuff my guy wants is pretty clear cut so that is helpful putting together his box will he fun that and we both like robots
  im gonna stuff my stupid cat in a box bc she keeps shititng on the floor
  youll just end up with a box full of shit then
  then give him something exciting my giftee has the shittiest taste ive ever seen doesnt mean im not going to get creative
i cant wait to start looking for stuff    adam h any favorite candy or preferences
  must be vegan
my anon was pretty specific with a few items and gave general things he likes which helped me awaiting everything to show up in the mail
  everything is going okay as long as nothing stupid happens with this ice/snow storm coming through last year our awning fell off from the ice
alex mc just letting you know that ill be ordering your gifts on monday are you partial to any kind of sweets or snacks
ugh i know what i want to get my assignment but its like 65 and i just dont know if i wanna shell out that kinda cash for this  i dont mind spending over the budget just im not made of money so spending over like twice the budget is a bit much    and its not something on their list its something that i would think they would like based on the stuff on their list their list was very vague so im paranoid if i get the general kind of things they asked for ill end up getting something they already have    having trouble thinking of anything else to get though
whats the date to have everything mailed out by i assume we have to email santa with the shipping info right
  read the op
  i wonder if this is about me i kept my list pretty vague just four types of toy i like specifically because i love surprises and thought itd make things easier    maybe email santaanon and see if you can get your giftee to narrow their list down for you
  i too was vague too    i am being nice to my anon christmas recipient    you could be nice too    or get them shit    whatever    just dont buy books books show no love
how does everyone feel about wish lists i gave santa my amazon wish list to give to my person
  im a bit worried my own list was too vague or that im responsible for  or     but other than that i have been having a blast thinking of ideas and putting together a super sweet christmas gift for my assignment we have similar interests they had a concise list but at the same time are flexible and open to surprises
  sounds great any kind of sweets or snacks are good
a few of my items mighta been over the 35 limit but i also added in a theme i like and to have fun in the end
hey santa if were buying multiple things for our person do you want us to hold on to our proofs of purchase and send them all at once or just send them as we buy them
  be careful with amazon cuz apparently they snitching on people viewing wish lists
  amazon lists have a dont spoil me setting set to on by default which hides purchases for several weeks so as long as the person with the list stays logged into amazon they wont know what was bought for them
  i need to see at least one item that is at minimum 25 bucks thats on your assignments list if you want to include more thats great if i expected to see the whole gift that would imply im expecting everyone to gift over the suggested price which isnt true    so the answer to your question is yes you can send it now and you dont have to send me proof of every single item      dont spend more than you want this isnt about breaking the bank as other people suggested email me if you want some help thats what im here for i can get a clarification for you plenty of other people have asked questions and gotten replies already please dont suffer in silence just ask
  if i buy something online should i get it sent to me and then sent to my giftee or send it directly to him
  its really up to you but im encouraging everyone to send it to themselves first to customize the gift like adding in candy or wrapping the gift itself before its sent adding those special touches is where the fun is after all
  bucks us
  yeah sorry 25 usd
  wait one item thats 25 on their list or a total of 25 on their list either way is fine i just need to rethink the gameplan
  i need to see one item that is at least 25 thats the bare minimum and if thats what you can manage to give thats fine i dont need to see the entire gift i just need proof that you have something in your possession or on the way to you or the recipient
hell yeah done shopping and proof of purchase sent i cant wait to get everything and wrap it ill see what kind of treats i can find to keep it  vegan friendly for my dude
all my assignments items arrived today minus one that will arrive monday then to wrapping and getting some goodies in its happening
i finished shopping for my secret santa i always throw in a handmade gift too which im working on now will post pics of it when its done
wrapped some of my giftees gifts one arrives tomorrow and the last arrives monday i suck at wrapping presents i think hell understand
  stupid question im an international participant but my recipient is technically domestic im i good for the domestic shipping deadline because our shipping situation just got worse here
  whats your question
amazon doesnt give a fuck what day it is which im cool with i was stoked to start some wrapping today
main item bought could be here by the proof of purchase date so thats wizard
  that is some amazing wrapping paper  love that movie
just one more item arrives tomorrow then after i get back home first week of december i make something for my assignment and will be all done
putting together my assignments gift had me actually go out in the wild to see if i could find what they wanted after turning up disappointment after disappointment from store to store the last place i stopped at actually had exactly what i was looking for  i havent felt that rush you get from finding the toy on the peg in a while a real thrill of the hunt moment
  i was wondering the same thing my giftee is technically international but shipping times are going to be the same as domestic
    the deadline is referring to how yourer shipping anyone i could keep domestic i tried to so there are only a select few that have to ship international if you dont have to ship outside your country your deadline is the domestic shipping deadline
what happens if our assignment doesnt meet proof of purchase cutoff you say theyll be removed from the event but like what do i do with this shit i bought for them am i just stuck with 60 bucks worth of shit my new assignment may not want do i just disappoint my new assignment with the stuff i bought for the first guy im not too worried about it but it is in the back of my head
and another quick reminder proof of purchase doesnt require you taking a picture of the physical toy itself i need proof of that you bought something at the minimum price range and in line with your assignments wish list this means a receipt if you bought it online already print screen me the receipt and email it to me thats you proof of purchase      whoever i havent gotten proof of purchase from i give them a couple days to reply to my emails im certainly going to send reminders once it starts getting down to the wire if said person shows no ounce of contact after multiple attempts i contact the person sending them a gift and tell them to wait at that point i have to go into the list and move things around i have multiple options one is that the person who was potentially going to be grinched can tell me what theyd rather do get the gift the potential grincher was going to get or i try to move things around and set him up with someone with overlapping interests its why the proof of purchase deadline is a bit early so no one pulls the trigger early and sends their gift out right away out of excitement some people do either way im going to figure something out after sending some emails so no you wont not send a gift no matter what and you wont have to buy anything new
  thanks i just realized i typod that question
were doing good on proof of purchase folks im getting more and more of you every day  remember the deadline is this friday
  i just sent mine too
just posting a general thought to bump the thread    if i run this again next year i think im going to make a new section for favorite candy ive sent so many questions about candy and pretty much everyone includes some in their gift not that im complaining but man wouldnt that be easier overall i should really do that
  definitely  especially for allergies
alright migo just ordered some of your presents
hey dan in canada i gotchu any treats youd like to avoid
thought id found my gift  dispatched from australia  arrives between december 717   do i risk it
  depends you could always ship it directly to the recipient many international anons do this
  ive actually got someone in my country for once so id like to use this opportunity to wrap it myself  i have found a second choice so i will probably get that
posting an update half of you have sent in your proof of purchase were on the home stretch you have all day on friday to make your purchases for you black friday shoppers
  im good
got some weird/obscure candy for my giftee   made sure not to get anything with nuts since thats a common allergy    i usually use ups to ship out and they always ask whats in the box and if i know the person im sending it to  i get why but still always feel awkward telling someone im sending a toy to someone ive never met i assume fedex does this too right
  no thats actually weird because ive sent letters and packages through multiple services and never been asked that maybe its just the area you live in people near me never give a shit
  just say its a christmas gift and yes they cant prove otherwise and unless they do find something illegal inside they wont follow up
got my assignments serif all boxed up i made no room for goodies and candy so ill ship it separate same day so hopefully both arrive same day ill be busy with family holiday stuff till first week of december it all goes out then
will you post from wich countries are the santas of this year
  not sure what youre asking but there is a chart comparing how many international and domestic participants there are this year   google forms lets you compile the data from the form into different nifty formats
hey doogie do you have any food allergies
  just sent email with photo i hope that is acceptable i didnt realize the deadline was this close what is the deadline for shipping
  nope i have none if you want a candy preference i love japanese snacks because im a shameless shitty weeb my second choice would be milk duds
happy thanksgiving the holiday season officially kicks off today    you have all day tomorrow the 23rd until midnight est to send me your proof of purchase there are only 10 more of you that need to send it in
just ordered the stuff for my giftee  hope the expected shipping happens before the deadline  op what happens if i cant ship until after the deadline
  which deadline
  december 15th
  if you arent sure youll be able to ship domestic in time notify me so i can let your assignment know just keep me up to date with the status of your gift nothing we can do if it doesnt get shipped to you in time  you could also ship the present directly to your giftee and skip wrapping it yourself
alright austen non of the shit you want is available anywhere so youre going to get lego and youre going to like it
  based santa
  that santa is topheavy  must have drunk too many cocacolas
8 of you still need to contact me about your proof of purchase im sending you reminder emails now you have until the end of the day
  oh its gonna be a good christmas indeed
  shut up oh my god you have no authority add a fucking please you faggot
  well in this guys defense he did mention he wants lego anything so its good with me      sure i do if i dont get proof of purchase or at the very least an explanation why and when im going to get it youre out a vast majority sent in their proof of purchase with no problem there is no excuse
  sure i do im your god look at my internet power  my real life im stepped on but here here i thrive  suck my fucking balls dude
  youre not stepping on my balls anon youre stepping on everyone else with that attitude mostly everyone has stepped up and participated followed the guidelines and deadlines to make this a nice event not following through hurts everyone else that did put the time to make a nice gift and take 5 minutes to take a picture and send an email like i said there really is no excuse
update  only 6 more of you need to get back to me on proof of purchase i sent everyone i havent heard from an email let me know whats going on
  what happens if you dont receive proof from someone do you contact their santa telling them to hold off
  just say please you fat fuck
  well i give said person some notice first off i dont just kick them out right away ill give them another day to reply to my emails if i hear nothing ill have to kick them out its not fair to everyone else and yes ill tell that person sending them something to hold off for a day while i sort things with that considered whoever hasnt sent me proof of purchase will have 2 days to reply to me after the deadline before they are officially kicked out i think thats more than enough leeway  just keep watching the thread if i have to notify someone ill say so hoping i dont have to
  it really isnt hard to fucking check your goddamn emails every once in a while i mean i assume you all have smartphones that require you to look no an email to activate them
  yeah i realize that but some people get too busy to check which is why i said 2 days is plenty of time
there are 3 hours until the deadline and only 3 more of you need to reply to me please check your emails
  why dont you go fuck off if you cant follow the simplest instructions
      hows your headtrip
  why so butt hurt buddy are you the failed santa that got all pissy when santaanon said hed take over sounds like it
ok so its update time ive sent everyone i needed to contact an email only 2 anons havent contacted me at all about their proof of purchase and i hope they get back to me ive talked to everyone else sending it in a little later and sent emails out accordingly    basically if you didnt get an email from me tonight then youre good to go ill be looking out for tracking numbers pretty much almost everyone can get ready to ship out good work guys
  i was your problem child sorry for the delay just sent you an email thanksgiving was particularly rough this year my family was hell i do have a box heading my recipients way in the am sorry
  hows being a cunt
  pretty sure its this autist  just trying to start shit
another update only one person hasnt replied at all to my emails he has until midnight tonight to respond to me midnight in my part of the world us est so he has a little less than 9 hours  i hope you check your email
imo id give him until tomorrow night or monday it being the holiday weekend but your the boss up to you
  here is the thing im not even asking for it i just want him to reply to my damn emails i need an explanation at least some people havent turned it in yet too but they told me why and gave me a replacement day he hasnt even bothered to reply to me and tell me why he didnt turn it in what else can i do i already gave him an extra day its not fair to everyone else
  the dates were all set up when we signed up its not like santa just sprung this shit on us
regrettably he never replied sadly hes removed from participating as a result ive sent emails to the affected parties accordingly and a quick switch will ensure that the person he might have potentially grinched gets a gift in time for christmas without a hitch i made that rhyme in a pinch    everyone else is good to go
  good call anon
  one shithead putting a smudge on what could have been 2 years without issue in a row    what a dildo
  its the angry anon in this thread realised his grinching isnt going to happen even though was warned before the event but was stupid enough to try it anyway and is now lashing out
  a smudge would be if he got through granted there is still potential someone could get grinched or more likely now maybe one present gets lost in the mail you never know ive done pretty much all i can reasonably do to filter out people who arent committed im confident everyone is going to send out the gifts i was shown this is the home stretch so im hoping we finish strong
  thats annoying  but thank you santa for having all the deadlines to weed out potential grinchers if i hadnt heard how well everything went last year and hadnt seen how well you organise everything i probably wouldnt have participated
  i wouldnt call a gift getting lost in the mail getting grinched that implies the santa did go get his gift provide proof of purchase and provide tracking once he mailed it once its left his hands and is in the mail its out of his control it would be unfortunate but definitely not getting grinched especially if the santa or the giftee were able to file a claim with the shipping service to try and get their money back
  are we good to send out the gifts we have purchased for our santees now
  yes anyone who is sending in their proof of purchase later has been emailed basically if you havent gotten an email from me then youre good to go
  wanting a please is grinching  fucking fascist
  oh i didnt mean a lost package is grinching its not that way at all i was mentioning it more so as a potential hiccup that could happen just like its possible that someone still grinches someone there is always that potential for mayhem despite taking precautions
everyone shipping internationally try to get your shipping done this week so your gift arrives in time all of you should be ready or close to ready for shipping
hey londanon i got your stuff together almost just wrapping it all up now will be sending friday if your proof of purchace comes though
hey matt hi got all your gifts wrapped and packed i am gonna be away for a week and back next monday will get all your extra goodies ready then and ship out
  thats me take your time brother enjoy your week off relax the sooner the gift gets to me the harder it will be for me to hold off until christmas to open it
hey alex mc this is a weird one but would you mind if i send your gift out next week  being from aus to nz its technically international i just ask because if i wait until next week i can have it shipped via courier for free with our work shipments and itll arrive in 12 days instead of a week later with dodgy auspost
  if he doesnt get back to you i can email him but that sounds good to me
  all good with me
posting an update some of you are sending in those tracking numbers which is great    hows the gift building process going for everyone
  i gotta wait till tomorrow when i get paid to get the candy and wrapping paper and to ship it
  wrapping papers here making some personal gifts then im good to go will ship within the next week
hey annie h your present is on its way  i attached a detailed customs declaration so it hopefully doesnt get stuck but please be careful not to read it and spoil the present
  just waiting for the last part of the gift to arrive then itll be ready to ship
ok so looks like were nearing that point where this thread becomes really active with people posting pictures of their gifts were at 263 posts now you think this thread will last until 350 what do you guys think should we just wait until bump limit
  bump limit is 300 on this board just ride it out for another 40 posts and then make a new one when it stops bumping
  this
  that sounds good to me too
santanon could you email us when you get tracking confirmation for our packages so we know abut when its all coming   also its parcelly anon here i gotta know when it gets here because theres only a 2 week timeframe to collect after it arrives
  any time i get a tracking number or at the very least confirmation that its on its way i send an email immediately to the recipient youll know as soon as i know dont worry
  yey
  people posting pictures of their gifts  surely that should be on the 25th right
  some are impatient and others cant open them on the 25th for one reason or another happens every year i see no problem with it
reminder that everyone shipping domestic should try to ship next week at the latest
austen ill probably ship out your shit the same time i pick up smash thursday

  a little bit personal but what exactly is your work im curious
  mind posting some pics here it would fill the thread with related pics and i would find it easier than emailing without even knowing what you have
is there anywhere to buy this koshikake village biroko for a not shitty price cheapest is otakumode but theyre charging 25 for shipping
  i love how huge that snorlax is     in terms of care if they are sitting on a shelf all you need to worry about is dust/cobwebs and keeping them away from smoke or anything that could discolor or make them smell if they get dirty for whatever reason you can spotclean with soapy water and a dish cloth
    okay sure i just figured it would be a little spammy if i posted a bunch of pictures but if you dont mind i dont have photographs of everything i am selling as i have boxes worth of stuff but ill post some that i have available    cuddlekins coyote newer style 10
avanti 1989 white tiger plush rare high quality plush     jumbo cuddlekins harp seal with all tags 30  shipping    jumbo cuddlekins harbor seal with all tags 30    douglas cuddle toy dogs over 15 available such as umbrabolt stjohn ryan newman limited edition dogs etc  if you are specifically interested in these let me know and i will post images i have them hosted offsite  1040 depending on what particular one you are asking about some have all tags some are tto    uglydolls poe xmas/fao edition uglydog limited edition hot pink ox mij clip version of deer ugly    pokemon japanese xerneas pokedoll 30    kuttari japanese releasesleeping version 17 marshtomp 15 each for everyone else
images of above mentioned cuddlekins harp seal
part 2
kuttari plush       basically i mostly sell pokemon and realistic animal plush but i have some things like a chobits atashi 35  shippingits huge hamtaro various lmk if you wish to see these ty beanie boos beanie babiesetc    if you have certain characters or brands or species you are seeking just let me know and i can see what i have to post everything i am selling in the thread would be excessive i thinksince that would be over 25 images
  is it a business or are you trying to unload your old stuff
  could anyone tell me what this one is called i remember some anon saying it was made by a taiwanese company but looking up its name/doing a reverse image search only links to that thread
  do you have any plushies of panda from hamtaro or any characters besides hamtaro or bijou
  i am a collector selling off pieces of my collection not a business been collecting for yearssome items are from my childhood some ive acquired as an adult        i have piggy bank plush of pandaboss  oxnard i also have very small mini plushies of pashminapenelope and howdy these are childhood items of mine though so just be aware they arent in mint condition no stains/holes
i really want meatlug from build a bear to complete my httyd collection but its been out of stock forever i hope they get a restock for the 3rd movie or i probably will just suck it up and pay scalper rape prices for one
  thats a mooka and its from the thai company luscinia
  thai as in from thailand not taiwan    heres pics of the tags
dat booty
  are they humping
  blessed snorlax
  can you list what pokemon you have
  meatlug is great i have them all hope they restock soon im also really hoping they come out with a light fury
  light fury seems inevitable considering it would only be a minor design change from the already existing toothless plush and toothless is such a continual hot seller for them
  i have a large selection of figurines and plush but they are listed on livejournal where my username is displayed which i would rather not display here    can you send me an email i can give you the link there cameo1960yahoocom    for plushies i have various brands tomypokemon centerjakks pacific hasbroetc    xerneasgogoat pichu torchictogepi mudkipmarshtomplucario chespinfroakie croagunk teddiursapipluptepig and cobalion are a list of some that i am selling      kuttari plush are stacking bean bag plush sono they arent lol
  what neopets do you have anon
for those unfamiliar plamo is a shortened form of plastic model if its made of plastic someone can probably help you here    if youre new youre gonna fuck up dont worry if youre experienced dont make the new people worry    read the guide    irc channel  server  rizon  channel  gunpla    the guide      releases     and a handy guide to other types of plamo        some line art        previous thread 
  re/100 nightingale    any good i like the design
new to gunpla but wanting to try candy coating what kit should i build to do red candy coating
  mak lunadiver
  its serviceable but dont pay more than 100 burgerbucks for it it looks better next to the old hi nu the ver ka makes it look cheap oob
  i was thinking more gunpla gunpla
  public toilet aesthetics
  zaku ii
what scale were the msia figures
wanted to buy pic related and other lbx sets like it is it worth to buy and what paints should i use on them
  not waiting for superior model
  generic waifufy an existing character  eh looks okay but id rather stick to the robot
  stick to the robot  robot that has part count and articulation of a happy meal toy  superior model  more parts more detail fabric cape etc etc being a cute girl has nothing to do with it
  you are not giving the lbx kits nearly enough credit       too bad she didnt come with either a helmeted head or a mechanical achiles head would have been a good addition even better with addition more mechanical thighs and shoulders like koto sometimes does with their various kits
  verka of the nightingale i dont think there is one
  say that again anon
  i wish i got into bionicle seems really cool in retrospect but farthest in i got was a few leggo sets of the ogs and those weird droideka looking fuckers that launched mini corruption masks at the normal guys
  i wouldnt pay more than 80 its a lot of fuckin plastic but it cant even bend its arms 90 degrees it really feels like they cheaped out on its upper body like no one was expecting another sazabi ver ka but it feel like they didnt even try that being said i love mine after i modded the arms
  lbxs are fantastic kits but good luck finding them anymore
  no the hi nu ver ka the nightingale doesnt have the detail to match it but the old hi nu mg looks pretty good alongside it
  im waiting for the purple chick with the hammer emperor is my favorite lbx kit
why are they doing this the colour separation is incompatible with the existing runner layout are they making new steel moulds just for a minor color variant furthermore it is a retail release    anyway i am damn happy about this but it just seems irrational
  no new accessories though
i guess theyre skipping over try completely and giving build divers an mg first
    banban is milking the new anime as much as they can
  i hope their cup overfloweth so we get another season with actual animation this time
  same i love them arm slave designs
  its probably easier since they can reuse molds for the magnum/diver/sky instead of making a new one for the burning though lightning might be doable and an mg cardigan would be a beautiful clusterfuck considering how they handled the powered gm
jetpack confirmed to be m9 compatible    i am hoping that they will do indian ocean m9 with jetpack next time or just do an individual jetpack
  robot that has part count and articulation of a happy meal toy    i take it youve never owned an lbx kit
  an mg powered gm would have been glorious
  it exists and its pretty alright   released as a pbandai exclusive in 2016 based off of the gm kai from 02 with a bunch of runners from the gundam mkii since it has its bazooka articulation looks more or less fine but it wasnt as technically robust as its contemporaries  also shit was only 3000 yen so it was fairly cheap at least for the japanese since baka gaijin have to deal with middlemen or the aftermarket
  wanted to buy pic related and other lbx sets like it is it worth to buy    you are years too late for that to be worth it some of the designs are hitting 150 plus on the aftermarket now pic related is one of many  bandai no longer has the license to reprint them
  powered gm cardigan i mean
  most of the ones i want are already under 100 even then i guess if you like the purchase than the money isnt really wasted right
  ah they dont have the loicense anymore so thats what happened im glad my gut told me to buy up as many as i could when i did but spent way more than i would have liked on a few
  naw trust me ive spent like 40 per kit a few times theyre really not worth that much i only did it to finish up my collection best i could
  try did get a mg though
  who does koto i assume with how theyre making a lbx girl now why dont they
    koto are only making waifu kits of existing designs they have no access to anything bandai did the only way bandai would come back now is if the newly announced lbx game for the switch is super popular  they signed up to make kits for it
  this design looks so unnecessary being a mastergrade
  is there anything out there that you think is worth buying now
  so the gorgeous gray white one will be pbandai    damn
  tough to say because a lot of them were around 10 or even less when they were released
  this is really hideous
  you know whats not my bomb ass farsia
  have you ever gotten a model that you were too nervous to paint and assemble so it just sits there  i have pic related not my photo and knowing that i only have one crack at it i cant bring myself to cut it off the sprue let alone glue pieces together but still i really want it painted and put together    id almost hire a professional if i knew one
  the problem maybe due to the rarity of kit if you make a mistake you cant get it replaced therefore it feels like dealing with an antique rather than mass produced goods
  the indian ocean type repaint is a lot more straight forward and they dont necessarily have to conform to the gonzo layout as the veriv is a different design so they could just do a straight runner colour swap and thats it
   that has part count and articulation of a happy meal toy  i love it when you can instantly tell someone has no idea what theyre talking about      lbx kits are very much worth it i had some great times building them the designs are fun the engineering is surprisingly good and they have easyrelease gates so you could theoretically just pop parts off the sprues if you were lazy like the others said though dont overpay too much maybe splurging a little for your favorites is ok but dont go crazy theyre good kits but not so good id say pay 60 or 100 for one
  good fuckin lord i have zero interest in fmp and to be honest didnt even like the mecha design from it but the proportions on the new bandai kits just make me feel funnyand suddenly im opening my wallet already bought the arbalest now im feeling tempted to buy these desert looking fuckers are they exclusive
  oh also a tip make sure youre buying either the japanese kits or if youre buying the american sprukits version make sure youre getting the level 2 version or whatever cause they also released level 1 versions that are simplified and ugly beware of this if a kit seems suspiciously cheap you may be getting a lowlevel sprukits version    pic related this is a level 1 hunter and the pic you posted is a level 2/japanese release the details and articulation are simplified and there is barely any color separation
  they are custom painted ones we are hoping that they will do the desert colour scheme to if the aggressor one sells well
so this is a thing that happened  facebook page called elitist gundam group got mass flagged by gundamnerds instagram followers as hate speech and subsequently deleted by facebook because the admin there dared to make a post saying the gbwc america winners entry looked like shit  when the model does in fact look like shit  nubmarks seamlines shitty paint and bad overall execution
  gonna need a nongrainy picture because i cant see those nubs and seams youre talking about on a side note i hope thosegundamguys get their page deleted
  use faceberg  get banned
  that fucking face on the pillar    what a fucking joke     everyone knows gundamnerd is an enormous faggot with the most fragile ego imaginable     in the tested video for steam seige you can see the stupid cunt creeping into the frame of the video he was mad that they didnt film him because he has more followers
can anyone id the face used in that monstosity  doesnt look to be fumina at all
  gbwc america winners entry looked like shit  so par for the course then
  maybe it will have duplicate runners in different colors kind of what they did with the pbandai landman rodi
  black man has fragile ego and tries to get anyone who dislikes him banned or silenced who would have guessed
  that is what they do for all pbandai recolours but they dont do that for retail releases otherwise it will inflate the box size
  i think i will get two    two for mediterranean fleet to flank a potential falke as ben was from that fleet    alternatively two as amalgam captured units used for their aggressor squads    the product name aggressor squad refers to amalgam aggressor squad not an aggressor squad working for mithril
how does the mg sniper custom stack up against the mg sniper ii they came out during the same year but i only ever hear about the sniper ii     are they basically the same with some color and mold differences
  oh second question how far back can you go in mg kits before you start hitting that old barrier where the kits were of lower quality in general
  generally the cut off is 2005 when the 20 line started but there are still worthwhile mgs released before that point and bad ones released after
      i for one would not mind if bandai keeps printing fmp kits with minor variations i just hope they also do a weapons pack as well as a falke and the amalgam units
  have you ever gotten a model that you were too nervous to paint and assemble so it just sits there  most of the models i bought were above my skill level at the time of purchase so what you level up until you are confident that you can do it right and/or can fix any possible mistakes you make along the way then you build it  pic related
  looks like glossy shit
a million zaku mgs  several aquatic zaku mgs  not even an an upgraded hg of the best design of them all   closest we have is a zgok mg from 200fucking3    its not fair
  gundamnerds  gundamnerd  gunplanerd    whatever the fuck he wants to call himself hes an asshole and an idiot    i dont believe he built his kit himself looking at his posting history on social media its a fuckton of snapbuilds and no painting there isnt any wip for his dio at all and it appeared out of nowhere the douche got famous for reposting shit other people did and being a jerk i know its the internet and toughguys never back up what they say but the dumbass threatened to kill a couple kids on instagram too because they criticized his builds im glad people are finally up in arms about this turdfarmer
  glossy  its canon nothing i can do about that
  some of those are entirely different people faggot
  i remember buying one of those at tru for 1 in their bargain bin and it was actually pretty nice for practicing painting on
 oh wow i got featured thanks gg
  like anyone cares enough to know the difference between ztier ecelebs who play with model kits
  i love this guy but hate his scales on hands
thoughts
  uh only one of those is an eceleb the others are just usernames
  gunpla is freedom you can change that
  bootleg orchis/deep striker but looked really cool in action
  its canon  no its not dipshit
  dont really know how just glue them at 1 piece
  theyre annoying on the hg for sure but i think if they were handled as separate ball jointed sections like a hygogg they could be really neat probably tedious to assemble but having arms that flexible would be cool
    trash just like every other uc related design from the past 22 years
  bootleg orchis  speaking of which
  i have to disagree
ive got a question and i cant imagine that its never come up in a past gunpla thread    has anyone here ever scratch built a maintenance factory diorama to go with your mechas id like to build something 1/48th scale and other than using lots of styrene sheets  foam core which would probably the bulk of it im looking for some detailing ideas for factory catwalks cranes model chain bay doors and such  i saw this and it gave me some inspiration       but mostly im wondering if anyone here has ever under took a project like this
do waterslides lose their effectiveness over time im building an older mg and im having a ton of trouble with the waterslides they just dont seem to want to separate from the plastic sheet ive already ruined a handful of them because of the amount of force necessary to get them to separate
  which kit  and are you sure theyre waterslide
  plastic sheet  nigga those are dry rub decals
  doh im a fucking idiot i am building this after a long and brutal work shift to unwind and it seems like my brain aint working so good maybe its time to just go to sleep and pick this up again later
  yeah    i find it odd that when gatoh didnt give us info on s5 he just told us to buy more gunpla but at that point in time more gunpla just referred to the unreleased laevatein colour variations of savages and these two new bandai colour variants    so they are testing the waters with colour variants first to see if there is any interest beyond the heroes     maybe they did realise that that fmp is a gunpla cash cow for the 3000 yen price point and are cheaper to design than rgs hopefully sunrise will pick up s5    though i think only 3rd gen ases have a chance of making good gunpla i am still hoping for a dark bushnell though maybe they will also do some fmp another m9 variants as pbandai    it really is odd seeing colour variants for nongundam kits being retail yamato had the dessler secret service guard as pbandai but the recolours of the bestseller earth dreadnaughts are regular and do take some screentime
  bayformer sazabi  good    its like you deliberately went out of your way to pick the worst example to support your viewpoint
figured there was enough space in the pg unicorn base to add something else besides the arduino  2x rechargable 18650 cells from an old laptop battery in parallel amazingly after 8 years still hold charge about 1600mah each to be exact  connected to a charge circuit with overcharge and short circuit protection built in which in turn is connected to a boost circuit since the 37v42v supplied by the battery needs to be a clean 5v for the arduino  using a usb breakout board to power it since i can position that wherever i like in the base  battery indicator circuit attached to the battery wiring press the button and the leds tell you the charge state based on the output voltage
  i have no idea what this means but im intrigued
are there any tutorials to make the duct nozzles on the chest on pic related by hand  i think the inside would be easy enough but i have a hard time imagining how to make the borders
  nope no direct tutorial on how to make em its all just pla plate and a steady hand    id recommend buying just the vent parts from koto honestly
i thought i finally managed to step away from this shit dont know why or how but i got sucked back in to this plastic existence after a few years   i saw the origin gundam got an mg is there word of any cyclops from origin getting some master grade lovin
  pg exia is fantastic no matter what that tripfaggot brexiter richigo says about the inner frame
  it has been a really fun build so far my only gripe is theres a little inconsistency in the joints some are loose others are tight it took a little work fixing that but its still awesome     i definitely dove into the deep end having this be my first kit coming back
  tripfaggot brexiter  shall we have a peoples vote on that
thanks ss appreciate the waterslides
  i actually have a pg exia in the backlog
so let me see if i have the steps right     1prime details paint on primer or spray primer not sure what to use for the paint on    2paint details    3 spray gloss coat    4 paint in panel lines and erase any spill over    5 spray mat coat
  1prime kit    2paint laquers first then acrylics    3 spray gloss coat    4 decals    5 2nd gloss coat to seal decals    6 paint in panel lines and erase any spill over    7 weathering    8 spray mat coat
  i dont really intend to do any painting or weathering beyond the details getting the paint to do so costs more than the kit itself and i have more fun making the kit than doing that stuff i just want to do a bit to make it look better without putting in a ton of effort
  kek the promo pics shows these very fast isopods rolling around at incredible hihg speed in ball form but i had a feeling that it wasnt possible with a windup motor besides the pilot would get crushed by his own ride
damn    this guy is 400 yen more than the original and will have 4 extra duplicate runners just to accommodate for the new colour pattern this will obviously inflate the box size    they should have made this pbandai
  why is it always recycled gundam 3042 and not something cool and unique like this
  it pisses me off so much i had just joined the group and i wanted to learn what i could from everyone     gundamnerd if youre reading this i hope you understand deep inside yourself that youre an outrageous spineless bitch youre a pitiful excuse for a man and deserve to be driven out of the gunpla community
  if you can find one for a sane price get a hyper function those have full inner frames and complete color separation hf lucifer is my lbx grail right now
  who the fuck actually wants this over properly detailed lbx kits
  if its a gunplay thread why did you post a picture of boba the fett
  nonscale although they did appear to keep relative size in mind theo towered over the emsia rx782
anybody building anything or we just funposting    post wips
  starting my first ever build hguc rx772 gun cannon gunpla is so zen to build
  gunpla is so zen to build  lately it sadly feels like labor to me i come home from work exhausted and my fingers start to hurt after just trimming nubs for a little while my backlog is also so huge it looks like a checklist of work to finish more than anything    despite all this i still enjoy it somehow i still do it even if it hurts me
what am i in for with this one also can you guys recommend me more kits like this stuff like feiyen and the like
havent built a fairlion but in general with koto you may need some glue or cement for some pieces with the frame arms i find i end up having to glue the neck piece to the body a lot also just be careful with the plastic kotos is odd even their newer stuff it seems more susceptible to stress marks and lastly weird nub placement will confuse you at times
  they should have made this pbandai  its not this is good news to me
  havent built a fairlion but in general with koto you may need some glue or cement for some pieces  no shit that sucks but not the first time ive used glue on a kit one being an old ideon kit hopefully it wont require any but ill keep it in mind
how much nub mark is too much nub mark i feel like my sanding sticks arent doing a great job and when i use my xacto i feel like i can never get rid of the nub or white marks any suggestions
  tamiya basic file set has done well throughout the years
  thanks friend ill see if my hobby shop has a set
  the subset of kids who grew up watching lbx and now would want to fuck the lbx
  never hurts to take a break dude did me wonders
  relax bro theyre already patching it up youre like 24 hours late with your comment
wasnt the 00 anniversary a year ago its still funny to me that it took them this long to do anything with the gundam team
  they released something new
  thats a fantastic looking inner frame
  another group of triple bypass in waiting fatfucks got their little sekrit club destroyed  lol
  its a march release
  rolling or no that does look like a cool little kit
    it looks extremely nice though from what we have seen i cant wait to see the kyrios in about 10 years
  honestly theres like a 90 chance you wont need it on some of the kits i end up only gluing stuff down the line because i find out it likes to pop off
  dat fucking face
  surprisingly both fmp obscure recolours are not pbandai    the increase in 1200 yen from arbalest to booster arbalest grants the booster  action base 5    fingers crossed for indian ocean m9  booster next or just release the booster separately  some extra weapons
i got this about seven years ago from a friend from japan i cant read it but the pictures help me to infer the contents of the pages its pretty helpful i can post more if youd like
  this depresses me
    i mean id bang pandora
finished this monster last night    pg strike freedom with a dream cast resin dressup couldnt get it in the photo booth properly but ill be fucked if im buying a new one for one kit
        i didnt know thosegundamguys posted here
        looks good but the orange peel/brush strokes are a bit of a shame
        im not gonna kiss your ass thin your paint and sand your resin go to /r/gunpla for lots of positive yous
  10 years  fuck man dont gnx it
      dandruff
  id respond but i have no idea how you got from this kit to thosegundamguys      theres no orange peel what you might be able to see is dust i live in an old house and its almost impossible to keep dust off stuff as it dries as for brush strokes im not sure where thats coming from nothing is hand brushed      resin was sanded paint was airbrushed mr color thinned 31 levelling thinner to paint didnt ask for positive comments but feel free to keep being hyper defensive      dust
  not the same guy but there is some orange peel texture on the dark blue panel over the ass in  also on the grey panel on the front skirt the chest and the shoulder pad in  zoom in and look its there unless youre trying to say that thats dust that settled on the kit that you didnt wipe off before painting either way its pretty lumpy    on a positive note the kit overall looks very good at a distance ie viewed on a phone screen or zoomed out its when you get in close that the problems start to crop up personally im of the opinion that macro lenses are overly harsh and tend to expose problems that arent even that visible in real life but you asked where the orange peel was so i answered
  theres no orange peel what you might be able to see is dust  then what the fuck is this also are those stickers
  id respond but  sweety you did respond when you reply to someone that is called responding in case you were confused on what the word actually means
im going to guess this is why /toy/ barely ever sees finished builds these days
    those are the waterslides that came with the kit i clearcoated applied them then clear coated again
  thats shit resin from a bad recast thats why resin kits take so long to do properly which anon did not       sweetie  ew fuck off fag
  hand that to some blind person and they might be able to read it
  it looks good if you let your eyes sort of unfocus where the glare hits   its unfortunate that you obviously put so much work into it only to be betrayed by dust and uneven paint application   if you didnt paint in your old dusty house you would probably get less negative comments   maybe invest in a paint booth with a dust filter or a clean room   i mean painting robots is your call but when you post photos with that much visible shit in them you shouldnt be surprised when people mention it
  ew fuck off fag  found the closeted homo
  alternatively resize your photos to be smaller and take angled shots so the glare isnt visible i mean if you really need a participation trophy
    like i said the dust is a fair comment ill leave parts to dry and find dust settled into the paint more or less as soon as im done if i wanted a pat on the back id have posted the unzoomed shots and called it a day    im all for criticism if it has merit like   i cant see any orange peeling irl but if it shows up under brighter light on a camera thats something i can look into next time    but why would anyone post work here when they get stuff like this     i mean i dropped some photos said it was done and commented on the photo booth and somehow im looking for people to kiss my ass
  yes please
  i wouldnt put too much stock in anonymous comments posted online let them flow over you like water off a ducks back   you are always going to have that one basement dweller who would rather take the piss out of you than do anything worthwhile for themselves try to remember that especially here
    /r/gunpla is that way 
  ill leave parts to dry and find dust settled into the paint  i would invest in some clear sterilite boxes use them only for when you let paint dry pieces go on the lid box sits on top of the lid no dist will settle on them that way
  sure thing pathetic basement dweller  is that way 
  pathetic basement dweller  you sound triggered over anon getting some criticism on his build sorry that 4chan isnt like /r/gunpla where gunpla is freedom is tossed around as an excuse and poor builders get their asses kissed
  you seem really intent on getting reddit more traffic are you some kind of false flagging embedded agent by all means feel free to attempt suicide immediately
      i wouldnt put too much stock in anonymous comments posted online  keeps posting when getting shitcalled
  post your work faggot
  it doesnt take any skill to know that that build is suffering from orange peel and waterslides that werent applied properly
  it doesnt take any skill  found the snapshitter
  care to tell us what youd have done differently
  keeps posting when getting shitcalled  at this point i wouldnt be surprised if that dude and the anon who posted his pictures are one and the same
  use various grits to smoothen out the resin and redo it if the bumps appeared after priming gloss coat before applying waterslides
  done differently  1 no paint  2 no seam welding  3 finished snapped kit right back in box on shelf never to see light of day again  4 no photos taken  5 download sadfrog memes  6 jack off to mlp fanfics  7 come to /gpg/ to shitpost  thats about it
    i gloss coated applied the decals and gloss coated again i used mr color gx clear for both coats    the decals were a total shit show though they came across two sheets one of them had an entire section printed in red instead of white the other seemed thicker than usual and all of them wanted to tear
  who made the decals theres one third party maker besides samueldecal that make some pretty good ones along with reprints of the bandai ones provided that you have some mark setter
  i sanded the resin 400/800/1500 grit i mean sure i could sand the dust out of the primer but then i reprime and the dust resettles im going to give  a try im working on another resin kit now so its better than ruining that too
  did you leave the parts in hot water or any sort of industrial degreaser after sanding it helps get dust and factory residue off resin
  theyre just the ones that came with the kit couldnt tell you who made them ive used samuels and i find his nonpre cut ones hard to work with his precut stuff is nice though
    found them ive used uc and 00 decals made by dl before they work pretty damn well and dont tear easily if you have to adjust them a bit during application
  gave them a soak in hot soapy water followed by scrubbing down with a toothbrush then a rinse in clean cold water just to get the soap off then dried them under a radiator
  change the air filter on your ductwork    somehow im looking for people to kiss my ass  yes simple act of showing off is attention whoring and seeking approval paint or parts look bad dude i cant tell which it is consider getting a magnifying lens to catch the shitty looking surfaces on your parts and also change your air filter
  the more i get into gunpla the more of a fucking hassle it seems its like xenos paradox just an infinitely expanding series of steps     just snap the kit together     no you have to shave the nubs down too oh and you cant just shave them down you also have to sand them and then polish them oh and then you need to glue and sand them again for seams in the kit and no you cant just use stickers you need to paint and no you cant just paint you need to prime and for that you need to strategically snip off bits of the kit before you assemble it so you can actually disassemble it and then painstakingly prime every piece individually but you cant just prime them all you also have to tape off any joints or connecting parts otherwise theyll gain too much thickness from the primer and paint     now once youve primed it you can paint and then you put a clear coat over it no you cant use a cheap 4 dollar clear coat you have to use a 20 dollar spray can from japan then you have to use a panel wash to fill in all these little lines then another total clear coat then decals then a mat coat then reassemble it     and if you do literally any step even slightly wrong it will fuck up everything and everyone will say youre shit     and now your 12 dollar plastic toy kit has cost you 150 bucks of supplies and hundreds of hours of work
  do you want a bad looking toy an average looking toy a great looking toy with some paint apps or a fucking art piece painted using at least 80 worth of paint variety that took 2 months to put together its all up to you thats why people like gunpla you dont have to put in 150 bucks of supplies and hundreds of hours of work it only takes 2 days to clean nubs and do a little bit of panel lining and maybe even paint some small parts tada your model is already at a better level of finish than some expensive toys if you paint the entire thing youre approaching art project territory and if thats not what you want you dont have to do it you probably cant anyway
  yeah but when you look at your display case with all your painted models in it it feels really good
    waifufaggotry is a universal force spoileri want to see what they do with the odin m/spoiler
  just to add to this i greatly underestimated how much work painting in mg especially a transforming mg is i started on my green/orange mg zeta 20 got the chest and head done and needed to redo some parts and that was basically it it doesnt help that my mom got cancer around the time it started and i ran out of space and extra effort for painting     ill get it finished eventually but yeah for real painting larger models entirely is a long and complicated undertaking even 1/144 kits can take a while depending on what you want to do    also fucking paint jesus it gets expensive fast i have tons of it probably 1000 now and i barely use any of it
  its the only model thats been a staple on my shelf for over 5 years
  ill upload more pages tomorrow i hope the image quality is okay
  ductwork im in the uk we dont have ductwork    showing off your work is attention whoring    well then congrats were all attention whores yourself included
            muh uneven resin  this is what surface prep and surfacer 1000 is for you prime/sand/repeat until all your surfaces are perfectly smooth or until they are smooth enough for you point is you have control    muh dust  youd be surprised how much difference regular vacuuming of the floors can make youd also be surprised how much static electricity accumulates on your work pieces as you work remove static and dust will not settle nearly as much also spray a fine mist of water on your booth just before you start painting    muh visible decal edges  use mark softener it dissolves the decal quite a bit spray a nice wet clear coat or two then sand lightly then repeat use good quality decals      2 months  hahaha
  why do you always have to shove this ugly piece of shit in here every time you want to bring up a point
  to torture you
  yeah well fuck off with your sloppy harbor your shitty gourai girl and that muv luv bullshit anonymousbuilder
      i like the look of it its like the right color of yellow not eye bleeding but not too dull and i love the magenta and purple fits so well p  what kit is this anyway
  pic related its volks 1/100 resin  i had a spare so i decided to paint one yuis colors and the other will be 00a white
  not eye bleeding  but that purple paint sure is bleeding onto the kit
  amazing how easy you turn things into shit anonymousbuilder
  im still sad the only one i couldnt find was hf achilles deed honestly im more proud of my lbx collection than i am my mgs
  turns out that theres designs for a lot of them already i wanted more lbx but it was all goddamn waifu bait at least they put some effort into it i guess    
  god i wish i was into model kits when these were being released retail prices seem like an impossible goal now
its officially december for the us east coast which means its almost the end of the year time to start making your compilations     what did you build this year anons
  this was a pretty slow year for me i started woundwort but rearranging the area i have my work table in put a stopper on that
  time to start making your compilations  nah theres a whole month left
  i couldnt get into the games but the designs are nice hopefully bandai regains the rights to reprint the robots while koto handles the robutts
  got a couple kits to finish first
  some of these are top tier qts i hope they get kits  granted id rather get rereleases of the actual kits but whatever ill take what i can get
  do what makes you happy personally and not an inch more the tips and knowledge are there for you if you want to attempt higher levels of modeling but they are by no means mandatory much as some folks here would try to make you believe    me i denub with xacto only no time or patience to sand sometimes i get little gouges but its small enough that it doesnt bother me i panel line topcoat and that makes me 100 satisfied no these builds will not satisfy anyone online but i didnt build for them i built for me you dig
  man perfect color separation is so fucking sexy i only own one hyper function kit and it is among my favorite plamo ive ever built i eagerly look forward to buying more someday
  i am saddened by how fucking generic most of these look seeing lbxs incredible style and designs watered down to bargain basement waifus is extremely disappointing
  lbxs incredible style and designs  dumbed down kiddie cartoon aesthetics
  nice try but i know better than to post my garbage kits anywhere i just enjoy building
first build is done i dont really like this kit but it was good to practice on what do you guys use to hold your small parts when you shave off nubs my thumb is killing me
  not bad for a basic build looks pretty nice very neat panel lining too
  thank you i found that my favorite part is panel lining i even lined the bottoms of the feet and all of the elbow/ knee joints
first time ordering from migs website  not only did it end up slightly cheaper even with shipping compared to the states i got a free oil as a gift     inb4 not mixing own washes not grinding own pigments
  whats the yellow thing and dragon thing i assume the dragon is a kitbash of some kind i think i recognize the wings and tail but the yellow thing looks more coherent ibo kit of some kind torso looks like it
  fair enough just wish the community were a little less judgemental and elitist as a whole would make hanging out in it and navigating it more enjoyable
  thats the problem with most modelling communities in general to be honest elitism is fine if you keep your ego in check but most elitist groups dont and instead offer over exaggerated criticism as a means to degrade rather than enable useful change on the other end of the spectrum and a much bigger problem are the scores upon scores of social media groups and forums including places like r/gunpla that will pat your back just for following the instructions and snapping some shit together encouraging no improvement in their members    do whatever you enjoy within the hobby but know where you want to be if you want to snap shit and call it done go be around people who want the same if you want to improve endure the assholes and find the elitists wholl rip your kits apart
  i think this is the biggest thing in modelling as a whole also in person groups run the gamut with some people being really basic snap and done types to full paint job sorts the nice thing about in person groups though is that most people tend to be good people and are usually more than willing to give you help it just seems like online it either devolves into shit flinging elitists or group hugs not that it cant happen in person too but thats been my experience
  theyre both kitbashes the dragon is a bunch of scrap parts from my spare parts box the yellow contruction thing is as you guessed ibo kits its a hugo kitbashed with the bottom half of a geirail the hugo legs were stuck on as arms using this one adapter part and the head is literally the hugos head with the helmet thing taken off i added some rails and stuff too thought i had a pic of it unpainted but i cant find it
so a couple of easy ignorable post spawns this much controversy and discussions of what it means to build  as a designer i take and discuss genuine advice and ignore shitpost    but anyway just wanted to post my first ever build i realize that theres a lot of wrong in it but those are things which i can improve and mostly the result of using subpar materials    but what does everyone think its supposed to be a captain commando inspired io frame shiden
  and this is what i get for being a shitty phoneposter
    well if this was supposed to be a metallic frame it failed p hard everything else is passable
  yeah the frame was supposed to be some sort of gun metal made from mixing shitty school grade water based silver and black acrylics i dont think it looks too bad in person ut i really have to try real paint    didnt panel line it because i didnt have a grey panel liner at hand and i could not find an easy way to remove the seam lines in the shins
  those are the waterslides that came with the kit  anon unless you mean the resin i have some bad news also theres one clearly painted over in the cap i sent      theres also noticeable orangepeel on the nonresin parts too like the upper chest and red parts on the face i dont know why anon was getting so defensive about all this though but he certainly seemed to like shit stirring because of it
man this place has changed it looks like the gunpla and general plamo thread got consolidated into 1 now    after a big break from doing gunpla im getting back into things and unfortunately diving straight into my first plane kit for a secret santa present specifically this f14a from tamiya it looks intimidating since i havent built a kit that i had to cement but im more worried about painting it with gunpla i built first broke it down then painted after but is it the same with planes tamiya tells me what color is what but do most modelers just assemble certain sections first paint then final assembly or like how i did with gunpla any help would be appreciated
  1/48  i havent built a kit that i had to cement  secret santa present  dis gon be gudgif  you assemble and paint inside the cockpit first then you glue the rest of the plane together glue the canopy on mask the canopy then you paint the whole thing     if this is your first time gluing a kit together i would not expect a good outcome if i were you    it looks like the gunpla and general plamo thread got consolidated into 1 now  gunpla and general plamo were in the same thread since at least 2013 what are you smoking no fun allowed scale model thread is a recent addition
anyone here use vallejo is it safe for abs plastic
  its water based acrylic paint so theres nothing in there that will harm plastic like other more volatile paints
  oh god what i have i gotten myself into    thanks for the basic workflow the kit just came today and i definitely did not think 148 would be as big as what i got ive got 14 days to do this so gonna try to be as delicate as i can with the assembly and paint aside from the cockpit painting should not be too bad after proper masking though right sure id still need to preshade the panels but id assume the 13 colors and more streamlined body should mean painting goes by way faster than gunpla    and my bad i was thinking about the scale model thread but forgot the word they used during my search ive only been out for about 2ish years
  ive got 14 days to do this  some people would spend this long just to detail the cockpit where you have 2 seats and 2 figures to paint
i need to replace the filters for my respirator if i want something thatll stop me from dying when i spray lacquers or enamel primer is it ok to only get just organic vapour filters or do i need organic vapourparticulate filters
    the light is directly hitting the bottom of the shoulder which is why you can see every little defect there including the decal border the pg strike freedom stickers are cut into squares precut waterslides are rounded    the entire armour is resin including the upper chest and the entire face except the eyes and the white mouth part im not getting defensive when the criticism is genuine but im not going to sit here are take people claiming im lying because idiots want to say dumb shit like i hand painted an entire pg resin kit or that im using stickers when the kit comes with fucking waterslides
  is that supposed to be a captain commando paint scheme it looks good
  i love this instantly knew it was captain commando before i even expanded it if the frame had a nicer gunmetal itd be great next time just spring for a premade one
  particulate i believe spraying aerosolizes paint into tiny little particles that you are breathing in so you need a filter to protect against that yes
  maybe look at the post above that photo
hey guys im just getting into gunpla and for my first kit ive ordered a grimoire red beret and the tiltrotor pack    my question is how much of the decision w/r/t customization do i need to make before i put these together do the pieces generally speaking lock into place permanently if i wanted to paint them at a later date would i be able to disassemble it in order to do more precise coloring
  the kits are snap fit so you can put them together and pull them apart whenever you please the parts dont really lock in to place permanently but you might need something thin and blunt to pry them apart without damaging them
  alright then    as for the customization itself the idea i had in mind would be a cross between any one of the commandos in predator and the predator itself    so id give the legs a woodland camo pattern while painting the feet black to look like boots    the abdomen would then get the meshpattern to look like the predators underclothes finally since red beret comes with drones that can also replace his head id take the one thats dark green and paint it black to resemble the predators helmet     i dont know how if at all i could do the dreadlocks or the arm claws but i do know that the tiltrotor pack comes with a shoulder cannon which is what gave me the idea in the first place    i know im putting the cart way before the horse here since the kit hasnt come in the mail and this would be myu first time i have a feeling that doing a camo pattern even on an already dark green piece is harder than it sounds    that said overall does my idea sound like something doable and likely to look good
  did you use fluorescent paint for the red bits it looks great gonna steal that idea
  dont listen to the other guy and use your judgement some parts may be hard to pry open once snapped or have too tight of a fit and prying tightly fitted parts will undoubtedly scar the surrounding plastic but if youre at that stage you could probably fix it with some putty
  sounds doable if you need some inspiration heres someone elses take on a predator grimoire
  forgot pic
bought a koto model kit from 2009  start building   the parts are thin and bendy as fuck  okay  start assembling the arms  shoulders are two balls connecting to the body rather than pegs  its a very tight fit  tried posing the arms a little  noticed the plastic gets a bit twisted when i do that  tfw now too scared to pose it at risk of destroying it    i probably need glue or cement to keep the parts together at this point its not really rock solid compared to most other kits ive built
im having a hard time getting this into some poses the fron skirt yellow piece keep popping out while adjusting the left left  im trying to get a left knee on the ground right leg propping it up followed by the right arm being bent back grabbing a beamsaber handle while left handing the rifle with the fist grasp being rotated to the right like a gangster the left leg goes back too far even though im just trying to get the knee to touch the ground but even if it seems like short distance it streches out the leg to a point where it looks unnatural   i know it seems like kind of a shit pose and uninspired as hell but my first thoughts were to manipulate it to look suggestive im not good with creativity i just like using my hands to make things  also my tamiya extra thin cement finally came in months after my kits came in decided i would practice on this kit that i already built before i start my second kit any tips for using it
  i dont know how their kits are now but older koto kits used to be awful i had two acs fall to their deaths because the hip polycaps tore just under their own weight dualface and mirage selena iirc it pissed me off so bad i never bought any kotoshit again it was like 120 just gone because of the shit quality of their polycaps
  nazi actual fucking ufo  why cant more modern military shit be as insane as the shit the krauts were pumping out in ww2
  this guy rambles a bit but its a decent guide    
  because its a shit ton more expensive now
  a shit ton more expensive  20000 tactical tea kettle  thats not really an answer is it
genbu has a good amount of moving parts on him but hes so chunky in places that it hinders articulation
  interesting i made the black version of the one on the left black tiger is it and the articulation on it is very weird those ball shoulders are interesting but really hard to get moving you definitely have to unpeg them how sturdy is the genbu i was considering getting the new recolor of him coming out
  theyre not   1 under the pressure of war  2 motivated by the feeling of being the rightful rulers of the earth  3addled by weird mysticism
feels good built my model last night while everyone was asleep now i got my brother doing the panel lining while i study for finals hes doing a shitty job but its gonna be an easy fix once im done exams he smudged the fuck outta the rx 782 shields red portion and thought it was a part of the knee kinda activated my almonds but whatever im getting free labor out of it
  addled by weird mysticism  what does that have to do with jet propulsion    only 1 really applies imo
  actually no the mindset at the time heavily influenced by the semimystical declarations of the controlling party resulted in research in things that were not terribly tactically useful or smart hitler has a well documented love for giant and impractical weapons for instance because they represented the might of the reich     so shit like flying saucers probably only saw any serious effort and research due to that
  cool things are more expensive  two trillion dolla for a fat bootleg f22 with identity issues comin right up lockmart  also we had this cool looking fucker that everyone involved said was pretty damn good but just vanished
  italy here we imported a bunch of them 4 years ago and some stores are still trying to get rid of the last spare ones we got only 10 of them although achilles destroyer hunter emperor odin fenrir zenon ikaros force ikaros zero and minerva kai
  damn the cup of tea made with a 20k kettle must be great
  a cross between any one of the commandos in predator and the predator itself  no offense but this sounds like a mess i would do them as separate figures if anything trying to mash them both into one will just be visually confusing and in all likelihood ugly
  i mean i can certainly understand if youre hesitant to give them another chance at this point but i can tell you that modern koto kits are pretty great they really improved in recent years pretty much everything ive built from them recently has been extremely satisfying
  genbu is solid but that the same time all the parts that peg in are super tight to the point that i felt like moving them even a little would break it i sanded them a little to make it easier to pose and reduce the fear of breakage it doesnt use the same ball shoulder setup as byakko but the whole joint still likes to pop out easily
  my genbus left arm wont stay attached at the shoulder its pissing me off
anyone here ever built the perfect zeong im curious about it because its weird and fucking huge but its an older kit and i hear little about it
  you ever see expensive military shit it would taste no better than normal and need 200 dollar maintenance after every boil breaking if you used the incorrect flavor of tea which logistics would send you anyway because everyone is retarded
  is shit like robot dogs flying drones powered exoskeletons and the like not crazy enough for you because thats all shit the military has at minimum working prototypes of unlike the fabled nazi flying saucer and other ufo stuff they are rumored to have made which was just a bunch of heresay and halfassed reports about foo fighters and out of work engineers who definitely saw plans for disc shaped craft being made but never found
  fabled nazi flying saucer and other ufo stuff they are rumored to have made  what are you talking about the ho 229 was in the prototype stage with 3 built and later captured you can see the damn thing yourself in the smithsonian
gunpla discussing real weapons  saw the disaster coming but overall was softer and less cringey than expected but still    i think hes talking about the haunebu which real or not is portrayed like the typical flying saucer
  oh well i guess but the conversation started from the ho model anon was building
so im getting into scratchbuilding and sculpting using styrene sheets and whatnot and i wanna combine this with 3dprinting since an absolute madman made a 3dprintable model of the megami device body    but what i was wondering is would my shitty fdmprinter yield fulfilling results given enough polishing or should i just get into recasting an existing md body i have
is it really worth ordering through someplace like hobbylink japan theyre cheaper than usa gundam store generally by a fair margin but they also inevitably slap on 50 bucks or more in shipping fees     are they more worth it on larger orders where the cheaper prices of the figures win out over increased shipping or is it always going to be about the same price either way
  are those supposed 5o be woundwort girls
  you have to order multiple items for the cheaper price to be worth it because of the shipping on hlj if you buy only 1 or 2 items a month and build them as soon as you get it hlj will never be w good option because you will keep wanting to wait to fill your shipment
  if memory serves the torso joint assembly in mds is kinda tricky id be curious how well that 3d model captures it
  it really seems to only be worth it if im ordering multiple hg kits ive tested it with multiple mgs and only after four do i see like a 7 dollar difference from 237 in usa to 230 at hlj     guessing hgs because of their smaller size and weight might be better but it still doesnt seem great
  at a glance yes  the gundam v crotchplate turns into a fuck me here sign  umf
  im legit interested in anyones opinion on this thing  thingiversecom/thing3135467    funnily enough i printed some md boobs also from thingiverse and they fit without any trouble im also looking into acetone treating the prints for further smoothing so whenever that yields some interesting results ill be sure to post it here    sla printing would be the definite solution for a polished result but i just got into 3dprinting so thatll happen later down the road
about how complex is the hg god gundam relatively
  hitler has a well documented love for giant and impractical weapons for instance because they represented the might of the reich  the fact that they even considered the monster is insane  maus was pretty cool though
  but the whole lumpiness cannot be blamed purely on dust or bad resin those kinds of lumps are highly inconsistent with resin defects it look closer to overspray than anything decal edges can be sanded down if youre concerned about damaging the decal just add more gloss coat over it    you did slipshod job on a pretty expensive kit if you cant face the noise dont post here tone down the hubris and stop shitting your knickers
  the schwerer gustav was pretty good too actually saw effective use too surprisingly even if it was limited
  yeah railway mounting fuckoffhuge weapons was a better idea than track mounting them  they did come close with the karl gerat though
  acetone only works on abs pla is resistant and nylon is borderline nonreactive
  so ive noticed it kinda works with pla to get grooves out of the way but abs really gives in    planning on offsetting the 3d models before printing sanding most of it down and maybe after priming itll look fine
  its very basic
qubeley damned coming from some hong kong foghat off ebay  shipped   made it to america on the 22nd arrived in la  been in transit since the 28th with no extra info  i live in vegas a few hours away from la     hurry the fuck up i wanna see if i got bootlegged
  overall or just for hgs if its dumb simple ill probably get one to hack out when im too busy for more complex kits
  no its not bad its just a very simple build is all no real articulation gimmicks just a straight classic hg its still a good kit
  you can assemble it by following the pictures in the instruction booklet
  too busy for complex kits  just do little bits at a time im in the middle of finals but i still made one of the legs from the johnny ridden rg yesterday and im a slow fuck builder at least compared to what most people seem to say for their build times
  hope you didnt want to pose it
  wait qubeley damned is shipping already
     busy for complex kits  i keep legend bbs and in the past lbxes around for those kinda times the easy release gates mean you basically can pop most parts off the sprue with minimal to no cleaning it really speeds things up and makes for chill little builds
is mg jesta a solid kit currently debating on getting either it or gm sniper ii but i feel like ill enjoy jestas heavier appearance more also it will be my first mg kit too
  its the most complicated kit you can imagine you will spend weeks assembling it a single foot alone could take days its a kit intended only for skilled modelers hence it being part of the high grade line and having such a high recommended age rating of 4
  jesta is a fine kit but gm sniper ii edges it out in my book in terms of impressiveness still they are both excellent choices for a first mg and i dont think youll be disappointed either way
  november according to what im seeing mine shipped the 22nd
roger    i recieved your package and have hung the card on the fridge using my fanciest magnets your final items arrived yesterday and i will be mailing your gifts tomorrow or wednesday might actually be thursday as i expect the post office to be closed on wednesday for the federal holiday either way it will be shipped out this week so you should have it by next week it will also be safe to open the box if you wanted to wait closer to christmas as the kits will be wrapped
  do you have your own printer with abs filament or do you send the files to a printing service
  relatively   calm your tism
  relative to playing connect the dots or watching paint dry building hg god gundam is extremely challenging
  ryan i just set up my tree and will get a spot ready for the incoming delivery im honored my card was fridge material every year i put one in for giggles but no one posts it you made my night
  internal rechargeable power source  this will be so boss      its the bandai figure model      nicest looking gunmetal ive used of the derisively laughable sum total of two was vallejo mecha color the alclad just came out as a flat ultradarkvioletintoblack
  even if only a few people participate im glad you guys enjoy it
    its been out long enough for me to buy one off mandarake according to the tracking it has just arrived at customs in my country
  imagine getting this anally angsty because someone asked how a kit compared to others
  is there a model kit of this just curious
  what scale are you looking for
  dont matter
  look at the name of the thread which has been the same for ages    gunpla/plamo general    plamo is a term that encompasses all plastic models in fact the term gunpla emerged as a portmanteau of the words gundam and plamo so that boba fett is more than welcome here
  interesting i feel like i just paid for the preorder weeks ago well my sense of time passing is pretty shitty hope mine arrives soon
  well theres this     then theres this     and then theres this glorious fucker 
are there any led mirage kits that arent a huge pain in the ass ive heard various bad things about fss kits over the years so i never even tried to get into them but my desire for this motherfucker finally boiled over soim looking for an led mirage kit that isnt a horrible pain to build relatively sturdy once finished and hopefully doesnt require a full paintjob to look decent im not exactly a novice modeler but i would prefer not to wrestle with a kit every step of the way
  to add to this all the the vallejo air paints incl mecha colour and particularly metal colour have really good metallics because they use very fine aluminium powder although ive heard the model air golds are a bit iffy even if youre brush painting theyre the best water based acrylic metallics out there
  im not exactly a novice modeler but i would prefer not to wrestle with a kit every step of the way    you should be fine with any of the volks ims mirage kits released so far the most notoriously bad of the injection kits are the first few releases the bang doll  v siren neptune are regarded as the worst batsh has a few issues but isnt nearly as bad as those two the other releases since have improved greatly and are fairly safe
  cool thank you since you seem to be knowlegeable on the topic of fss do you know anything about this i saved this pic a while back but dont know anything more and i would greatly prefer buying a simple led mirage than that monstrosity with the gigantic flame launcher which i honestly have no room for    also can i take this to mean that waves fss kits arent very good
  all the the vallejo air paints incl mecha colour and particularly metal colour have really good metallics because they use very fine aluminium powder although ive heard the model air golds are a bit iffy even if youre brush painting theyre the best water based acrylic metallics out there      vallejo metallics are awful not as bad as mr color aqueos the worst or citadel which have huge metallic particles but still awful hand brushing water based metallics of any brand look like shit unfortunately this is why the non metallic metal painting technique like pic related is so popular with professional miniature painters there really isnt a good acrylic alternative hand painting lacquers like tamiya or mr color with a dust mask or respirator is the best option if you dont want it to look terrible lacquers arent anywhere near as harmful when hand brushed as it is not atomized
    i was actually about to suggest you look up that kit its the latest ims release  supposedly the best quality version of the design it has been retooled  improved from the previous mirage releases its in stock at the volks us store here    
  beautiful once i get my next paycheck this will be my christmas gift to myself thank you again anon
new thread 
how big is your collection /toy/ right now im sitting on a hefty 156 figures consisting of figma sas sh figuarts sh monsterarts and kayodo  do you like how many you have do you ever think you dont have enough or too many toys pic related is about half of my boxes dont have a display going because im currently moving and dont know when ill be able to have a setup again when i was in college i would rotate figures out between vacations when i went back home since i didnt have enough space and that was back when i only had about 70 do you guys have any tips about what i could do when i find a place
  10 mechs  1 anime fig  5 horrid soulless nightmares for some reason  3 rcs ones a traxxas machine  and around 126 hot wheels
  i have about 100 figures a good chunk are shitty marvel legend cause theyre cheap and easy to get
too many to count offhand i mostly collect robot spirits and dabble occasionally in other lines i think im approaching 120 or so of the robot spirits and the other stuff i couldnt even begin to count because its so varied and some ive thrown out the packaging for which makes it harder to count maybe 300 just a guess really     but yes absolutely my collection is out of hand and im running out of space honestly considering throwing out the boxes lately to condense down to a few plastic totes instead of an entire closet full of boxes
thousands  at least 5000 and probably nearing 10000
  i predominantly collect pokémon articulated merch and i think have about 50ish figures mostly mons with some poké nendoroids and figmas pic related is an example    i move around a bit for work so i currently dont have a tasty set up i store most of them away at my folks until such time as i have a permanent base
100lbs of lego  20 375 iron man armors  30 robot damashii  30 chug transformers  a couple gffmc and some other odd figures    thats after giving some away already less premium stuff mostly for the anticipated size of immediate future living spaces id like to have less but as a homeowner maybe someday id like to have a sizeable room or area dedicated to lego inventory build space think mini fig scale 7 foot spaceships and a city  display of toy collection and other recreation going in on lego like that will probably see reductions elsewhere
  how do you display your hotwheels dont collect them myself so id imagine youd line up all of the blisters or maybe unpack them and put them on closelyspaced shelves      cmon anon you cant say you have a collection of 5k10k figures and not show pictures either you have a lot of space or the stuff you collect is small
too fucking big to the point where its becoming unlivable and its getting kind of annoying mostly because my place is too small and compared to my last place i lost so much square footage at the same time i dont want to sell shit that i love and i definitely dont want to lose money on each item since my absolute favorites are the only stuff actually worth more than what i paid
i have 150200 figures from dozens of lines it annoys me because i enjoy everything i own but it looks a little incohesive overall with all of the scale/series/aesthetics being different i group similar things on the same shelf so that helps a little bit but i still feel a little envy when i see people really dedicated to a line when the line i collect the most of has only 10 figures i just like too many things to stick with a single line
guessing around 15k considering swiveling around in my office chair just counted 132 figures out and about in the room and not the ones boxed up in the closet in other parts of the apartment or in storage    fuck
ive gone from buying figures whenever i can to only being interested in things i can customize like model kits and lego my collection of those has reached the point where i have a ton of material to make projects from so i havent bought anything new in a while   aside from mythic legions and well made skeleton figures nothing really compels me any more   after having a few high quality japanese figures its become quickly apparent that almost anything i could find in retail in the usa is cheap garbage
  youre asking to be trolled with this middling collection  your gonna be told either youve bought way too much or that youre small time in comparison
  in terms of figures i probably have about 6070 higher quality stuff being about 40 of that
  my collection is so large that it cant be contained in a single space no room is going to be just for holding shit because then itd be unwieldy to get to muchless display    also the trick is to using smaller boxes to store your shit you can put them just about anywhere  so now i have a large collection of boxes too
  and that bottom ammo can holds this many sets   also have a dozen extra sets that i found weeks later
got shelves full of offbrand lego i dont care so much for the premium lego brand as i do making builds for my mega bloks figures they take up the majority of space    own 40ish 1/72 diecast model tanks because too lazy and dumb to build scale model kits  mostly coldwar    sadly my matchbox and hotwheels have been purged only retained various diecast toy tanks    have a handful of patlabor mechs and a soltic from revoltech/robot daimashi that fit in well next to diecast tanks i really want a votoms at but ill likely end up building one out of lego    own only 5 figma rest of my weeb figures are tiny like desktop army
  absolutely agreed on imports theres no comparison most of the time
    ive always used tackle boxes but had never thought of ammo cans thats a great idea they look cool too id imagine you also have some sort of labeling system so you know whats in each i guess that would be the downside of them being opaque
  no real labeling  pretty much i know what goes where and whats in each based on the room its stored in the size of the container and common sense of whats new by being higher up or forefront    so gi joe boxes are in my bed rooms closet with my clothes office closet has more of them and oter 118 stuff vehicles for 118 figures are in a shortage room out back   models are mostly kept out in the open ontop of bookcases and the top of closets  112 and misc scale stuff is scattered around other closets    then theres my receiving bookcase where newly bought stuff is put until i get around to organzing it  but since i usually just play with the new stuff and rotate out displays to put up my new stuff the bookcase is used mostly for doubles model kits and other shit i cant play with immediately and new books of course this is in my sidehall leading to the garage
hmm
1/2  i own about 250 figs ranging from marvel legends marvel select dc figs neca dbz kits and 4 hot toys i have all my figs displayed across 6 72inch tall bookcases heres my four fav displays before i make dioramas
  2/2
2 figures polynian  and 40000 legos
13 figuarts  5 sic  5 busou shinki  4 guttokuru  6 1/10 anime statues  6 transformers more when siege comes out  and about a dozen cheap trading figures/candy toys    this is of course not including toys i still have from my childhood that are packed away of which there are probably a dozen boxes or so i used to buy lots of figmas and revoltechs when i first started collecting in 2010 but i got rid of them all over the years as my tastes changed and now im much more selective    not a pic of my collection but one that inspires me
what do your girlfriends think about these collections anons
  stop
  im only like half joking had a friend in my room once when i had a display going and she thought it was cool
  why dont you throw those fucking boxes away why are you hanging on to trash
itt people who collect valueless trash
  this fuck toys and fuck america
ive hit a point where i also have more figures than display space each day i work one gets put away and each day off one goes on a shelf just to keep it fresh
20k30k lego and a bunch of old toys i havent inventoried fully sold a bunch of recently as well    current era over 420 figures and models ranging from hot toys to mattel everything is inventoried and tracked in a spreadsheet with quantity and value that i update about every 2 months for insurance and display planning
  how often do you count your lego/legos/lagoes
  because he cant actually afford his toys and needs to resell them to buy new ones
  this fuck poor people and fuck america
  man i remember i tried hanging onto all the bionicle canisters i had and i was super pissed when they got lost in a move
  dont have enough and too many are kind of not applicable instead there are things i dont own yet and things i am considering getting rid of most of the time when i get rid of things its to make room for other things or im just getting out of collecting a line      b8 aside my girlfriend is supportive she likes that i collect things she likes that i dont care what people think about my collection she enjoys looking at the poses photos and dioramas i make
  probably about 5070 figures i actually display  though a lot of those are transformers titans return which i see somewhat disconnected from my other figures
  only recently did it for the first time for loose pieces have unbuilt joker manor and voltron sets that i will count into it once i complete them  i should probably do a minifigure inventory at some point
  oh and a shit ton of lego
  my man spreadsheets are great for collecting
  i started it originally as a way to remember all the things that i had shipped or coming in from trades or sales but now i just catalog everything
  i am the girlfriend in my case its a bit of a flipflop since my boyfriend isnt terribly interested in figures but understands how they can be appealing we each have our own hobbies and support each other either way so i dont really mind
i currently own about 60 figures i have owned about 300 figures since i started collecting i buy things that look interesting and sell off things that loose appeal over the years i only ever display about 30 figures at a time i can rotate through them regularly and it helps me appreciate each piece it makes the hobby feel more like a currated collection and less like a horders cluster fuck
  in those sterilite drawers a bit more practical than using cardboard boxes and its pretty much neat also yes i open these fuckers up theyre meant to be played not sealed
  i did it originally to keep track i had stored now its tracking status on ordered items as well
  moth figure  where can i get this
    sounds like a not being rich in america problem  sounds like a you problem faggot    also all of these faggot anime toys are for fucking weeb losers
  ive shared this countless times but heres an outdated video of my office     embed    ive sold a few figures and bought a ton more im really running out of space thinking about getting a fourth detolf
  just recently discovered the cosiness of xcel on my phone im gonna catalog my collection like this
  i dont get the point of tracking shit like that    if you cant remember what you have its because you didnt actually want it  i have over 5000 figures and i know almost everything that i own  the shit i dont know i own its army builders and with army builders its okay to keep buying them
  what are his hobbies
  i use it to keep track of when i bought it and how much i paid if i ever died suddenly at least my loved ones could sell off my collection and make a few proper quid instead of just throwing up a lot on ebay for nothing
  fuck their scalping asses    if my family is selling off my shit and dont do the proper research thats their own dumb fault i want my shit to go to people who will appreciate my junk    btw i used to handle dying peoples collections and other assets and shit was sad not just because of people who expected junk to be worth something but because i was literally going through their life of collecting crap that amounted to nothing in the end and there was the family getting all antsy about the value of that crap   fucking vultures    you can make good money doing that shit and traveling expenses and meals are all paid for if you get rich clients who also happen to have the worst families  if youre an asshole you can also undervalue crap and buy it yourself because most times they cant wait to offload it for their money i never did this but was offered things for half off by the families i was even given things for free just because i actually liked what i was handling at the time electronics comics even antique sculptures obviously that shit had to be properly signed over or id probably get sued or accused of theft    anyway if i die and no one wants my shit i hope it does go for peanuts so someone else can find their grail or favorite new thing for peanuts
  fuck their scalping asses  honestly not reading that rambling blog if you cant see the logic in selling something for what its worth then i dont know what to tell ya
  ive probably hit the 2300 mark but i have slowed the waaaay fuck down due to space and completing my main collection
  sounds like you have being bullied by some otaku fags dressed up like girls
i have a large collection my display cabinet has about 50 built gunpla of varying sizes pic related was my backlog of unbuilt models    from 5 years ago its not only doubled but i have both the lack of desire to build many leading me to offload many as gifts to friends had ambitions to be a modeler but i just want the end product not the time to do it as well as other interest least over 100 transformers from masterpiece figures in boxes to main line kids toys which are strewn around my room yes its pic related no those kits in pic related reside under the bed normally and in storage boxes one of which is dedicated to 200 hotwheels cars in boxes another 60 are unboxed which are in 6 sewing boxes for open viewing as well as many figma nendoroids and such    i have the hoarder mentality and my goal was to quit buying once my holy grail transformers we got mp beast megatron now we just need a titan scorponok come out but there is always some god damn new anime coming out that said thanks to announcement that is mp44 optimus 30 i am considering going cold turkey and just sticking to digital video games since they take no space almost i have 20tb of storage devices and sales are plentiful    dont be me i have the money to keep buying crap and none of the financial worry yes i work but i live a very minimal lifestyle but not the freedom to display as id like nor the reasonable space to really have as much as i have not that id be selling anything theyre only in the boxes the higher end imports for safe storage everything else gets tossed in giant bins    laugh if you wish id most likely close this tab and start hunting on ebay for more trash
  hoarding  minimal lifestyle  wut    theres nothing minimal about buying more than 48 square feet of just unbuilt gunpla and buying who knows how many games that you will probably never finish in your lifetime    this fake modern minimalism is a deluded lie of materialistic narcissistic entitlement babies
  5 mattel jw   1 black label stormtrooper  5 necas  1 transformer  1 funko    also an ever growing supply of animal figures that come in yowie toys  brother buys em for his kids all the time and they have a retarded amount of the animals and they end up at everyones houses  while at work kids get em and bust em open and throw the shit everywhere toy usually included and half the time when im taking the mess to claims i forget about the damn toys and find em the next day at home in my pocket
218 figures all cataloged     theres also bttf ghostbusters and star wars including the giant millenium falcon lego    and many hot wheels
yknow i should probably catalog all my shit since i want to sell a lot of it anyway and its mostly just sitting in boxes rn
  i did it for that reason and it helps to keep things in check and feel responsible for such an expensive hobby
1 sh figuarts  1 sh monsterarts  5 sas  3 revoltech  2 storm collectibles  2 mezco  5 btas dcc    and what i consider to be too much lego im okay with the size of my action figure collection but i worry about the amount of lego i have

previous thread 
so i take it gogeta confirmed for the broly movie
  seems too buff to me pass
  yeah watch the new trailer
  what do you think dipshit
so wait when are gogeta and broly preorders going up again
  who knows
now i dont know if i want to go to bed for fear of missing preorders
  im setting an alarm for 1145 just to be sure
does this shit ever actually go up for po on a saturday
    lmao cant wait for the bloodbath when amiami and hlj crash simultaneously because the new websites are shit
  that looks pretty nice actually i dont care about this line but im glad you guys are getting good entries
  oh shit he does have a normal head
      some tiny text on the site says orders wont open at retailers until the 3rd      2018年12月3日月一般販売店様での予約解禁予定
  good to know thanks for spotting that bruh gonna need nothing gogeta and broly
so december 3rd
  so they give him a normal head but they couldnt give gotenks one
      im like 90 sure itll be the 3rd because thats when the sh figuarts captain marvel goes up for preorder
fffffuck yeah
    yes the same time bandai will be releasing everything else including belial i am 99 sure
  gotenks isnt a major movie merch pusher
dang broly looks to have some pretty great posebility for a bigger figure
  fuck he looks greatsuper gogeta has been one of my top like three wants in this line while this isnt ss version it still looks nice and i know theyre do the ss version eventually       well the original broly had some really great articulation hes probably among the best articulated and hes also the biggest figure in the line its really not surprising since they kind of have more material to work with
    mfw sdcc exclusive classic gogeta will have a different skin tone than ssb gogeta
  im more annoyed theyre probably gonna force a halo peghole onto his head
how much will he come with  so far i see  base head smiling  blue head neutral  blue head smiling  blue head yelling  2 fighting hands  2 gripping hands
  but still no ss hair guess they are saving that for the sdcc recolor
  holy fuck also look at his feet firmly on the ground passable ankles at least
  so the fusion hands will come with the new goku and vegeta
  seems like thats when theyre putting up a bunch of stuff i think spike also goes up on the 3rd
  i cant believe people hate on this figure it looks great
  theyre just butthurt about old broly
    are these web exclusives or regular releases
  regular
  gogeta and broly are regular bluegeta 20 is exclusive
  gotenks fags give us kamikaze ghosts  bandai sure  replaces planned black hair parts with only one ghost  ahahahahahaha gotenks fags getting postshafted even harder than before
  it wasnt before they updated the sculpt
    oh thank god i was worried to death these would be web exclusives
both gogeta and broly look like great releases actually all the figures next year look great with super buu topping them all  lmao at gotenks though
    the gotenksfags ritualposting jinxed the gotenks release i bet
  still gonna be a complete bitch to secure an order on bandai night
  are they going to mold his chest in the proper color this time
  2 at once will be fun considering ami turns into a first day bethesda release for just one   wait theyre releasing multiple figuarts from multiple lines that night disaster and frustration incoming
  my dude are you retarded
my bdays in april if i dont get my broly im gonna be sad
so preorders go up at what time
  midnight
  midnight pst
i have a hard time finding cell dragon stars pictures anyone
  yas
  damn gonna be a long night and i work the next morning but im still kind of bummed about missing dragon tour vegetto blue and broly so i gotta lock in these two
      what tonight
gogeta overshadowed this poor fellow
  all ive got is this
  read the thread you sperg
what websites do you guys recommend for the preorder  ive never ordered a figuarts and im going to try and go for the gogeta
  hlj or amiami
doesnt look like preorders are going up tonight nothing on amiami
  no shit sherlock
fell in love with ssj gogeta when i was a kid and never liked ssj vegito until i got older and rewatched dbz in kai  him turning blue in super got my cock throbbin now that gogeta is back and blue i have no idea how to feel
  whats the dilemma just enjoy the fanservice
  lol youll be lucky to even login to their shitty new site
tfw none of the villains have figures of their best forms yet    why no base nubroly
  because the dbz fanbase by majority drools over power is maximum shit and not the actual character designs     its why so many people dickride the fusions
  nippon yassan theyre fairly quick too i preordered future trunks on there and hes already on his way
  lol and a metal build on the same night    its going to be impossible
    tfw no final form cooler
  nippon yassan  also expensive as fuck and if a package is lost you may as well go fuck yourself
  blame that goten/trunks fag that constantly spams forced meme pics of long sleeves shops on /toy/ single handedly jinxed the whole thing
  is there a cheaper alternative if you want your figures as quickly as possible
  bbts if youre in burgerland hobbysearch is another good option if you want it direct from japan
  new dragon ball form  now his hair is blue
list updated    also with gogeta and broly now coming for april did 21 just get dropped seems strange since they had the little card with release date for her not long ago at an event
    this is all i could have ever asked for he will make a fine replacement for gotenks which i cancelled
  if youre in the us just order from bbts youll get the figure later than everybody that orders from japan but youll still get it
  did you not get the first one
now people can make blue gogeta fight goku black like the predictions said a million years ago too bad black doesnt have a white hair head
no power levels who is better
  design and personality i like gogeta more
  gogeta has personality
  vegito had a cooler look and better fight scenes
  difficult both have cool attacks and a cool design
based toriyama salvaging shitty toei characters
  i can see i have a great following
  movie 12 gogeta is he type that gets shit done instead of getting cocky and letting others power up
  honestly spirit sword is still worth a buy imo
  gogeta is cooler but vegito is funnier
  there have been a shitload of new releases since the new site design and theyve worked them out i havent had any problems preordering any of the new figure like super buu from amiami and that was on mobile where the design is even worse and slower than the normal version of the site
  see   
gogeta is getting a figurerise standard kit too
  isnt broly getting one too
  top 10 would be    17 dbs  janemba  pink outfit bulma  merged zamasu  bardock  18 any other relevant design  videl  cooler  trunks 20  hit
    oh thats cool anon you do that
  my collection has expanded a lot recently but this list still makes it look small compared to others lmao
ssj3 gotenks  no date    there was a prototype of that
    i dont like to keep old things around still wondering if i want android 21 that would be awesome if they released her nonmajin
    theyve never shown off ssj3 gotenks you might have seen a figuarts zero
i wonder if these two will come with base and if they do will they be the superior goku  vegeta figures
  i know preorders arent up for the new figures but im gonna
  not wanting the new superior broly  end yourself
  they wont and you know it but i hope they come with lots of faces or at least effects
  nubroly is trash with his purple yoga pants and his lime green bath mat skirt ill pass thanks
  vegito has a cooler attack and outfit but gogeta has cooler hair and shit
i know the pole is gokus thing but has anyone given it to anyone else
  it will be too late after you see the movie and fall in love with him anon think about it
  theyre not the same height
  thats basically gokus hair why not at least give him brolys bangs to make him more unique
now that most of the important dbz figures are released they should just start doing some crazy shit
  is that like adult gotenks still have a lot more dbz stuff to go too
  how about more dragon ball characters instead of z and super ones
  stick with your anchor arms broly who got mad because a baby cried next to him
this nudragon ball run is just about hype no need for a good story just show broly what will get people excited lets have an evil goku and bring back trunks people loved trunks know what else people loved transformations but we dont want to get creative just turn the hair blue and red and white and lets have a tournament be every other arc what ever happened to story telling what happened to feeling a sense of dread when characters fought a bad guy what happened to stakes and character development emotional deaths creativity look at this new movie what is there original about it whats new nothing
  no need for a good story  yeah thats what i associate with dragon ball good story not fun fights and characters not good humor good story
  the stories were compelling enough now theres nothing compelling its just  remember freeza remember piccolo saving gohan remember broly remember gogeta its trash
  nah dragonball sucks
  vegeta is exclusive  that sucks is it hard to get a po in for exclusives  goku didnt get a release date  hopefully he wont be exclusive either
  if anything unlike the previous broly the new one seems to be more developed in terms of personality and the movie itself works as a way of showing us things about the past that we havent seen before
  that sucks is it hard to get a po in for exclusives  no you can order from mykombini or ny usually or just wait for bbts because exclusives are released retail in the us
  gogetas design is much cooler to me than vegettos goku with his colors flipped and vegetas gloves and boots despite just wearing the metamoran clothes like gotenks and i admittedly have a soft spot for his ss4 design i definitely prefer gogeta    id say that vegetto is actually much stronger though but its very clear given the way he names himself using vegetakakarotto and his general attitude that vegetas personality is very dominant and combined with gokus traits and the idea that the potara fusion would last you end up with a cocky asshole who holds back and ends up just fucking around too much to get anything accomplished
  top consequtive releases  shenron  yamcha  tien  kid goku  goku black  frieza  what a fucking ride the beginning of this year was    roshi into buu bulma and gotenks has been a drag kid krillyn into satan will be a bit of a drag as well
  with his vegeta i wouldnt be too concerned majin vegeta was an exlcsuive and is very easy to get still
  looks like future gohan and future trunks
  last time i ordered from bbts i didnt get a figure till 2 months after its release so no
    guess ill keep an eye out then these go up on the 3rd right
where would be best to pre order if eurofag 
  thats referring to dragon stars
  nudragonball  i think you need to reread/rewatch dragonball again once the android saga hits the story isnt even about dragonballs anymore its just fights and powerups
  and now you have it for the rest of your life did those two months really matter
  honestly i think the problem started with beerus bog was great as a standalone movie because it presented a foe that couldnt be beaten but goku showed him some tenacity and challenge that he lost and that it was revealed that this universe was only one of many in a multiverse filled with strong fighters was probably the best ending that db could have ever had goku fucking off to train uub at the end of z was retarded as was hastily ending the fight with omega shenron only to have goku fuse with shenron was also stupid    dragonball should end with the ceiling of strong fighters being wideopen and goku losing to beerus only to learn that theres entire universes out there with strong fighters was perfect because in our heads we can only imagine what future training goku and vegeta will endure and what future fights they will come upon    having goku and friends hang around with literal universebusters on a daily basis means theres zero threat or urgency in any of the battles because if they write themselves into a corner they can just have beerus or zeno just blink the threat out of existence which literally happens
  android saga had its flaws but it was a good culmination of gohans rage arc
  yeah he should be the next release followed by mui goku and ssgss vegito then this new gogeta
  most likely     basically broly and gogeta will sell out but not be goku black bad    vegeta blue might has preorders sell out but ultiamtley will be fine to get things will relist goku will be very easy to get
  ive sold a lot of damn figures
arm gap fags have yall ever notcied all the elbows have a small gap not just trunks and gogeta
noob question but are the figuarts worth it over the figurerise standard stuff ive built broly and vegito but the figuarts are tempting and my bn has the awakening ssj goku
thanks anon for 16 sorry for shitty photo but hes my 1st 10 and honestly he is really great despite that bigger than i expected too dont know if the seller wants to remain anonymous or not but i can vet for him if anyone else wants to buy stuff from him super nice and speedy shipping
  i have never gotten a figurerise but from what i have seen and general consensus most if not all agree that sh figuarts generally looks and poses much better but can be a fair bit more expensive
    gogeta will sell out  broly will shelfwarm for atleast a few months i guarantee it
  no way he looks awesome and is huge    but larger figures dont sell as well short term because of price not everyone has money in this economy most dont
    i hate to break it to you but figurerise are shit
  is gogeta that popular hes a noncharacter in an okay dbz movie
  the dragon balls were necessary for the finale of the buu arc creating the ssg and reviving frieza the super dragon balls were relevant to every arc of super so far the regular dragon balls are used in broly
  so is broly
  if i have the money to pay to get my figures as soon as they release why would i wait 2 months to save 20 that ill make back in an hour
  broly was in three movies he had development in the first couple
  somehwat this i want the figure immediatley thats when my excitment is greatest and i somewhat like the attention of having the new toy
  ill be the first to tell you not to order from big bad toy scalpers but and normally i buy my figures from import sites but for gogeta i can wait
  sold the androids super vegeta and nappa  could i ask why anon financial trouble or just not a fan of them anymore
  im prolly gonna sell super vegeta because the new one will have a better bod color
  seeing how hes been a heavily requested figure hell probably be hard to get for the first couple of weeks but seeing how hes a regular release and not a web exclusive he hopefully wont be goku black levels of rare
  thats what i said
  any tension the series had ended by the time the cell saga was over
  i like the kai outfit better but i think gogeta has cooler attacks and personality
  honestly it was more of a space issue combined with just wanting to shift focus with my collection and of course it doesnt hurt when the money can go to newer figures i want more at one point i was going for pretty much the whole line and when i realized that was becoming not feasible i started focusing on a goku shelf as well as a shelf of personal favorite characters i could have just bought another cabinet and expanded my collection but at the time being limiting my collection to 1 cabinet works for me and its already spilling out throughout the room anyways
  fusion reborn is objectively in the top 3 dbz movies
  personality all he does is kick janemba and throw fairy dust at him i like gogeta but come on now
  top 5  1 battle of the gods  2 history of trunks  3 worlds strongest  4 biobroly  5 fusion reborn
  and thats called personality he is serious doesnt act cocky or makes fun of his opponents he gets the job done but from the trailers it seems like that has changed
  bio broly  youre fucking kidding right
  i unironcally love that movie it had a unique cast no goku wins lol faggotry clogging up the movie gave others a chance to shine
  i always thought gogeta felt more like a proper mixture designwise vegetto looks closer to just angry goku
  biobroly  and i like history of trunks but if that coutns so does bardock
  did toriyama design gogeta
  the first broly shf literally pre sold out before it hit the us back before le stock cut meme started    no it wont
  i dont think so apparently he had actually considered a metamoron fusion in the manga but the movie had already happened so he made up the potara as a response to that
  the only design elements unique to gogeta are his hair face and the colors of his vest and belt the rest is straight up gotenks metamoran stuff
do you guys buy dupes of characters
  i cant understand why you would need multiple copies unless youre a customizer or scalper trash
  some people are mint in box autists
  but the movie had already happened so he made up the potara as a response to that    i had to look this up out of curiosity cause i wouldve sworn vegetto long predated gogeta and its true he does but only by a mere two months and arguably since animation takes longer gogeta couldve been conceived of first its actually crazy just how fast production on the dbz anime was the whole status quo of fr with vegeta being dead was probably written as soon as it happened in the manga
  youre absolutely right anyone who thinks super is onpar with z is forgetting that z had shit like vegetas entire redemption leading up to his sacrifice against buu or gohans entire arc leading up to cell it was dumb and had absurd powerups and shit but at its heart it had good writing for its characters  super is fun and all but it doesnt hold a candle
  1 history of trunks  2 og broly   3 bardock the father of goku  4 fusion reborn  5 coolers revenge
  1 wrath of the dragon  2 worlds strongest  3 fusion reborn  4 bojack unbound  5 history of trunks
  1 battle of gods  2 dragon ball z broly  3 coolers revenge  4 fusion reborn  5 history of trunks
  aside from the feet still looking bad and it just plain being a terrible redesign the figure is leagues better than the old broly  that design though holy shit what were they thinking its almost as bad as new bardock
  yes i buy one to open one to keep sealed and one just in case
  this surely aint nostalgia talking
  1 dead zone  2 tree of might  3 worlds strongest  4 history of trunks  5 coolers revenge
  only of goku black i bought a second just in case i damage the first one because his price isnt going to get any lower
  clown shoes  purple yoga pants  puke green bath mat skirt  edgy scars  oversimplified color palette  how is this better
has anyone preordered a figure through amazon i know about the whole goku black situation but it seemed that was the case with most retailers im alright with receiving a figure late i just want to make sure i actually get the figure
just got trunks from nippon yassan he came in the brown packaging and didnt have a scratch on him as opposed to amazon who dented the box in almost every figure i own and stuffed in shitty bubble wrap  anyways he looks great not glossy at all and not a single paint issue
  how is this better  it doesnt look like a dragon quest reject for starters
  amazons been so shitty lately they refuse to stop sending me figures in those thin padded envelopes and theyre crushed almost every single time
  ive preordered dragon ball figures from amazon for like five years and never once had a problem if that says anything
  it doesnt look like a dragon quest reject  youre right it looks worse
  the amazon problem was just from people who were late to the game trying to get preorders in at the last minute mostly
  nah the old is shit
  oh boy you sure told him
  i wish you at least had an option to pay for better shipping
  fuck off retard      i already listed all the things wrong with it its not my fault his taste is shit
  you used to be able to select this item is a gift and theyd put it into a box but it seems like they stopped that
  well that does say something but im seeing post saying the figuart boxes arrived damaged have you had an issue with this      yeah that could of been a part of it
  so the only issue i have with trunks so far is that his gripping hands almost dont fit the sword handle its a very very tight fit that you pretty much have to force in there also even though i already knew the answer head swaps arent gunna work so dont even bother trying  his ankles are great and stands balanced at pretty much any pose highly recommend already
  not those guys but at least his base form before the armor comes off looks better than the faggy dragons quest jewelry he sports i actually think the green/black armor is nice not to mention the slightly darker skin and the gold eyes give him some more traits that seperate him from goku and vegeta his father definitely had a better design previously though i limed his colors he looked regal as fuck
  amazon regularily cancels my marvel legends and star wars black preorders and my black too you can preorder from there just expect them to cancel at some point in time if it takes too long  the biggest fuck you ive gotten is a 15 dollar tarkin them canceling and them him going back in stock less than a month after the cancel for full price 30 can
just a rushed paintnet job but i really wanted to see if this works looking forward to the inevitable exclusive
  woah really cool could you do it for this photo
  fuck it ill buy the df on this at least the hair wont be wildly off just hope its not another see through fiasco
  gogeta makes me sad that i wont have gotenks to pose him with all they had to do was shrink the head even with the chest issue i would have bought him
  i preordered son goku and he came a bit late but everything else was fine
  ayy looks better than the blue shit were getting
  wheres the like button
the goku black squad is here
  only if i break the first i dont have the space for it im already trying to sell a lot
  quality list
  where did you get the normal goku i cant find him anywhere
  i bought mine on sale on the barnes and noble site broly hype didnt kick in until it eventually sold out later
heads up japan doesnt do daylight savings or whatever so for my east coast brethren check amiami at 2am that might actually be when its up
  tomorrow morning right
  or is it tonight morning
  i thought it was tonight am i retarded and wrong
    is this like their usual preorders where its usually when its midnight pst here
  fuck man im super hammered my bad ahaha i meant monday morning
  why drink alcohol when you have a fun time playing with your figures
  no i was out tonight but i dont want to miss out on the gogeta and broly pre orders
  nigga toriyama has one face he can draw he just flipped the little zigzag he draws for a mouth upside down dont act like theres any real effort put into these characters
  honestly the real effort goes in to his nonbipedal characters and vehicles
  nice posing friend
  i got him here     sadly he increase in price pretty much everywhere which bugs me because they kept touting the 3500 price tag for months up till his release
why did they make dbs trunks so short shouldnt he be the same height as saiyan armor or xenoverse trunks at least 
  well that bulkedup ss form isnt really accurate to his normal height see broly and xeno isnt canon so
  blame vegetas manlet genes
  vegito he doesnt give a fuck
  no    demonicon ssj4 god gogeta pls
can someone post 20 gohan next to gotenks
you guys already killed hlj
  a feather touching their new website could destroy it the new site has been a disaster since launch    to be fair theyve fixed quite a few issues but i dont think its going to hold up well tonight
so if people dont manage to get their hands on gogeta this time around theyre fucked no
  scalper out
  i was more talking about myself i wanted to get gogeta but ive quite a lot to pay for around the same time plus i will be busy tomorrow so unlikely to get a preorder in anyway
is broly going up tonight too or just gogeta
  both should be going up tonight at the same time
  thought so thanks
so any specific time it will go online or is it just sometime on the 3rd of december
when
  such a good outfit toriyama does great outfit design
  probably around the same time as saiyan armor goku
  probably midnight pst and 2am east coast
  thanks a lot
  why does anyone care about this its just a very generic looking top piece that he never wore again after arriving with it
  because goku spends a large portion of dragon ball and z in the turtle gi it ends up being very washed out as a design over time especially when its worn by krillin yamcha and gohan as well    so its really fresh when he shows up in a very alien design its asymmetrical which is cool a different color palette we havent seen looks very toriyama and is worn during the great exchange between trunks and goku id hardly call it generic    these are the same reasons people like the casual jacket goku or even farmer goku
  so its really fresh when he shows up in a very alien design its asymmetrical which is cool a different color palette we havent seen looks very toriyama and is worn during the great exchange between trunks and goku id hardly call it generic  mainly this
  fixed a bit more for you with a correct shade of blue for belt and shoes
played with trunks some more today hes a damn near perfect figure his smiling face is the worst of the bunch but really doesnt look all that bad his hip pieces get loose just like saiyan raised on earth goku but they dont fall out it is still damn near impossible to put his hands in his sword without fear of breaking anything
  his spirit sword is actually very light it comes with a stand but i actually didnt need it at all he balances just fine without it but normal stands help too theres not a single spec of messed up paint anywhere on the figure and hes not glossy at all he cant do a full split but he can get in just about any pose i love him
  he looks cool as fuck you pleb
  looking forward to the inevitable exclusive  you guys said the same shit with lots 20 and nothing ever becomes true  blue kid goku  first appearance vegeta  nappa anime colors   etc
  give it time the 20s have only been around for about two years now and its pretty rare for them to do a straightup repaint as a con exclusive anyway    usually its just like sdcc though this year they had the broly cell and ssb vegito all as event exclusives theyll get around to the 20s
  this is probably reaching hard but trunks is significantly skinner in dbs and suffering from malnutrition since goku black hes seen eating cat food half a can at that so clearly theres not much to eat in his world anymore im willing to bet he gained a few inches just off of powering up back when he was fighting cell
  absolutely      i cant speak for everyone but i know some people and myself buy multiples for multiple displays mostly vegeta and goku have multiple transformation in the same gi so buying multiples of that body just seems natural if i wanna display them all at the same time
  base kaioken isnt included but ssb kaioken is
  god ss4 looks like absolute garbage in those clothes
    nah senpai its gohanks future gohan  trunks
  that image is retarded as fuck anyway  ss4 goku with orange gi  everyone has the exact same copypaste gi with none of the right boots belts or kanji
        yeah this is just some shit image i found on google lmao its trash
  thanks buddy looking forward to getting this one ordered from a potentially dodgy ebay seller so wish me luck
    im glad hes turning out really well    the past 3 months havent been the most exciting releases and i had no interest in trunks but seeing as hes really great it makes me happy    while im excited for satan it wouldve sucked if trunks sucked then the next fig is a gag character followed by another mostly gag figure
  the fuck you just said about great saiyaman / gohan
  im pumped for him and hes gonna be fun but come on look at that skirt sh has a bad track record with skirts    i think hell look great and ill love him and youll love him but honestly these past few and next few aside from trunsk now  havent been the most powerful dynamic cool dudes     and all this broly movie hype makes me want some more brawlers like who gives a fuck about kid krillyn
  confused face  smug face with removable roshi glasses  another surprised face for when trunks reveals his intentity to him  on top of that sweet ass suit  yes please
  not enuf pixels
  i was initially down with the db line despite the size issues but theyre honestly pretty boring releases outside of kid goku
  roshi and bulma are just fine kid goku is great but doesnt pose with anyone krillyn is just goku again witha worse head and a terrible effect    like you telling me that shitty effect is on par with nimbus
  if it comes with some unique face/ hands and fits the awakening warrior ss head id buy it otherwise just get a customizer to make it
  i lost interest in roshi really fast my preorder also got delayed way into august so apathy set in
  theyre fine just not the most exciting characters even from db itself maybe if they make a jackie chun version of roshi now if we could get piccolo or tao id be more hyped
  those non canon colors are way better than the canon we got
  is roshi really worth it though i bought him off barnes and noble twice and both times they never processed my order i had to call them weeks later to get a refund i see him on sale again and i kinda want him but after getting fucked twice im starting to lose interest in him
i want a bandit yamcha in the dragon ball line and a puar
  i bought him off barnes and noble twice and both times they never processed my order  i bought him and yamcha in the same order almost three weeks and they still havent been processed
  king fucking piccolo
  thats a given
  just walking into barnes and noble hes been at pretty much every single bn ive ever been in recently
when did kid kurillin get revealed i feel like weve had like 10 z/super reveals since kk was first shown
  i think he was revealed probably 78 months ago
sucks that well never get trunks in his dbh outfit
  man this show looks like shit
  july 1st apparently that means weve had   super buu  blue goku  blue vegeta  blue gogeta  android 21  jiren  gohan gs  mr satan  broly    since the last db reveal they better be making an amazing huge king piccolo for this
  thats par for course vegito loses due to circumstances without actually losing the upperhand in combat while gogeta flat out wins in a movie its history repeating itself if its like last time gogeta will end up with flashier animation too despite being weaker since its a movie
  im pretty sure july 1st was when he went up for po but he was revealed a little while before that    though i forget if he was one of those revealed and then literally went up for po a day or two later    that said you are right im surprised we havent seen any other db figures yet even if they showed off a new one tomorrow were practically looking at next fall for its release at absolute earliest assuming the actually release all the protos weve seen so far before it
  i live right by bn they hardly have any figures of any kind let alone dragonball books
would love a bardock and first form frieza  absolutely terrified theyll make the dragonball super versions  they wouldnt do that would they
  ill take whichever bardock im just mad they removed his bandanna movie bardock is an easy cc exclusive they could do
  id take it theres nothing wrong with his super design
  roshi isnt that big is he
  fuck you
  hes massive i do have him straight upright in this pic and the turtle shell shortens his height
  //////////// that helmet  i hope the paint is cleaner than that on the official release
  the square shoulder pouldrons look sooo fucking stupid
  i doubt it remember the classic bardock appears in   the original movie  the manga  episode of bardock  episode of bardock manga  the majority of the games  major focus in xenoverse  fighterz  all his cards in dokkan  almost all gachapon shit  and it would allow them to make easy remolds for masked saiyan or ss3 bardock plus they could do a normal release with the scouter and a damaged one with the bandana
  thats true but we are getting a base and blue gogeta before the iconic super saiyan version so they could end up doing anything
  yes but this new gogeta easily sets them up to make the old one either as a convention figure or with a janemba release    by making new bardock theyd have to do more work to make the old one also gogeta is the marquis hype character of the movie so striking while the iron is hot now makes sense even though bardock is in the film hell probably only be in a little in flashbacks
have broly and gogetas listings gone up yet cant find them on amiami or hlj am i just retarded or dont they usually have a page up before its time to pre order
new ssgss figures to tie into to the movie  no pimp winter coat versions    fucking why
  because they dont have a 20 version yet and bandai knows theyll sell
according to at least hobbysearch preorders for broly/gogeta go up in about 5 hours just in case someone didnt know
  just wait there will be 3rd party ones soon enough
  this
  amiami usually does
  almost forgot about that was tonight thanks for the heads up
  soon
    need to sleep before work but also dont want to risk missing this  fug
hobbysearch vs amiami  pros and cons please i know amiami is fucking the worst as a site so i might need a backup
does anyone else buy the jakks or irwin dragon ball z figures to use as fillers for figures that figuarts hasnt made yet currently my favorites are babidi with my fat buu and mai to go with dbs trunks thats incoming but i have a good amount of them as fillers plus they are generally pretty cheap
  i found my old irwin supreme kai figure recently had a few marks on it that i was able to mostly get rid of with a magic eraser its slightly smaller than id like but im fine with it so all i would do with a supreme kai figure is stand him next to beerus and whis
get ready lads      also seems like they know it will crash and gave them special pages so hopefully it doesnt turn out that bad
  hobbysearch dont trust amiamis shitty new mobile site especially when japan still gets to use the old one
  ive found that chemical free baby wipes and enough rubbing will get marks off without taking away the original paint most of the time i hadnt even thought about supreme kai but im definitely going to check ebay for that now
so broly and gogeta dont come with any effect parts
  it says theyll be up at 100 japanese time so we should expect them tomorrow morning
  it says 200 japanese time
how does hobbysearchs shipping compare to amiami
  i was going to ask this their figures are considerably cheaper than amiami
  maybe were in different time zones they both show as this to me
  strange mine says 2
  same what time are they going up on eastern time
    aw fuck now im paranoid
      what time zone are you guys in im in central time
  different guy im in central time and it says 1 for me too
  eastern
    est
  have to go to sleep early because of work  did homie a solid a weak ago  ask him to preorder for me  he ends up covering my gogeta  all is well sometimes fellas
  mine is showing this pacific time
          i think its showing what time itll be available in your timezone despite it saying japan time
  its like they know its gonna be a fucking shit show with the dbzs spike and belial dropping in
final stretch faggots you ready
  im aiming for broly and spike then gogeta but i dont mind missing out on him
  ya boy is on the edge of his seat over here
nothing is up yet
  mine loaded
  slam dunked all 4 brethren its a good fuckin day
snagged broly and gogeta feels good man
got broly is good day
got broly and gogeta time for sleep
damn i missed the orders because of amiamis stupid site when do they usually go back in
got both was worried there when it was past the 10 minute mark as thats usually not a good sign
unfortunately shfiguarts super saiyan broly full power dragonball super brolypreorder is sold out
  got mine off hlj go there if you want it
jesus christ gogeta and broly closed on ami wouldve gotten them there but the damn site kept crashing but i snagged them on hlj hopefully got spike on ami atleast
guess ill just preorder something else if im not getting gogeta and broly
all these people saying gogeta and broly are sold out but theyre still available on amiami from what im seeing
ive ordered stuff from hlj before their site change but ive never preordered with hlj before are they as good as amiami or am i going to get my stuff a month later
fug  i want gogeta  but in his original colors    but what if they dont end up making that
for the people that missed out these are supposed to be regular releases you might have to wait longer but you should get a few more shots at them keep vigilant though the line is getting more popular and even the regular releases are starting to become harder to get in aftermarket right after release when they used to go down 10 or so before hitting that problem
  p sure dragon ball heroes is a game
  vegito didnt lose the fight with buu though he got absorbed on purpose it was all their plan besides they shoehorned in that bullshit with the potara being time limited in order to weaken him for the show anyway blame toriyamas hack writing and forgetting his own fuckin rules
  we dont know whether or not yet
  considering it would just be a simple recolor itll definitely happen give it 12 years and well see them announce fusion reborn gogeta with proper colors and super saiyan heads instead of ssb
how are the old joyride halo figures im considering buying some but id like to hear some opinions
  not as super poseable as the mcf versions but so much more fun very solid great accessories honestly i wish they had kept the line for h3
  yeah i much prefer the look of them to the mcfarlane ones im not too huge on articulation just decent enough hows the qc any common issues with them
  not him but personally i thought mcfarlane started off good and then just got too obsessed with details  pose ability towards the end as for joyride halo i have about 15 between halo ce and halo 2 and all except one are well built a halo 2 master chief and that one i bought used so not sure what it went through before i got it
  i loved these figures i had a halo 1 cheif a halo 2 chief that i got at spencers of all places and an elite all super fun
i had the blue spartan figure and i remember having too much fun playing with that thing they felt like they were built to be played with and thrown around wish i still had mine
  fun but avoid the early halo 2 spartans with deformed helmets
theyre honestly fucking sick i can andwer most of your questions if you still have any i always saw the early halo 2 spartans weird faces as an interesting alt head and never saw it as a big problem    the only real issue the figures have is that the hands are all made of a rubber material and it bends to hold weapons if you are super hard on it the wrists shear on these and tear off over time if that happens just glue the hand back on honestly it sounds bad at first but you need to consider the mcfarlane spartans hands simply just snapped if you tried to cram a weapon in or you just bent the grip of the gun or whatever so if you take care of them the hands shouldnt ever tear it can happen with poor storage or manhandling them though its unfortunate but it lets them all hold most weapons and i think it makes them feel that much more unique from other figures     also one more thing that is cool about these the chrome gold visors they look really impressive in hand you see your face in them distorted like youre looking in a spoon or christmas tree decoration that too makes them feel super unique compared to all the other merch out there      sorry for it being such a long post but i did grow up with these things and they have enough of a charm that they are my favorite toys to this day ive bought sold and tossed out all sorts of other more modern stuff but ill always keep these
the bigger ones are good but stay away from the 34 minis i had a handful of spartans and marines and literally every one of them came apart at the knees
  was only a problem with the halo 2 minifigures the halo 1 mini figures were really solidly constructed its kind of ironic though that in improving the sculpt they turned them into inferior products     you can pull the pegs out and replace them with better ones custom made which i did with one but that is a pain in the ass and obviously no one should have to do that idk why the pegs they used were such horseshit
  ill just tell you straight up what i did i had generic army men around that scale as a kid that came with single color molded plastic guns the type of yous you get from walmart for like a buck or two some of the guns had long barrels so i cut those to length and used them as the pin melted the ends and pushed them against the joint for a cap that wouldnt fall out the end result was a beefier looking peg but one that held the figure together perfectly and didnt look distracting either
  gen 3 and up had the best sculpts and poseibility
they were a game changer for me as a kid really still feel on par with collectible figures from today
  not wanting an arby n the chief master chief  ok bud    but yeah these figures are solid have almost all of red team from rvb put together from a bunch of multiplayer spartans   joyride grunts are some of the favorites of my collection just because of their bulk they cant pose much but theres no solid figure that captures halo ce2 grunts like em
i was obsessed with the halo 2 series 1 mc it was my favorite figure 
so im learning that furbies are still pretty popular and im just curious to know how many furbies you own  also the oldest or most unique furby you currently own pictures appreciated
  
  hes joking because i accidentally posted this thread on /v/ first
my parents buy every original furby they find at yard sales if its like 2 or less then they line them all up on a shelf in the guest room to make people uncomfortable my original one is among their ranks too
  hi dude saw the thread on /v/    i own 2 of the reboot models and a furby boom that unfortunately broke still works but doesnt move anymore    id really like to get the latest ones but theyre so fucking expensive i want them to hack them via bluetooth
  furbies  
i have two furby buddies two furblings and a plush ornament
  that sounds kind of hilarious actually how often do they find furbies at yard sales for so cheap i go yard saling a couple times a year and while i find a lot of childrens toys i dont think ive seen very many furbies
  she thiccc
  i have like 20 but this one has funny arms
  heres their modest collection i just happen to be visiting for thanksgiving not a whole whole bunch but more than your average household    they dont find them too often but often enough i guess
  i would die for him
  these two are good boys for sure
heres a better picture of them all condensed onto two shelves in case theres any reason for anyone to want a better picture
      holy shit your parents sound like awesome folks
whats the coolest fucking toy an anon could get for their 2 year old niece that they wont choke to death on
big lego shes 2 wrapping paper would blow her mind
shes 2 just get her like a box of fruit snacks and a plastic tierra and youll be her favorite uncle
  kinetic sand is always a nice gift its tactile and you can get it in glittery colours messy play toys and sensory toys are nice maybe a nice huge soft toy bigger than her she can snuggle and be amazed by
the biggest mazinger z sofubi you can find
  a fukno pop those are cool and contain 0 small parts
this could serve as her private clubhouse for years
    shes a girl dipshits girls like dolls and animals not gay robots
  she got one of those already i was thinking magnetic blocks or something
get her a tablet with fortnite thats what the kids are about these days
  i wouldnt recommend these i thought it would be a fun toy for the girls the randomnessakesit exciting   but we keep catching my neice masterbating with it
  which way does the snake stick out
shes only 2 buy her a fisher price rattle
  a supersoaker filled with bleach
 has it right a stuffed animal bigger than you is the the fuckin shit       magnets  unsupervised toddlers is a dangerous combination theres a reason those magnet ball things got banned      are you stupid girls love gay robots
the biggest plush toy you can find her
  duplo is always a safe bet with younger kids beyond that the basic baby/pram set goes down well with girls that age   have you asked her parents what she likes/has taken an interest in when they go out      pretty sexist tbqh
  girls like dolls and animals  how do you know she could grow up later and identify as nonbinary or possibly as mecha
  ill echo what some have already said either a big duplo playset maybe something like a farm with many figures or a giant plush toy
find out what her favorite animal is and get her a plush of it
  yeah or anytype of plush in general but make sure theres no buttons or any shit like that because they usually try to eat them
  yeah or anytype of plush in general but make sure theres no buttons or any shit like that because they usually try to eat them     like this ones on etsy fo 12 bucks shed probably love it
  my niece plays with my hulk figures whenever she visits so i got her a titans series hulk for xmas they come with no accessories so no choking
pic related is kind of neat theyre called sequin surprise its a large plush that comes inside a giant plastic egg so the surprise factor is there    the only downside is that they all include a smaller egg with a little figurine that you can stick on top of pencils if your niece is still at that age where she wants to suck off everything id advise against it my own little niece is turning 4 this weekend so this product in particular was on my mind
  other femanon here  please contribute to this thread and for ops cause man    post your links at /soc/ or something

  based now im hope to get my nephew one as well thats really great idea for gift      if she have older brother/s she would probably love it        if not the awesome mazinger z sofubi id say get playmobil 123 i got one for my nephew hes 1 year old3 and its his favorite toy i would particularly suggest girl with dino egg set i mean it has little girl relatable and cute dino baby and generally great play value
guys op here you wont believe it stunning development  the father of the child whom has been battling with the mental disorder known as transgenderism for the past few months has chosen to disown me from the family because of the raging unnatural swirl of hormones in his brain i got a scathing text from another member of his family so he must have told some lie    so thanks anyway guys but obviously the kids too young to remember me now i think ill finally get the fuck out of canada
  the age where she wants to suck off everything    whores start younger and younger it seems
uhhmega blocks
  this made me sad to read
  thats sad doesnt your sister have any say
a plush toy if you can find a plush cat with a tiara then you will win the game    there are at least half a dozen shops on ebay and etsy that will make you a plush like this to order for a somewhat reasonable price
  also you are not op you are miloanon the rightwing troll fuck who wont end his life    pedophilia is wrong doxxing pedophiles is right
  paw patrol slip n slide
  what a tweest
  do it faggot
give her some dick little girls love it and yours must be tiny so she def wont choke on it 
should i get medicom or mezcos alex delarge  inb4 watch a toy rewiew comparing the two  already did and i still cant decide
  pros of medicom  costume is sculpted  derby hat with mask can be put on any of the headsculpts  wellarticulated  cons of medicom  the price obviously  face print tech is hit or miss  joints are tight asf
pros of mezco  injured alex headsculpt  stand included   taller so will scale better with my collection   costs 20 dollars less  cons of mezco  cloth goods for the costume  limited articulation  mask is sculpted onto a specific head  codpiece is too high up
  that looks embarrassing would not pay 30 for that let alone 70
  codpiece s movable its a belt
  yikes
  articulation seems good to me
    can you pose him setting his cane down for me please and does nobody have the medicom one
  someone on fwoosh reviewed the mafex  
  also found someone who did a video comparison of both  
  not sure which one youll end up preferring but if price matters to you the medicom mafex is still available for approx for 67 on amiami shipping price not included though  
i bought the mafex one its a little tall next to mafex dk joker but looks great
was walking in the street decided it was a good idea to kick a piece of paper fucking piece of paper had a set of cards they fly all over while i have kinda like a shock i pick them up thinking it is either magic yogiho or pockemon fuck is this a ripoff link from zelda funny thing is i like them what are they from anybody knows
yogiho  pockemon  learn to spell first
  you have now been tasked to find all 50 of the cards youve unleashed upon the world only a few more to go
bootlegged nfc cards because some people cant get/dont want all of nintendos amiibos but wants all the content in the game they bought
  theyre really useful i made a homemade set using chips i bought off amazon

  what a world we live in
  honestly even owning the amiibo ive been tempted to getting a set like this they so much easier to use than big clunky toys especially since i dont really have much surface area near my couch to keep the toys on and i use my switch in handheld most of the time
  i have a switch and didnt know stuff like this even existed going to find a set to buy off ebay the zelda 22pc set on ebay is like 15 bucks its around 300400 for the amiibos on amazon because some of them are rare thanks anon
  this i have the full amiibo set and bought a deck last year for travel botw  amiibo on the go
i wanna get it to model making mostly star wars with some gundam later on what do i need to start
u need to believe in yourself
  money and time  youre gonna need it
just dive in with nail clippers and super glue screw around with cheap kits until you get a good feel for what youre doing later on when you want to get more serious invest in an airbrush and a good pair of side cutters
thieves have recently stolen an estimated 10000 dollarydoos worth of lego from the affectionately titled laygo store based in adelaide st marys suburb this is also in lieu of similar robberies such as from toysrgo in which 16000 of vintage lego was stolen     steve campbell owner of laygo said he was very very gutted at a robbery this close to christmas in particular expensive and larger sets were stolen which will particularly harm parents who had placed layby on such sets for the holidays     why is lego such a common target for robbery /toy/ i remember similar cases in europe a few months ago can our autism stop this from occurring in the future
    forgot link here are reports from 9news and abc       
  kek must be hard to trace
   because theyre expensive and you can make dough selling em piece by piece or you can sell em in sets or you can build your own sets
    selling them piece by piece would be the least conspicuous way of reselling the lego but my guess would be that reselling the products still in the box would be the most profitable thatd be my guess as to why they stole the larger sets as well as they tend to go for higher prices in mint condition
  selling them piece by piece would be the least conspicuous way of reselling the lego    fuck off no it wouldnt
    well thats a rather rude response     my thinking behind it being less conspicuous would be that you could break up a set into many different bunch of pieces and individually sell them or collections of the bricks to several different buyers     as it i said before that the money to be made is just in reselling the lego in the boxes which is what the owner of the robbed store said he thought would happen
  so you are saying selling them piece by piece would to traceable please enlighten me on how they would track that
  can our autism stop this from occurring in the future  fuck off nigger not your personal army
    yeah because of the unique/rare pieces you could look at the entire lot someone is selling and work out which sets it came from    for example this store had 16k of vintage sets gone id be on the look out for the rare pieces in those sets once i find someone selling those if theyre selling bulk lots of bricks aswell you can work out if theyre from full sets or not    what is this first day in /lg/
  stop this from occurring in the future    yeah by having a legitimate security system set in place or tarring the outside and covering the floor with pieces throughout
  why is lego such a common target for robbery /toy/  probably because it keeps its value over time you can easily wait a few years and sell the sets for about the same price sometimes drastically higher
  op is some baitfaggot that came in from reddit when that eceleb got robbed too even with the same can we as 4chan come together and help them bullshit
    i wasnt referring to the vintage sets         i guess i was kind of baiting with the last question but thats what gets clicks also im not a plebbitor and i dont know what eceleb youre referring to
  why is lego such a common target for robbery /toy/    because they hold good resale value and because theyre kids toys no one is going to chase down or put major work into getting it back      yeah armchair detectives could easily put the time into finding every little piece could sure but will the actual authorities theyll put more work into handing out speeding tickets or busting people on drug charges than trying to recover lost kids toys to be fair i dont know how austrailian police operate but i cant see it being too different around the world its just not a high priority
  adelaide lego store targeted by thieves twice on one night  two male suspects entered his toy store twice between 330am and 600am this morning  the men used two different cars and were in the store for about five minutes on each occasion  dose he not have an alarm system to alert himself and the police
  maybe lego should flood the market with more of their kits to tank the prices so they dont become easy targets for theft
  first time crash in to grab entire pile  security guard comes in time to see them screech away  calls cops  cops check it out  take report and leave  security guard goes for a nap  burglars come back to the scene of the crime just like they left it  grab another pile  store owner realizes how worthless alarms security and cops are   i constantly see those home security alarm guard cars late at night in my area just ambling along not even matching the speed of traffic probably hoping not to find anyone still mucking up the place
  ausfag here can attest that aussie cops are busier dealing with retarded drunks and giving out ridiculous fines for traffic violations
  do the cops there also spend an ungodly amount of time sorting out people getting their feelings hurt on social media
  op is some baitfaggot that came in from reddit when that guy whos wellknown in the lego general got robbed too even with the same can we as 4chan come together and help them bullshit  yes that guy who no one on 4chan had heard of because you had never heard of him
  no i dont think so
if any of you guys work in law enforcement or investigations youll be aware of a service called crimedex it allows local police and corporate investigators to send out an alert across law enforcement and other corporate investigators about crime     about once a month someone reports a theft of lego usually its just someone walking out of a walmart/target without paying anything in the middle of the day or they use counterfeit cards or bamboozled buying a 100 set for 20 or a return scheme     most of this gets sold on ebay a lot of these crooks are just straw buyers for the guy whos selling on ebay     you would be surprised at the sheer amount of shit that stolen by trash who just simply walk out of the store with a cart of shit or 10000 diamond
  they are touchy with nigger migrants as to be expected but if youre thinking of cuckrope memes not really
  i opened the image and my first thought was  that guy in the back is a fucking idiot hes not even covering his face    then i realised it was actually a giant minifig and felt kida stupid
  10000 aud  so like 3 sets
  16000  why are australians so illiterate dingos eat your schoolbooks
    theres no time for lessons in grammar when there are demands for a further fifth of the syllabus to be dedicated to whitewashed aboriginal studies
my wager is it was an inside job as in the crook had a key to get in and/or knew the code to shut off the security system loss from employee theft is bigger than losses from any other random faggots

it seems like the only nontoku reveals this year were snape vicious and jiren no real news on previous prototypes either
  jesus thats depressing  when can we expect some new reveals february i know bandai doesnt really often show up at wonfes so
  it cant end like this can it id like to have hope that theyre holding out for the 40th anniversary but i dont know
  more star wars  fuck
tsunade and orochimaru when
  if only
  i cant stand naruto but theres no way i could resist a big titty shf tsunade
  naruto is thankfully dead
  is that official fukn idiots they shouldve released part 1 design figures
the figuarts line is going toku only as of 2020
figuarts when
  american toku that is
    im glad boruto is raping the corpse after shippuden killed naruto but i still want an orochimaru
  ill even take a haf idc
  thank god
  of course now boa lost the pr license its up to boj to continue it with new pr figuarts so we can continue to shitpost about which is better between bandai and hasbro
    id like to have hope that theyre holding out for the 40th anniversary  i hope so but i doubt it  i am reading though kinnikuman now and the lack of sunshine is bumming me out more with every appearance he makes  i would have loved to have him for the stray devil chojin combo since we already have two ashuraman figures
hulk is back up no discount though  
is it worth getting tfa kylo ren
  sure if you want a figure of a whiny entitled cunt
  part 1 outfits for team 7 when
  i prefer the tfa to teh tlj one because of the cloak and stuff
snape    he is just the sort of figure i need with figuarts articulation and chinese face sculpting    what the hell are they thinking
  snape  this ones going into my chinese figurine collection
  buying sequel trilogy toys
  not buying sequel trilogy toys
  the only one i would consider is tfa unmasked kylo but he is overpriced being an exclusive and all so i just dont care  tlj kylos face is a downgrade in likeness and the pattern of the torso should have been sharper
  not not buying sequel trilogy toys
year of our lord two thousand and eighteen  still giving a shit about star wars
  the regular release is pretty cheap so yeah if you can get it for around 3035 bucks and have other figures in that scale to display it with go for it  the unmasked tfa version is way too overpriced and definitely not worth it also the head looks a bit oversized/weird on the body  if you want something more impressive for your money go for the hot toys kylo ren and you get a lightup lightsaber gimmick the tlj version even comes with an unmasked head in case you got a boner for driver
anyone know when ultraman zero beyond is out later this month
  theres technically a better thread for this he releases on the 22nd however
  oh hell yes
  what does haf mean
  that filename
  haf is hero action figure its a line doing lesser known toku heroes like fireman and redman their quality control is a little bit spotty to say the least
picked up ol lupin here     anyone else have a problem with his ankles reverting slowly mines cant stand for jackpoop   only got him propped up against the shelf here  starting to get poed lol
2 recent figuarts purchases 02 is actually not that bad bulmas great tho
  whats happening with his ankles theyre rotating back to its position they started from    if thats the case then it may be that the joint isnt actually moving and your bending the peg you might have to loosen the joint by heating it
  pretty lame that bandai released the oyaji accessory without oyaji
  cease
  nothing like that at all idk if its the socket for the ball or the ball itself the feet just wont stay in place/in poses i move it it just slowly moves back like it needs friction or something it pops in and out just fine
  oh if you tilt his feet down itll shear the peg right off those ankles are shit
  peg is fine its the ball/socket thats not staying in place when being posed is all
im not sure how to find out so i thought id ask here i apologize if this is a stupid question are they done with the sailor moon line the last i remember they were putting out the supers but i havent seen anything new in a while and it felt like we were getting new releases pretty consistently for a time i was hoping theyd do villains or the starlights
bounjour /toy/
  
  she is cute  which precure is she from
anyone get the new sora  i really want it looks gorgeous but i already have the first sora so not sure i want to bite the bullet
  shes not gay shes into incest      kirakira precure
  i love how the team looks all together but now im just antsy for the two pack to finish things off so i can finally complete that cake monstrosity
  i want that doge
  wish they included kirarin and pikario with ciel i will finish the kira2 eventually but i am kind of burned out this year after getting the card commune and the fw figure
i thought snape was john wick from the thumbnail
any hope for the figuarts tdk line continuing     have bat cat and joker but would really like a bane is my only hope mafex at this point in time
  nonexistent mouth  weirdly molded hair strands  cheap looking finish to the red plastic  god 02 looks cheap as shit
  shit figure for a shit show  perfect
i recently got my majin vegeta and its awesome   i wanted the ss vegeta 20 but i am happy with this one besides majin vegeta was a very badass and important moment for the character
i havent been here in over a year did i miss the general grievous release
  lol
  ha funny because i made it just in time for preorders right anon
  what the name of redhaired one
  jesus i promised myself id never watch anime again my gf convinced me to watch darling in the franxx with her why the goddamn is modern anime cringy as fuck i want to die everytime i watch that fucking show also that figma looks embarrassing does anything like kaiji even exist nowadays or is everything just waifushit and pedophilia
  figma
  this post is cringy as fuck
    i feel you but theres still a lot of great anime out there its just harder to get to it with the hufe amount of animu we are getting lately  btw i love kaiji
  watch banana fish its probably right up your alley
    i was thinking about that anime too but i didnt want to recommend something i didnt watch it is in my list though
  there was a new kaiji spinoff series like last season  anyway most modern anime is kinda shit but franxx is a special case in just how offensively awful it was and we get a standout or two every year
  that anime actually looks kind of good outside of the man love  at least recommend him something shitty like yuri on ice or something
  franxx was fine if a bit bumpy until episode 16 after which it went totally downhill this was also when trigger left  franxx main problem is that it had no idea what it wanted to be and nishigori is shit and has no idea how to write a good narrative didnt even properly plan out the second half of the show because he believed that it would flow naturally after the first half
  it was shit from start to finish
  whatever you say fag
  i finally managed to snag an unopened blossom and marine to go with my gogos im too poor for the newer ones
   get the last one i need a couple of months ago pine   still dont feel accomplished inside    damn
  daimidaler did it better
  cure chocolat
  mfw got scarlet over the summer but cant be bothered to bring the rest of the gopris out of my closet and pose them next to her    fuuuck shame i dont care much for nucures so i cant be bothered to get the kiras or any other team left to release
  very interesting
  franxx was fine if a bit bumpy until episode 16  i could not disagree with you harder if i tried  i was pissed off by the middle of the first episode even though i really tried to enjoy it
  alright
  i hate nucures too but i hope one of the spacecures is ufo themed like this but girlier
reminder to keep to street fighter line going we need laura menat and juri
  why yes i would take a menat
  vicious  why such a retarded pick anyone really wanted him over the rest of the crew now if it sells poorly well never get the others
where is the count doku preorders at
anyone know if the figuarts mark 7 head is the same as mark 6 or mark 4
  its a web exclusive the preorders started several weeks ago
  where at
    big fucking shf titties  fuck yes
  anywhere youd go to get web exclusives mykombini nipponyasan etc
  
  who thats not any of the original sf2 12
  an extraterrestrialthemed cure would be brilliant maybe a villainturnedhero later addition to the team
  hero action figure  that line made me doubt if i should go ahead with my ogon bat custom idea or wait for them  also lionmaru looks great sic when
        the only english says japan only how serious are they about that ive never ordered a web excluisive
  it means that theyll only ship to japan to get it you have to use a middleman site like nipponyasan ect wholl order it from them and then ship it to you
  shes basically one of the only things good about sf5
  memenat  no thanks
  any character i dont like is a meme
  thats how it works yes
  it sure seems that way
    thank you im all prepaid and ordered thank you anon together we will destroy the sith
  you might get a kick out of megalo box its unapologetically oldschool
i guess this is the right moment to announce a stan lee figuarts but maybe well have a tupac figure instead
  guys dead quick lets cash in
  yeah thats how it works how new are you
  remember when everyone cashed in on bowies death
  wait hes dead this is the worst fucking monday of my life
    fucking spoilers asshole
  alan rickman died too
  nice joke hans gruber cant die
    clearly to go with trenchcoat spike
  stan lee is pretty much a marvel character so hes a shoe in
roxas when
  id love die hard figuarts
  happened with kamen rider orga
  fuck yeah
ny has shf ep 3 anakin for 3k with ems it was only like 50 if anyone here is still interested and didnt pick it up a few months ago
  80s action movies have a load of toy potential  some highlander figures would be cool
  he can die its just really hard
  shame the only company that seems to go near those type of movies is neca maybe some hope from mafex with their robocop though
  its ny though
snape isnt geriatric in the books hes like 30    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee    why do they always make snape 80 years old
  how can he be 30 and in the same year as harrys parents
  harrys parents died when they were 21 so the guy you were responding to was only slightly off
i would legit pay hundreds for a good snape fig where he doesnt look ten trillion years old      harrys parents had him in their early 20s they look much older in the movies for some reason
  being a full grown incel thats still mad at chad potter for bullying you and ntring the girl of your dreams since childhood will do that to you
disney has the rights to gargoyles  rather than making something cool like gargoyles figuarts they keep shitting out more star wars
  more m8
  bandai a japanese company with a primarily and majority japanese target market is for some reason not making high end figures of an obscure american cartoon from twenty years ago  really makes you thinks
  was gargoyles obscure i remember it being pretty wellknown where i lived for at least the time it was airing
  i dont really know to be honest but it is almost certainly obscure in japan
    eating boogers was also wellknown to me when i was 5
  did you live in japan at that moment
  hes so tiny in this kart lmao
  cronus is stylish as fuck i love his gundam ass shoulder pads    but his skirt is a pair of restrictive clamshell pieces and i wish he had cloth goods instead
  i think someone like cjesm or whatever makes a cloth skirt replacement but i agree that cronus not having a real skirt is bullshit since ss wizard was announced at around the same time
  these actors scream visual shorthand for parents if they chose 20something year olds the audience would be like who are these young adults next to harry idk it just makes more sense to have them look like this in a visual medium
   d_tridoron made a fucking sick skirt and he included a tutorial for how he did it but i would rather buy one off him
like the looks of the darts better  figuarts works better as a figure and has more hands  can he be fixed
  i regret selling my exaid 3 pack i know the designs werent for everyone but i loved how over the top they are
  pls he cant be a cuck if hes a necrophile he totally bangs lilys corpse every night
gonna show off a scarlet witch figuart at tokyo comic con
  ill cum
  the designs could not have been more perfect for me
  yes
best hulk is finally here    
  so glad i got this pairs well with thanos
holy cow these are like day  night level of differences
how are injustice batman and superman i know they are a bit dated but for a good deal would they be worth it
  i like the superman its great the only dated thing is the face cant speak on the batman
    i have batman and hes great the only thing i can fault it for is the heavy plastic cape which makes it hard to pose otherwise no regrets    in fact id even say hes better than most modem shf releases generous amount of diecast lots of accessories and good paint
  better than most modem shf releases  not really hard when all the best modern shf releases seem to be toku ones
    just in case you havent killed yourself yet he still isnt released i wager he isnt that far away anymore when dooku/rots obiwan are april/february releases though the release of episode 9 might fuck the schedule maybe check in again in may 2019
  left one looks like a very bad bootleg
      perfect big guy great sculpt and choice of faces but best of all nonmovie specific so he can stand in as a default hulk on my shelf
  nonmovie specific  the box literally states avengers infinity war
  are you really that dumb to dont see the point  nonmovie  neutralgeneric hulk that will blend into any nonspecific marvel shelf
  i think he means the figure itself is indistinct enough from his other appearances to where he can be substituted for any version of the hulk not just as a part of the iw ensemble
  that anon is actually not wrong either
guys im getting nervous that we havent heard anything on spike
    can i help you buddy
  youre probably newish to /toy/ what hes trying to say is that youre probably not going to hear anything for quite awhile its not unusual to see a painted prototype from sh figuarts get dead air for 6 months and then get a release date for another 6 months later its probably fine youll just need to be patient
  spike was announced in what october thats nothing in this industry if you havent heard anything about him by this time next year then id start getting concerned but youre setting yourself up for disappointment if you think youll have the figure in your hands six months from now
if anything cowboy bebop showing up in the next srw game is a sign in the figuarts favor i would think
how do i put this leg back on it slid off while changing her pose and i cant get it to stay on
      yeah my bad i was being overly dramatic about it its one of my most anticipated releases so ill be antsy until we get the official release date
        oh you poor noobs bandai is infamous for tossing out prototype figures and never putting them into production unlike figma or mafex where seeing a new figure is pretty much a coming soon new figuarts at cons are just teasers to guage interest theyre only confirmed when news breaks of their release date or pricing
    i feel bad for lupin fans dbz usually gets the same treatment too
why the fuck is it called mario new package ver when the package and the contents are exactly the same as it used to be not a single thing fucking changed stupid fucking bandai    like seriously wtf is that just a retarded lie of a marketing technique absolutely fucking ridiculous its minor but its shit like this that pisses me off and makes me stop caring about brand loyalty    new package my fucking hairy asshole
  green shirt never ever    kill me
put the fuckin roxas out already ya bitches  sora getting his keys worries me abit though
  new package  the box     mong
  bandai has gotten very strict on what they show prototype wise now which has made their shows recently very boring however it also prevents you getting hyped for shit bandai has no real intention of releasing    this figure was shown at some western convention wasnt it pretty sure spike is going to get released because bandai is trying to appeal to the west super hard and cowboy bebop has like almost no popularity in japan they wouldnt even bother sculpting that shit if they didnt have plans for a western release
  what the fuck are you talking about how is someone this dumb did your mom drink while pregnant    obviously one would think the box but the box did not change which i explicitly stated when i typed in my post severa times by saying the package and the contents are exactly the same and not a single thing fucking changed    how many fucking times do i have to type the same elementary fucking statement for you to understand holy fucking shit this stupidity you just displayed really fucking pains me
  wow what an embarassing post the post you quoted already said the box didnt change    mong
  man i love this figure but that chest/ab cut is way too distracting for me his traps look a little strange too
  pics
  well this past weekend i was at anime nyc and at bluefin or whoevers display they showed mario labeled it new package ver and nothing had changed was selling the same old mario at the cash register    thinking of it now maybe there is a chance they were just showing the contents off still selling the old package and that the new package is still just a couple of days from release the timing was prime for me to be confused by all of this    i guess well see within the next few weeks either way it seemed like a lazy display choice to me by bluefin
    i guess i fucked up skipping this guy i never liked the non swivling biceps and i figured the hips and torso would be weak again but hes looking good
  its funny those photos make him look good yet all the promo material makes him look really fucking bad i would have ordered him if he looked as good as that in the promo material     less upset as im happy with my figma hulk and its not a giant enough leap for me to be that upset
nippon yasan has hulk for 6200 yen  shipping is so expensive its actually the same price as everywhere else  have to pay even more for packing materials
  thats where they get you anon you see their good prices but when you checkout their shipping is absurd
  some of the never evers were usually displayed in no photo allowed areas like the lupin figuarts  spike was pretty much the highlight of that comic con for bandai
  cringe
i got qui gon ginn for 166 dollarinos with ebay coupon today those dollars came from boxing up 75 of my marvel legends and ko transformers and selling them i then bought infinity war hulk with the remainder of my sales proceeds     im pretty fucking pleased with my efforts
  sh figuarts team 10 when
  using nippon yasan  ever  at best theyll rip you off on shipping at worst theyll take your money and run
      instant preorder
      april  okay i guess
  cant wait for them to never make anybody else after vicious tanks
        the only question is do i order 1 2 or 3
oh snap ultraman belial too
      the real folk blues version when
  dat cheap toy syndrome  ugh reminds of how they cheap out on shf majin vegeta
      and the pak was promptly thrown away
      what did they cheap out on thats bothering you
  but it looks better than the majin vegeta you should wait until the in hand photos in april before saying it looks like shit
  nobody saying its shit
surprised they took this long to release this repaint
  im not as surprised they seemed to have avoided any of the non main suits for quite a while now   would love a mark 8 even though the midas is more likely cause its just a mark 7 repaint
  are they actually releasing this the proto has been around for a while now along with a few of the other im3 background suits
  yep
  releasing this and not the mark i suit that has been teased since forever   okay
  i hope the mark 1 is as good as the revo that one is excellent
esb luke when
  after theyve run out of prequel shit to shit out
    scarlet witch loki and probably malfoy will be shown next week
  next year or two probably maybe timed for 2020 empires 40th anniversary
  no mention of new star wars figures    thats gonna please the grievousfags
  probably not until after the next batch of sequel shit that wont sell
  heres hoping for a not shitty scarlet witch jacket
      please make faye ed and jet
  so you want vicious and another spike variant got it
  id honestly be fine with just faye or just jet at this rate its a miracle were even getting one spike let alone two id be willing to drop a few hundred on a whole bebop crew
  april  nice maybe well get viscious by this time next year i wonder if theyll still put out that trenchcoat version
    you know what its going to look like
  30 for some bare pieces of hollow plastic  have to buy two sets to make a decently sized wall
  i hate how bandai seemed like they wanted to go big into display and effects parts then just quickly became lazy and awful at it
  why bother when the chinks are gonna rip you off
  because their stuff still sells anyway they may as well cancel their dbz line entirely then     pricing what they do make outrageously just guarantees a chinese bootleg would sell better
anyone here pick up the infinity war black panther barnes and noble has the set with the rocks for like 63 right now and im tempted but i havent really seen much discussion of it and the fact that it appears to use the old dropdown hips is disappointing
  hey this is the same brick wall that came with homecoming spiderman pretty much the exact same thing      i just picked up the ko it feels the same as i imagine the authentic one feels or at least comparible in weight and plastic quality it depends on how much you like the character id say 63 for barebonesand i mean barebones release is a bit much the mafex is coming out and while i think its definitely a different style it has a fuck load more accessories than the shf though i will say the shf is a thicc mvcistyle boi while the mafex looks more proportioned to chadwick bosemans bodytype so it depends on what style panther you want
  wait they bootlegged the infinity war version already that was fast but in that case ill probably just spring for that since there arent a lot of details or accessories to fuck up
  i think only the cw version has bootlegs so far the iw version isnt bad but compared to the better iw releases like black widow and hulk its just mediocre id say 60 is overpriced but it probably wont drop much lower than that because of the magnetic rocks it comes with
has anyone here gotten figuarts static statues im thinking about preordering this from somewhere  
  bandais static figures are usually shit aside from that one fw precure figure  their sisters megahouse/alpha and omega are usually better
  i have some of the one piece ones they are pretty good      statues that cost twice as much are better    you dont say
  the only issue i have with megahouse is avoiding bootlegs from resellers it seems easier at least to find official figures for bandai
  i know the japanese love harry potter but is snape really that popular over there to get a release right after the 3 main characters not that i mind though since a 1/12 scale alan rickman is always welcome
  give me a gruber and metatron rickman plz bandai
  i already have kylo ren but thanks anyway bandai
how are the macross delta shfs i really like mikumos design
is expedited shipping worth the extra money i hear wildly conflicting things about it
  hmm what does her butt tech look like
  are you desperate
  from where japan    i always do ems or dhl sal can take soooooooo long last time i ordered something sal/rsal it shipped in may and i got it in mid july
  ems is paying extra for speed consistency and care    your shit gets to you fast it gets to you fast regularly and it gets to you without being beat to shit no long awkward waits for your package to shuffle out of its origin country no long waits at sorting centers along the way just wham bam thank you maam
bought this guy using one of ebays coupons what am i in for
  the usual
  do your own research before buying a figure
  its probably one of my least favorite suits and one of my least favorite figuarts im figures    the figure itself is finnicky and i just dont really like the look of the suit but im building the whole hoa so i needed it for completion luckily i got it off amazon for like 70 and it comes with its own hoa part so i guess that wasnt so bad
  i like the revoltech more the 5 is one of my least favorite figs
has rocket racoon been released wide spread yet havent seen anything come in on ae but looks like ny has him in stock
heads up for the next event  tokyo comic con november 30th  december 2nd  stuffs from marvel star wars  harry potter will be shown maybe some db stuffs too
  could someone translate what theyre saying about this spike release also whats up with the tamashii express thingy
  palpatine release date please
  dont get my hopes up
  but when will the preorders go up
  if only bandai put their preorders up around the same time every month so wed know that
  help a newfag out
  ok heres my advice lurk moar you fucking newfag
  my i certainly dont remember snapes pants being so aggressively bootcut
  hes got to have some anime flair somewhere
    im surprised theres so much dislike for the mk5 i agree that the movie was shit but the design itself is unique and easily my second favourite suit behind the mk3
whens arino from cx dropping next month hoping to pick one up for cheap on mandy
any ebay coupons today
  nah they probably would have been announced already theyll probably do one in december a few weeks before christmas
  i bought mine a few months ago and it had terrible qc hopefully yours fairs better
  the coolest thing about the suit was that he carried it around in a brief case
  it was unique especially since the mks 3 4 6 and 7 all looked kinda similar but the design kind of made it look like half a suit i honestly cant explain what it is it just didnt work for me i think part of it is the fact that it has so much silver but i dont know since i liked other suits with a lot of silver like the mk 47        mine had more dings and chips in the paint than any other im figure i have too so
  i love the mkv as a suit but the shf looks like garbage arms are too skinny head too big and the whole thing looks awkward and gawky
whats the likelyhood of us getting those tupac figuresi really want to recreate scenes from the hit em up vid along with my dbz figs
  extremely unlikely
  other 3 walkure girls when bandai its been over a year you bastards deltas still popular theres a second movie confirmed
  literally being considered so extremely unlikely i dont think so
  some little form they sent out to just see if people are interested doesnt mean its likely its just going to help inform them where they should bother trying to chase licenses
  would really love a reina she activates my fap engines like no other
  theyve even teased the prototypes so a verison of her exists somewhere i dont usually care about idolshit but a its macross and b these designs are pretty fuckin nice hell all of walkures outfits were great actually
is spike going up this week
  dings and chips  did all those youtube reviewers get lucky with theirs or something they looked fine in the vids now im worried      head too big  if anything the im heads are too small chalk it up bandais anime proportions but they all look more like robots than suits
  calm down bogue
  hang on let me hop in my delorean and go check
  holding out hope that wanda will be good
  i dont know why they even gave him pants pants are gay
  they better not skimp on the tits and ass tech
  while youre there can you get me a copy of the sports almanac
  im hoping theres a vision to go with her theyre the last two i really feel are missing from my iw display that cant be substituted in with mls
i wish there was a harry potter anime so theyd release figures that look less like real people      oh shit are those different faces i see
    spike goes up on the 3rd now quit fucking asking
  nobody asked in the first place fucko
  the real folk blues version when
  when does spike go up on preorder
  fucko  back to tumblr you go
  make me faggot
    theres one today for toys only but it is only 10 off
so is spike a webshop exclusive or are they actually going to release a figure like a normal company for once
  yes
  no
  maybe
  i dont know
  can you repeat the question
  which robocop movie is this from
  fuck yes  inb4 exclusive
    those actually look pretty good especially the face maybe its just not close enough but maybe they finally stopped trying to shade the entire face with printing
  jesus i hope the movie is good shes qt
  theyre jumping on cap marv real fast as far as i can remember pretty much all the marvel shf have been revealed after the movies the face sculpts also looking pretty good
heartbreaker  oh no my wallet
i zoomed in a ton on the tamashii nations instagram story and spotted a new bucky maybe new thor and loki
  i say right as pics drop
  avengers 1 hulk
teenage groot all the way on the right
this is why i stopped collecting mcu theres just too much shit
  ayy finally dont care much for mcu shit outside of iron man but scarlet witch a cute her outfit is great
  hes too tall
  holy fuck good thing i still havent paid my po invoice i received days ago for the recent released hulk im so canceling my order and wait on this
  1st avengers hulk looks even better than infinity wars love the classic ripped pants and how much more naturally the knees turn out to be are some of these their backlog unreleased figures they had for years
after shown once 3 fucking years ago they are finally showing grievous again still no date though but better than nothing at least we know its still alive
  i just want all those fucking clones in the background
  post the harry potter shit
  its shit nobody fucking cares hence thats why nobody bother posting it
more pics incoming from event  main hub   bandai stuffs 
sup guys missy me
  jesus why
  youre a shit
  carols a standard release and is going up on the 3rd
  those marvel legends fire effects  fancy meeting you here
  i think ill need this one
heres your hairy pooter faggot
  this is pretty much all stuff thats never been seen before
  finally episode v luke  but not best luke bespin version  fucking why
  dracos hair is the color of a dehydrated persons piss instead of silvery blond    im triggered
  i bet that robe will prevent him from sitting
  hence unreleased they probably had all these in their underground storage for years before finally decided to show them all today i guess they were restraining these back in those days to avoid flooding the competition from figma  others now that the coast is clear
  wow youre a fucking moron
  so are you
  lol that hulk sculpt is literally the same as infinity wars version they just retooled the head  legs still ripped pants is better than tight yoga pants
  nah im not retarded enough to think obviously new sculpts have been sitting in storage
    instabuy      looks good overall but why is she blonde i know her hair was lighter in cw than in aou but not that much      i want to give bandai the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it looks better with the glasses off because this is rough hopefully theres an alt head
  dang i like his ragnarok look much better i prefer its horns
  no flippy pauldrons  actual paint detail  improved head  if this comes out nice with an unmasked head ill sell my civil war cap for it
  this is all ive ever wanted i am really afraid it wont come with all the head options i want though cause it feels like im asking for too much i want facemask with goggles on facemask with goggles off unmasked with greasepainted eyes and normal seen here i think this is too much to hope for
  fuckkkk vision when
  what the heck is up with that chest piece
  its accurate she is flat as a board  
  now i want mib figuarts      display only  you cant really go by what they display bespin luke could very well release before this
oh boy
  here we go
  
i was waiting for the tamashii comicon to have thw confirmation jl aquaman and cyborg never ever right fuck
  dc shit  and nothing of value was lost
im pretty surprised captain marvel and gogeta already have release dates but im not complaining
  they showed cyborg at least
        does anyone else think this looks weirdly bad im trying to stay optimistic because ive been hoping for this for years but god something just looks off about it to me
  not just being thankful we have a spike figure thats not a fucking pak  you autists are never happy
  wait where      forget those give me mera
  he has a cape now so thats preogress
  i think it looks fine but youre right that it looks weird it reminds me a bit of a really well done play doh model is it still a prototype thats hand painted it has a texture to it      geez whats wrong with you its like saying   you should be happy its cow shit instead of goose shit  not that i have any problem with the figure aside from the texture but thats a really stupid way to defend a figure
  no
someone make a new thread
  i think it looks like a downscaled version of the pak the extra expressions and notyellow skin tone helps it out though
  no
  i think it looks like a downscaled version of the pak
  i think it looks great im not even a huge bebop fan but i might get it so my lupin has another lanky bro to hang out with
  pak
    more like play arts why amirite
  fuck i wish theyd move on from sorcerers stone  id say they should fast forward to prisioner of azkaban and give us a sirius black and a gambon dumbledore   then they could move to goblet of fire and release voldemort and mid teen harry in his triwizard tournament outfit
  i was literally yesterday watching the star wars episode of the toys that made us on netflix and when they joked about jar jar my friend said he would actually be a cool figure and i thought of him as a figuartsthats hilarious this was released at like the same moment
  only thing bothering me is that weird running stance but thats just bad posing
  need droids
new thread      
fag
  best girl finally gets a figuarts  this better not some bullshit exclusive
  looks great  know subjectanon will shit on it with muh dot matrix and headsize memes  everyone else will shower him with yous
  looks cool dont care about marvel but still cool
  more interested in nebula in the back their to be honest
  agreed
  oh nononononono  look at the top of her head
mcu toys  kek
  she was blonde and why did she loose her accent
  best girl finally gets a figuarts  i know its great right
  that is not sfw 4channel material
  who the fuck even likes captain marvel
  tumblrfags and waifufags with shit taste  other than that nobody really
  absolutely nobody judging from her comic sales
  i do think this is a cool costume even if she is the worst marvel character
  get that shit tier waifu out of here
  did they not have the actress likeness rights
  where are her tits
ghost or bust
  give me my blue cyborg waifu now
  no smile no buy
 no mantis
  people have liked her long before either of those things existed
  i was specifically talking about her after she took up the captain marvel mantle  i am sure some people cared about carol prepush  i have never actually met one in person but i am sure they exist
  it actually looks more like mary kate/ashley than elizabeth
  i dont know looks enough like her to me i think part of it looking a little off is the hair sitting too high
  i wont disagree with this comment
  newfag question these types of realistic figuarts have a second face right
  christ who let the gimp out
  no ass no thanks
  disgusting
id rather have ebony maw

as the person who has made all but one prior op ive always kept the information to hard facts and if other people are going to make them they should stick to that and not hearsay     while the aforementioned legacy figures are likely cancelled there is no confirmation one way or the other and those figures should remain an unknown until a credible source provides such info or bandais time runs out prn has proven to not be a credible source from having posted a lot of false information in the past and even they only mentioned psycho pink and yellow being cancelled
  its been confirmed the psycho girls are cancelled theres no way were seeing anything that was supposed to come after them those are the facts dont get so butt flustered when someone makes a new thread when the old one is 40 posts past the bump limit     tldr old op was lazy and slow at making a new thread and is now upset someone else did his only job
in space silver and psycho pink/yellow are coming    ns crimson/navy nstl red/blue/yellow/white/pink are the ones not officially announced and canceled
  whats your source
  my dad works at bandai    5in rita is coming too
  bandai just wants to cause panic and be praised in the end
  also if like his reviews more if they didnt have so much fluff feels like he often drifts off to completely different subjects and loses you before his plugs at the end    i think he has undiagnosed adhd not autism like the retroblasting guy but a lot of the time his videos feel like not like shitty channel awesome skits but those youtube toy review skits you see with a million views all the time   main difference is those normally have kids doing them while maybe his wife is barren i dunno theyre like 40 maybe hed be better off doing a pixeldan style thing since they seem somewhat similar but he also probably just likes doing the random skits
  honestly hes different enough for me to stand watching him im fucking sick of reviewers like shart and anthonyscustoms d amazing and bruno are pretty much the only ones i watch anymore and bruno might not be a great reviewer but its engaging and different idk      i know psycho yellow and pink are all but canceled but ill be really surprised to see dino thunder yellow psycho black and in space silver frankly i was surprised we got psychos at all
  hassan ahmed hes the real dude and shukuen shinobi
  remember when they lied to his face about the color gold they were gonna use and then he kept making lowkey pissed off remarks about it for awhile after the gold ranger was released
  i doubt well get is silver dt yellow and psycho black have release dates though i expect them to be the last of the line at least ill finish my dt team still a little mad i wont have a full is team though
are the miniplas not getting reruns either because of licensing
  its been confirmed  did you miss the part where i said prn has tried to pass off bullshit as fact numerous times in the past and are not a credible source im not saying it isnt highly likely that theyre cancelled but its far from confirmed    ps  theres no reason to make a new general when the old one is nowhere near dropping off the board it unnecessarily clutters things if you havent noticed i generally let them drop to page 8 or 9 before making a new one i dont care if someone else makes the op but do it right not with unverified information
  no one cares bruh
  delete the fucking thread already
are they ever going to do a completely black and green soc dragonzord to go along with the megazord
  never saw one but two years ago we got the black and gold
  i mean i want to buy the black edition soc megazord since its on sale right now but the dragonzord having so much more silver looks a bit weird when combined
    work your way through it youre almost at stage four
  says the one posting likely false information in the op which will lead to problems throughout the thread as long as it exists
finally got this in the mail now im waiting for engine daishogun as well  i really like the look of the figure and now i wish they did the other two mech in different color schemes
  whine more
  its pretty funny to see how salty you are over this
  i cant wait to see half the thread pissed off at you for posting false information without taking the time to verify anything
  imagine being this salty about not being able to make a thread is making the new thread the most important thing in your life
i see the shitposting is still alive and well here
  didnt even know this existed     also lol  my 10 minute photoshop job being the topic header image
watching wild force its so shit
space silver is the only unannounced figure that has a tiny chance of releasing and im 90 sure he wont because some bandai employee got cucked by justin nimmo way back in 1998 which is why hes always been left out of toy releases      do miniplas ever get reprints i would imagine if it ever does itll be another web only release
 bandai refusing to finish a team of popular villains with only 2 of them left to go     some things never change
as glad as i am that gobusters is finally getting adapted i really want some kyuranger figures i havent even seen the show but those suits are sex and now well be waiting a long time for them this probably isnt the right place but how was the kyuranger toyline the mechs and transformation device im probably going to collect the transformation device and collectibles since its so cheap and i love space shit the mechs seem weird but theyre cheap too so i may get them if they arent too bad
1 point for bandai of america they did not lie or were deceptive about dino thunder white at sdcc17
  is making the new thread the most important thing in your life  obviously
  about two or three years ago i watched every single episode of power rangers from mmpr to time force   i stopped about 5 episodes into wild force i found it so uninteresting  i thought that as a kid as well for some reason
  nobody accused them of lying people are just pissed they chose to stall on releases for over a year and subsequently put no time into finishing the psychos    its one thing for retailers to be backlogged by shelfwarmers its another when you announce a full 4 figure wave in january release only 3 of them overseas in april wait until october to release them in the us and then quietly reveal the missing figure from that wave plus the last girl of an incomplete team are coming in february of next year right before the license expires 5 figures releases over an entire calender year is unacceptable    not to mention cutting back on female figures was an intentional money saving move that cost us an entire team in the long run nobody complains about the smaller ninja steel figures because they at least had their girls released last year and dt yellow probably only happened because the physical prototype actually existed and would be a huge waste to cancel
looks like hasbros lightning collection will be the first pr line worth collecting since rpm everything since 2010 has been such a headache
  rpm  those train rangers  amazing line only thing that would have made it better would have been orange and navy rangers and paleomax being more available
   shattered grid made deathryuger and fivemen suits canon   didnt adapt the dino train rangers   missed opportunity man
what the hell gamestop pushed back release date of preorders for legacy items till dec 7
  right now we are getting the summer release which is missing silver and pink    there is still that final wave all they need to do is add silver and pink to it with 4 figures per case now its not impossible
  this last case was only three figures no psycho red blue and dino white assuming that well see dino yellow psycho black and space silver thats the end theyve scrapped their sdcc 2017 wave format almost entirely
  id be so happy if they did is silver but the fact that he hasnt been announced or listed with dt yellow or psycho black has me doubtful well get him
  does anyone like white dino he looks like trash to me i wanted the figure but when i saw it hard pass
  youre right 3 new figures i meant as in before this it was 6 figures per case now its only 4 currently 2 white 1 red 1 blue     dt yellow was made along time ago and was just backlogged the same way zeo pink and yellow were dt yellow will come in the black box    im still counting on psycho black being a case assortment with the current wave how zeo red was randomly swapped in the wave/case with zeo green blue    that leaves in space silver psycho yellow and psycho pink if black isnt a case assortment then it can still fit in the final wave
legacy titanus
  i like it the only thing that bothers me is that hes missing paint
  legacy tit anus
    does hasbro have the license to make any of the bbbs i remember some of the suits popping up in forever red as villains
  they got the brands to stuff like my pet monster and other small things the official release is on investorhasbro com  but i dunno if they picked up licenses for bbb vrt or kotnn if they did theyre either small time enough to not mention now or hasbro didnt get them at all hard to find explicit details on them since its a dead franchise and therefore not relevant to anyone outside of fans unfortunately
    fuck everything i just said wikipedia has hasbro listed as their official distributor  and since they have the rights to power rangers they could still just release general venjix and call it a day
  lets not forget the negro stepchild of the franchise vr troopers
    unoe saban couldve adapted gobusters as vrt vs bbb
  yup i hope they can make a subline of ameritoku under the pr license so we can finally get some decent vr troopers beetleborgs and mystic knights toys    although i think the latter has some licensing issue its big enough to prevent it from getting a dvd release
  with the recent collective trauma from boas costcutting horrors id hate to be the one to give saban any more ideas to jew the franchise but the vr trooper helmets are just red ranger helmet retools
  but the vr trooper helmets are just red ranger helmet retools    those specific suits were anyway though im sure if someone thought theyd sell they wouldve shat those out in a heartbeat
  top secret     drakkon  titanium ranger     please
  they already made a drakkon and those top secret figures definitely arent coming out now they were rumored to be either the last three ninja storm figures or three ninja steel figures but legacy line got cancelled
  stop spreading unverified information youre going to piss off half the thread like old op said
  the last three ninja storm figures  green was never slated for a release which is funny considering we got green in super legends and super megaforce and everyone but green in figuarts and planned for legacy they just dont seem to want to make all six ninja storm rangers in the same line though at least the super legends fits in well with the figuarts
  you can actually see the stuntmans face in the white one
  who hurt u
      fyi youre replying to a different persons im the prior op and i ultimately dont care who makes the generals it saves me time if anything if someone else wants to do it i also have never liked the legacy figures and hasbro made them obsolete with one reveal so i couldnt care less whether the figures in question are released or not     i just dont want unsubstantiated information passed off as fact after a year and a half of going out of my way to verify sources and keep the op of these generals as factually accurate as possible really quite reasonable
people always complain about legacy but now that ninja steel is officially over can we talk about how badly boa shit the bed on that line     they only released two of the three auxiliaries and you were forced to buy a repainted megazord to get them   they released an oversized overpriced lion fire zord playset which toys r us was swimming in and literally couldnt give away   the ninja spin gimmick of the show was completely absent from the toyline   they never finished the set of training mode figures in spite of being simple repaints of one another   they never finished the set of super steel mode figures because ew girls   they never made a figure of golds superstar mode or yellows lion fire mode   they only released one figure to cash in on the anniversary special and they pigeonholed it with a ranger specific sculpt when a generic torso would have allowed them to make 5 different figures while only needing new heads   the aforementioned anniversary figure is needlessly out of scale with the other ninja steel figures  the fall 2018 wave of products was limited to that one 5 figure a couple of toy exclusive deluxe figures which were essentially elaborate accessories on a preposed ranger a few toy exclusive zords some generic toy exclusive throwing stars and a role play weapon    i can get them giving up on legacy stuff when losing the line but shouldnt ninja steel have been business as usual considering it ended long before hasbro takes over theyve essentially had a toy commercial running these last few months with no product to sell even the preexisting stuff is nonexistent in stores
  once again whine more
    best black variant is still black ultimate daibouken
  i had the black variant when i was 15 and lost it in a move i was so fucking frustrated for months it vanished and i dont know how
im trying to figure out if stretching out a single seasons worth of footage over two years is a better sales strategy than just cramming it all in a single year and then moving on to a new theme to shill more toys sentai is like a well oiled machine doing this for years and coming out with passable products i dont understand nickelodeons strategy cause nothing good has come out from this eraare there some figures to look at and compare
  because nick does different contracts for live action compared to cartoons
  you could look at bandai namcos yearly fiscal reports but those sometimes group power rangers and sentai together making it impossible to determine whats what    ultimately i think it depends on the sentai dino charge worked well in a two year format given the number of rangers and zords ninja steel feels sparse in comparison and could have easily been done in one year though i also think keeping a sentai around for a couple of years is good for brand retention/recognition versus the yearly shuffle in which all your toys are obsolete within a year
  its amazing they shit the bed that badly considering how relatively well they had handled dino charge and super dino charge with lots of villain figures every ranger and every mode released and lots of aux zords considering what they had been doing before that since getting the show back its just sad how bad they handled things
  its mostly because nick has a really dumb policy about how many episodes of a show theyll allow to premiere in a year    honestly i figure that once this current contract with nick runs out hasbro will probably take power rangers to somewhere else likely netflix
honestly this is all a thing of boa getting fucked hard   first the theme ninininger was garbage besides the suit design   i bet boa was frustrated or genuinely confused when they were presented the ninnin toy line plex needs to stop the hybrid vehicleanimal form because they half ass it and it confuses kids the theme with the way it was done was not marketable in the west   second coming off dinos into the one of the most boring and by the numbers sentai adaption ever didnt help that ninnins source footage is garbage too   im not defending boa but they got dealt some shit cards because the nips sometimes forget that the show has to be marketable to other audiences and go buck wild with jap culture in the show     beast morphers will work because the hybrid designs make sense as triple changers not just a train with a dog in it     boa shit the bed tho was lazy probably hated ninja steel    boa had it pretty good for awhile   theme and cohesion wise  samurai works even with the clusterfuck zord combos    mega/super mega  made up for the weird card angel thing by having pirates who copy past rangers and having vehicle zords easy    dinos all i have to say plus a fuckton of rangers
  when hasbro
  hence why he said rumored
  super megaforce was also quite good the figure line while it was light on villains had no cockpit mode bullshit just one of each ranger and a ton of legendary reds/sixths the megazord caught flack for cost cutting but they did some really cool things with the others zeo racer was a neat original as was the mega winger mode of the ninja zord also love how they managed to give the turbo falcon a megazord mode their biggest fuck up that year was the way they handled the keys though they eventually made good on full teams
  according to tokuchris the reason the ninja spin gimmick was never i the actual toys was due to a patent owned by beyblades parent company they also tried going for a nerf style gimmick but that was quickly shot down too so they were stuck with just soft shrunken that do nothing      ninninger was partially chosen by bandai america because ninjas were a safer theme than trains greg mentioned the higher ups only saw the suits and thought they had a slam dunk but didnt take into account the zords fleet for that year was a complete shitfest
  actually not all rumors it was supposed to be legacy ninja steel figures for the secret spots    they were never officially announced therefore not coming
just got the metallic samurai figuarts already chipping this is why we dont use this type of paint
  the zords could have worked its just bandai handled the like shit there was no reason to release the replacements for red alongside a stupid recolor of the rest of the megazord what they should have done is released them seperatly like the did all the auxiliary zords for dino charge and do a few original ones to fill it out it doesnt help that their version of shurikenjin was utter garbage out of the gate at least for dino charge it was mostly paint missing visually honestly what could have worked out for them to fill out the megazord line is releasing 2 packs of upscaled 5inch figures of the monsters ive never understood that about power rangers toylines even since i was a kid you have this cool robot guy but whats even the point if he doesnt have anyone to beat up
hey guys just reignighted my love for the old megazords working at a toy shop in the mall i was wondering if theres a good place to buy older megazords or did they remake older ones ive seen the legacy versions for the dinozords and dragonzord but i was wondering if they made stuff for timeforce or lightspeed rescue any help is appreciated
  nope nothing for anything after mmp s3   for later megazords being remade in japan they have the super minipla line which is plastic models that are smaller than there original toy but highly articulated and show accurate and do their combinations they had so far for those their is    mmpr megazord  dragonzord  titanus    season 3  shogun megazord  ninja megazord  falconzord    space  astro megazord  delta megazord    also any current sentai i want to say after boukenger have a normal minipla line if you like any current zords    time force and light speed dont have anything at the moment other than the original toys which you could either use ebay or japanese auction sites like yahoo japan or mandarake or check your local comic/collectibles store
  thanks dude just bought a busted up time shadow for 10 bucks on ebay gonna see if i can repaint it to make it look nice i got the legacy saba at the local vintage stock i work at for 25 bucks and i think ill end up picking up any megazords and such whenever they come in i think this is going to be a hobby i enjoy
  no problem id just stick with the megazords you like the newer designs are hit or miss and you either like some of the quirks or completely hate it
  sounds good was wondering if any of the new shows are any good or just boring nickelodeon tier i saw the ninja storm or whatever series took zords from other series and it looked pretty dumb could just be a change of the times
  dino charge was good for nickelodeon   disneys last hurrah rpm was good  jungle fury was fine  if youve never seen spd its good  dino thunder is a damn good disney series
  i think i actually stopped at mystic force that was the one before rpm right
  close but after mystic is operation overdrive very mediocre series but the sentai equivalent is fantastic then jungle fury or geki ranger and then rpm/go onger which was disneys last series
  gotcha wait does japan have different versions of the shows or is super sentai just a different series thats similar
  power rangers uses the suits and some footage how much varies by season from sentai but the actors and sometimes the plot are different
  im thinking well see him in lightning soon because hes in the comic team right now
  the local vintage stock i work at    which one is that theres not a whole lot of those and most are in the same region
so the white legacy titanus is never coming back right things 500 minimum these days

considering they arent exclusive they should be easy to get up until about the last month or so before release right
  rright
  dont act like black wasnt easy as fuck to get for anyone who actually cared
  what the fuck are you talking about  black wasnt a general release
  maybe and thats only if you are american    everyone else is fucked if they dont get in on it tonight
  what time we droppin boys 12 or 3
  okay even easier in this case
changing faces of ssj characters  keep getting stabbed by their hair    my finger is bleeding 
  my condolences for your tissue paperlike skin
i want way more kamikaze ghosts but i dont want to buy nine gotenkses    or do i
  all figures are easy to get if youre willing to pay latecomers tax
when do these come up 3 est
  in 2 hours
the discount price for broly and gogeta is fucking insane on hobbysearch  close to 2000yen off
is it just overseas websites that are having the figures go up for pre order
how much does a broly weigh
  should i get them in the same order or would it be smarter to have gogeta and broly ship separately
  black was hard to get for retards who think just because you preorder something on bbts or amazon you actually have spot reserved i got mine on eknightmedia and he got to me a week after his release
  they recover it with the shipping
someone give me a quick rundown on the gogeta toy
  look at it yourself retard
  it looks like a big step down from gotenks who is the best fusion figure
  not really shipping is on par with amiami sometimes better
  i can see it but i dont have any sh figures what do i need to know i keep seeing people throw 20 around
  20 means basically any figure including and follow awakening goky more articulation and posability
    links on amiami for anyone interested looks like theyll be up for preorder there in 40 minutes
any idea when the new figures will be up on hlj amiami seems to have a pretty regular schedule but i cant ever figure it out for hlj
  oh alright makes sense     well i hope i dont steal someones pre order
fuck i might just have to preorder both both look like great figures and like the characters still dont know why they recolored gogeta in the movie though
  im not completely sold on the new broly but the new hair looks cool plus i dont own any of the old ones so i have some incentive there
  i think it was to make the outfit consistent with the coloring in gotenks design
  seems to me they took the opportunity to sync with gotenks colors since fusion reborn and gt arent canon
  so they can milk the mold for another pc version of course
you bitches ready
  lmao they adjusted the prices its more now
  ready and waiting
tminus 5 minutes fuckers
strap yourselves in folks this is gonna be rough
  have faith
you guys are fucking queers
  anyone
what are the chances this is still gonna break
  this
  98
  seems about right  its already getting pretty laggy
crashed
yep broken  i love this part about preordering
the new pages are broke and dont work with the cart system lol
hobbysearch sold out in 20 seconds
got my order in at amiami wasnt too hard
  congratulations still waiting to log in
i have everything in my cart at amiami but it gives me a login failed error when i try to checkout every time i logged in ahead of time too
  logging in is taking a while
    keeps logging me out fuck
  how page doesnt work
  same
  when i log in it logs me out at the cart again and makes me try again
heh
add special pages to prevent site crashing  site crashes worse than before    bravo
just wait for hlj dumb faggots
they wouldnt sell out they said  its not an exclusive release so it wont be goku black 20 they said
why do gaijin faggots even bother anymore
shes dead jim
  got the same here
  bandais fault for doing this shit all at once
    go fast
i got to the checkout but it had 3 of each in my cart and i couldnt change it without going back fml
hljs broly    
  got that too but then it said my purchase has been processed
  i get that when just trying to access my cart
  and gogeta wasnt working just before i posted haha    
  based thanks anon
oh fuck you amiami  it loaded to the checkout page for a moment then crashed
  7800 yen  get the fuck out of here im not paying that ill buy it domestic
took a while but amiami worked
go through checkout login  takes 3 minutes  sorry we could not find your cart information please go back and try again    ugh
got em
    whats with these prices only hobby search had a decent discount both amiami and hlj are overcharging youd pay more importing these fucking things
    anon you beautiful mother fucker you a real mvp dude there are still good people in this world
    thank you
500 is my least favorite number right now
so i ordered on hlj but had to use a invalid credit card because i had no time to pull out the new one and type that shit in    i can change the payment method before they try to bill me right
    both 404 for me
  yes youre fine
took me 18 straight minutes but i got 2 broly and 2 gogetas
    thank you for the links you the real mvp
1 gogeta for me thinking about getting that coolass blue mecha too     ill wait on the brolly altcolor issues
gogeta has sold out fuck me
finally manage to check out including to payment info and rip
      neither of these has been anything but 404 for me since you posted them
    it just went down in price
  scalper garbage begone
mfw ill just preorder them from bbts/amazon later  mfw i wont have to worry about exorbitant shipping just to make sure my shit actually gets here  mfw i can cancel my order any time    i guess i may end up paying more but goddamn is the rat race just not worth it if youre an american
  how are you using these links i just get a woops our bad on the site
some hlj fuckery going on right now    prepare your anuses for cancellations
  yep same here absolute bullshit ive never had problems with amiami like this
  order completed  thank you anon
  yeah its nice getting them a bit early but ill have like 50 more opportunities to grab these at retail
broly and gogeta are sold out now fuck me i stayed up for nothing
  ive been doing bandai nights on amiami for like 8 years and this is the worst set of varied errors ive ever seen
  well just gonna have to hope that it comes back up for a little while like super buu did
  never
afew left    
i made it to the last page before gogeta sold out fuck looks like im getting these faggots on bbts this shit sucks
lag like shit and end up getting nothing
stayed up late just for it to crash and then miss my window fuck this gay earth at least i have super buu
wew after 20 mins of trying
  also got it from here how is this site cdjapan never ordered from them before
  pic related  night anons
looks like i got gogeta from amiami and broly from cd japan thanks you anons for your help tonight
not even trying to buy dbz stuff  dbz stuff sold out  site is still turbo broken    amiami needs to do something to get their shit in order it keeps getting worse
  dependable they kinda suck at messaging you back in english but they have solid policies and allow cancellations without banning you
  grab one for 50 bucks  someone mentions broly went down in price  check gogeta  43 bucks now  grab him again  cancel 50 buck one  all while lagging and taking a few minutes to update  that was more tense than i would have liked
  ive only ever bought already released books and games from them before and they were generally fine from my experience no clue how well preorders are handled especially for figures might still try bbts if this doesnt pan out
  well i hope it works for you chances are itll tell you its out of stock
  do not use paypal or theyll charge you upfront
  post gogeta link
    same feel fuck this shit hopefully bbts will have my back    i actually grabbed super buu when he came back up but that shit was pure luck theres never any warning i guess ill have to keep my eyes glued to the thread
im guessing hobbysearch is a crapshoot
  
      got them they wouldnt show up if i wasnt logged in    well they are cheaper than amiami which is nice
  it just says 404
  search shfiguarts dragon ball in the search bar thats how mine showed up
  try logging in then using the link
hlj gogeta is at order stop status broly still good at 
    ive tried that still 404 when i click them
for you anons who have ordered from amiami before i think i got my order in but i have a questions i received a confirmation email and it shows up in my orders list what are the chances of that getting cancelled later by the company due to stock issues
for hlj if you do a search for figuarts and change the filter to sort by release dates youll see both still available
  keep refreshing i get the 404 like every time i refresh it also try logging in as   suggested good tip never realized that was a thing i just always login when its bandai night haha      i ordered broly while he was still listed at 7800jpy just checked my order history and hes showing as 6630jpy so it looks like hlj autoadjusts the price accordingly but hey some late night tension doesnt hurt haha
    i ordered him again without cancelling the first one still have just the one order in my warehouse but its the discounted price now weird
  not a scalper just like to have backups in case something goes wrong
  well not anymore
im having a fucking mental breakdown here
  ive tried it still just 404
  no they sold out
  on amiami like next to none
  just use another site dipshit
how the hell is amiami still broken 15 mintues after sell out
hlj broly just went order stop
  try cdjapan    
  its still available though
well you guys have been the biggest help sadly it didnt mean anything in the end but i still appreciate the updates
    max quantity per household  3  still not sold out  guess they werent as popular as it hyped to be
  had everything in my cart  stuck loading for liek 20 minutes and didnt get shit  just kill me now
  if you click the preorder button it tells you it is sold out
  it says sold out though
  duh they were available when i posted that these guys are regular releases so theyll be available at gamestops and barnes and noble stores next year around may so no need to worry if you missed out
    try clicking the buttons retard
everyone check back every 1020 minutes theyll put them back up again
  try clicking the preorder button faggot
  im tired tho
  theres no telling when theyll be back up maybe itll be a few minutes maybe itll be ten minutes maybe itll be tomorrow afternoon
  exclusives also show up at those places because bluefin you fucking idiot
its a cookies issue if you use amiami on an incognito window it will glide right through    holy shit their new site is so fucking badly made
  true enough
have 2 gogeta orders on hlj  try to cancel one    it cancels my mafex spiderman instead    you fucking retards
thank god i dont want these two lol hopefully blue goku and vegeta wont be so chaotic
      oh its all good though i already got my confirmation email 20 mins ago
    i did fucktards my order just went through like any other mondays as smooth as a babys ass
  i havent used hlj for preorders in years    not since one of 6 items i preordered in one go got cancelled and they cancelled all 6 items on me instead of just the one
alright sitting here till 1 and then im giving up
  vegeta is a pbandai thing so ironically hell probably be far less chaotic
  who was talking about exclusives you spaz i was pointing out that these regular release figures are relatively easier to find and dont command crazy late comers tax if you sleep on ordering them for a while go to bed
bwwaaaaaah
  its a shit show ordering through hlj was so easy after getting burned by amiamis shit site im legit considering switching to hlj for all of my future preorders
  i got broly because his power is maximum      not the dude youre raging at but if you click it now it tells you theyre sold out
considering im yuropoor im probably not gonna be ordering from bbts  its up to the winds now
  ive done that and never looked back also forget that urban myth about people getting their orders cancelled ive been ordering from hlj for around 10 years now and have never had an issue
dont worry guys you can always get this instead
    uoykcuf
  after you get the order confirmation you can update the payment information when you view your order
this was somehow way better than the super buu fiasco it kept putting wrong items in my cart instead or when it did add it it gave me wildly expensive items as well fucking amiami is garbage thank god they put them up 20 minutes later today it was just a solid almost 20 minutes and i got both
  also forget that urban myth about people getting their orders cancelled  you dumbass    when the big mass cancellation issues happened we had multiple threads about it just cause you werent hit doesnt mean other people werent
  ive been refreshing hlj nonstop and all i get is pic related
  lol while the figurerise looks comically bad compared to the shf i enjoy getting them since theyre fun builds inexpensive and its dbz that said it would be great if they made more secondary characters that shf would never release
broly and gogetas preorder buttons are gone just the solid gray block of death now  its over bros
  for some random reason the links dont work for some people
  that means that when they come back up its more easy to notice than having to check by pushing the order buttons every time
  i dont really understand how my statement constitutes me being a dumb ass youre just butt hurt from being a shitty customer and thats why they canceled your orders
if i dont get a broly preorder im going to fucking kill myself
  good now itll be obvious if they go back up
chances are more will be available later so dont be retarded install the distill addon on your browser and download the web alert app on your phones
  hurr durr its just an urban myth
got the new broly and for super cheap too get fucked retards
    it doesnt really matter when they dont give any sort of alert as to whether hes available im not a neet i cant sit in front of the monitor refreshing all day    jesus christ hes a mass release hes going to be on every site and in certain stores calm the fuck down
  calling something that actually happened a myth makes you a fucking dumbass dumbass
  was it a specific figures orders
  this is cg made from development design data  fucked indeed
what time does bbts usually update shit tomorrow itll probably sell out crazy fast too
  figurerise broly is actually pretty decent ill admit
    anybody exclusively collect figurerise
  or made them to scale
  his hair and body proportions are better for sure
so looking at the times of posts here i wasnt seeing the new listings on hlj soon enough although i was busy and successful ordering on ami hope they stick    i usually search bandai and arrange in order of date of just show last 7 days and hit refresh or search bandai again the same way what am i doing wrong they sold out while in cart it feels like they appeared for me later than others somehow
  why does gogeta blue look so bad design wise but vegito blue just works perfectly
  ive noticed that sometimes it takes them anywhere from 13 days before they update with the new stuff these days
  next time try logging in to hlj then it works
  did that still 404  sites fucked
  they both look fine imo i give vegito the slight edge cause i like him more though
  because vegito is all blue
so what happens now
  you wait and hope
  to me thats the opposite gogeta has a better contrast because theres little blue on the body    also why i hate vegeta returning to the old suit over the white and grey one for going blue
have special pages for bandai day  things still fuck up  how do they keep getting away with it
  by still selling out regardless
  their website has always had issues but the redesign made things worse    they only have to deal with bad events like once a month or less so they choose to ignore it
i was asleep when preorders went up
  because filthy gaijin dont deserve to use the superior nippon site
  doesnt matter chances are you probably wouldnt have gotten your order in anyway
didnt see the new thread fucking hell amis shitty new site crashed at the checkout page and i missed broly and gogeta but got spike i got them on hlj and hopefully it stays true ive bought stuff from them before but never poed how are they will i get them when they come out or a month later
man have i missed the boat i only want broly
  theyre reliable except for a few occasions that i know of where they accepted more orders than they could fulfill shf luke and chogokin yf19
gaijin btfo have fun with the flashy dysfunctional site
  accepted more orders than they could fulfill  broly and gogeta went down in about 10 or so mins i guess ill find out later    theres always bbts
    and to latefags  poorfags  bandai got you covered thats what the budget broly is for
  i know that feel i didnt get my order in either keep checking back they seem to go through a few rounds judging by past releases    can also try refreshing like a madman on release day because most stores will have a few in reserve or box damaged copies
  no thanks id rather stalk mandy
im just gonna wait to see if gogeta goes back up on amiami  if not i guess im giving up on this release my wallet will be happy about that one at least
  that really doesnt look too bad all you need is a layer of matte topcoat to make him look presentable
them boys just went up on ny and the site immediately crashed last chance for those of you still looking to get a po is bij
  what the fuck are you trying to say
  fuck sold out in 10 mins
  link
  just trying to help out those who can read    jesus youve still got bij and bbts but i dont when they update their site    sites down
anywhere else for an australia    bbts taxes us now and shipping is like 40
gogeta on hlj 4675  gogeta on amiami 5320  broly on hlj 6630  broly on amiami 7530    fucking amiami and their selective discount they knew these are going to sell so they lowered the discount to rake more profit meanwhile figures which are not going to sell well    spike on hlj 4800  spike on amiami 4830
  yeah while hlj might not have the best discount rate at times at least they are being honest with all their products receiving consistent discount rates
  madman ent will probably get stock but itll be about a month or two after its released in japan you also get free shipping over 50 so it might work out close to retail price
so whats the deal with these brolys and gogetas are they some sort of limited release ones or will it be widely available after the initial preorder craze
did gogeta go up and go down again seriously
  i caught that too
i cant seem to find a preorder    are these going to be ultra rare    im unironically feeling extremely depressed and bummed out right now
gogeta back up on amiami catch him quick
  actually hlj has been giving out close to 0 discounts over the past 6 months this is actually quite unusual for them i even suspect it might be a system error
  broly too according to the site
grabbed broly and gogeta finally two hours after having a real bummer time during the initial launch
  same its the exact same as with super buu waiting paid off
  shame i already preordered him elsewhere might wait for hlj for the better price if he comes up again
goddamn what a journey the night has been
    holy fuck thanks lads  my webpage monitor didnt tell me shit
  this shit happens with every figure in this line theyll pop back in and out of stock in all the usual places just keep an eye out and youll get them
with amiami whats the cheapest shipping method that still has tracking and compensation for losses
  gottem i really dont trust any other site like i do ami
  no problem glad you managed to pick him/them up
  omg yes thank you for update you guys
theyre back
missed him again fuck
  fuck i just missed out because with was trying to research shipping differences     i thought i was gonna keep it in my cart
  rsal and air small packet are the cheapest ones with compensation but only cover 6000yen  ems and dhl covers everything
got to the last spage of checkout then kicked me out again _
  pro tip when selecting a shipping option on amiami you can change it at the final invoice
awesome got them no doubt theyre just staggering the release to make it more desirable
real talk    how rare and hard to get are these expected to be    is it worth freaking out and getting depressed over or am i just over reacting with the initial 1st preorder wave    i was freaking out over the idea of missing out of great saiyaman but his preorders seem to be in an abundance    are the brolys and gogetas expected to be a limited time and short supply figure
  short supply think kamen rider shfs have a feeling these might get reissued sooner rather than later but get a bluefin po asap
  i think technically speaking regular releases like gogeta and broly are more of a pain in the ass to get than pbandai releases just happens that you have to pay extra for pbandai
  theyre regular releases so theres nothing stopping bandai from making more stock or reissuing them but you also have your ss3 goku situation where he flew off the shelves and weve not heard a peep since since    its up to the manufacturer i guess
  keep checking all the different sites as they usually open and close pos for how long its different for each site not sure about reissues when it comes to db shf i cant even think of one that has been reissued so you might be out of luck there worst case scenario youll just have to periodically check mandarake and hope you can grab one for a decent aftermarket price could take you a month or much longer to find one there
  this whereas with pbandai releases theyre made on order for a set amount of time up to two months i think and sites like mykombini order directly from them  so that means that for people they are easier to get because the stock is based on how many people order not a predetermined amount
  awakening goku and vegeta were reissued a few times from memory
  i wanna say that its possible that theyll reissue these but they havent really reissued any of the new stuff since like awakening goku i think
  yeah reissues are fairly scarce which is why figuarts tend to fly off the shelves quickly  these almost seem like promotional movie figures so i wouldnt expect broly and gogeta blue to be reissued a lot if at all unless those two characters end up on screen more often
      vegeta has not been reissued only the first 3 figures and awakening have been reissued at least once
  saiyan saga vegeta did not too long ago i know because i saw the product page explicitly say reissue
  nope not listed on the website    
any chance hlj or amiami will put them back up again or should i give up now
  i see well maybe it was a restock
  put the tbd figuarts in the next op retard
  there is a possibility that theyll come back up but im not sure
  youll be f5ing on their pages for the next 5 months
ah fuck it im going to sleep if bandai doesnt want my money ill take it elsewhere my wallet thanks me at least
  anyone else not pull the trigger on a pre order for broly or gogeta because they already got saiyaman and super buu on pre order
  thats what i should have done  but i did not do so now i have a few months to deal with these fatal cuts to my wallet
i am sure well get some kind of exclusive ss gogeta they wouldnt waste the opportunity to reuse a mold right same for ss4 gogeta if they do start doing gt stuff at some point  well i say that but they still havent made an updated future trunks despite all the parts essentially being there in the xenoverse trunks and the time patroller
  well anon if it makes you feel better i feel im gonna end up regretting not getting a gogeta hopefully buu will satisfy
  i pulled the trigger on gogeta only one i managed to get but id already prepaid for saiyaman so hoipefully it wont be too bad buu will be a kicker though no doubt
  i mean i definitely wanted them especially gogeta but considering i already have two pbandai products ordered for the exact same month i am going to feel this one
so ive havent used hlj in a while but is there any way to change my order from private warehouse and edit the shipping method
  not for preorders i think they changed it so you can only edit shipping once it comes into stock
  i am going to feel this one  you think thats bad ive got 3 metal builds obiwan spidey and deathstroke due in the month of janfeb alone im not sure ill even have enough come marchapril unless i start rationing
  oh wow  ive got  december  1 nendoroid  4150 yen  february  1 figma  7300 yen  march  1 moderoid  3650 yen  1 nendoroid  4560 yen  1 figuarts  6200 yen  april  3 figuarts 1 pbandai 18590 yen  1 robot damashii exclusive  5353 yen  may  2 figma  12100 yen  thats without shipping and the inevitable assload of money for customs
how do the japanese feel that gaijin are the ones responsible for things being out of stock
  they shouldnt complain at least the sites they use are functional
worried about feeling shit at work if i stay up late for preorders  sleep early stomach troubles and miss workpreorders  god fucking dammit there no winning
wake up  check my confirmation email again  feelsgoodjpg
  work nights  just casually preorder while on break instead of losing sleep setting an alarm or just hoping you happen to be awake that the right time
  japanese dont care they are more into moemoekyun idol statues  generic school girl figures
  americans are the only ones who buy dragonball figures
  im glad that atleast one of us got the preorder
  why calm down its not even an exclusive
  i am calm anon very calm actually
just wait for bbts
fuck yeah
its on animenpccom
    dudes what did they do to gogetas face his jawline is way too narrow
  its nugogeta his widows peak is also far less defined
you vs the guy she told you not to worry about
  based hopefully this works
anyone wanna take a guess as to what were going to complain about with these 2
  clown shoes and lack of shading on the actual product
  blue chest on gogeta like gotenks
  i have a fear of gogeta having a poorly painted upper torso like gotenks
    to be fiar why cant they just have the vest and the actual chest piece separate it shouldnt be hard
  is that chest a different color
yurofags this store has both broly and gogeta and some other figuarts in case youre interested those prices though    
  using a comma instead of a decimal point to represent parts of a euro  what the fuck is wrong with the eu
  both amiami and hlj are overcharging    how delusional do you have to be to think a discounted price is overcharging
who else was initially more excited for broly but has since grown to like gogeta better
  they have other japanonly websites and local stores to buy from
  other way around for me still pumped for gogeta but new broly especially the look of the hair is growing on me id like gogeta more if they kept the fusion reborn colors for the outfit
  his new colors have grown on me personally i like how it matches gotenks
  im pretty sure gogeta has a separate chest from his vest if you look at promo pics of gotenks you can clearly see where the vest starts and the chest ends on gogeta here his chest actually wraps all the way around his vest doesnt have a distinct paint separation and in the official photo where he and broly are charging each other you can see upper torso that is skin colored underneath the back of the vest
  i like how it matches gotenks  i think it makes him look less unique and i loved the orange instead of the yellow
is it weird that for as much as i hated caulifla and kale i still want a kefla figuarts
  those prices look mighty fucking shady 37 is something only that faggy goku managed    in my experience that gogeta should be at least 59
  ive actually bought from them before theyre legit the price goes up when they apply taxes and other shit if you live in europe
  oh well then its not half bad    shipping seems cheap af where are you located
  spain its a spanish store thats why
  people keep saying different shit but honestly the criteria is as follows    if i preorder it it will be extremely common to find for months  if i dont preorder it its sold out before day 1    im not preordering these get the fuck on it
  ive never pre ordered a thing in my life i own every figure of the line released so far
gogeta and broly are up on amazon
  hasnt amazon fucked people over to their faces and canceled preorders with no pity before
    i once preordered freiza and they gave him to me for 3640 because of some preorder price guarantee     i do feel like they once cancelled my figuarts goku black figure before though i must have gotten it through bbts instead
when is bbts gonna have their orders up
  7999 for broly  june release dates for both  no thanks
i still cant decide if this guy is worth it i have no attachment to this outfit and he potentially only comes with one face dont really care for the helmet or the ssj hair     but gohan was fucking awesome
  gohan was never awesome and he is ugly as shit
    i mean he was kinda cool when he was beating the shit out of buu without using any saiyan transformations
  and then he immediately fucked that up in the same arc where he let a bald dude rape the shit out of his girlfriend in front of him gohan is beyond pathetic
  and it only went further downhill from there
    back to /a/
new thread 
we live in strange times
fuck i just want a decent figure of haruko and her scooter
finally bought a funko pop  i dont actually feel bad because i bought all monsters so they dont look ugly that much
  never thought that id live to see a character that would look decent as a fuck pop hard to believe but is mostly because they didnt include those dead stare black eyes in the design i could seriously consider getting this canti          and these other looks like fucking shit and what piss me off the most is that probably well never get a decent haruko naota  mamimi figures being made
    
  i always thought takun was mamimis nickname for naota what the fuk
you do realize that the cat is named takkun right
  it was originally her nickname for naotas older brother tasuku after he left for the us to play baseball she transferred it to both takun the cat and takun the boy
      
    yeah mamimi passed on the takkun nickname over the course of the series as the things she refers to that way grow apart from her first tasuku who left for the us and is hinted to have never really been as close to her as mamimi considers them then naota who stopped spending as much time with her once haruko shows up then the cat who leaves her for a female cat and finally the terminal core
  you know every generation says that right
  never thought that id live to see a character that would look decent as a fuck pop hard to believe  their non humanoid pops are fine all of my pops are monsters
  that gaping maw  ew
  i mean to be fair that saying is never wrong
this is fine
still hoping praying that sentinal will do a rerelease because of the new shows
  buy the garage kit
lol how dead eyed why not just regular action figures
  their non humanoid pops are fine all of my pops are monsters  i have never follow or be aware of all the characters that have been made in this like so the only two monsters or non human creatures that i have saw are the mtg nicol bolas dragon which i think still looks bad with the black dead eyes and the sharktornado one which is the only one that i think benefits of the black dead eyes just because sharks eyes are like that
  slimers rad
  those movies are dumb as hell but i love the look of this
  haha oh wow      would buy          would rather get a big bag of marshmallows and eat them all while scrooling through these images
  i picked up their smaug with his yellow eyes and hes pretty awesome hes got a big head but hes really well sculpted
  i love this dude half the shit they make comics about ive heard come out of peoples mouth when they want to argue at lcs      its almost like he wanted to present them as mouth breathers
            who
  who what
  i dont know half the fuckin characters funko produces
  not their fault
i just want an affordable canti figure
  iktf
  i bought this cause i think hes cute good sculpt
          well shit i admit that these non human fuck pops looks decent enough to be considered for future buys
  those shows went over like a lead zeppelin hope is over
my friends shit on the few funko pops i already have so why id love to get all 4 of these im afraid to
  id love to get all 4 of these im afraid to  or you could i dont know grow a fucking spine i know were all nerds and geeks here but never be a dork especially a cowardly dork
  i cant say i love this show or anything but some of the characters are cute and i wish they had some real toys  that ludo is honestly pretty nice at least
this is the only funko i own because it doesnt have the soulless eyes but more importantly because its the only affordable tom servo figure around  im not convinced by their crow it looks too weird
    the less humanlooking humans also benefit from that  roadhog from overwatch is cool deformed figure  same about dva
  ordered him last month
  holy fuck what  didnt know there is this skin of zen
  you didnt knowthere are skins for zen are you not a player of the game he has skins
  you lack reading comprehension
  no maybe your writing ability needs work
  youre just being a dumbass on purpose fuck off retard
  skin is for digital models and mold is for physical representations sorry youre ignorant
  same here i occasionally dab in humanoid ones but very rarely balrog and treebeard from lotr are amazing for their price the heartless have circular yellow eyes so the pop versions just look chibified i have gigantor krampus and a few misc ones too      ignored the universal monster pops for several years  reminded of them with invisible man pop comes out  now want to collect them all  40 for one  i made a mistake
  i got a walgreens literally spitting distance from me fingers crossed on invisible man
  sorry forgot to comment on your balrog currently tipsy atm fucking love it one of the ones i hope to get
    what he meant dumbfuck is he didnt know about this specific skin
  i really want that not super saiyan star
  god these were so exciting when they first came out i wish they werent as fragile as glass joints literally crumbled after a while with nothing more than minimal posing and gentle handling
not a big fan of the human funkos but as many have said before the non human funkos are not too bad at times i think the cuphead and funko style blend pretty well together
  i love godzilla but this is horrible mostly because it isnt based on any particular godzilla but a generic american idea of him
  its pretty awesome in person and that generalization is all it needs to be though its very clearly based more on early heisei godzillas
    yeah making it a general one is a much better idea than doing every last detail of a specific suit
    funko pops are a monkeys paw wish come to fruition all these characters finally getting toys but they look like this
ride on poopy star
  still no duke nukem pop    im glad
    doing every detail of a suit also probably just isnt feasible for the funko pop style so once simplified to funko pop style the majority of the suits would more or less be similar enough that all the variations would be pointless the only exceptions would be ones that have major differences like shingoji legengoji or miregoji
  roadhog from overwatch is cool deformed figure  same about dva  how do these compare weight wise i have the dva funko and the meka is really sturdy and nice so are all the bigger ones like that and only the regular ones are flimsy or at least thats what they look like ive never held any in my hands
hows your pop investments going
  im not id buy the fuck out of a pig cop pop
a collectibles shop just opened in my town  75 funko  10 lego  10 statueshit  5 other  selling funko chases at ebay prices and normal ones at markup prices    how fucked is this shop
  i give them until april 2019
  that s o y youtuber face    lmfao  m  f  a  o
im finding myself buying more pops than usual the dunharrow king is really great theres a translucent layer over his head with a skull behind it the eyes are on the translucent part over the skull sockets im a sucker when toys do things like that            please stop shilling your videos here
  im not toy insanity im the only one commenting on his videos
  heres the only one i own only because i chose the mystery prize
pops are the beanie babies of this era the only question is when the fad will end    i already see stores selling them at greatly reduced prices
  i disagree at least beanie babies were cute they had intrinsic appeal pops have jack shit going for them
  they have licenses that people care about
  theyre cute and have appealing sculpts
  a good number of the sculpts look to be weak and carboncopies of other preexisting figures
  meh my local hobby shop was shut down a couple months ago due to some assholes harassing the owner he primarily sells mostly board games trading cards comics  filipino food but hes my benefactor of used games  gundam figs
this is the first funko pop i bought i almost bought the hatsune miku funko but i hated how they made her a super skinny body with a big head if i wanted hatsune miku to look like that i would have rather gotten the nendoroid version recently i bought a special edition chun li with a red dress on a markdown i also got ant man and wasp from the new movie they are both wearing their helmets and i thought it was pretty adorable i dont like the bobblehead versions i bought poe dameron from the new star wars movies as a bobble head which was also a markdown doctor strange from the marvel movie it looks like benedict cumberbatch is also a bobble head and i have never seen any other version of him if it wasnt a bobblehead i would have bought it
  flcl  flcl  flcl  flcl  trading card game dragon  alien from an old black and white movie from the 50s i think
only one i have not from a lootcrate     their seattle building is fun to visit though the diagon alley is neat
  i remember buying the haruko one as a kid and crying when i broke it
remember when these were hard to find
  my local shop got anything from figuarts nendoroid figma cupoche everything now they are all over funko and sell only game and movie figures for plebs  i give them year maybe two
  but the original in original numbering and boxing and year tag is still rarer than this retooled bootlegs for poor late new comers to own something that they jumped onto when it has always been available for years
looking for something to distract myself from the emptiness of my cubicle are these the key i really just want to put something neat looking on my desk thinking of maybe getting either the black manta pops
  id recommend gashapon toys instead since they are smaller and usually more fun but its whatever you want i suppose i have a few tiny figurines on my desk that i toy with mostly gundam and miscellaneous scifi characters it makes me happy when people at work recognize them
    i really like how the mystery mini black manta looks the funko one just looks so boring    pic related is the mystery mini one
  where are the joints
has the lizard pop shown up in stores yet hes one i really want for my lizard collection
  apparently so he was up online and sold out quickly i hope you find him lizard anon i like your collection saw it posted before
  a netflix original series    what the fuck
post your custom projects here mods  fixes scratchbuilds kitbashes repaints 3d printed stuff  whatevers on your worktable    offer tips and advice ask for help post tutorials/guides and have fun
heres some tips from the previous threads    beginners practice on cheap figures first    for sculpting on figures use 2part epoxy putty like aves apoxie or fixit    for tools try a basic carving/sculpting set like the kind arts  crafts stores have and calipers for symmetry  dental tools have also been said to work well  also using a dremel is recommended minimites the small 2025 ones are fine for starting out but the battery life is poor upgrade to a corded one only if you want to get deeper into customizing they are useful for stuff outside of the hobby though so its a good investment regardless a flex shaft attachment on a dremel is a godsend and relatively inexpensive the grinding shield is also pretty useful but you can improvise one using a cut open soda bottle wear a dust mask and dremel in a well ventilated area    for paints use acrylics paint in multiple thin coats brands like vallejo/p3/citadel are recommended because of pigment quality shake/stir the bottles/pots before using to ensure uniform pigment in the paint    use a sealer when finished to protect your work there are matte varieties and sealers that give a glossy look as with painting use multiple thin coats
previous thread   also there is a guide in the works by mellow        give feedback/critiques to help improve it
i was looking through my old computer and found many past works from previous custom general threads ill compile them over the next few days and post some here
  
  oh my god somebody made an mc ride custom im listening to beware right now
    most of my stuff is slaonly but this one can be fdm printed make your own dtas
  its the base i used for ninja and i have more in the works
hi guys im currently redoing some of my old customs with the new body types ive been making heres a new version of my iris heart now with more voluptuous proportions
  heres another pose i m still tweaking her range of motion so that she can cross her legs but i might just make a solid crossedlegs piece like the upcoming warspite figma has instead
are there 3d models of the revoltech joints or the hobby base joints that i could use to test how they would fit on a printed model
i bought a cloak for my 6 inch action figure now i would like it to look war torn whats a good effective way to get that look
  rough it up with sandpaper especially around the edges stain it with various reds and browns to simulate blood and dirt stains
  man that op takes me back i remember it being used 4 or 5 times
  ass tech is outta this world
  thingiverse has some figma joints
  oh shit what the hell is that im the top left i want that body
  sorry i realized right after posting thats the markov evolve body my bad
ok i remember a while ago somebody mentioned how to cut a shield out of an acrylic sheet but how do you make something with a slight curve to it im pretty sure i can just sculpt the details on the front with milliput but itd suck if the whole thing were flat
  find a glass bottle use putty to bend over the curve and sculpt basic shield and then break it or use silicon release
  so make the entire thing out of putty itd probably be 45 tall and weight might start being an issue at that point i was hoping to use plastic because itd be lighter
  perhaps heat up the plastic around some type of bottle
  hm i was thinking of using harder plastic but yeah something softer would probably be better all around
  just use hips sheets aka plateplate thinner sheets are already flexible on their own and you can stack them using plastic/model cement you just need a straight piece to reinforce and hold the shape because it is flexible ask gunpla guys for more info
im planning on buying and customizing this guy but im not sure on what to do im thinking on giving him a really dark blue wash on the body to darker the plastic and then drybrushing a lighter blue i will cut the belt and glue it higher on the torso and put a really light orange wash in the yellow parts will it look good im not sure how drybruhing and wash look when put together in this way
  just about any plastic can be bent with heat you could also use metal like a tin cookie sheet
  thigh swivels 1/4 inch above the belts on his thighs  but why
  think you meant to reply to       and also what the fuck youre right who would do that there is an obvious place to hide the swivel right there how do you screw that up
    its because they use the same generic base for multiple figures
      the straps are floating you can glue them to line up with the thigh swivel
  whoops youre right       oh thats good
i need some paint advice got this figure today and when i moved the visor it got stuck and chipped off a bit of the copper paint the two white marks  im not quite sure what colour to use to fix it now  should i try to match the copper tone which i think is gonna be pretty hard and look weird when not done well or just use a dark grey to match the weathering on the helmet
  yeah make it look like battle damage
turning k2so into a necron baddie
  oooh that seems like it would work pretty dang well
  oh my god please do
  thats a really cool idea  might actually steal that
which balljoints do you guys think are the best both in quality and availability
head sculpt coming along still need to sand it so its abit rough right now
x23 kitbash i put together out of pepper potts and x23 for the collar i used the classic deadpools choker and cut it up wish worked out well as for the medallion i cut out a piece from the vintage wave black widow and for the belt i used another black widow belt and removed the decal with acetone the arms might get swapped out in the future with ms marvel/carl danvers from the target three pack but as for now its done
  what kind of putty are you using
  some really old aves apoxie sculpt thats why i think its so rough to work with and it takes forever to cure ive had luck sanding it to shape though
    its funny that youre doing this i was going to make a necron a year or so ago and i was going through some redesigns and literally everything i came up with looked so much like k2so that i got mad and quit because i thought people would think i just kitbashed him i really dig the lanky necrons from the art its a shame the minis look like such ass looking forward to seeing what you come up with
  croix this might be a dream out of reach but is there a chance you might be willing to sell/make customs for an ordinary person
are phicen and hottoys neck pegs different i bought an alternate head for my hottoys black widow off ebay but the head wont fit anybody got a quick fix
how does talc and superglue compare to an actual modelling putty for filling bubble holes in resin casts    ive got some generic blue/yellow putty and some of gws liquid greenstuff but never been able to get a result im satisfied with while using it    i head the talcsuperglue method was actually really good and since what im filling is going to be painted white after id rather stay light than risk dark patches showing through the paint
redid the face like it a lot more now
  yeah the models are squatty and hideous probably why i dont own any
  dont quit your day job man   keep refining that looks like youre half assing it
  eh it all looks really rough cause i havent gone in to sand anything
guys does anyone here have that image explaining how to change the shoulder joint for the guts black swordsman figma if im not mistaken the new joint was the new system in the place of the old one
anyone know how i can make a custom headmaster unit for a power of the primes legends class figure like tailgate i know the prime master figures can ride inside him but i think theyd be to big for his body if i just added a connection hole
doing a custom with figure rise standard frieza  paint doesnt stick very well any advice
  what paint are you using
  im sorry my man but this is the kind of idea you are not ready to make if you are asking on a way to make it  do you have a plan to do it have you considered using a dianaut for the body
  just in case you did sand/prime the surface right
  testors acrylic     thats what i was wondering if i should sand the whole thing because the surface is so smooth
  repaint of the black series gamorrean guard
  yeah you should lightly sand it so the paint can grip on the sculpt better
what dremel should i buy all i want to do is some hip mods on marvel legends
  
    i use this one personally works great   
new to this is there a gallery anywhere of all the cool shit people here have made
been working on this one for a while   1/12 silicone body kind of like a realdoll
  heres a backside shot  forgot to mention that i had just taken it out of the mold when i took these
  the butt is squishable
  bruh you have some real unlucky timing   also it looks like the feet are backwards
  out of curiosity how much in materials did this cost you to make    also either your feet are on the wrong legs or the toes did not completely fill the molds what sort of mold did you use for the silicone
hey     i am desperately looking for a few pieces i saw on someones custom they made this doctor doom and i need to know what body they used    i would be so fucking grateful if someone could clue me in on this body because i know the head is the run of the mill doctor doom marvel legends
  2
  dc collectibles batman v superman armored batman
    okay so just realized while posting this that the body is one of the armored batman figures from batman vs superman    just need to know specifically which one it is now
      heres the included accessories just in case it helps
  heh nice
    bitch i already told you
  oh shit thanks man you just made my year
  glad i could help
      aaaa  and it turns out i already own the figure that the head comes from    everything is coming up anon
  it didnt really cost anything at all as this was just a test casting using stuff that was lying around i used a mold made of unused corn starch that i had in a cupboard and some leftover platinum silicone from a friend who had used a silicone that was too soft i also used armature wire that was pretty much free as well  and yes the feet were installed backwards this particular casting was a bit of an impulse cast to see if such a figure was possible and i had mixed the silicone before noticing that they were on backwards      yee i had this particular project planned for like 3 years and never got to it until like 2 days ago spent a day scuplting the body then casting it bit of a shame but i had pretty niche ideas planned such as elf girls so im still going to pursue this project
  heres and update on the iris heart im working on ive blocked in some of the colors ill be using and also made her a dominatrix style cap
  and heres some of the work i just put in today still need to complete the black parts and ive got some material that might work as flexible garter straps      i still need to improve my castings to the point where i could feel comfortable selling them as is theyre filled with holes and surface dimpling that require lots of postcast clean up one of these days ill look into getting a pressure pot or vacuum degasser
anyone recommend where i can buy green grass mats for dioramas
  hobby lobby sells them in rolls i think another option is to get some faux fur and dye it green if you want taller grasses
i would like to make a sculpt for my mom of her as a clown but i dont know where to start should i just repaint a funko pop and kill myself or are there better ideas
  maybe not exactly what you are looking for but i wanted to share it in this thread anyway saw this being used live this weekend and the results are really impressive    
  maybe try thatsmyface to get her head and use a clown figure as he body
  thatsmyface  i like this but it would mean a lot more to me and as a gift if i did it myself
  clown figure of mother  okay so anons into that  gift to mother  u wot    in all seriousness the question is whether you know you can make the figure of her head already if you arent 100 sure do thatsmyface to get a betterlooking figure you dont want to make something that looks like crap
  markov from evolve tried to make him into an enclave soldier and gave him a ron perlman head
  tell us more about your niche ideas anon      you cant really synthetic faux fur without melting the fibers though that looks like a cool idea tho
  neat how is it articulated
  had ideas such as a body with tanlines freckles etc a possible navi body and other different colored variants red green blue ect for bodies    i had also designed this sort of quintiplegic girl mech which i think i showed here and was hoping to expand on the idea
  another update here got most of the black parts painted next step is to add some details to her outfit
  also i got some new waterslide decals from hlj im working on some more expressions for iris after some experimenting with a tattoo set on one of my old customs
    god bless you you absolute madman this looks incredible
  even if you dont use dye you can color the fur using acrylic paint just apply it with a brush then work it in using a comb its a technique that model railroad guys use but it should scale up if you need it to
made phascomons claws last night they need some touchups and sanding this hand is just a pattern test im waiting on some supplies to come in the mail before i can make the real ones         looks like she could use a bit more sanding but overall its damn impressive      shit youre right i was thinking acrylic paint makes fur all stiff and coarse but thats totally irrelevant for dioramas
  this was up on ebay it would me lice to have own
so i want to run some wire through some hinge joints  i want to keep as much range of motion as possible and maximize repetition of motion without the wire snapping inside and breaking the connection  i have seen conductive thread at my local electronics shop obviously the stuff they carry there is probably cheap shit but i was wondering if a stronger version of that would be more durable than using a high gauges multistranded wire i know a big issue with stranded wire is the copper will eventually snap overtime thus breaking the connection i figure conductive thread could get past this issue but i imagine the coating may wear off
  maybe bead stringing wire like beadalon
    wow shitty work
  not a bad idea actually those are made of steel wire which will hold up to the abuse  only question is soldering to it to tiny led pads
  regular copper wire shouldnt suffer from fatigue if its like just 90 to 135 degree bends      i wonder if you can use a pair of washers as slip rings at the joint
  if you want absolutely indestructible wire then go to a phone repair shop and look for diamond wire for slicing phone screens free from the glue on the motherboard its impossible to cut with scissors youll need dukes also dont wrap it around your finger because you can cut all the way to through the bone if you jerk it it can be tied around things looped like fishing line etc imagine the thickness of a human hair but the strength of a steel rod
  heres a pic of the stuff you can also kill someone with it nearly decapitating someone by just making a simple loop cuts right through all muscle tendons larnyx arteries right down to the spinal column
  steel is tougher than copper but it is far weaker in fatigue strengthrepetitive loading the inbetween is aluminum wire  something they do use in the electronics
what would be a good base to make a teen titans robin custom has to be short an skinny and not very expensive
what would be a good method to give an iron man figure a blue glowing effect all the figurarts come with stark white eyes and only plain clear plastic covering silver arc reactors has anyone here tried giving one a proper blue look on those parts is there some sort of clear blue plastic friendly paint
  that would be tamiya clear blue acrylic paint
  clear nail polish and blue food dye
  amnd how woudl that be applied would it like noramlal coating or perhaps as such the image
  you could use a spectacular spiderman figure as a base all youd have to do is take the head off a ttg robin shave down the mouth and nose and resculpt the features onto the head in more accurate positions
  goddamnit croix why do you have to be so good at this
  quintuple amputee    how exactly does that work in your mythos is her consciousness uploaded to a computer system or is an artificial brain running the biological systems of breathing heartbeat metabolism etc without a personality like a cybernetic drone
  its a twostep process that requires and airbrush first paint the light port solid bright white then use an airbrush to lightly highlight around that with bright white airbrush tamiya clear blue over those areas next
what materials to use to make fake action figures    are there any tutorials how to make whole own action figures
  great job    what were they thinking making this
  great thanks the body shape is perfect for it
apparently the new huawei mate pro phone has build in 3d capture system that you can import into your favorite 3d sculpting program and 3d print into reality think of it as like a reverse 3d printer that takes physical object and turn it into 3d model    the resolution is not quite there yet for us to be able to take 3d picture of a figure we like resize appropriately and then 3d print the parts for custom but hopefully it would develop in the next 23 years to become feasible
  the app qlone does it too for an iphone but requires printing out a proprietary checkered sheet to rotate your camera around the trick is to have the sheet glued to cardboard or foamboard on a rotating platform i rigged mine using a fidget spinner and some silicone rubber to grip the board
  can i get a peek at the joints in the hips
  typically resin just go on youtube and look up how to make and cast resin figures
  well i dont have an airbrush ill figure something else out
  sure when i get home tonight ill post a pic its just two modified figma hip joints that are spaced apart though so instead of 1 yshaped joint there are 2 jshaped joints
in the last year my son has gotten super into pic related but it seems the line kinda died off a while ago im thinking about spending the money to get a few of the more unique minifig pieces so i can start molding some of the current and iconic wrestlers anyways i was wondering how i should go about making faces for them i do have an airbrush but i feel like trying to stencil faces that small would be a pain i was also looking at 
starting small with a little statuettes first then scale it up and start making them really fetishy    hey kid wanna buy a cumflation desk figure
    okay heres what it looks like different figure but the joint system is the same this setup lends itself to a lot more flexibility so youd probably want to add a thigh swivel as well
  reminds me of shinki hips good to know
  im surprised max factory or bandai has never tried a system like that themselves closest i can think of is some of the monsterarts but that doesnt really count does it work for more slender bodies or do you need the wide hips to accommodate the joints
  can you get a detailed headsculpt of 1/6th character and scale it down to 1/12th with the app im really curious
  shinki hips  that was my inspiration to begin with lol i was initially trying to adapt their full range of motion to a figma body but it interfered with the butt shape so this was the compromise      it could work with a more slender build but youd have to place the joints closer together which would make the hips area more fragile im sure its feasible with the right sculpt
my 3rd ever mod nearly done
    ps whats the best way to clean this it was a seam line gap that filled up with dirt until i got it right
  anyways i was wondering how i should go about making faces for them i do have an airbrush but i feel like trying    maybe printable water slide decals
work in progress
  oh fuck youre making meruem nice
yikes i hope it isnt out of place asking this here but would this be a good place to talk about commissioning custom action figures
  yeah shame a figure of him doesnt exist so i had to
anyone know a good paint color i can use to cover up this purple dot on my menace figure
  nice titty birthmark
  never mind i just use polish remover
got moonracer and ended up modifying her a bit to better suit my tastes
  it goes   it goes   it goes     yuh
  nice are you going to give him overlydetailed junk like the manga version       youd hardly be the first give us an idea of what you want and your budget
  what kind of mod am i supposed to see here      carve it out seam weld runner bits into it
i ordered an azusa figma recently but when it arrived it was busted in numerous ways including the hand being broken off inside the arm hole since i dont think im getting a refund  i wanna turn it into venom snake azusa im new to customs what materials should i use for it if i want a similar visual consistancy and is making jointed arms possible/easy
  well my budget is around 250300 if thats not enough i can go higher and all id want is a custom shigeo kageyama from mob psycho 100
  no because in the later drawings he doesnt have it but i will make the shoulder design based on the manga with the extra circle
  just get a bootleg saitama off ebay for the head and stick it on figma ichiro
figuarts white dragon ranger / lord drakkon and the wip of my ranger slayer
  well that bodys too tall and the satamia figma head looks awful and not much like mob
    oh god
  yikes
    i knew that cap on friezas head and the choice of barefeet were too specific to be a coincidence awesome to see someone make a custom meruem
what do you guys do when you need only one piece for a custom but dont want to buy the figure that has that figure  i only need the heads of cw wheeljack and tr sentinel but dont feel like buying and reselling them after finishing
  jincustomcom has you covered choose guides and tutorials on the left menu
  look for the cheapest despite long delivery time or bid on ebay if only one piece of the figure is used leave it for another custom
  ive been out of the loop for a while does everyone still hate you
  fuck off miloanon  you dont even have the skills to make a small mod
  thanks that seems like the best way to go about it
  you know anon jins work may be mediocre but at some point i wonder what the purpose of your comment even is  low hanging fruit isnt all that sweet
not sure if this board fits with my issue but ill try it  somehow lost its arm for some reason  is there any way i could replace it with gunpla arms
  the hell is this
  could you back up a little i cant tell what that is as to your question you should be able to install a gunpla arm if the joint has something to plug into and the arm itself has good clearance
asking for someone with experience modding balljoints before i fuck this up  i want to relocate the slot through which the male balljoint goes out but i want to make sure the balljoint is not left unusable afterwards i thought of using some polystyrene to patch it afterwards but since theres not space to carve out some extra support im wary about it just falling off  what do
  
  that thing looks pretty cool  something out of five star stories i assume if all that is missing is the right hand then you could probably replace it with a gundam hand they sell the hands by themselves but i would try looking for the lost hand first and attempt a repair of that
  wtf is this is that a gold card from bm64
  its gone from the box  the peg on it cant even fit with a gunpla hand i checked it  are there companies who sell female connector mecha hands in 1 100 scale
  i would take one of the gunpla hands cut off the peg and drill a hole into it instead you might also need some epoxy putty to reinforce the holes perimeter i think kotobukiya makes 1/100 scale hands with their msg line
  i dont know why nobody does reviews of these hands kits without measuring their length with a ruler like an actual physical ruler with centimeters and millimeters
after taking a break to work on my novel im going back to a project of creating an ogre here you see three different attempts of hair with style color and scultping medium
so im planning on starting a poster version rodan soon using the marvel legends sauron as the base my big problem is that his legs are way too long anyone have any suggestions on what figures might have some reptilian and preferably articulated legs to use as a replacement
  it is  good eye
i cant believe it worked lmao
  but you cant see his legs in the poster p    the only shorter legs i can think of would be from 118 lizard figures but considering rodan is a guy in a costume in the movie i would build up the torso and bring down the crotch a little    otherwise you can cut material from the center of the leg and glue it back together
so i have 2 questions    1whats an effective way to make action figure skin look more realistic kind of like pic related im casting parts with epoxy resin and id like to add some realism like the sort of visible capillaries on this hot toys figure i tried adding dried ground up pinkish paint flakes to my flesh colored epoxy during castings to see if i could get a similar look but it didnt work out well anybody got any ideas for how this realism can be achieved    2 how durable is a printed abs joint im thinking of printing a few figma joints that are up on thingiverse but pla is too brittle has anyone tried printing a joint in abs and are they functionable/durable
  why not buy hobby base joints instead
  for that kind of effect id get a very thin red a toothbrush and do the brush flick thing gently
  i have a printer and i dont want to wait a month for only a few joints to be delivered
  then fucking print some joints and see if they work or not goddamn it why do people always come here and ask fucking simple ass questions when they could just trial and error shit like the rest of us
  because the point of these threads is to be able to share knowledge and give advice along with showing off what youre working on sure i can understand there being frustration around having to say the same thing every thread personally im kind of fed up with people repeatedly asking how to fix warped figure but who are you to take the process of inquiry from a thread that is practically oriented around it especially when my particular question has not been covered in this thread or other archived threads that ive been looking in
  some guy on thingiverse made these and they work for him  hey guys do you think these would work    why not just use hobby base joints    because i have the capability of making these things that are already confirmed to work by the guy who made them     so just do that    the point of these threads is to share knowledge and give advice 
  thanks im a big fan and always wanted to make the cast as simple figures but im not sure if they would translate into 3d or not where did you find some an obscure gif
its that time of year again suddenly christmas themed crappy plastic g scale trains operated by four c batteries everywhere
caboose not at the end  they always do this and it always bugs me
  my family has one of those amongst other actual g scale trains like lgb aristocraft etc and at the very least the freight cars are somewhat usable they have lgb style couplers and honestly theyre not too bad all youd need to do is slightly modify them and theyd be great for normal g scale operation
my parents got a train set one christmas to set up around the tree it was christmas themed but looked like a regular train none of this santa elf deco but they stopped setting it up because i would tie gi joes to the train tracks and try to set up fights on its roof
this one really pisses me off
  looks nothing like the real one
i have a set that looks just like this from when i was a kid a bit worse for wear  i should probably go dig it up and fix it now that i have the skills and can probably find replacement parts for the broken bits easy enough    i remember there being a more toned down christmas train version that i wanted but never got from memory it was the same train just painted differently more whites and reds and green    i intend to pick up one or two of the better g scale christmas trains this year after christmas when theyre all on special
  i will never not be mad that they removed the hollow cabs
i dont know what you call these wild west era mid 1800sish body style of locomotive exactly but 260  440
  but its 27 pieces anon think of the value
  7 of those pieces are crappy tiny signs that will never come out of the box
  thats a mogul
  yeah i know the 260 is a mogul but the 440 isnt
  the 440 is referred to as american type
  yeah but i mean is there a word that refers to both the 260 and 440 like see how theyre very similar visually
  i guess 19th century american is probably the best term for them
  you could also call it the baldwin/rogers style
  i fukin hate these things
  this ones better but the wheels arrangement is wrong  that font truck
we had one of these when i was a boy i loved the way it smelled like fire
tfw i live near two model train shops next to each other and some how surprised theyve managed to stay around for this long model trains are such an extremely niche hobby im sorta scared to imagine what the community is like
does someone have the hornby magazine in pdf to share
  its just a bunch of fat old balding white guys with pedo mustaches like literally every other hobby under the sun
what are female train hobby people like are they dykes or weird ass fujos who fantasize trains are people possibly their children and have weird gay male train fantasies
  what are female train hobby people like  they dont exist
  tfw no traingirl gf
  there is no community the whole point of a hobby is to collect for yourself if you find someone else that shares that hobby then good for you whats important is if you yourself love it
anyone else lego trains
  bought like ten different ones of them for pennies each one year when i was a kid  had a giant multi leveled maze set up in my bedroom and just oogled at them going around  good times  god i miss that so fucking much
  you know lad you could recreate that if you desired so badly
  dunnae if the missus would approve  besides i keep all my train autism sated with cities skylines these days
  id like to now that i am an adult with money
ive never been a big train anorak but i do think older trains are interesting nice looking things ive always quite liked diesel trains actually theres something oddly satisfying about how powerful they look and lego trains are cool though that might be because lego anything is cool    also christmas themed armoured train when
    rip sounds like she got you by the balls
  ive met plenty of them they were all literally just like men who are into trains awkward socially inept and most likely diagnosed aspies being autistic about choochoos isnt genderable anon
is it the cost that compels the purchase  hard to find without selling your soul  a demo incase the real deal might appeal to you  mistaken purchase but liked/hated after realizing  do you have morals for/against or do you just want your shit    my first 2 experiences with kos was with masterpiece transformers one was a ko of g2 sideswipe and despite it being a ko it turned out pretty great just a small paint incinsistancy and slight box misprint gave it away but a ko of redalert ended up being an example of how bad they can get box was an obvious fake and the pinned wheels were loose meaning it couldnt roll not to mention being a floppy piece of shit that required modification just to transform both were mistaken purchases but the later ko had me chase them up for a partial refund since i liked it least initially until it broke itself just standing there one day    pic related is something i just came across i own the original and after opening multiple monster hunter figure builder blind boxes paint work is mostly consistent and this one is a terrible reproduction but good enough if you missed it being so old    on that note do blind box figures belong in /toy/ its not an amiibo but they do as much as an ooshi
  i dont buy bootleg figures only accessories like demoniacal fit heads or casting cave i dont really demonize anyone for buying bootlegs but i personally would rather have a quality product or not have it than buy a lowquality ko
  theres knock offs of the mh things shit guess i need to be careful about buying them on ebay
  im getting one from hong kong as we speak and if the thread is still up ill let you know how it goes that said paying for a second hand one from japan there are a few good sellers out there its any from outright china/using product placement images/have 40 types that you should worry about    that said pic related is from an ebay listing i saw says its from australia but reviews from customers confirm they not only hold bootlegs not of these though no one has bought any but goods are infact from china    i just wanted me a shagaru magala since i sold my larger gore magala years ago since i wanted more monsters and kinda sick of paying pot luck with the boxes when the next set comes out ill be buying the damn crates this time since this one cost me a pretty penny after shipping and shit about the price of 2 and a half figures if i bought them locally and we aint cheap here
  that retarded sentence structure     i shouldnt be hunting as i post but just to clarify there are a few sellers that have legit figures usually from japan ive compared their figures to what i have and i have multiples of and theyre spot on but that camelouss colors are a bit wack stick to jp sellers but know youll be paying a fair bit but dont buy single boxes/crates from ebay stick to amiami hlj and the like or local stores if possible
  do you have morals for/against or do you just want your shit  i dont really care its not like im trying to impress friends on the internet and my rl friends arent elitist  i buy both originals and bootlegs depending on the figure ill shell out the cash for super detailed light up 3a figures and turn around and drop 50 on a bootleg figma snake and a few gurlukovich bois to pose and play around with theyre toys if its fun ill buy it however if im dropping the dosh for an original and i get a bootleg thats a different story all together
post robots doing gay things now
  i cant tell whats worse the fact that droseel cost 120 or i couldve bought her for half the price long while back
i have two more not shown
  what are these called and wheres best to get them desu theyre very cute
  they cost too much now anon just go google drossel fireball charming and hop you have enough money to buy the two different versions
  120 on ebay desu thats not too bad i payed more for my kanna fig from the pictures it looks like the hair can be changed to match the one in your photo is that correct
  i set a mandarake alert on her years ago and managed to pick one up for like 80 that might still work

andrew up to his old tricks again eh
    i shipped the package but was in another state with my family for thanksgiving without access to the receipt instead of waiting 4 days i got another 6 emails from this retard if its you or you even think its you then youre definitely a huge bitch
  ahahhaha
  fuck off andrew
    i sell here all the time and youre an absolute retard id never purchase from    tracking is inherent with the blind trust were throwing at the wall here how am i supposed to know youre not a scammer piece of shit tracking costs maybe a dollar extra with priority on usps stop being a cheap fuck
  tracking is free with priority and has been for years at this point
  with  with  with  /withwith/  preposition  preposition with  1accompanied by another person or thing  a nice steak with a bottle of red wine  synonyms accompanied by escorted by in the company of
        tracking is free with every service now how can you fuckers not know that the damn  is on the receipt
  85 for gohan    i should have bought him when he was 45 at barnes last year
  tracking is free with every service now how can you fuckers not know that the damn  is on the receipt    i never said it wasnt dimwit that guy just specified priority
  i hope you do purchase from me so i can send you a literal box of my shit with tracking you blind fucking faggot i shipped it out with tracking a couple of days before thanksgiving and was out of town and kept the receipt on my counter with the tracking you fucking faggot when i told the person that i wouldnt be able to get them the tracking until i was back in town they bombarded me with emails twice a day wondering if i had the tracking yet like a complete fucking nigger no sorry im not coming home 4 days early so that you can be sure of where your 40 second hand toy is you cocksucker and with all the protection people have these days who gives a shit package is lost refund person is a scammer refund fucking anything happens except you get exactly what you paid for refund relax and stop being annoying pieces of shit
  good luck with that retard the odds of you selling what i buy are so infinitesimal that youd have better luck going door to door in every state until you find my house
  haha damn andrew
  nice dodge dipshit congrats on not being able to fucking read have fun with your hot glue figs
im not going to list my shit yet but do people usually buy a few figures at once for a good deal i have a bunch of figmas to unload but i am not gonna sell individually just wondering if it happens
  happens but not common and prepare for people to just email you a fuck ton asking for specific ones
  maybe ill sell elsewhere then thanks for the reply frien
  if youre going to sell a bundle youre honestly better off selling on an auction site people here are massive poorfags and will just keep asking you to sell the figures individually for bundle prices if youre not in a rush to sell them you could probably make more selling them individually on myfigurecollection or something
      tracking costs maybe a dollar extra with priority    see how your sentence structure implies that tracking is the thing that costs a dollar extra and not the priority shipping itself tracking does not cost extra with priority shipping its included for free
  after some hiccups got my scream with some buddies
  make a generic bundle offer upload all figures with individual prices then offer progressive discounts     something like   5 dollars off if you buy 2  10 off if you buy 3  or a buy 3 get one free this will incentive for people to buy more
  yeah thats fair but i want to weed out people like  and  said ill think about it

  this is a different anon than me selling it i just wanted to make that distinction this anon is on one for whatever reason
my son loves the old rubbersuit kaiju movies and i want to get him a frigging huge godzilla for christmas is there any figure i can buy that he can carry everywhere and bodyslam without destroying it i dont care about quality so much as long as its rugged
  i would say jakks pacific is good but its hollowish
there was a limited release 45th anniversary gojira thing was something like 4 feet long expect to pay 5000 if you can find one
  hes asking for something his kid could smash around why are you suggesting something that could cost up to 5k
  i would maybe pay a little more than the average parent just because he loves them so much but i dont want to destroy anything a collector would be looking for if theres a plush godzilla that would work too
  empire godzilla look him up on ebay king of the monsters got me banned from neighborhood megazord fights
  empire godzilla  i keep getting figures of godzilla on the empire state building do you mean the 1998 godzilla 
bandai creations 12 godzilla is my goto godzilla for all my young relatives hes not the coolest looking toy but hes a solid classic godzilla im sure any kid will love originally it was a cheap domestic release now you can only get it imported unfortunately will probably run you 50 with shipping    
  target and best buy sell a large plush godzilla from kidrobot that jiggles when you bounce it or slam it its about 24 tall
  its imperial godzilla
        these are all great thanks bumping for more suggestions just in case
  i second this one you can get a gigan in that scale too and hes just as nice looking
  how big id go with    if you want a 12 or 24 one there is also the movie monsters line that is 6 scale that are soft rubber/vinyl i collect those and they are quite sturdy albeit i dont really play with them just put on display they are sold in japan only now but you can find them online for a good price 15 msrp usually 20 they have been in production for many years but recently theyve been rereleasing older and some newer figures for cheap there are a lot of other godzilla monsters in the line too gigan biollante mothra kiryu etc    here is a link to a few godzilla figures from that line for a decent price via amazoncom my favorite is the millennium godzilla      
  definitely one of my favorite toys growing up he beat the shit out of my inhumanoids in almost every fight
jakks pacific did a really big hollow plastic godzilla for the 2014 movie like three or four feet long from snout to tail thats a goddamn tank i think its gotten fairly expensive in the aftermarket but they may reissue it for king of the monsters next year
  i might get him a little one and get that one next year if hes still in his dinosaur phase
  my brother had that toy when we were kids  im not ashamed to admit that i would use him as a stand in for catwoman when i wanted to have my plush batman get some it was the lipstick what gave me the inspiration to use it as a female
  the movie monster figures arent particularly large but you could probably chuck them violently into a wall and theyd be none worse the wear so theyd definitely be prime candidates for kids the price isnt too bad either
  i liked that he was hollow so he could eat my smaller toys and the limbs pop off so you can get them back out
bumping out of curiosity which one did you end up choosing op seeing parents looking for neat gifts always warms my heart
  i think im going with 12 imperial godzilla i like that its been used abused and enjoyed by several generations of kids now plus a lot of the other toys are collectors items and i dont really want to take one away from a nostalgic adult like me
has anyone here tried this app they appear to have some nice figures toys and goods you can win
  must of spent almost 70 over the course of 6 months playing this stupid game mostly trying to win the nice disney figures    realize i couldve spent less than that buying the figures online    on the plus side i won a pikachu mug and a rilakkuma coffee pot
  i just installed it and got 5 free tries im not skilled at crane games but i love playing them still sucks ive never won one irl
  only play when i get free spins too bad i completely suck at it
    is this similar to the one on otakumode i couldnt even touch one thing with my claw because of a small delay
  i used the free tries and deleted the app its kinda laggy obviously and there are a lot of stipulations on delivery outside of japan from what i understand
my friend played it a lot and won a lot of stuff who knows how much he spent im not going to download it cos it seems like the sort of thing i would get addicted to
the worst feeling is spending a bunch of money trying to win an item and once you cant play anymore someone else wins it next try
i love playing it but became obsessed with trying to win ive spent over 200 on it but ive also won a ton of things shipping is hit and miss large packages obviously take a while but ive gotten prizes 5 days after winning too
so i found a bit of a hack to get free tp fast    you know these spammy looking links that ask you if youre interested in a degree that are 67 tp each as seen here    cont
  theyll take you to a spammy looking site like this thatll ask you to put in an email address you dont have to put in an email or any text at all just click the learn more button and itll give you the 67 tp once you back out
  reported for hacking
  and youll recieve free tp just like that
  is it really hacking though if youre just clicking a button and going back
  thanks senpai it still wont make me win a prize i just wanted to see a crane game live and im already seeing theyre too good
  i tried playing for things like the hedgehog plushes but everything is already wedged into those damn bars i tried picking them up and pushing them in but to no avail i also watched a guy try to get that solar pikachu wobbler wedged diagonally
  ive seen players win these games like crazy and theyve said theyve won only on free plays    my own sister won 2 prizes within a month using free plays i dont know how she did it
  oh i should also mention that those links reload every few days so you can gather a good amount of tp again every few days using that method
so theres going to be a cyber monday announcement for the super7 motuc/filmation motu line very likely santa heman but well see
  yeah hope he comes with skeletors dog
  id buy it just for that
it would be cool if super7 would ever ship my laughing prince adam
  is that you sean
    what if its a filmation skeletor with a smiling head and the dog        itd be a pretty cool exclusive to get that people wouldnt throw a fit over missing but also kinda want like smiling adam
  i got a shipping notice just last friday it took em long enough
  it would more likely be santa heman packed with the dog and smiling skeletor head
super7 is weird    i couldnt find my orders when i signed in apparently they have a separate thing set up when the store has preorders up and that account is different than a regular account or something like why do that
i use to watch that horrible special on vhs for years growing up    i might have to buy this and i dont even collect heman stuff
the big question is just how bad the qc will be on it and what excuses that moron brian will make when people point on the obvious flaws
  i mean i only have like 5 super7 motu figures so far but they all seem to have good qc to me i had some super stiff joints but thats fine
  brace for deception
cant just order the normal heman figure shit from them    fuck them theyve fucked up already
  didnt they had the ultimateultimatethis time is for realisies edition heman on preorder the one with the tan laughing face
  they seem to be doing just fine
  sucks got mine 2 weeks ago
  this is troubling
got my laughing adam finally hips are a hair loose but for a figure thatll stand there and be a meme im happy with him
oh
wouldnt mind getting into motuc but not only is it impossible to find anything but everything thats out there is scalped to fuck wake me up when they rerelease ultimate skeletor and faker
  i need it
  do you have to be in that club or whatever to order this
  i dont believe so orders are going up this monday
    ultimate skeletor and faker were the rereleases that was the whole idea behind the ultimate figures
  literally just a new hat and a candycane power sword  no smiling skelly or alien pupper
  the ultimates were essentially the rereleases  too bad you missed it loser
  absolute fucking garbage lazy low effort trash     they obviously want to clear out the extra stock of their filmation figures so they slapped a santa hat on this guy and gave him a candy cane sword pathetic    this is what people really wanted 
  ollies shopper detected
  its probably not clearing extra stock so much as a quick release to help cover tooling costs after preorders of ultimate filmation heman and skeletor fell a bit flat
not a fan of the super 7 stuff seems so lazy
  while i agree that people wanted a real santa heman the rest of your post is nonsense    there are no leftover figures to get rid of they literally sell out every time they go up also that hat and sword are mass produced in china like everything else theres no dude at the s7 office painting extra swords
  if you actually pay full price for this then you are a fucking moron
  you should be happy to pay 200 aftermarket for super7 highend collectibles    fuck you brian flynn
  i kinda want it but its disappointing theres not even a smiling skeletor head
  its ok for someone who has no heman figure yet i guess
  this is just a lazy greedy sleazy cash run designed to capitalize on existing molds the filmation figures were a bomb and this is their way of trying to recoup their losses    cheap shallow junk
  those hands
unwrapped    is it sad that id rather have the snowko shown on the side panel instead
  the filmation figures were a bomb  proof because nothing would make me happier in regards to motuc figures than to hear this and see them stop making the filmation ones
hemanorg will eat this up because they have mattels dick up their asses and now super7s cock in their mouths    a lot of them are also openly leaning /pol/ now despite the fact theyre jem feminazi fans but if youre going to be a retard you may as well go full retard      filmation figures are like sunbow masterpiece transformers they cost a premium yet look like simplified cheap toys its budget 80s animation with no detail sure people are free to like this and spend a fortune on it im also free to say they waste money on underdetailed crap free speech isnt here to say only your opinion is correct faggot
  youre starting to crust over with all that salt youre coming up with
  the fuck are you so mad about i think the filmation figures are trash and i was hoping to see some proof that its a failed concept
  absolute junk
bought one
manage to snag 14 of these will be selling them for 250 each on the bay if any /toy/ friends want one can help out for 200 each
i was going to buy one for a friend as a christmas gift but he bought one himself
lol sold out in about 28 minutes estimated only about 2500 total
  im earnestly surprised it sold through good on em i guess
    motu fans have to be masochists if the keep overpaying for the same molds and defending a line full of qci
  there really isnt a problem with the qc
this is what we could have had this is what they should have given us instead of the cheap lazy garbage we were given    if you paid a single dime for that super7 trash then i laugh in your face
  hey when you lay around and miss the original release the reissue the evergreen and then ultimate edition too you dont deserve to have boo hoo scalpurz taken seriously mattel and super7 could reissue until the end of time and it still wouldnt be enough for some of you
  me too i didnt expect it to be limited either though
  super7 legitimately sucks under any condition and anyone defending them is clearly an asshole    but you do have a point about people sitting on their hands the funny thing is though judging by the numbers on ebay the vast majority of candy cane adams were purchased by scalpers clearly the general public was like fuck this shit
  not a fan of super7 any more than mattel      judging by the numbers on ebay the vast majority of candy cane adams were purchased by scalpers  the thing about that is that it was limited so its just as likely that scalpers merely got there first by the time i got the link the page was already 404ed so i dont know what the price was but its entirely plausible that both it wouldve sold alright at 35 or whatever and 100 is a nonstarter are true    that saidi think theyll eventually sell for 100 or so if ive learned anything selling toys its that poorfaggotry ends in loony sale prices almost as often as it ends in dead stock when a toy is limited like this was the story just plays out faster than with say transformers wave 1 figures that seem to linger forever only to inexplicably skyrocket anyway    it sucks for people that genuinely wanted it and didnt make the 20 minute window
i love super 7 i made 4000 with their epic battles 2 packs and soon i will make another easy 2500 on these santas
  this makes me sad
  got there first  actually it took over a half hour to sell out
did you preorder your five pack and wind raider
dont forget these guys the evillyn and manatarms arms are supposedly out soon
  my boy scareglow is actually getting something recent  hot damn thats nice
  things that never happened
  i preordered my wind raider back in august and it just got automatically cancelled a few days ago
  im not planning on getting that 5pack as those figures were listed to be in the castle grayskull set and id probably go for that really hoping everything works out for these releases loving the mega construx motu and i dont have any yet because they never showed up where i am
  i honestly find the gift wrap more interesting than the toy
  castle grayskull set  i havent seen any listing for the castle grayskull set just that it was stated that one was in the works its highly unlikely that theyd make those five figures the ones in the set though
lol snagged another 10 today any /toy/ bros want one i can hook you up for 200 can post link to my ebay store if any one wants one i dont mind giving back to the community
forgot to mention thats in aussie dollars
how much did super7 sell for
  uhhh what are you referring to
i find it hard to believe not one of you wants one of these badboys i have/will have
  i mean apparently a lot of people did want it i think its pretty weak compared to what could have happened but thats fine
  let super7 lose the license if theyre too stupid to understand that limited stocks only results in scalpers making all the money as theres no alternative for people to buy x and y figure from super 7    basically fuck em
  how are they going to lose the licence
snake mountain kickstarter to be announced and begin next week stay tuned
have friends and family ever become so worried about your toy buying addiction that they had to intervene to save your sanity and bank account
  have you ever posted a photo that actually fit what your text was describing  being a cucked pops collector
  have you ever posted a photo that actually fit what your text was describing    i just did
thanks for stealing the image i posted on /tv/ like ten minutes ago
  based  
  quite disappointed he lacks the soi
  how autistic do you have to be to buy even one fucko pop
  fucking manlet his wife is taller than he is
  ill be honest its about what i pictured when you look at the op
  stealing  yeah youre literally the first person to ever post this image thats been floating around this board for months    admitting to posting on /tv/  oh i get it now youre just retarded
oh look its this thread again
gtfo statueshit
  well be seeing a lot more of them once the split is complete
  disappointed that hes hardly as soicore as ops image makes him out to be he seems like a decent guy just a very massive edrone
30/week on pops  even this is excessive desu
  no but i worry myself and try to watch it anyway i dont need 100 spent on vices my brain just wants that skinner box fix so i try and fight it     no more autistic than any toy hobby really a figure art or full statue has about the same impact of lost finances to say you have a idol of something you care about
  agreed but have you seen what some anons spend here in general even if the money is there for it blowing 1k a month on plastic waste will always be absurd where it be some revolutech or better quality or a pop in the end they all melt down into plastic and have no vaule beyond taking space and collecting dust
  i wish i had received a 30 allowance when i was a child
  man i would proper go for a churchill pop
  timeline is nothing but retweeting funko giveaways
  i wish my friends and family intervened by giving me a noose
thankfully not   a couple years ago sure would spend close to 1000/month on figures and statueshit with my own money and my parents would see my credit card statements but since then theyve seen me sell off the figures i dont have interest for anymore and ive gotten a higher paying job so now they dont care  actually theyve recently bought a display case for me so theyre supportive    my so is supportive and thinks its awesome too but whenever he asks how much the figures/statues cost i always lie lmao
    hahahahaha this man is a walking meme
my mum was pretty shocked i spent around 60 on a digivolving spirits wargreymon but not concerned or anything    im on a pretty decent wage so i earned enough to afford it in a day anyway
  never understood this anyone who doesnt share my views eats a bean product meme but then again miloanon and other cuntservatives are shit at telling jokes or acknowledging facts just like their racist hero bill hicks wasnt funny either    i guess because they drink semen they think they consume real protein or some shit and anyone not dumb enough to believe in their fake deity hate people who dont look like them etc must consume certain foods if only they put that much effort into being an actual threat they could just wipe out what they hate instead of fucking crying about it like a bunch of children 24/7 but they aint got the backbone for a real war they dont have sex with women because theyre already so pussified they dont need more vaginal exposure yet are okay with kavanaugh and trump raping women     they see music piracy as a worse crime than rape thats how dumb fuck these people are and why they warrant removing the rights they waste    ill take solo over milo any day miloanon that man scareer is fuckign dead stop evoking his name ever 5 seconds when someoen bases conservatives also ghost  megadeth you musicallyillierate waste of flesh real metal worships the devil dave mustaine needs to get the fuck out of the genre instead of demanding it change to appease his feelings now go fuck yourself instead of raping a child
  its a meme to want an emoji that looks like you when the gingers of all people got catered for
  maybe people assumed he would be the type to take pictures of himself open mouthed infront of his funko collection to find out he looks quite normal for someone who needs a written contract to limit his toy purchases understandable comes as a disappointment to come
cmon guys stop reposting my tweets cant a bald dude get some love on the internet
thankfully that hasnt happened yet though my mother did get annoyed for seeing me drop 120 euros in pic related that could have been used to get something useful instead
  punch her in the cunt and remind her of all the brave astronauts who lost their lives fighting on the moon
  no but i got married recently and my toy purchasing has simply slowed down because i spend less time by myself than i used to when we lived apart i cant really complain i just find myself enjoying the ones i already own even more
whos ready i imagine theyll be prototypes but i cant fucking wait
  last blurry image  mmegalon  let me dream
they had better not be godzilla repaints
  either that or titanosaurus    or a godzilla repaint
i expect the big four from the 2019 movie
    theyve pretty much confirmed its the 2019 monsterverse kaiju if you click on any of those images it plays the clair de lune rendition from the kotm trailer
were never getting a monsterarts hedorah 
  heh well no offense but im not beating myself up over that im just stoked when gamera finally releases
  bummer
  cant say im upset i like the designs and itll be nice to get a ghidorah that isnt crazy expensive since i missed out on the earlier runs
  when    m80 hes out        not an official website or source
  dont you dare get my hopes up like that
unofficialofficial
    so whats the source of ops image
  coming soonmore repaints and repaints of repaints and store exclusive repaints and tamashii web exclusive super saiyan x10 repaints with pre order bonus
  no figuarts megalon  no jet jaguar  no cookie monster godzilla  its like bandai hates my money
  a fansite based on the line shm is confirmed to appear at tokyo comic con on saturday though after the panel for 2019 kotm so thats why they have that set up on the site presumably its for the four kotm kaiju
  supposedly a new trailer then do    as much as iike them hiding the designs i got sick of having blue balls after the 2014 film
  yeah i understood it with the mutos cause they were new designs but this time around its just redesigns of classic monsters so id prefer if we got to see em a bit beforehand
  the line is no longer viable its just a sluggish mess of a line now well be lucky if they ever do anything past this new us movie
  eh even if thats true theyve done just about every monster im interested in itd be a shame if it does die off but if not at least i can be grateful that i never really had a dream monster that never got made any of the ones i would even consider as a request probs wouldnt even get one anyways
  the line is no longer viable  what went wrong
  not that anon but  lack of accessories  high price  too many unneeded repaints and reprints  too much focus on heisei not that heisei is bad but there are good showa and millenium choices too  common paint application issues where there shouldnt be any  i dont buy monsterarts anymore i got one a godzilla 2002 figure and youd think with such little paint there shouldnt be any issues right no they screwed up the eyes the most important part to get correct what a waste
i regret not picking up rodan when i saw him
  line got taken over by a 23 year old who loves heisei best
  too much focus on heisei  wasnt that because the guy in charge of the line had a huge hard on for it do to growing up with it
i have some various kaiju vinyls from the late 90s to early 00s anywhere i can find prices online lost my job and need cash and trying not to get hosed or ask for too much
  try ebay for an approx price which ones are they
  his head is fucking miniscule but he looks fine otherwise
  throws 2014 goji into the trash
fight me in the water sky wont save you this time
look at this slut
sure is hot in here
look at him you fucks
no more for tonight
  wrong
  its going to take a while for me to like this design it barely feels like mothra anymore
  hows this
  unironically love this rendition already get that fluffy heisei shit outta here
  hey its king ghidorah    hey its rodan    hey itserm well two out of three aint bad
  you barely feel like mothra
i wonder how much ghidorah will cost me
  he looks ok but wasnt rodan suppose to have fire cracking through his body guess thats going to be his second toy
  looks like piece of beef jerky
  i read he catches ablaze due to the speeds he flies not generating it himself
  dem sexy leigs
  ey yo where the fuzzy feelers fuckers    tell im stevedave
  pterosaur literally too angry to die  better be a good guy again
  based on what an anon who saw a test screening months back it seems like rodan is more neutral he doesnt care about what happens he cares more about being able to fly again which causes untold destruction
  he doesnt care about what happens he cares more about being able to fly again which causes untold destruction  i can respect that
  dude rodan my dude  just fly and never look back you glorious flaming fuck
  he would but apparently he wants to see how bad ass goji really is as well as having a sort of rivalry with mothra
  looks ok this is looking to be the best rodan weve gotten since 1956
    holy fucking shit that is an incredible design
  the wings are so massive its honestly ridiculous
  whats wrong with fire rodan
  oh my gosh king ghidorah looks great they nailed rodan and i love the new mothra look godzilla still looks good too cant wait for this movie now i just wait for the 6 vinyls
  this is ridiculous dang
      looks like shit
    western chaddora shitting on decades of japanese design thats how you make a spacedragon
  that cloverfield monster designer did this didnt he
  why does he have feathers in this image
  its actually ridiculous how well they pulled this off i didnt necesarily have a huge problem with the wyvern look i expected but im shocked they managed to still work in his proper wing design to an extent
  difference of opinion   mothras always been my 2nd favorite but i never really felt she had a strong design always liked her just due to the contrast she presents between her and godzilla along with a nice aesthetic and great music   really like this design feels elegant and fantastical
  no to mention finally has something to actually articulate     the old mothra figures were statues
  the old mothras in general werent very articulate ill always admire the work done on her in mothra 61 and vs godzilla the puppetrywork is a sight to see and fun as hell to watch but they really dropped the ball the more appearances she had until heisei era where her wings were stiff as hell and she was a glorified plush toy     it got better in the millennium era but i think this might be peak mothra for me
when are we getting best boy  or at least his kk vs godzilla version   fuck ill even take a reissue of 05 at this point
    quite pretty but i hope it doesnt actually need those two stands to hold up the wings also does anyone else want at least one joint in the wings so that it can fold them up
  its an unfinished prototype they arent done integrating engineering yet
  is there a source for that godzilla and mothra could pass for done
  maybe they are but ghidora doesnt even have leg joints yet were talking about a company that just spent months showing off an unfinished broly shf
    okay you gigacasuals plenty of alternate angles here im only posting one
  wings look like cooling lava  neat
  you can literally see they havent even done things like knee articulation in the photo
  what a qt
  concept art
  sexy
screening leaks said mothra has a hidden stinger that she uses to fight rodan so im cool with the more aggressive looking design its kind of a radical departure but she cant be a big fluffy snuggle bug when matched up against these guys
  is it bad i want to fuck that ghidrah
  my dick is diamonds
    ill wait for the inevitable blue spine and breath effect release
love the new ghidorah and rodan designs    kinda iffy on mothra like the wings but its gonna take a bit to get used to the massively changed body
  someone on this board thinks 56 rodan was better than both fire rodan and final wars
  someone on any board actually fucking likes the garbage heisei redesign   fire rodan turned the guy from something that rivaled godzilla in strength into a fucking midget chicken head duckfaced faggot and ill never understand how anyone can actually think its cool
  i cant wait for the porn it will be amazing
  fuck off you /co/mblr reject
  i get not liking the shows designs as a whole but rodans showa design from his original movie was fantastic it aged very gracefully particularly the head
  aw baby learned a new word and wants to show it off to everyone
i think rodan walked out of this the best i cant say i like the changes to ghidorah giving him straight up lizarddragon scales instead of the more stylized scales he usually has really makes him look a lot less outlandish and less intimidating now he just looks like any other dragon from a dragonheart or game of thrones spinoff to me and mothra well i figured this was what they were going to do
  dont get me wrong i dont hate every showa design and i like rodans og one a lot i just like hesei and millennium more
wow i fucking love the new rodan i hope the shma isnt like 200 bucks
  i hope the shma isnt like 200 bucks
    would be mad chuffed if rodan in this tanked big gs breath weapon no problem like he dives right through it and knocks him on his ass    sounds like they took some inspiration from battra which is basically a more militant version of her
  his wings have the texture of hardened lava flows in these images pretty cool since he comes from a volcano         given the way he looks like hes covered in cooled lava maybe when he gets more active and flies the cooled parts crack and he flares up       this design is everything i could have hoped for he can still spread his wings out in the classic pose but he doesnt have that weird fish fin effect where the spines meet the body separately plus he has much better legs now as much as i love classic ghidorah his legs are so fat and he looks like a cylinder       look at that wingspan no cost too high
    moth pussy
  looks like a flea with wings
found this checklist lying around one of my folders does a kind anon have a more recent version is it worth updating such an old list myself      with the amount of real estate it appears to be taking up i will be shocked if its less than 300
  looks like the cloverfield guy cant go one movie without jamming that same sort of monster into it
  the cooled parts probably crack and break off revealing the feathers from the concept art
yeah id fuck this new rodan
looks like godzilla might have a breath effect
  recycled from the spitfire version
  its longer
  thats what mothra said
  thanks for the link
  nah it just doubles as a water fountain
  wouldnt be too upset by that looks nice and its better than no breath at all     also these are the best closeup shots ive seen 
really would have liked a hinge joint here to fold the wings in more to have on shelf space pity he dosnt seek to have any joints in the knees or ankles but i guess the weight of the figure wouldnt allow it though they could have used ratchets
  more like going back to the prototype
  actually it looks like his ankles appear articulated look at the sculpt it separates at that point between the top of the heel and the bottom of the shin ive seen this done in different figures with digitigrade legs they give articulation to the hips and ankle only ex halo elites jurassic park dino showdown allosaurus
  its not finished thats just a test prototype
  they look about the same
  no stupid tiny feet and dont looks fat  great now it need a long snout
  honestly it just looks like the original figure with remolded feet spikes and head
  it does use g14s body
  id lick those feet sure
  ghidorahs gotta be a 300 figure jesus
  i can already mentally picture someone putting bane heads on ghidorah just for hes a big guy yous
im gonna have to see how necas offerings compare
  couldnt you just look at some broken plastic now and save yourself some time
  neat choice neca branching off from just godzilla is good im waiting for the bandai and xplus stuff
  im guessing ghidorah will have alternate wings to walk like a wyvern dragon
  i was thinking the same thing
  yes it was    kaaaaaaawaaaaaaaakiiiiiiiiiitaaaaaaaaaaaa1
wonder how much rodan will be    im not expecting much from the vinyl figure iirc servum and anime ghidorah didnt even come with stands
  couldnt you just drown yourself in a toilet to save us from reading your posts
  not cute enough
  its a necanon gets angry at anyone who knows about necas qc faults episode    is this a rerun or a clip show
  i am hoping hes a bundle with mothra     mothra should not be sold individually at that size
  not articulated enough
fuck this design fuck this design
  this is elegance you degenerate
ma leo in all his fantastic forms never
  all the porn will make her a leggy moth
  not my mothra
    fuck this hornet shit fuck western designers fuck you for ruining mothra
  eh makes sense to me the smaller body is more aerodynamic than the more massive classic designs plus small bugs with proportionally small wings like actual bees and wasps have light weight thin exoskeletons a kaiju moth would benefit from a compact but sturdy body
  a kaiju with chainsaw chickens anorexic looking already hornet mutos godlen three headed dragons giant turtles friend to children would benefit from anorexic moths    fuck off
  there are actual moths that look like this just fyi
  thats awesome
      stop whining how the fuck were they gonna make  into a formidable creature when its going up against the new rodan and kg this isnt clumsy suit actors and puppets anymore    it looks like a fucking stuffed animal for children and its always moved like one too now it has actual legs and arms and a head so it can actually move around in a convincing manner
  someone hasnt watched the rebirth of mothra movies  leo could actually kick gojis ass
  show me a good mothra aesthetic that fits this new movie
  theres plenty of fan art concept like this that look better than that thing
  aww cute yet menacing
  now if we could get a layers of white version of mothra id be sold
  thats just a drawing and it still looks like like a kids show character     having tiny ass little legs means it wont be able to grapple that was all well and good in the days where they just smashed suits and puppets together for fight scenes but this is modern cg mothra and rodan are going to throw down physically and in midair
  then  would be the best case
  how the fuck were they gonna make  into a formidable creature when its going up against the new rodan and kg
    it looks like a fucking stuffed animal for children  implying thats a bad thing  you arent a real fan right
people in here still crying over mothra   probably my favorite redesign out of the kaiju shown at the panel aside from the big guy himself     so glad they didnt go with something like the heisei design what a garbage looking mothra   overly fluffy  stiff af wings   chubby cheeks looks like a big oaf     ill always like the original showa design best but this is a very close second
  being tonedeaf    this is not the movie for a cornyass mothra
  and it still looks like like a kids show character    this is not the movie for a cornyass mothra
herpaderp my big bad dinosaur should be super serious like man of steel and not have fluffy cute moths but child abuse victim billie 13 from stranger danger    nice try jose
  every other monster gets a grimdark overhaul to reflect a serious tone and devastation of the film    reeeeeeeeeeeee where is my fluffy cute mothra
  serious tone  literal meme actors front lining the film
  i choose you beedrill also nice way of removing white monsters with literal mutt designs
  fish moth  elegance
  waaaah i dont like this actor because of some completely unrelated series    who cares watch the first trailer again and tell me where she is involved in any lighthearted meming       maybe they plan to have mothra be a real force and not some supporting jobber who gets fucking nuked they already confirmed extra abilities that she didnt have in any previous movie
  instead of posting actual quality anime its a knock off waifu    typical
  herpaderp lets rework an original design instead of making something new like the mutos because we lack creativity this time around and cant rely on new ideas selling and should kill everything good with shitted up colors of originally white monsters    nice try hollywood
  i just want mothra to look like mothra not some ugly wasp looking thing
  waaaaaahhh not muh mothra  how dare you take liberties with your own movie    so are you gonna be a little bitch and hope the monsterverse fails or something because hollywood is literally all this franchise has got now
billie 13s mom is an eco terrorist and distracts ghidorah to redeem her antifa destructive way of purging the population like thanos did with a snap of his fingers this gives fatzilla enough time to sucker punch a literal god and billie is happy that the audience got to clap over a bunch of cgi your welcome
  maybe hollywood should adapt chutulu instead of outsourcing their mythology theres so much they ignore in favour of cheaper knock offs made for children
    sounds about as deep as any other godzilla plotline
  shin godzilla was much better and hollywood knows this
  sounds really good
    it was ok the core of the movie was just a boring critique of japanese politics and redtape    the movie has nowhere to go besides fucking bizzaroworld because it wrote itself into a corner with the multiplying mini evamonsters
  mothra is usually a jobber and i hope that this movie changes that
  shin godzilla was much better
  and pacific rim1 was much better than any kaiju movie in years including shin look at the anime godzilla trash that japan is shitting out right now    hollywood will save the kaiju genre
  pacific rim 2 wasnt as good as first one though
  it was gloppy diarrhea in fact pacific rim 2 just doesnt exist honestly someday well get a real sequel
  pacific rim was fucking garbage on every level
  original  plenty of cool monsters and ultraviolence  competent battlescenes with actual kills and stakes instead of monster wwe  the majority of the movie wasnt focused on boring ass humans  didnt take itself too seriously    i really dont see the problem and beyond that i challenge you to name better kaiju movies made in the last 5 years hell last decade
  not him i like pacific rim it was fun shame about the sequel though    but to name better kaiju movies made in the last 510 years id say shin godzilla by far shin godzilla did so many cool things i can gush about forever but this is a /toy/ board so i wont   and i also liked monsters and colossal but those are more character driven things i guess the focus isnt so much on the monsters although kaiju are important to the plots of those movies
is there a piece like thus but with 4 holes
how would that work exactly
    1x1 brick with studs on four sides      nicknamed the dalek in the uk these are fantastic for creating small columns as they let you point plates out in four directions overlap them and you have eight directions
op your dick is way too small to fit in that try your sister
  nah hers is too big
  can confirm this too
i wanna sell a body pillow with this on it

hey /toy/ i need some help a while ago i got a storm collectibles heihachi from the bluefin website after it arrived i found that one of the arms pops off easily at the bicep i emailed them and they agreed to send out a replacement and charged me about 8 for the shipping its been over a month now and the tracking status has been stuck on pending ive emailed them about it twice now but no response i went back on their site and wasnt it able to sign in and it says my account may have been disabled help guys what else can i do has anyone else here done business with them before
  messing with the bluefin zaibatsu  consider yourself lucky that you still have your life and your action figure punk
  post some pics  i bought heihachi for 35 and the sdcc shin akuma for 70 nothing wrong with mine
  you wont see any qc issues visually the only problem is that the left arm pops off way too easily its because the elbow joint goes too deep into the bicep piece making the peg hole for the shoulder too shallow
i wish kazuya came out already
  look wish all you want but kazuyas straight
  how are the prices relevant lmao
  other sites have heihachi for 65 and sdcc shin akuma is over 100  drops the mic
  and what the fuck does that have to do with anything in this thread pick your fucking fedora back up you idiot
  shut up and take my money  you got ripped off you dumb fuck
   the mic  you need to be over 18 to post here
  no shit but thanks for the tip
    only the tip
  just the tip
knowingly bought a bootleg sh figuarts thanos   it was way cheaper than normal retail so wth  how fucked am i
  theres a bootleg thread buddy
  as long as you dont ded from anything its made from looks considerably better than most the versions we have gotten  hes thinner than normal but neat
  do you always throw away money first and only ask if it was a good idea afterwards
  ko thanos is actually really good aside from paint splotches on his face
  movie toy  bootleg movie toy
  normie anime picture   into the trash your opinion goes
  this flustered over internet culture memes  browsing the internet    back to redit with you
  on 4chan  mentioning reddit    back to 9gag with you
  lol i mentioned 9gag i totally look like an oldfag now right  embarassing
  imagine being this fucking retard weeb    hahahahahahhahahahaahahahhahahah
  itll have the quality of a marvel legends so price wise youre ok still waiting on mine for 2 months now these tariffs are sure making it hard for chinese bootlegger to ship stuff
depends on how much you paid for it if you paid more than 20 id say you overpaid modern shf bootlegs are surprisingly solid  pretty much a more sloppilypainted version of the real thing rather than the brittle messes bootlegs were 510 years ago
  it arrived  tried to swap heads  success  tried to swap hands  ball peg breaks instantly   mfw i spent 3 hours doing the metal pin fix to reattach the ball peg now basically a fixed hand   was fucked in the end
what are these
seriously what the fuck are these
looks like kinder can i have them serious
  only if you have something equally rad to trade
  nope mine are cooler they have good articulation and i like the fox girls big boobies
  are there any marking mpg ff
bumping because im genuinely curious to know what the fuck the figures in op are they look oddly charming
  they must be kinder    op place a battery next to them
help me to identify my toy frens    i dont have a picture but it was some kind of a duck with a hat and an eyepatch it also had four arms i suppose

my shf hazard arrived its almost perfect save for a nub mark on the side of his head i might have to get another one when its sold as a regular pbandai just to have a perfect one i dont mind displaying two since one can be the hawk gatling mode    anyone else got him its a great toy really dont know why bandai decided he was going to be super limited cross z charge is shelf warming hard where i am while prices for cross z himself is skyrocketing i managed to sell of my extra used one for a good profit these are great toys but the choice of release is weird    hazard could easily have sold a lot more as a regular release
  a lot of bandais choices for figuarts releases seem weird to me we should always get base forms final forms and mc bikes as regular release there should be a couple midseason/upgrade forms and enemy characters as regular release as well but certainly not all and certainly not instead of base or final whatever else they want to make can be pbandai  i wonder if there are sometimes communication issues between show production staff and bandai say like filming changes for a certain suit resulting i bandai making a figure of something that doesnt really have any important scenes but would have had plans not changed
  to add to this i wonder what kind of numbers they sell on a popular suit design that is pbandai intentionally hyping a certain form in the show only to make it exclusive could net bandai some good profits
  i cant believe both grease and rogue were pbandai they were such popular characters/suits i only collect one figuarts per character just their base forms so that i can have the cast assembled i feel like upgrades should be pbandai since they arent as necessary in rounding out a display
  mc bikes being an exclusive i understand not everyone wants to pay that much for a bike versus a character hazard is a form that even people who dont watch the show get hyped about though and if your secondary riders 2nd form is regular why make the allblack sleekest form upgrade for your main rider an exclusive     i get that they might be trying to bait people with how build is a regular release then expecting people to order cross z then getting cz charge and getting baited into ordering sparkling but man even visually it should be a no brainer considering just how good and eye catching cross z looks compared to charge    its frustrating because build shf is full of great releases yet theyve all mostly been p bandai save for three releases build night rogue and cross z charge
  something that occurred to me too is the pacing of the show wanting to have releases as it progresses and not wanting to spoil the show that would explain a few of the odd choices at least for example imo night rogue should have been pbandai rogue regular but rogue didnt happen until way later and they needed a 2nd regular release to go with rabbit/tank crossz wasnt a thing until a bit later
  the production team could have coordinated with figuarts to choose blood stalk as the retail release instead of night rogue in this instance honestly i see this as them kind of forcing the change so that people buy directly from them so they make more money than selling through distributors like apple removing the headphone jack from the iphone 7 so you have to use their wireless earbuds its obviously not a good idea or whats best for the customer but it benefits them the most cant say for sure but thats what it feels like im more pissed about not having the drill crusher to be honest i want all my riders to have their accompanying weapons and now neither zi o nor geiz come with their weapons which are way cooler and more desireable than the drill crusher and geiz is full price not even a discount release like zi o and he still doesnt come with his weapon and we still dont know how theyre going to release their weapons like are you going to have to buy 2 seperate accessory packs like zi os sword comes with the bike and geiz axe comes with the time mazine or something hoping to keep purchases conservative next year so i wish i had more info
    t someone that wasnt here during ghost  the base form second rider bike and early season were all shelfwarmers and an absolute bomb of a toyline i can understand why bandai wants to be more cautious after taking a huge hit like that
  i was watching it as it aired and youre right but ghost was the shittiest rider season ever imo easy to see why folks werent interested
  it really just needs a couple of good seasons in a row to build up that confidence again they did experiment by putting out the fan favourite gold drive as a regular release during ghost but that didnt sell well at all  with exaid and build doing so well and i think zio is chugging along pretty alright merch wise too i think we might see them be more generous with the releases in the future its the double whammy that a bad rider season gives us its shitty to watch and no one bothers buying the merch which in turn causes bandai to tighten up on releases with the next show
  theyre changing the business model completely and putting out a fuckton of releases more kr figuarts being sold now than ever before its been 4 years since ghost
  i mean more releases as in general figures of current season shows though having the early supers of build zio and genm geiz is a promising sign even as exclusives  but the practice of selling most of the figures as post show exclusives has been the practice since gaim which was in response to so many wizard figures bombing on the shelves
have you ever felt like you have too much stuff  i have about 6 belts now and i find myself asking why am i doing this
  you can always just sell what you dont really want/have space for anymore just in the future only get stuff you really actually want
      ghost shitty designs shitty first two eps i mean really ghost and exaid the designs alone were already taking a huge risk before you ask anyone what they thought of the series/plot/story they really had that one coming their way    lets say shitty or not shitty thats subjective but a rider design that looks that different and unlike a rider blasting it off with such huge releases was really reckless i hate that a series like build where the suits clearly were a throwback to older more traditional designs was the one that had to take the brunt of ghost and exaid what were they thinking with those two in a row
  shitty designs  say what you want about the quality of the rest of the show but the base suit designs for ghost and specter are great
  this
  ghost was the shittiest rider season ever imo  t someone who hasnt watched decade
  loved decade go ahead and put more words in my mouth youll be wrong
  t someone that doesnt know shit about how opinions work
saying decade was a bad show your opinion doesnt mean shit in this discussion because it was extremely popular and continues to be a fan favorite even kivala got a regular release
  remember when kivala got announced and people thought it meant kiva was getting a release soon after only for shfss decade to be announced     that was a fun time
  decade had a trash story but decade himself was worth watching and an absolute unit
i wonder how close you could get to kitbashing a genm level 0 from a genm level 2 and a cronus
zioh gimmicks and design choices feel so bland and lacking of charisma i dunno it is just they throwing armor and stuff for older kamen riders the another are really interesting tho
  well likely continue to get the armors  if we do get anothers it will probably just be major arc villains  if the greeds and zodiarts hadnt shelf warmed we would have gotten multiple
  that corny spidergwen hoodie looking design for a kamen rider show themed on ghosts and yokais it definitely is a shit design for a potentially super cool theme that is just an opinion of mine though    however the sales arent good for ghost in nearly every toy category i can still get ghost toys for a bargain these days
  based trips
  theres already a lvl 0 genm
  just use level 2 and paint the lines silver
  geiz and zio have the same bike   the bike was at tamashii nations
  how retarded do you have to be to fuck up two figures to make one that is readily available
  not only that level 0 is like half the price of a level 2
  of course there is a level 0 genm i just posted it      just for funsies
  yea but why are we going to get toys of the actual another riders hell ill settle for some vinyls if that means i can get all of them
  ghost was the shittiest rider season ever imo  thats decade the worst thing about ghost is wasted potential the worst thing about decade is everything that isnt the main rider         cringe
  because it was extremely popular and continues to be a fan favorite  its not even in the top 10 dude
  decade not in the top 10
  just buy the sics
  thats decade    nah wizard and ghost have it on a coin toss     ghost was just utter shit while wizard was incredibly forgettable to the point people have actually forgot how bad it was
  wizard  even coming close to worst rider series  imagine being this retarded
          take it to /krg/
  krg autist has shown up now  you fuck off if you dont like it
  this
  its autism to not want /krg/ discussion to derail this thread  you fuck off
  it is autism to try to stop people from having ontopic discussion in a thread so you fuck right off with your krg hissy fit little guy
im sorry i get triggered when someone says that anything is worse than decade
  newfag this thread is for talking about toys not a debate about which show is the worst
  no other thread gets their diapers in a twist when the source material the toys are based on is discussed this is literally the only one and im not going to let some autist stop me from having discussion related to the media on which these toys are based
  well if you werent such an obvious newfag youd already know how things work here and that derailing this thread for debates isnt what its for theres literally an entire other board for discussing just the show and a thread there dedicated to it youre the autist for trying to start shit here in the first place theres a difference between talking about a show and trying to get into a multiple post debate about it and if you werent so socially retarded youd know the difference
  attempting to have an ontopic discussion is trying to start shit  jesus christ and youre calling me socially retarded when you dont even understand what context is
  its not on topic you mongoloid this isnt a thread for talking about the shows its a thread for the toys jesus christ why dont you even want to go to the /krg/ to talk about this its not like the posters there will tell you to take it to /toku/ they will actually have that debate you so desperately want
  people in these threads obviously have an interest in the media these toys represent so why bother going somewhere else just to please on crybaby who throws a fit any time someone says something not explicitly related to plastic gimmicks with his same canned reply youre the one derailing this thread with your take it to /krg/ nonsense
  not that anon but no this thread is about the toys how good a show is should not dictate what figures we should buy i own a figuarts tajador and have yet to watch an episode of ooos its been standard practice in these threads to direct any deep show discussion to at least /m/ i would not tell anyone to ever voluntarily enter into that cesspool known as /krg/
        complains about how discussing a toys source material derails the thread  doesnt realize that his complaining is doing the derailing    oh the irony
  yeah it doesnt come close because it is the worst rider series
lets just ignore the bait
show shittiness  discussing why we didnt buy the toys its a nobrainer   trying to get people to post in that shitshow /krg/  thats a big yikes from me famalam 
its perfectly fine to base your purchases on things you like and not buy things related to shows you dont like   its also perfectly fine to like a rider show other people believe to be garbage ultimately on a scale of tv shows from worst to best all rider shows are garbage kiddie shit compared to normie shit like house of cards or sopranos as far as average people are concerned so you disagree on what shows are the best what suit designs and what toys are the best thats okay   the minute you start thinking you are better than someone else say because you think kuuga is better than than decade you have become the autism
  i dont like the selfdepreciating angle to this perspectivekamen rider is kiddie stuff so who even cares to weigh the merit of the series but i dont think that was this anons point to be fair i just feel like you ought to be humble and accept that theres a million different reasons to like something account for nuance in opinions ex aid is my favorite rider but im not even that crazy about his show in comparison to the rest ive seen since ex aid got me into kr if someone asks who people who their favorite riders are and i say ex aid its not in spite of better kamen riders or whatever its totally dependent on my unique relationship with the series also normies are boring cucks thats why i come on here lol
  i stopped going to /krg/ when i realized it was pretty much all fags
  kamen rider is kiddie stuff so who even cares to weigh the merit of the series  is not the same as   all rider shows are garbage kiddie shit compared to normie shit like house of cards or sopranos as far as average people are concerned  as far as average people are concerned  clearly those people dont come here just trying to put some perspective on those faggots that think their favorite particular flavor of kid show is more sophisticated than your favorite   yes there are many nuanced differences thats why i say its okay to like what you like  i think we can all agree though that power rangers totally sucks compared to any rider or sentai show 
  to add to this there is no selfdepreciation i dont make excuses for what i do or like there is not enough time to worry about stupid shit like that
  rocco from mega64 likes pr so i hold a candle for the possibility of valid pr fandom but idk shit confuses me like you think theyd at least also be interested in sentai or kr i love godzilla ultraman and kamen rider and i think sentai has a lot of really cool aspects too but from what ive seen most pr fans are only into pr just weird to me at least they have their own general i guess
  good to hear my dude being so insecure that you have to resort to liking things ironically is totally cancerous
  agreed on all points i think for pr fans a lot of it is nostalgia and having little to no interest in japanese language or culture like the only anime they watch is dubbed
got my ultimate kuuga today and the top of its double elbow joint is stuck and doesnt bend what can i do to fix this
  run the elbow under hot water until it gets a little pliable then try moving it only in the direction the join bends
  the bicep swivels on my ss accel was stuck around there and finally gave but flaked off some of the red finish when it did i dont think kuuga being all black should have that problem but ve careful all the same i thought accels arms might snap before theyd give even a bit and it was nerveracking
hey anons    bought my first driver new to toku and belts in general where can i buy one of those belt extenders the official one that came with my meteor driver is way too small
  can it safely take off the arm for kuuga or will i need to hold the whole figure
  i would hold the whole figure water wont hurt anything and it wont take more than a minute just hold the elbow directly under the stream
  amazon has them for a damn good price atm    besides that you can sometimes find them in stock at cstoys but not right now on ebay or you can order them from bandai with a middleman
    here is the official listing on pbandai  
grateful is getting an sg ride watch  oh god so theyre actually opening the floodgates and having just any form be possible i swear if they do a second campaign to get dangerous zombie genm instead of a legit release ill go insane how are the candy toy watches anyway are they a huge downgrade from dx or kinda acceptable
  amaaaaazing i love ryuki/dragon knight my favourite shodo wave in a long time dont really need blank but i can see them wanting to have some reuse could have been ryuga though
so aside from ultraman jack zoffy and seven how many of the showa ultraman have shfs
  they arent that bad aside from weird button placement and lack of a rotation gimmick theyre better than past series offerings simply for the mode change feature that lets it run sounds with the belt like a dx watch the speaker is kind of weak on my rogue watch but im not sure if thats a universal problem
  there arent really that many more than the ones you listed ace taro and 80 are the only main showa ultras they havent done yet
  i mean tajador is in the actual fucking show anything goes
    oh wow forgot i was dealing with bandai here    arent there third party belt extensions
  arent there third party belt extensions  the one in the amazon link is a third party one
  yea its called just buy a fucking belt and mod it yourself   cheaper and nicer than the shitty bandai extender
  ihow did you do that i have the meteor driver and i dont see how i could strap a belt through it
  this was my build driver   buy a real belt  size it  fold it in half  cut then  open up the belt  make holes for it  fit it and seal it up    ta da
  forgot final result   fits fine and looks way better to me
  nicer than the shitty bandai extender  people unironically believe this  kill yourselves luggage straps look like dogshit
i kinda want to collect the exaid weapons should i or am i just a stupid idiot
  thinking thats a luggage strap    anon its a normal fucking belt almost you dipfuck
  theyre pretty sweet if youre into that asthetic theyre all compatible with gashats and have a couple of sounds in each of them plus if youre including the bugvisors as weapons then youre also getting some belts for your trouble too
  depends which you like most  i have the gashacon magnum keyslasher and parablaygun and theyre solid and fun to play around with   you always gotta accept theyll be smaller than in the show tho
as display pieces go the dizer is really nice ive only got two tiers fully filled while i wait for the gaim kuuga w and decade watches but im far more impressed with this than i was with the panels for build or the remolded case for gashats
  lately the universe seems to be telling me to get off my fucking ass and watch ryuki already
  seems the joint is just stiff is there any kind of lubricant i can use that wont kill the plastic or paint
  looks like shit bro  it doesnt even fit the width of the orginial belt
  blank form  oohhhh
  mine was the same until i popped its cherry warm it first bro
  wow how original yet wrong
  i want to see you try this at the star wars or marvel general and report back to see if you got reported/banned or not
my stupid shf hazard came with a small circular nub/extra paint on the side of his head    seriously bandai event exclusive supposed premium and all black toy and you can still manage to fuck up the paint fuck this shit
  hazard
  gamers rise up
  why cant i buy them on the english site i hate bandai so much
  the real question is why do you want to buy a useless noisemaker that will hold importance for you for maybe 6 or so more months before you either throw them in a drawer somewhere or try to off load them on bst
  because japan only youre a fool if you honestly thought theyd sell rider shit on the english pbandai sites
  youre a fool if you honestly thought theyd sell rider shit on the english pbandai sites  they do but unfortunately its just watches and clothing
  its easier just to get those velcro stickers and those elastic waist bands for sewing  stick the male velcro on the waist bands and then the female velcro on the actual plastic belt end do that on both sides and your golden you dont need to use a big piece of the elastic it just serves as a tiny extender     works much better than the piece of shit bandai ones the velcro stickers are also super easy to remove and dont leave any residue    i dont really bother with this any more though did it with a first few dx belts i bought out of curiosity
  thats before it was cut you tard   if youd keep scrolling youd see that       its also easier to just cut and size a belt instead of dealing with velcro and sticky shit
  people in the star wars and marvel generals talk about their respective source materials in every thread this is the only one where someone shits their pants if it happens
the hei sabre looks quite nice hopefully it sounds good but with girade and zaxe sounds im not too worried
  who gives a shit about what happens in those threads this is the way weve been doing things in the /toku/ thread for years and newfags dont get to demand we suddenly start doing it differently just because theyre scared of /m/
  even tho id prefer for these threads to mainly be about the figures you sound like the biggest faggot
  you are the only newfag i see demanding anything fuck off
  its also easier to just cut and size a belt instead of dealing with velcro and sticky shit    using an actual belt looks like shit sticking on four pieces of velcro is much easier
i know that we are all supposed to hate them but has anyone seen anything worthwhile in hljs black friday sale  jikku driver is on sale but i already have one  the orange silver and gold robots from kyuranger are on sale but for some reason pink isnt
  its not that were supposed to hate them theyve just fucked up hard with letting their customers actually order something when therere new listings    but anyway yeah i havent really seen anything really worth it hljs sales are always just them trying to clear their old stocks so its always stuff that shelfwarmed or got over ordered jikku driver is actually pretty tempting to me since i didnt get it before but thats all ive seen
jiku driver on sale at hlj    
moley moley moley moley
  do not bully mamoru
why dont showa rider figuarts all come with a dedicated pointing hand
  ha i fucking swear to god if we knew each other i would suck your dick dry
  you sound like the worst part of the toku fan base calm down eugene and let people like what they want to like most of the threads are juat white guys complaining about toku anyway
  thanks for the heads up
do we have an estimated release date of the super minipla gridman a little more concrete than nov 2018 like has anyone seen a specific day anywhere or is it just anytime between now and the end of the month
  if i remember right its actually either today or next thursday but theres often about a days delay from when its released to when the online stores get their stock
  oh ok thats good to hear
  v3 did
looking to buy a couple detail of heroes books primarily w and drives im seeing w got a reissue earlier this year but all the listings i found dont mention if the new one is soft or hardcover anybody here have the new one and can clarify for me
is it me or did bandai kinda slow down on the ultra man kaiju figuarts  i was ecstatic when they released all these kaiju within a few years i have 10 i didnt have a few years ago now i dont think theres anymore were waiting on is there didnt they show evil dopplganger ultraman awhile back or am i dreaming that
what makes this special colors version
  this is why i love my w shfss and build shf so much i wish my showa riders did get more expressive hands they missed out on amazon making his friend gesture too
    its right in the op
  yeah theyve slowed down for now because theyre doing six figures at once just for the ultraman r/b base forms itll probably be around mid next year before we start seeing them put out kaiju again
gaim ride watch finally went up  already sold out  god fucking dammit that was the last one that i wanted too now i just have to hope that hlj will work long enough for me to even make an order for it
  are you sure it went up
  on amiami yeah   so now ill have to just watch hlj like a hawk
diy
  oh ok i understand now
  i still dont mind the original version but i do like the torso on the new one better
  ugly
  what have they done to this poor boy
  you should do a gold one for the oma zio look
  they made him a big guy
  the figuarts go for suit accuracy rather than being an idealized version of the character like ultraacts did for me its a case by case thing as to which i prefer but im still happy with my ua belial anyway
past 3am here  fuck how much longer hlj im falling asleep on my fucking keyboard here
huh i woke up earlier and the gaim watch on amiami was order stop now ive just checked out with it perfect
hey bandai can i get that new decadriver please
  sougo with decade ride watch fighting tsukasa who somehow can still transform neat
it has callouts for every dx ride watch
  this thing looks so fucking bad bandai fixing what aint broke just for the sake of a few more shekels could easily have just released a normal aesthetically pleasing decadriver with updated sounds instead theyre just gonna shill this crap recolor     at least hes wearing the real thing in forever
  fuck off
    wow i guess theyre putting skeletons into the kicks figures too
  like kiva
  11/31
production samples of dyna dragon and sigma  
  some parts swapping required like thunder gridman
that grey plastic just looks terrible in photos
        looks like shit compared to ua pass
  the original seven is more of a muted red/brown that matched the old showa suit this looks brighter and more vibrant closer to the heisei/modern suit
  im glad i got the atrocious version when i could
  fuck of eugene
is it true that amiami gives you an extra day to pay if you change your payment method i got a request for wizard but the last day to pay is the 29th and i dont get paid until 900 am that day
so super minipla gridman went straight from order stop to discontinued two days ago the po opened up again for like a couple hours this is when i got my order in the order is still open in my account on hlj but the item page is inaccessible how likely is it that my order still gets filled
  neat
  niiice really digging the show accuracy the ua wasnt my belial
  discontinued is hljs default item status it doesnt mean anything can you email them and tell them to change it to something else theres like 1 guy asking about their hlj shit being discontinued every month on this board since its inception
got a charge from hlj for around 50  havent ordered anything from them for months due to getting everything on amiami with pure luck  completely forgot i ordered shfss wizard from them    now i have a smile on my face
  noice anon i just cleared out my private warehouse so i could get him as well
does japan support online stores ive been trying to sign up to a bunch of them but none of the japanese stores online have an option to ship in their own country
if i wanted ultraman ace should i get the figuarts thats out or should i wait for a new version
  most nips just buy their stuff from either amazon or specifically japanese versions of the online stores they keep the gaijin side of things completely separate from theirs      there wont be a new version for years so yeah either the figuarts or ua would be your options
im actually excited for minipla thunder gridman i had the dx set but sold it awhile back took up too much space
    how would one preorder this
  hlj/ami ami or overpay at bbts
    i thought that one is a premium bandai item
  nah exclusive stuff have a specific logo on their pictures
  dyna and sigma are pb exclusive
thank you hlj and your private warehouse feature  next week will be fun
  its cheaper to combine orders together right but doesnt the bigger box and heavier weight cost more for shipping like you combine just 3 packages before it exceeds 5 kg or something
  the shipping came to 60 aud but im fine with that since ill be paid again before amiami sends me a payment request for november releases
  i guess thats a pretty okayish price for shipping
  australian prices suck in general but we also pay tax on top which makes it worse  ive just accepted that i cant have these hobbies and money at the same time
  shipping gets cheaper by volume the shipping cost per item drops as number of items go up     yeah one 6080 charge at the end of 2 months s a lot but its a lot less than 1220 per item
  thats why i use hlj for items that i want but am happy to wait for up to 90 days to ship that way i can amass three months of things and ship them together for cheaper    i have the deno and ryuki rider kicks figuarts preordered but i wont ship them until probably march
any reviews out for zero beyond yet also how long does biginjap take to send packages out
has the gaim ridewatch even shown up on hlj yet
  yeah for 2 mins you missed it  not knowing how to look for yourself
  not on the new site
  then why does bbts have dyna
  bbts do get a few exclusives like they have mad rogue and blizzard grease on there
  because theyll scalp anyone who doesnt know better and they dont give a shit if its exclusive or not
so today was a good day my genm lv0 arrived and my collection of this weirdo is finally complete
best site to get a dx jiku driver this black friday just hlj
  no zombie lv0  no figuarts kuroto  no prototype lv3  no another ooo  doesnt look complete to me
  which dan kuroto figuarts seems generally better to get i personally prioritize the black suit version over the one with the continue pipe but the range of different faces is hard to decide on assuming it will be placed next to a genm collection similar to this
  better to get    both
  this 
  great shot
  gaim watch back up for now at least
  its also back on amiami at a cheaper price
hlj have the dizer extension up again
the new csm arcle looks pretty sick first ive seen of it how are the rider belts in general are they really worth the bucks which ones are the best
  its mediocre at best
  ok
  only one of those currently exists and didnt event hit retails yet stop with your small dickness
  they do a hell of a lot to cram as many references to the show they can possibly can with the belts ooo driver did a really nice job but whether or not its worth the extravagent prices is up to you
do the weapons with this gridman actually transform or are they basically scale vehicles
  both actibuilder and goodsmile can combine but goodsmile is much closer to accuracy actibuilder is wide/chunky and has balljoints showing everwhere
  thats goodsmiles dx variant yes it combines and can use each one separately max gridman/buster gridman/sky gridman can also form the zenon equivalent with just the vehicles and full powered gridman
      thanks i saw the actibuilder showing off all the combinations but the hip joints look off to me so im stoked to see that the goodsmile has all the gimmicks
hey did shfss decade ever get a ridewatch edition meaning that we can actually find stock for ss decade
so as varied and cool all the new ssssgridman figures are looking is anyone else kinda surprised bandai hasnt thrown in something yeah there is the two minipla sets but ones the og and the other based on the short that got us the new show we have the actibuilder the goodsmile dx set the figmaapparently its different than the one in the dx set and the nendoroid why hasnt bandai stepped up with an shf or ultra act
  they cant for legal reasons or so ive heard
  you tell me
  read the thread bro  
  but thats fake tho
  oh well damn that sucks
  so you are clever enough to spot the forgery yet no one has posted a legit one and you cant find a legit announcement yourself because you definitely looked   what does that tell you anon think real hard about it
  im not the first anon bud im just pointing out thats fake
  a lot of it is based on popularity and a lot of companies have to gauge interest first from fans we know gridman is a success now but the two companies gsc and actibuilder probably have contracts to be producing figures and bandai waited too late     minipla were only made because of the anniversary
  true i kinda figured contracts or something of that nature factored into it i guess its just really surprising that bandai let it go like that there are two healthy dedicated tokusatsu sublines of the shf brand and i am shocked that bandai let gridman slip through for whatever reason i get that ua is a collab line with tsuburaya buts its basically shfs sister line with both of these at their disposal and og gridman already having an ua release i figured bandai would be at the forefornt of the gridman merch stampede
  they were probably hesitant because not only is it anime but goodsmile usually takes care of the trigger audience well
  im kinda glad ua didnt get their hands on it i disliked thunder gridman and king gridman zenon was okay
  actibuilder is megahouses and megahouse is a part of bandai spirits so bandai can make a figure of gridman whenever they want but choose not to for some reasons
  remember that time when gsc make figma of ryuki riders  they got btfoed so hard a year later when bandai announced shf ryuki is included with dragredder
  i dont exactly like nor dislike wizard as a show but damn this is a really good looking figure
  well technically the figmas were for the american version dragon knight so that was a slight licensing loophole
if the decade ride watch and the heisaber both release on the 8th then when are they going to go up for preorders
  the way things have gone lately the 8th
    8th pastebin says 1st for kuuga double and decade where are release dates officially listed
  
  and kuuga and double arent even listed does this mean i get a week off from the stress of trying to collect these fuckers
want to buy rider stuff from the na premium bandai store so they will get more and better rider stuff  all the rider stuff sucks
  buy out their us distributor  lmao just let the asia guys handle the us pbandai site instead  based bandai
  those dates are coming from the original catalog scans from way back in july decades listing said december with no specific date originally kuuga and w say the 1st but with those being knocked to movie form status who knows if that date will stick the could sneak in i suppose
      the 12/01 in the pastebin is the disclosure date from the catalog which is subject to change its rarely the actual release date stores had always put up toys for preorder by the disclosure date prior to zio now some are doing it the day of release or a few days before
  i cant wait to see how bandai fucks this up the zio line is just so boring the toys feel half baked
  zioh toy line and gimmicks are the worst they feel empty and they didnt even have the watch/time lore attached to them is literally they throwing old stuff in armor forms totally bland and stupid
  its going to be hard for them to fuck it up considering it has callouts for every heisei main rider in it  but youll find something to complain about im sure
straight build videos of soup minipla gridman are up  
pictorial unpainted/stickered review by nodakalife  
  its going to be hard for them to fuck it up  do you even own any zio toys
  yes i own every dx watch currently released except for ooo which is an sg the girade zaxe the dizer parts and belt obviously   so i guess ill repeat it its going to be hard for them to fuck it up theyve made sure it interacts with all of the dx watches so thats already a good thing about it and from the leaked sound clip it sounds pretty alright too
i asked the kaiju thread about a week ago but never got a response  kaiju stuff is toku so maybe someone here can help    i just want one gamera figure and need help deciding which monsterarts to get the 1996 or 1999  which gamera do you guys think is better which one do you think comes from the better movie which one is a better figure which one is the more definitive gamera
  the restricted arm movement in thunders articulation is downer plus all the additional parts feet/zenon head/thrusters fists etc  still looks good though
  which one is the more definitive gamera  this one
  this guy should be shipping out later today right since late afternoon on the 26th where i live is start of the work day in japanland for the 27th
  hmmm not a big fan of the combined form i think i might just get the figma    heres hoping bandai makes a shf or atleast    one of the original gridman
  i heard the figure of the 1999 one is not suit accurate is that true
  fuck if i know but hes got a goddamn shining fingerclaw hes cool looking enough to overlook that i guess still wish id grab him during a hlj sale eons ago
is hlj not getting the minipla thunder gridman in today it released yesterday so why is it not ready for shipping on the 26th us/27th jp
  does this thread look like hlj fucking customer service first of all fuck you secondly email hlj thirdly golly gosh some website hasnt shipped your toy a whole day after it released who cares
  damn you upset
  hey quick question amiami hasnt shipped my gridman yet do you know why the op says the 26th   thats today for me but yesterday for the japanese so actually today for them is tomorrow for me i just wanna know when the company will ship my order anon you gotta tell me
  shf shinkocchou seihou silver fang knight zero  11/22      i havent been paying much attention to stuff aside from kamen rider but is this the only garo merchandise coming out for the forseeable future shfss id kill to get some affordable shodo figures or even converge stuff
      all japanese retailers have gaijin buyers blacklisted and will deliberately delay their shipments to see you suffer expect to wait any time between 2 to 2503 weeks for them ship it depends on their rice harvest yield that week
pretty boy
  not another wizard  why even bother
got shf stronger in the mail today to go with ss ichigou and amazon he looks great though his hips seem to pop off rather easily despite having tight joints
  so actually today for them is tomorrow for me  lold
just ordered kamen rider cronus shf is he a decent fig for 5000 yen after shipping and all
  not really but you already placed the order
  if only your pictures did it justice
  god dam alpha is so aesthetically pleasing to look at i would love that play arts kai of him
  you seem to be the guy to ask but hlj amiami hobbysearch and mandarake have not shipped my simultaneous orders of gridman and flavor of the month anime shit that released on the same day three days ago why
  they did
  ultra act is not the same thing as shf you mong
  thats the ultraact
  a c k s h u a l l y y y y y they havent made an sh figuarts of gridman yet thats the ultraact
  i bought genm lv 0 shf for 6500 yen and i dont regret him even when he dropped to 5000 youll know for yourself when you get cronus but i think the included gamer driver part seems neat
  where can i get that plush
  damn youre still on this youre more annoying than the actual faggot asking the question shut up nigger
  gridman  anime    hes asking about the og toku series minipla you illiterate sperg
  i think i might just get the figma  but the figma looks worse than the actibuilder one
  where do you find those cronus at 5000yen
  it really doesnt but anyways the actibuilder is only like 4 inches tall so no thanks
  try checking manda or a few toku shops that still sell it price is about 2500 yen now
  those proportions  those shoulders  that tiny sword  enjoy your garbage
some reviews for zero beyond are out it looks great to me    
  i understand that buddy i am  so one of the first to ask that question when anon had an aneurysm over multiple people asking a question i decided to take it farther by asking the question again but obviously being full of shit and for your call of illeterate there is an and between the gridman and the flavor of the month it may surprise you but i was insinuating my fictitious 4 orders of the gridman minipla contained shit other than the minipla just to be an ass to that anon
  gotcha no worries fellow gridanon that one retard was just being obnoxious
what dx toys did you guys have the most fun with ive only owned a zabee zecter w driver and the ooo driver
  that one retard was just being obnoxious  i  was not being obnoxious     seriously though no one here knows why your babby toy hasnt shipped yet kys
  babby toy   in a toku toy thread     says the nigger who buys roleplay items made for a japanese toddler
lets just ignore this new shitposter thats shown up and keeps trying to start an argument every time anyone says something they always reply with the same nuh uh its bad schtick or any other kind of lazy bait its not worth replying to
          preorder on the 30th
  zio and geiz look good but kabuto and faiz all kinds of fucked up
  thats because kabuto and faiz are rereleases of kits from 3 years ago
  amazonjp
  detailing on the ride watches and they come with their weapons  well somebodys eager to show up their figuarts counterparts yeah yeah well have to see how all the stickering ends up looking but considering that geiz in particular is like half the price
  well shit guys im over here trying to start conversation in this dying thread but nobody cares yall aint shit mang
  that topic has been done to death you might as well ask what is your favorite figuarts to play with
  not when i was around
  dying thread  anon this thread was about a dozen posts away from autosaging when you make your post and /toy/ is a slow board anyway some days this general might only have two or three new posts altogether just lurk and learn next time
  that necrom  thats pretty alright i wonder if well start getting ride watches of movie riders id need nadeshiko to finish the fourze trio
  gaim kachidoki and build rabbitrabbit are candy toy watches  accel baron necrom and build tanktank are gashapon watches  kuuga amazing mighty comes with the zio mook
  can you move the face plates of the gp watches at all
is grease the only dx ridewatches from non main rider
  i said i wasnt going to get the actibuilder silly billy
  beast
can we talk about retro toku toys here
  nope not beast      if you want to get technical theres geiz
  sure better than this overpriced over designed rainbow garbage anyhow
video of decade armor in ganbarizing with the jingle  
        no there are no faceplates on them
  genm is a weird psuedo dx they put it together differently than dx sg or gasha ones
  god damn i knew that italy got a ton of super robot shows but i didnt know that they straight up got metal hero ones too    the problem with retro toys is that so many of them are either out of most gaijins price ranges/sofubi dolls or both by the time bandai started putting out proper toys kamen rider was already in stasis sentai had gotten into its pattern of putting out robo figures and metal hero was the toy mainstay but there arent quite that many mh fans here nowadays
    is grease regular or just rare one i mean in here its still expensive than the build one
fyi figuarts geiz is open for preorders on amiami if you missed him the first time
the pastebin still just has placeholder dates are there any dx zio toys coming out this week
  absolutely fucking brilliant i cant wait for the toy
  kuuga and w iirc also heres videos of them      
  so im looking at that second video and im looking at wotafas review and im wondering which of those accurately represents the color i look at wotafas review and the green seems far too flourescent while the back appears to be like a navy blue but then i look at the above and it looks like proper cyclone green and joker purple
  the plastic for the base looks slightly different depending on the yellowness of your light
  makes sense i was all ready to start go full fan boy rage over the blue back piece good thing it isnt actually blue
wizard is cool shame about his show
  i recognize you from /gpg/  great scenery you got there
  yea i dont post as much since the hurricane shoahed most of my collection ive been rebuilding tho
  close but no cigar those are from brazil    
the hell  all pics online show that old shf kabuto hyper has blue eyes but the figure i got has white ones whats up qith that
      its the same fucking company you utter pedants
bluefins clearing out their metallic shinkenger sets for 56 shipped get em while theyre hot    
  and its still a completely different line ultra act are a tad bigger and have heroic proportions while figuarts goes for suit accuracy     you really doubled down on stupid didnt you
  those look terrible
  grease is the only truly dx watch for a non main rider because he was only available on pbandai crossz and genm are pseudo dx
  but theyre 65
my crocodile full bottle is stuck i pulled it out today to mess with it and its stuck in what i think a sound test mode has anyone seen this before and/ or know how to fix it taking the batteries out does nothing and taking it appart revealed nothing stuck or broken    
  should be a reset button of some sort on it somewhere should look like a tiny little button you gotta press with a toothpick i dont own one but most electronic bandai toys have them
good haul
  didnt work thanks still
  im not going to claim to know how these are made but id imagine that a sound test would have to be removed from within the coding on the sound chip but honestly thats kind of a neat thing to have id personally hang onto it and get another one
      oh wow those look great like giant wcf  that fucking price
  its a garage toy thats why the price is so high
  fair enough but ive never really been that big a fan of garage kits its rubbish at painting anything if theses were just some sofubi with dynamic posing like this then id be all over them
  im rubbish at painting anything
dang no new shfs at tokyo comic con
anyone know why bandai scrubbed the kuuga and double ridewatch from their amazon store thats where i got all my zio stuff from
figure rise zio and geiz are up for order on amiami         
  i forgot to add i know they scrubbed it because i saw the page for kuugas ride watch a week or so ago and searching the same page brings a dead link a cached page shows up on google results     whats a good place to get these ride watches i only been using amazon japan
  yeah i was really hoping to see some
  were the dan figuarts pushed back until january or were they doing a second release then my ny order now says that theyll be in stock in jan instead of this month i was wondering why they hadnt shown up yet
    didnt mean to quote sorry
double and kuuga ride watches are up on hlj    
  pls someone help its driving me crazy its not a bootleg and its not the shinkocho i got him loose and didt think much of it but maybe its a factory defect
  thanks anon
rider time
  if their online stock levels are to be believed they have 556 of these fucking things
        like that makes any difference the fact that that lines like ultraact and darts have basically been consolidated into sh figuarts goes to show how meaningless the branding is
  only they havent really been consolidated at all ultraacts are significantly different and clearly an entirely different product line stop being retarded
  theres nothing wrong with not knowing something but to try and push your ignorance and lack of knowledge as fact is incredibly annoying and you should honestly stop before you embarrass yourself any further
  kuuga is back in stock
    the ultraact and darts lines are dead and all subsequent new releases that wouldve been under those new ultraman digimon pokemon have been branded figuarts tell me how thats not consolidation cut the pretense
    blade and ryuki are finally back up too
w is my favourite so of fucking course that is the one i miss
  why is it already discontinued
  because a shf wouldve never been released as an ultraact theres like a two inch difference between the two
  this your first trip to the rodeo
  actually yes it is i planned on getting all 20 ridewatches dont know what to do now now that w is sold out
  amazonjp
  do what this  anon says or wait it out hlj always puts anything that sells out day one under the discontinued label i dont know why but thats what they do things usually come back and if its a gimmick item of the year you can bet your ass theyll end up getting more later on down the line
  ive been using amazon japan for everything and double is still not showing up on bandais store i would buy third party but none of them are willing to ship internationally
  wait it just came out itll be on amazon probably by monday its worth noting that every watch so far has also been restocked on hlj some time after initial release
  good to know thank you    now that im here anyone can advocate if hljs private warehouse thing works as they say it does
  works just fine save things up for up to 2 months and send it all out whenever you want the only thing im not 100 on is campaign items like the crossz and genm watches i dont know if those are secured with the purchase or when it all gets shipped out pretty sure its the former but ive never had the balls to try it out
    did you wake up today thinking boy i feel like looking like an idiot on the internet today    if the ultraacts were consolidated into the figuarts line they would still be a couple inches taller and with heroic proportions    the figuarts go for suit accuracy and a smaller scale
  use amiami when it pops up on there amazon cstoys kotetsu toys etc
  never had a problem with campaign items in my warehouse and ive left them there close to the warehouse time limit
when they will release those another rider watches
  do you have link for those watches im still noob using amazon jp
new rider toys are on amiami only the kuuga watch buggle driver ii and evol driver are left
  i use the android amazon app since it translates everything seamlessly and just search for any kind of dx rider watch then all the other ones pop up in the similar items link down the page
i want to buy these sd ultraman figures but the only place i see them sold is on ebay for strangely high prices is there somewhere that sells them for cheaper or a place to buy them new i am guessing they are sold in japan loose among other ultraman toys
  theyre finger puppets/指人形 sold in ultraman stores and events sometimes just in a big tub you can try getting bulk sets on auction or individually from a store on rakuten
im too autistic for ss wizard its too much fucking work to get these cloth parts perfectly into the exact position that i want
    heisaber is up on hlj it is on amiami too but preorders are closed there
hooo boy this is going to hurt the old wallet   good thing im picking up a shit load of hours this month
  good job its not real then
  thank you
  how can you tell
  art is from the climax game i think
  ah thank you anon ill check out rakuten
hlj is slow as shit same with there customer response time something that shouldve been shipped a week ago because every other online retailer had it in stock hlj doesnt even have it in stock ready for shipping
  i presume youre talking about the gaim watch why not just order it from amiami then  
  they told me they hate you and you alone the rest of us have all our stuff
  sure why not spend nearly twice as much for shipping
  but seriously theyve become mismanaged and kinda shit since the website change
  the fuck do you live
  they cost the same anon and amiami lets you pick which postage option you want anyway
  everything works fine for me in fact my items seem to ship a helluva lot faster then before the change i dont get why some people are having issues and others not
  no they dont ami ami is seriously across the board higher than everyone else its how the compensate for their discounts on items
    now were real
surprising absolutely no one except for that one guy that thought it would be someone other than decade the last hidden watch base is decade
  new attack rides  neat  no new form rides  well thats to be expected hope we at least get to see zios either next week or in hgf
post the figuarts you own that you enjoy the most
  its a dx and not a csm  then just fucking release in regular stores you fucks dx stuff being pbandai only is so retarded
  all the gaim figuarts i own are a dream to handle besides them chalice
  is tokullectibles a good middleman to use for this 132 shipped doesnt seem bad at all for this
  yes
  it also doesnt matter to the children who just bought the decadriver in stores dumb fucking nonnative
  dumb fucking nonnative  implying kids wont see the new belt on screen and want it  youre really underestimating kids
  good thing they can buy it in their country
  yeah dude just release another new belt onto the shelves right along side the other new belts and the half a dozen old ones we just put out  doesnt matter how tangential it is put it on the shelf
my riders started to outgrow my detolf so i moved them to their own shelf   slowly but surely my collection is getting there
  whys rider 2 doing rider 1s pose
  symmetry    i need to fix a few of the poses and put together the second acrylic riser i have
  its better than releasing the old belt he doesnt even have in the show anymore
    how does it feel to be this wrong   
  what stand is that
  
new thread  
  wait is the figure getting a re release im confused
  dont worry that definitely is a factory defect and you just happened to get the one kabuto figure missing the lens over his eyepieces
  amazon still hasnt put theirs up yet its all third party sellers
what are some characters you like to have high quality figures of
my whole collection is of the highest calibur of quality
a new lotr line
  patrician taste
bout time aint it
  i would love a designer vinyl or sofubi of redline vehicles
shuma gorath  shuma gorath    the chances of getting one are near impossible though the closest thing is the heroclix which is nice put id prefer his pink look from marvel super heroes/marvel premiere
  or at least 164 scale models of their machines
  who
  ritcher from castlevania
  i dont think its impossible to think it could be a dr strange wave baf doubt hed ever be pink though
  all we ever got of him was a shitty funko figure
spawn is a big one  something about him having a shit ton of statues while his creator pumps out well articulated fortnite figures of all things bug the piss out of me
  never ever
  not diecast  fucking peasant
shf combine forces half life stuff
  can throwing action
  actually any mvc2 figures that look nice and close to the game what i would give for a cable based on mvc2
with a clear plastic bob effect piece
an accurate figure of jhiaxus from the marvel transformers comics    every jhiaxus figure made has been a nightmare of orange plastic and never even the right shape/alt mode its awful itd be nice to see someone anyone take a stab at an accurate representation of him
  newfags dont knoe
  id want alucard first and sotn alucard not his dumbed down anime design
can never have    even the figma for the major wasnt even based on this style quality requires likeness too
  would have been a kino palisades release back in the day
all of the azumangas
  he said high quality
  i should probably mention that characters that already have figures count in this thread they just have to have subpar and/shit figure representations
misty preferably in an older design theyve been slowly making pkmn figures but they keep recycling the same characters now and its getting dull
  i second this
yiff
  you knoe thread ok
  a figma of her would be nice
theres not even fucko poops of harry potters parents ffs
haf when
  weird chibi creatures from a yaoi artist  they all have butt faces  heh
soc gaofighgar tenryujin choryujin gekiryujin volfogg mic
i would buy an entire set of gaki no tsukai figmas with alternate screaming faces
all i want for christmas is a nativity scene with articulated characters
these were the best designed characters of the nintendo 64 era they deserve something decent
she doesnt even have any good dolls
  or a funko for that matter
  i second skull knight hes fucking awesome and only has those expensive artículo of war statues
i need to check my coverage
if figma ever does make msiato itll probably just be her rebuild 333 captain nemo look
  no zodd cmon
  i hate that fact that youre right
preferably in catgirl form but a cat is fine too
  preferably in catgirl form    no
  just think about it a thicc ginger neet who hates mondays and loves lasagna
  word in an alternate reality where the horrid scorjoe flick took off like venom wed at least have ml/dragonstars version of section9 with baf tachikoma or aramaki by now
  shed have a super pochaco body type odie would be a cute but stupid bishounen that garfieldchan likes to flirtatiously bully just think about it anon
  his father would be a better start for a figure line
the entire darkstalkers cast modeled primarily on the sprites with a just a hint of darkstalkers 1era portrait art when needed for detail with lots of articulation of course and bunches of swappable option parts to recreate the various transforming body parts from their attacks and other animations
world of warcraft dc direct did those mcfarlane type figures a while ago but id like to see poseable figures of random races/classes in different tier sets
  an import quality jesus figure would be one of the best things ever whoever made it could do a robed version and then a crucifixion version each with different faces hands and accessories lol
i could take or leave the rest of the cast just want my best boy
pls gimme
  what are some characters you like to have high quality figures of  we both know who
    nothing about the shitsons is high quality
  love to have a asuka      this as well
optimus prime
  spawn did have the a huge selection of figures that used to be the gold standard sculpt wise the articulations were always kinda shit though i remember macfarlane was using this really soft plastic for some reason and if a marfarlane toy ever broke it was because the elbow or knees fell apart
or the gustaff from misadventures theres a chance of getting tron by herself in the 4inchnel line since theyre doing roll but i dont see them doing the gustaff      also this but the series doesnt seem to have ever gotten much popularity and is probably dead forever after the fuckery with the second game
  evangalion has a literal shitton of figures
    this a shf or mafex lord of the rings line would be amazing
  shf    please no
  not him but op said  what are some characters you like to have high quality figures of        they must include pic related face
  shf or mafex lotr would fucking rock though i wonder how theyd do the ringwraiths hopefully not static
  because
  op here i just meant figma quality and there is already a figma of asuka
anyone please just one decent figure preferably 6 in
  they already do star wars marvel mcu and dceu with them appearing to dabble into the harry potter movies throw in lotr and shf might as well just become a western movie line     id rather another company tackled lotr while shf dropped one of their current lines and put that energy into making more random figures celebs music or even some asian franchise instead
  i would rather shf drop their lucrative lines to make one that they already tried and didnt perform well  yeah good luck with that pal
  just do a custom using one of the new hasbro power ranger tommy figures when they come out
a 3 foot tall master mold
  definitely wont be buff enough     i did make a custom mega construx one though so he can at least team up with the turtles and my custom mega joes
  yes thats the point thats what i would rather they did i know they wont but it doesnt change that id like to see a move away from some stuff they do and try new things       what about putting the head on one of the more blank marvel legend figures
  they already tried celebs and music just because they dont keep doing different iterations of michael jackson and freddie mercury doesnt mean that what they do would constitute new things
  the idea of an iron man hall of armor full of freddies does sound quite tempting
  hulkbuster freddie    id buy it
  yet somehow nothing good of the angels
funny enough op the simpsons
  shf simpsons  though non family members would be pbandai and i dont want to deal with that
  explain the full lineup label if theyre exclusive or whatever they are
  regular release    homer with bowling ball duff first run exclusive is the couch similar to the mk42 iron man  marge with maggie maybe ringo starr painting or generic bag of shopping   bart with slingshot and skateboard maybe krusty doll  lisa with sax books  apu with squishee hotdog  milhouse with comics or copy of bonestorm    exclusive  grandpa simpson with old man shouts at cloud newspaper  krusty with burger and tiny bike  burns/smithers two pack inanimate carbon rod malibu stacy with new hat box   moe with a bar set up or at least a phone   barney with more duff  lenny and carl two pack with donuts and a lenny  white carl  black right hand for homer   patty and selma two pack with jubjub and cigarettes  ned flanders with a bible and some sort of leftorium items  sideshow bob with multiple garden rakes     obviously you can argue for and against countless different characters i know i didnt list every one id want
  this is great
  missing skinner and chalmers twopack
  honestly nearly included them two pack with steamed hams for sure     otherwise a two pack of skinner and edna could work as a school set but at a loss for what you could include with them besides the mini tea set from martins playhouse
  nah edna and willie
  this is all you get and youll like it
  golden bat needs a whole revival and a fuckton of toys hes a great character
  any kaneko drawn megaten protagonist is my dream toy would buy in an instant with gsc doing demons i pray we eventually can get someone still even if tbey just continue doing demons thatll be a miracle in itself
i just want a good 1/6 scale toy of this costume
  only if we get the classic version too
  gridman  good news and bad news  good news is that ultraact did a gridman figure and it was quite good  bad bews is that is costs almost 200 in aftermarket prices
hasbro needs to get on this right away
  he doesnt want freddie in all his glorious forms  what is wrong with you
plus a series of blind bag cousins
geralt without a doubt been a fan of the series since 2010 and have been wanting a good figure of him ever since beating the first game    bonus points if it includes a bathtub headswap like on the nendo
  these guys would look cool
  a 3 foot tall master mold  im surprised toy biz didnt put out one of these in the 90s
    here you go you meme loving fucks
  i didnt need to see this
  gib both
kars with ultimate life form parts
there are many many starscream/g1 seeker figures and theyre all fucking awful in their own ways    i want a definitive seeker figure everyone can agree on
  so far maketoys howling meteor is the best looking one at least in both modes meteor does suffer in the fact that his back in bot mode is not as smooth as the front
  milhouse with comics or copy of bonestorm  dx  empty goldfish bowl barts soul alf pogs
all of them  figma preferably
  surprised it hasnt happened yet considering katimaris popularity
  implying you havent already bought decoy octopus figma  one of your anime schoolgirls isnt what she seems
  what comic is that from
  this put snake near them and watch foxdie do its job
  luckily fifteen year old me already got thatsort ofthrough neca way back when now i wish id gotten simon and wish i could get any belmont as a figure except for juste or maybe julius
never gonna happen but would be sick
  fuck  i need this
    back to tumblr with ye
  please i need my queen
ill make a figure of her one day
i want senran kagura figures so bad theres tons of statues but the closest thing to anything with articulation are minifigs with balljointed heads
id love this   like the figma virtua fighter figures
      there are high quality asuka figures dumbdumb
id like the witch bitch from kirikou
just for headswaps
ridley from metroid
      we need a satan too
actually the whole bebop cast deserves quality figmas  not that id ever be able to afford them but id wait for a sale and i dunno make it happen somehow for ed
  he wants a shitty figma when figuarts has already shown spike
  a proper and good looking simon belmont figure and a nendo of king dedede since meta kinght and kirby already have one
  any of the battletoads  rash
  t edgelord
  tons of statues and most of them are pretty garbage the most recent ones are good but they suffer from being mostly yumi like everything else coming from this franchise lately    it sucks that revoltech didnt have some senran releases when their queens blade line was still popular they clearly had a grasp on what people want from ecchi fighting girls series if they jump in now the classic characters will probably be ignored again for even more gessen circlejerking
we need a samurai flamenco figure i havent even seen a statue of him
  spike looks great but their jazwares quality vicious might be a sign that theyre putting their flist sculptor to work on the cb line and poor sales will mean the line will die with him
any villain from kingdom hearts but specifically xemnas or vanitas
  i really want a liquid ocelot figure thats the only figure id really want for the rest of my life
would love a trico plush or something i think sony released a few at some special event a few years ago but theyre overpriced on ebay and itd be nice to see a higher quality version
  very surprised that hasnt happened yet
  paladin tier 2 and 12 action figure  i need it
  any of the main 7 girls yes lala too would be enough but i would buy the mon girls ms smith and any of the side monstergirls too especially cathyl or ruuto
  we got a nendo so theres still hope      bob dylan
  i think we can all agree that the nobel gundam needs a current master grade and/or real grade
forever waiting
  maybe use the walgreens/vintage wave punisher body as a base
  any news if this is coming back i heard it was getting a season 2 but i havent seen anything yet
  mega size 
  came here to post this i mean one of the most recognizable fiction characters in history and yet no definitive action figure
  deformed  no thanks
  furry bait aside a star fox line that isnt based off the n64 models is something id pay to see id much rather have some updated looks similar to the smash bros designs
  this there are a ton of soras out there and barely any enemies to pose him with id love for figuarts to just do an enemy pack like they did with their mario line and to give us at least ansem or xemnas
            man it sucks being a fan of old anime _
  it sure does  i am a huge tezuka fan for example and you would think being one of the single most influential figure in manga as we know it now would lead to his work having something of note in terms of figures but all we get is the occasional lackluster atom figure  i am hoping my boy hyakkimaru gets something when the new dororo anime comes out next year
  old jack
  or you know any jack that isnt a kids toy im willing to compromise the stylization for a better 3d sculpt a few solid statue type figures have been ok but these things suck
  do we have any high quality figures regular jack
  not that im aware off just junk like  there are a few 3d prints and garage kits but not really anything note worth
  does bring arts count as high quality to you  its okay bandais been making kh figuarts
  fukin all might id be happy for a 5po figure too its a disgrace there arent any figures of him
  im still going to hold out a shred of hope for some sort of amuro and char announcement for the 40th anniversary next year the anime line is doing great so hopefully they decide to
  and i hope they continue to but they seem to mostly concentrate on marvel/star wars and dragon ball i got the bandai mickey and am really happy with its quality
the mgs4 bosses but also specifically the frogs    arsenal tengu would also be nice
got this guys figure a while ago both legs broke out of the package  stupid clear plastic
  who is that
  nox from wakfu a french cartoon
  imagine a separate set for all her weapons including some angel and demon weapons
i want this guy preferably with the horse also cooler and imperfect cell theyre the only dbz figuarts id buy maybe some darkstalkers too while im being unreasonable
  they did some shit 12 medicom ones a few years ago doesnt look horrible but its not even poseable plus theyre overpriced as fuck would love a detailed 6 old snake figure
these guys
gutted this dude hasnt recieved more love probs my fave monster design of all time
  kiva from megasxlr
  yea    dirty pair had some merchandise  oh and goodness this verification shit is too much of a headache
it would be nice to see these guys get the bucky ohare treatment
im not even a narutofag but i loved the preshippuden era would love to have a kid sasuke and naruto
  forgot pic
  loved this episode as a kid
  its of the movie version which a lot of people arent a fan of  the details are just different enough to turn me away from it    ed  please god
tfw no shezow merch at all
  literally who
  undercooked toast
  now that the nintendofags are getting their very first nepu game i hope this adds more incentive for figmas instead of statues
  no thanks    maybe bionic six or exosquad   love me some cyborgish/mechs    if they do exosquad i would not mind them just doing the jump troopers and various neosapiens   huge amount of designs and the power armor bits can be swapped around for high customizability and even with other 118 lines    playmates limited articulated mechs would be alright as long as they they use barbell joints instead of just pegs and hinges
  shezow
  totally buy ghost figures i love how they are basically a parody of christian rock adding my own pick i badly want a new line of baki figures
  a tranny
  if were ever gonna get the yuyu crew its soon with that new project coming out im sure some company will produce at least 3 of the main 4
  a child tranny
  of course he is surprised tumblr isnt cumming all over this
  yeah miloanon liking them pretty much ruined them for me
how come there are no toys of kilala reno shes a disney character      it was cancelled years ago so tumblrites probably forgot about it by now
  who is she exactly
  
  seems like good figure material
  came here to post vampire hunter d
  i second jiban
  sword holding hand has painted amd sculpted detail
  just buy the nendo it was my first owing to the lack of geralt merch and its actually great basically a fullyarticulated action figure with a massive head
  so just like a marvel legends
  its not that big anon
    holy shit
there should be a no more heroes line of figures
  i agree even after that debacle with molecule8s ceo taking the money and running off somewhere
  id kill to be able to make a prop shunt display
  how is there nothing of this classic      pinnacle of animation yet ditto so frustrating
  action bastard
  rejoice anon gsc announced a while ago that theyre making a figma of all might
characters from doom    real doom only not that illegitimate /pol/pandering doom 4 reboot jizzboy trash where he looks like a master chief ripoff zenimax deserves their games pirated and this reboot canon ignored most of the classic doom community hates the game its only cuntservatives that pretend to like it because a woman said some mean things about it
      you again i thought you were gone for good this time
itll be funny
  hey jabroni i think youve got the wrong board the /leftypol/ club is two doors down
  this chart  youre alright youre alright
  you knoe
  i wish for soul of chogokin for the sake of diecast goodness and figma version so drossel will have another female robot friend
  i want a figuarts action bastard with anti enema beam so bad
  only shitty rei and asuka we need kaworu and shinji      me too      based      it was an epic episode one of my favorites
lots of old republic characters/soldiers they all looks so cool but are barely shown any love by hasbro/bandai whoever
scientifically correct or at least close archaic humans and hominin species neanderthals h erectus h habilis australipithecines especially a lucy fig
i wish companies didnt skip him
i would like to see some figures of takeshisan
  she looks like guy from my workplace
  i loved the design of the doom slayer but the threea figure was too rich for my blood coming from a guy who impulse buys masterpiece transformers was next to impossible to find and was reportedly shit anyway ive got a funko of him to sort of fill the void but i hate that shit i just hope theres some sort of good quality figure of him in time for doom eternal
  fucking this its criminal that the superior boxer hasnt gotten a figure yet
  it was 260 dude not that bad thats like a standard hot toys price for a much beefier figure with a 100 original sculpt and perfectly affordable if you just skipped a few of those mp transformers    that said the arms were apparently shit though a sad blemish on a great looking toy
  i want a 6 doomguy based on the original game
  yeah could have been great but they went with the rubber undersuit which restricts poseability something chronic and will disintegrate over time a shame as id love a decent doom slayer mafex maybe
   pbs bikinis    heads arent even chibified to fit the proportions   the curse continues
  thats true he would have been around 260 if he actually had halfdecent distribution preorders for him kept getting pushed further and further back until some sites just removed the listings entirely and last i checked on ebay i could find maybe two or three of them for around 340 each plus ungodly shipping     oh well they have to be doing something more than funkoshit for doom eternal
  this one
  nendo snake is a good compromise
  not really
  he looks overweight
easiest figma job and they passed on it in the meantime more fate saber remolds
  sully from the uncharted series  jeepers creepers  pumpkinhead  victor crowly  graboids shriekrs assblasters aka tremors figures  chev fucking chelos with switchable hands/heads to make him look like hes crazy and on fire at the end of 2  ernest/thantor the troll 2 pack  scorpius and possibly other farscape characters
  also as far as godzilla goes a figure or 2 of some of the b/c tier kaiju  ebirah  kumonga  orga
   fucking chelos  hell just a jason statham in general would be pretty fun
  ernest figma never
meruembut im working on making a custom one myself
  would make a great 3a 1/12 scale
sol badguy
  what really stings is that figma used to do all of the big schoolgirl ensemble shows justice  then yuruyuri comes out around the time they stopped doing sol comedies for the most part  i would murder for yuruyuri non non biyori maid dragon and galkosan to get the lucky star treatment
id kill for a good 6 bryan fury figure
    would you settle for a pullstring doll
  he was supposedly going to get a new anime somewhere in the 00s but nothing came of it after the trailer it always seemed weird to me since he is not only one of japans oldest superheroes but the first flying brick superhero he is also known in countries over the world and was pretty big himself in japan back in his day  i always liked how you can do pretty much anything with him you can do horror scifi mystery he even fought kaiju daily      yeah i always had a hard time deciding which version i like the best  cackling mummy musketeer golden bat anime brute golden bat diavolik golden bat skeleton in tights golden bat they all look great
        castlevania main trio  zodd skullknight  witcher 3 geralt  nonpak bayonetta  going to have to add the main space dandy trio and the rest of gutss group and voilà everything id ever want
id love more yurucharas to get plushes or toys many of the good ones are not popular enough to get them despite how massive the interest in local mascot characters has become in japan over the last 67 years toys are still the least common type of their merchandise shirts and mugs are just easier to produce i guess
  storm might eventually get to making a figure of a nonmishima
  its not everyones cup of tea but as mascot characters go chiitan is getting a berbrick 100 in the next blindbox series and a separate 400 release soon
  the scene from pic related in figure form well it would be more of a diorama/statueshit thing but i want it bad
  if that ever happens i want king
we only got shitty funkos
  least you got something
  quite literally the only tekken character i like and that i would go out of my way to buy probably even armor king if they decided to make him
they have nendos but i want something thats not deformed some 16 scale dolls with fabric clothes would be perfect
  bojack horseman is one of my favorite fictional characters ever written yet i dont see a 3d figure of him working kind of like those shitty rick and morty figures theyve been pumping out plus i doubt any quality manufacturers would be interested in an alcoholic horse with clinical depression at best wed probably get those shitty funko style action figures
  you mean like this ones    i rather have nothing
  my nigga
you should say who already have toys because now you welcome the whole you know who needs a figma crowd    anyhow i feel most wwf/wwe guys need better high end toys
  fucking robin  i want robin corrin is good but robin would be 100x better what the hell i love the robe and shit damn
  dude same excited for the amiibo though
  new ultimate warrior  its not figuarts  wwe figuarts is dead because wrasslinfags would rather buy a hundred happy mealtier figures the size of a small child than wait to get any number of high quality figures
would prefer papa nier over brother nier personally i know 2b got some figures but id like to see some other characters from the previous games or at least turn the dragons into cute plushes
ill never get figures of aoty 2016
  its several stands gloves boots emotes w/ cheer leader and school outfits that can be used with other potential releases    if only
id really love either a figma or figuarts version of these three
  is this chinese infinite stratos
  its an actual unironic japanese anime
  i was hoping wed get a figma of joey before i die but who knows how well kaiba did and god forbid they prioritize malik and bakura over him
  aki has a much higher chance of getting a figma than joey
  they havent touched anything outside of original yugioh though
  you got exactly what you deserved
  your taste is shit enough that im surprised you arent satisfied with the funko pops
  id kill for a tenma fig with a smug bastard face
    its also unironically superior
  fuck i would hot glue the living shit out of these
  glad to see someone else wants darkstalkers they really would make such great figure material but it seems every time a company sets out to make some they get cancelled of course they still manage to pump out statues of morrigan and felicia somehow
  strange not a bad idea though
  new thread stop posting here
old  
  is that liokaiser any good i saw the whole set for like 400 bucks earlier and this pic is kinda making me think i fucked up
  oh goodness no its a pile of crap its a miracle that one is even standing
my cats sulking because i wouldnt let her lick the trailer
    this is an exagerration but hes not worth more than like 350 i got him on sale as a set from bbts for 270 and thought it was a steal hes fine as whole but his leg set up is pretty shitty so you can do much leg posing without modding him rubber pads on feet plastic spacers in the knee joints to tighten them etc    from the thighs down combined hes iffy from the waist up hes fantastic individual bots are all great however
so i feel this was overlooked about the arcee roboobies kit that was shown but the normal chestplate looks to have fixed the gap issue on her side
    do you have a link to the page with the pics i cant find it
  would you say that it fills a niche space
  here they are click at risk facebook com / tfspirit/posts/1780722992053382
  what toy is this for
  ft rouge also reposting form the last thread tcp has tw legend class exhaust as well as ms traibreaker and blaster
  is there a combiner with actual good legs i cant think of one
    the rare gem that is maketoys guardia has more articulation than most chug figures be they combiners or not its a fuckin masterwork that needs a reissue because it was limited as shit for its first go round    poseidon is decent all around honestly hes just a fucking chunky boy which makes him a little limited in posing due to how thicc he is trinity force is good as well as long as you dont mind the explosion of a transformation    the unique toys combiners have good legs if you dont mind parts forming
  so weird that tw exhausts are getting to american retailers when its delayed to january in china then again they do sell for 15x the chinese price there
  the yes model version of guardia is dope so far and really cheap/easy to find
  i guess im on the fence between ms and tfe    aside from the fact that i dislike takaras idea of hyper realistic alt modes and hyper cartoony bot modes their just turn it inside out in 200 steps lmao engineering philosophy their focus on perfecting proportions at the expense of everything else the fact that they only care about the front look of figures and even then theyre getting lazy with that by having those ugly hinges on sunstreaker and mp44s chest plainly visible every redeeming quality about mp44 i can think of is just completely extinguished by the fucking laughable price point
any guess at what that stocking stuffer is for tfsource
i preordered him what am i in for
looks nice
  the unique toys combiners have good legs if you dont mind parts forming    maybe they do now     warlords legs are abysmally poor yes that is ancient by todays standards but theyre still inexcusably bad
can someone please tell me what search term to use to find the metallic bootleg of striker manus on aliexpress i can find the regular ko on there no problem just not the metallic ko people posted pics of in the last thread
  the metallic one isnt a ko but an upcoming release by mt themselves the kos are only available in regular striker manus and noir colors atm
    that would explain it thanks anon
i have this browser that got on a sale long ago and decided to move him after a year of just standing    and as you can see it stated to melt the plastic base with his feet do you have any stories of toys melting or stating to sweat oil or something similar
  what an epic story good stuff anyway what does his feet smell like now jutst wondering haha
  most plastics have substances called plasticizers added to the material to make it less brittle as the plastic ages the plasticizers begin to leak out
  but some degrade at faster rate than others  also color change and stuff and was interested to hear about noticeable examples
thats strange that it would leave puddles    even stranger is the stand that has no support for the figure is it a statue that was glued to the base    usually the last place for a toy to degrade is the area that sees less oxygen and light such as the feet when its standing up    if i had to guess the bowser plastic is leeching something from the bases plastic causing a bad chemical reaction to create those puddles  so its unlikely theres anything wrong with the toy itself its just the toy company has no clue what plastics/paints are safe this is why toy companies hire chemists to ensure shit like that happens or at least use various guides about that shit
i have a bunch of old evas that are stickier than a resin coated bong   eventually when i set up my detolf ill clean them with dish soap pose them and leave them in there til i move no much you can do with plastic when it gets like that
you must live in a humid hot area
  hotglue always helps in this situation
    are most figma  figuarts fucked in this way
  early figmas had that problem but the issues were solved    all toys will evenually leak their plasticizers but itll take decades    basically if you live in an armpit country or state the heat and moisture is going to make the plastics age faster     and large companies generally have chemists and labs to test plastics and paints to avoid issues so bandai mattel hasbro etc etc products will be more durable because of this
  stop cumming on your figures anon its gross
    yeah that really sucks i guess the best hope for this situation is that your favorite toys / series constantly get a new release once a decade

anyone know the preorder date for the kakyoin nendoroid
  damn thats one cool little knight not so often we get an medieval armored nendo its now difficult to chose between him or figma
moira nendo when 
meme    wheres my samurai calibur nendo gsc
is this a must buy /toy/
  well theres gridman
  if i say anything bad about this will i get banned
  probably
  oh shiiiit
springfield
rimuru
hisomasooooooooo
the land is cloaked in deepest blue
riko and reg
prof layton
cute
  rbc when
  hopefully soon
  that and nk and killer t
  super cute i dont know a lot about her but she seems great     yes i need to get wbc soon too theyll be so cute
  how are you on 4chan without even cursory knowledge of yotsuba
virtual youtuber edition  no one posted mito yet    how is this possible
  who she looks bland compared to all the other youtubers
  i know of her but not in detail
  its because she is normally just a face rig with the body of a typical school girl its all in her character that makes her interesting    i do hope they include some accessories from when she went 3d though like her human centipede entourage
is that an archer elf nendo
  no
    fucking yotsuba and danboard nendos  riko and reg painted look cuter than i ever imagined
  just dont give us a cheap bookmark for preorder bonus thats worth fuck all this time gsc  fucking cheap kisama 
  he come with any other hats or is he like ice kirby i just remember needle was yellow in some games
  can anyone please explain to me that if we ripped that fabric off does that mean shell be nude with tiddies and bushes  this is important
  more like the nendoroid doll blank body ie fucking nothing
  whats wrong with optimus nendo
  so were getting a literal barbie doll here then what were they fucking thinking
  mordred also comes with a helmet you know also get both
  a way for gsc to sell their own branded nendo clothes without draping them onto painted bodies/taking on the cupouche audience    i take it youve missed the news about this new subline to assume itd be even remotely anatomically correct
kaguya luna    am i the only one excited for her
  i was until i saw this was hoping to see it in color but i still cancelled my nendo anyway
  more for me
gallian chronicles on steam  remastered for ps4 and switch  valkyria chronicles 4    nendos when
  hoping for some silly expressions and good accessories
    yeah hoping for this expression myself  and if i can be even more hopeful maybe gsc could release a extra face set like they did with umaru yotsuba have a good amount of expression in the manga that would be nice to have with the nendo
  which would be better to buy this or the revoltech i want her to be cute and small but i also want her to be posable and have plenty of accessories
  theyre thinking that theyll appeal to the doll market this isnt genius level thinking here
  for most accessories youre gonna want revoltech but theres also the koyobukiya one which i think looks cuter
  cute and small  posable and have plenty of accessories  pick one
  thats exactly what im saying which of the two anon
  you could wait until we hear more about the nendo but it wont be as posable
  yeah youre right thank you for your advice
    i hope kaguya chan comes with speech bubble sound effects 3
  ice kirby came with his headband for the various martial arts copy abilities
  i wish he came with a kicking foot for the fighter kirby kinda hard to pose him with his normal feet
i wasnt planning on getting the jack frost at first but now that ive seen the pyro jack painted i feel the need to have the pair
  theres a set of kicking feet on shapewayscom you can order if you google it
japan hates her right  will we ever get a nendo despite disney and gsc releasing shit together all the time 
  if the monsters are supposedly a parallel to minorities why does she punch them
  obviously to protect the mewnie master race
  is that like a filthy frank joke because many animators seem to enjoy and emulate that sort of humour
  because theyre nazis
  request it
gsc didnt buy azure lane in time and now were stuck with statueshit and a dead line that releases mostly ocs and disney characters  i fucking hate my life
  at least we get virtual youtubers f8 and miku
  implying that gsc cant get the license to do azurshit later when theyre sure it will profitable
  is there something preventing gsc from getting the license if no then its only a matter of time until they get it
virtual youtubers are really annoying and i wish companies didnt waste their time on them theyre just as annoying as real life gayass lets players and reaction video content creators but cuter i aint buyin it eceleb worship is cancer no matter the form it takes    all i can picture is a nendo markiplier or jacksepticeye
  if these pieces of shit exist then anythings possible
  those are actually what i was thinking of when i was typing holy shit with some twine the chester is really exploitable
          truly best girl
    cccuute
  shes short
  oh my gosh shes so cute
  what do you mean pieces of shit    literally my favorite band and the most japaneseesque internationally popular band of all time why they have gundams etc too fight me faggot
  holy shit totally forgot about this abomination  are they cheap or expensive af now
  shot up after chesters death but has been coming back down i was able to find one cheap a few months back 5070 or so    and my fucking maid i hired for yesterday knocked it over and now im missing one of the cymbals god damnit
  sounds about right i tried watching some of these vyoutubers but found them boring though i had to get akari because i like her design
  fire her
  they were just talking about the nendos looking silly       its so weird that they havent made red blood cell before the platelet
  lolwas a oneday hire so i unfortunately cant reprimand her with an iron fist  i spent some time before she came even putting away loose figures into drawers so she wouldnt knock them over i thought this one was on a stable enough platform but i guess i was wrong  just let that be a lesson to everyone someone coming to clean etc clear your fucking toys and store them for the time being
  green chiyo  get on with the times gramps she was replaced by hiro a while ago
  get on with the times gramps she was dumped by hiro a while ago  she is no longer a mascot for 4chan/4channel
reddit nendo
  have you fall for the virtual youtuber meme  no  it confuses and slightly enrages me  it is just typical youtube lets play junk but with low poly waifus  i dont get it  that being said maybe if hatoba tsugus videos end up going in the creepypasta direction her first video kind of foreshadowed i might get her nendo

  no pics of the face without the eye flame  was hoping to see how bad the beg hole shows through the helm
      looks like not bad at all
    see even this one doesnt do a full frontal they know it looks like shit so they dont wanna show it off    look you can see the peg hole here
  oh man i been waiting for the chito and yuuri ones for awhile
  not very bad and theres probably a piece to stick in the spot where the led goes
  it doesnt really affect the grille on the front honestly
  i hope so but i highly doubt it
  shit now i want this too    jack frost not delayed  what are the chances they didnt as much preorders as they were expecting
  as an aside if youre like me and got the pop team epic nendos in order to do stupid face swaps be aware that pipimis head is completely nonstandard and popukos faceplace will likely not fit other nendos because it is wider and has much more prominent ears the only way to make them look good is in photos and only by using clever camera angles that hide the fact that the pieces dont fit
  can you post the faces and necks without hair alongside some regulars  also can you show us the back of pipimis head
    he looks like some edgy donut steel
  luna looks kinda flat in that yukata
  its a shame the yukata body isnt busty
  should i expect 10 bucks for shipping to the us on a nendo from amiami it makes it sound like its not gonna tell you until it drops next summer  im trying to see if its worth paying a little extra but if its closer to 15 or 20 it might make more sense to order it later from a domestic like crunchyroll
  if you use rsal then yes it will be about 89
is there a specific day the nendoroid jotaro kujo will be released ive heard its on januray 31 but i want to make sure what the actual date is
  sounds like a place holder they wont give the actual date until 2 weeks before
  where do i find the actual release date too ive been looking at 3rd party sites and im not sure if theyre right
  straight from the manufacturer
best oc vtuber nendo wen
  this  or lurk the nendo threads as the release info always is posted here
  sweet thanks mate
  oh right hes definitely going to replace her with that vtuber thing that looks absolute dogshit i wouldve rather he licensed green chiyo for a couple of years instead of that
  holy crap im tripping so many balls right now
  implying hiromoot is willing to pay fees for a licence in the first place  if even is he is willing to do so it would be better to go an extra mile and get the right to use best girl and make 4channel great again
  donut steel  kek
  here they are as you can see by themselves they are fine     pipimis head is on a ball joint thats completely unlike other nendos and the faceplate is slideon the hair/red bow does not come off its just attached to the back what i discovered just now is that the front of pipimis face actually fits a normal face peg joint     popukos face is roughly the same size as a normal nendo faceplate but as you can see its more squat and wider and the ears are not the same size at all pictured are the front/back of two popuko face plates the back of kaban and the front of sucy    cont
  most nendo faceplates are swappable with no issue as they are the same size sucys face fits perfectly on kaban    i can put popukos face on kaban and pipimis head can go on serval and from the bottomleft photo you cant really tell anythings wrong because the camera angle doesnt show it but looking from the side you can see that popukos ears are too big and dont fit into the ones molded for kaban and most other nendos and pipimi doesnt have a head back i could probably have made the face swaps look a bit better if i spent some time adjusting the hair and setting up proper lighting and camera positions but it takes some work and isnt just as simple as swapping some plastic pieces around
  
  loled on those kaban  serval swap faces  i think pipimi would look better as kaban and popuko as serval imo
    they made these as thanks because the band helped when japan had a tsunami and earthquake years ago i think thats much different than some lets player loser bullshit
whats the virtual youtuber power ranking i know nextto nothing when it comes to these girls outside kizina are the other girls even popular    i dont know i dont care about lpers masking themselves as anime girls with cheap facial animations
  i think a few of them are moderately popular  i am betting the main reason we are getting so many figures is that they have meme cred which is a huge seller in japan and they are dirt cheap to work with
  4chanss mascot wont be a loli  not only wont it be a loli it will be a fucking vtuber  these are dark times
  when are we getting a decent articulated platinum ver sakura figure
is there an predicted date for nanachi im unable to pick it up later in december
  next month we dont know anything more than that
finally shipped  cant wait for pyro to release the two will look so great together    really hoping gsc will give us more non persona megaten stuff a figma or nendo for any of the mainline protagonists would be great to see
  kizuna ai is the only one that actually managed to become a multimedia success kaguya luna has a decent following and the rest are all literallywhos outside of their niche follower bases as another anon mentioned were probably getting so many because theyre dirtcheap to make and license and the sort of people into this whole virtual youtuber thing in the first place have a lot of disposable income that gsc wants
  with pyro jack coming i wonder if well see more jack brothers id love to see a black frost at least
          june 2019 release  gsc bonus clear bookmark sakura kinomoto clear ver
          july 2019 release
      august 2019 release
shizue reissue     april 2019 release
  again damn
its a crime that they didnt make a nendo of my wife chiyo i however believe there is still hope
  seeing as how much they love to recycle molds just look at all the different versions of kirby and megaman they made i feel like black frost is almost guareented simply because it wpuld be so easy to make demoneeho or really anything not persona would be exciting to see wonfes isnt too far off febuary 19th i believe hopefully with smtv getting nearer we can see more stuff from the series
  that smash hype tho
  ricina ia and that drunk girl are the only ones i know
  id love to see a black frost at least    black frost and mothman are my goto demons where available thisd be fantastic i wouldnt mind more humanoid demons with the standard nendo faceplate setup like angel or pixie though
  angel  white wings or blue wings
  its nendoroids why not both
toot      
      tfw gsc fully acknowledges smash hype  tfw still will never release a captain falcon or any smash related figures
  tfw mods locked her mfc comments section because of gorofags  tfw mods blocked the main gorofags ability to comment on figures and banned their alt account  what a fucking ride sometimes i wonder if its on purpose but then they always act surprised
      looks like a early 200s nendoroid
  my early 200 nendos take offense to that seriously she looks so bland to me shame that the same manufacturer is doing the post apocalyptic potatoes
just got aqua it was worth the price just for this face plate
  aqua has some great faces
  still will never release a captain falcon or any smash related figures  that could be because gsc have not the license of any of those characters in the first place
  damn i must have missed it ive seen that spergs antics before it was only a matter of time mfc users have some of the funniest tantrums ive ever seen    anyways i hope that they also make nendos of the phantom thieves in their casual clothes ann yusuke and haru in particular would be adorable
do you guys resell your nendoroids i bought elise from fire emblem when she first came out not because i especially enjoyed the game she was from but because i thought she had such a cute design and i love drill hair but compared to my other figures i dont get very much enjoyment out of her and it probably is because i only purchased her for her aesthetics so ive been playing with the idea of selling her and putting the money towards toys i have more of a connection with elise goes to someone who would probably really appreciate her and i get some extra cash seems like a great idea but i have this pack rat mentality and its very difficult for me to get rid of anything just when ive convinced myself to sell her ill look at her on my shelf and think she looks so cute and ill regret it if i let her go and yes i know i over think things thats my problem     just curious if anyone else struggles with selling their toys
  i understand what you mean honestly its ok to sell her if i were you sure its nice aesthetics but you can always just look at pics for that plus now that youve had the experience but arent that attached to the character its a better bet to sell her to make room for more that youll actually like shell be outta your mind before you know it
  too many people buy without much thought for me ill think about each and every figure i want for days sometimes weeks before actually buying it now i have a collection that is smaller then most users here but theres no purchase i regret seeong all the people here who buy characters they dont even know always seemed ridiculous to me    if you really dont see yourself thinking about the figure then just sell it anon you can sell it and use the money for a nendo you will be much happier owning
  sell away as you said its bought by someone who actually cares about the character and you get extra cash and space to display something else that you care more about besides looks which are still important but buying for looks alone is an express ticket to buyers remorse land
its not quite the revoltech but thats a pretty good woody
  that buzz face is pretty tempting
  id want to sell some of my nendos/figmas/whatevers but literally no one i know collects them so they stay on my shelf regardless
separated at birth
  i hope for a rape face for the woody nendo but knoeing disney they probably would try to prevent this to happen again seeing how the second revo woody doesnt came with that face
  that mios been through some shit
  raphael when i saw sculpts of it way back
  the fuck happened to that mio
knoe
  yeah mods cleaned up the comments before locking it then that one user got blocked by the mods after sperging about it on their twitter    casual versions of the pt would be great and considering how their masks arent attached to their faces itd give us more choices for faceplates per member
  fuck i would love to get her nendo also pic related needs one

  im full aware that its a never ever but i wish bandai would share at least a little since they killed off chibiarts
hows your day going fellow nendofags just got my invoice for kamina   tried doing something with my phone  comments appreciated
  ive got senbonzakura miku in the mail so today is a good day
  just curious if anyone else struggles with selling their toys    yes but not because im not sure if i want to sell its because i live in a shithole that doesnt have much of a fanbase to the things i want to sell and selling internationally is a fucking hassle
  nice props
  where do you live
  sucys hair and lottes face right    i have akko and diana on preorder and now im wondering if i should combo something with them assuming they do get released on time in december
  im guessing mexico or some other 3rd world country
  country girls make do
  might be the first time i buy a nendo from a series ive never seen i like how blocky he his and that face plate is pretty great
  reissuing a figure theyve already made from an established and popular ip because smash caused a spike in demand and making an entirely new figure from a niche series that hasnt had a game in like a decade because of smash memes are two very different things
  got my shipping confirmation for kamina today so pretty excited for him too but it wont matter if my mailman keeps losing my packages i bought figuarts bulma and she was confirmed delivered but i came home to an empty mailbox
  you should go to the post office to ask if theyve kept it ive had it happen to me a couple of times
  and selling internationally is a fucking hassle  how so
  currency exchanges probably although paypal takes care of that
    my guess would be tracking/insurance for international packages is crazy expensive and without that theres a good chance of you getting screwed over if the person decides to make a paypal claim
  tracking/insurance for international packages is crazy expensive  seconding this it doesnt make much sense for the seller or the buyer unless the thing in question is really expensive/rare to begin with
  yea the tracking would cost just as much or more than most nendos
whens train miku
  14 usd to cad exchange rate  more like payjew
  midmarket is 132 so 14 is pretty reasonable for the end user
has anyone here actually ordered custom faces
4 seasons each one outselling the last with an upcoming 5th  all we have as far as nendos are concerned is this from back in s1 the other trio doesnt even have official figures in general that i know of  is there some kind of licensing hell like bnha im missing did these 3 not sell well or something i get that a big chunk of its sales are because of nana but it still pisses me off that i cant have the full team
    is the top listing there legit i hear toy zany have sold bootlegs before but im not aware of this ever being bootlegged
    it has been bootlegged    
  not him but how does that link prove that there are bootlegs
i am impatiently waiting for the yellow kirby now  i hope they reveal a red one when its put up for preorder
  id say its only a matter of time until they do
  if theres any chance then theyd be showing up with the upcoming season  iknowspoilersdontworkon/toy/dainsleif versions when/butiwishspoilersdid
  the item ships from china use your brain
snow miku 2019
  aw she looks so pretty but why so many mikus or were the releases just really miku concentrated lately
  super cute princess miku
  id guess the latter there are new snow and racing mikus every year and then some other designs
  its never going to happen well get another rabbit costume chris statue and that will be it
  but it doesnt prove it which was my question
  99 of figs that come from china are bootlegs sure theres still that 1 but its not worth the risk
  most bootlegs come from china unless the listing is from the official company or if being sold by a person doesnt have pictures of the product then its a scam
  i already have the case myself but im curious about how some random seller proves anything      yeah i mean i wouldnt order that item either just thinking out loud here
  well recently i bought a used figure from ebay and the person had pictures he had taken of the figure showing the figures condition it was legitimate
  nendoroid 1000 will be a snow miku  predictable but fitting
  pretty but her face looks a bit plain/boring compared to other mikus everything else is really nice though and im sure shell look cute with other miku faces
  shell most likely come with other face plates they may make it nicer
    looks like its buzzs turn
  i meant more the artstyle of her eyes but her alt faces will probably be cuter yeah
  revo woody and nendo buzz at the same time  a match made in hell
  well get another rabbit costume chris statue  i hate bunnysuits so much
  new snow new racing new mirai then occasional additional ones as well as reissues and updated versions   this year has been kinda heavy on mikus though what with all then anniversaries and special editions
so close yet so far
  what is the tiny white creature they keep putting snow miku with anyway
  yukine who first appeared with the 2014 snow miku and proved to be a popular addition so hes shown up ever since
nendoroid more thor extention set for thor
    so what is the consensus on these nonnendoroid looking nendoroids those two in particular look great imho but since you obviously cant swap the faces is it a big minus for collectors
  its only a minus for people who like nendoroids for their interoperability this works fine for people who just like the aesthetic
finally  after a preorder that took half a year to complete i have my nendo kizuna ai  shes adorable and come with lots of stuff  her face when browsing /b/
  i really love that smugness  well worth preordering
    aw she looks really cute im excited for my nendos now
  youre kizuna is on her way  you will not regret it
  i didnt order kizuna but you getting yours just makes me excited d
  whos more smug
  you should order one while shes still available at nonscalpy prices      kasane teto nendo  so much want  do they also have akita neru and yowane haku
  no and i die a little every time i remember that
  looking for nendoroid kasane teto on mandrake  sold out of course  ebay  aw fuck you    well theres at least the petit option to get all the girls /
  shes available used on amiami
      now you need kaguyachan
pic related did not get delayed and ships next week  now im realizing that due to previous delays i will have nendos raining down on me this month like confetti if the december ones dont get delayed
  its luna chan not kagura but good reccomendation
  no creepy pervert face no buy
  the 2nd run of the creepy woody didnt have the creepy face so its not surprising for them to leave it out
  wait until they reveal the other faces to complain of course if gsc doesnt include a rape face it will be a deal breaker
  different companies regardless i doubt goodsmile even thought of adding in a creepy pervert face why would they because another toy company memed about it do toy companies release products playing off of each others various versions i somehow doubt that
  later buddy
  too cold here for kamina to pierce the heavens
hey guys i just got isabelle here really love her in fact im even getting the regular version to go with this winter version however what i wanted to do was to find a way to stick this foam retsuko head on her body is there a diy way to get this done maybe just as plastic to peg to puti n the neck hole but what kind and where can i get one is there anyway to at least it articulated
  what does the bottom of the head look like could you make a little hole and put in a neck joint
  where did you got that retsuko senpai
  got her from my local comic book store besides comics they were also selling blind bags and random anime stuff
  depends on how hard the head is you can probably get a mold of a nendo neck joint make a socket for it out of plastic and glue your socket into the foam head
  its flat the thing is that the head is pretty much a stress ball so im not sure what putting a hole wold do i was thinking maybe gluing some sort of base then the peg
  adding a base could work but it would most likely be visible and if the head is hollow then putting a hole in it might not be a good idea
  thinking about it maybe if the base is thin enoiugh to not be seen it might work if not i could paint it the same color as retuskos head im going to have to take a trip to the hobby shop and see what i can find will update when i got something
  then you would have to shorten the neck joint to fit in the base

  the mars mission game was kino af
  what happened lehman brothers
  those fukkin tubes man
  parents decided not to buy it at the time when we where at the store and instead wanted to buy it after christmas new years little did they know that was the last year the mars mission theme was going on
  thats not mtron  thats not orange transparent chainsaw
  it was the star craft 2 one right good times
  with all that exposed technic yeah right
  i remember getting the eagle command base for christmas 2007 good times
  crystalienreduxcom  its still a very nice game
  glad theres at least someone here with common sense  i certainly havent been keeping that thread going for over a god damn month for it not to be rightfully acknowledged
  no just no simply the most unplayable theme lego has ever made the sets are flimsy and not childfriendly   it has god tier pieces though
  awful theme not even in the top 10 you pathetic fuck best post 2000 space theme is space police 3 and thats a goddamn fact
  space police was pretty kino  but did it had multiple modular vehicles
  no it was actually time cruisers     hey do i want a pirate ship or a spaceship    yes please thanks for all the cool helmets from all the other themes dummies
  alien conquest was superior tho
  mars mission was good but i preferred life on mars mars missions alien concept was less inspired
  i only had the crystal reaper was a damn fun toy though also the martian ship aesthetic was cool as hell
combatdriven space theme    absolutely disgusting
good video here lego rewind ep2 life on mars/mars mission    
  mtron spacemen drink onions milk while the mars mission spacemen drink the blood of slain aliens
      it was literally a reskin of the original command and conquer and it was awesom
  aliens sucked in it the invasion ufo line from 2011 or 2012 was much better
bitch pls
  i feel like im obligated to plug bionicle but for system sets i dont think mars mission could be beat what a rush of nostalgia anon thanks for reminding me   i only ever had pic related and a few of the smaller sets but they were awesome
it pisses me off to no end that they seem to feel star wars is sufficient and hasnt put out any of their own space designs gotta be a lot of frustrated designers with piles of cool shit in the pipe
forgetting based exoforce
lego time cruisers/time twisters was the best lego theme ever and also a brilliant economic strategy fight me
  i agree with you
time cruisers was a clusterfuck and even as a id i saw through the thinly veiled excuse to reuse parts     only thing going for it was the mechanical motion which could have served just as well in any number of themes
  its weird when lego themselves mixes themes its bad
  i liked the clusterfuck aspect though it felt like they had to keep rebuilding their ships with different eras parts plus it was a nice way to unite all the existing themes
  money wise it was probably a good idea to get rid of a bunch of old pieces and shit like that thematically it was shit
  brilliant economic strategy  what do you mean
  oh no we ran out of ideas for themes  oh no we need a new theme or else well have to resell old stuff people already have  i know lets put ghosts cowboys and flying boats in one set well call it wacky crazy adventure smashers genius
why do older afol seem to hate this so much i mean in general they have a hate boner for most midlate 90s theme but this one in particular gets a lot of hate
  i see
  maybe because its a bit of an eyesore its called time cruisers but they dont seem to have a futuristic aspect and rely on pastime designs using wheels and propellers instead of something spaceagey or neoncyber pieces    plus a lot of the builds use bland colors or colors that dont mix well
    i kind of wish we had a theme that was like that you could say ninjago is basically that but ninjago still has a level of consistency and also internal timeline what im talking about is literally like a lego version of kamen rider decade every single theme from the past 25 years being brought back in someway and the plot is we have to use these themes of the past to save the future
id like to think that it wasnt the way you say it was strategy to reuse parts but rather that someone landed the master builder contract and let his kids do the magic and just fucking put the clusterfuck of bricks into autismo builds and gave it some lore
i actually liked this theme i even had the board game
  its called time cruisers but they dont seem to have a futuristic aspect and rely on pastime designs using wheels and propellers instead of something spaceagey or neoncyber pieces    thats why i liked it though
  afols are like geewunners they just hate anything they didnt grow up with beyond any reason or logic
  counterpoint the builds look like they were put together by a child theres no real sense of cohesion with the colors and they did a poor job marketing the interesting technicbased functions of the sets as a kid i didnt even register it as a real lego theme i first thought it was just the result of some kid winning a contest to have their mocs turned into real sets
    time cruisers missed an opportunity they should given all of the pirates to a regular pirate ship  extra parts to turn it into a time machine
  i like steampunk too but its attempt at being steampunk itself was more reliant on your own imagination
  i had one of these it was like a biplane with bat wings or something
  in hindsight were they really in that position though the decline didnt really start til 19971998 and 1999 was when they really reached the dead end place where theyd have to do that star wars barely saved them thanks to the phantom menace hype and wisely doing ot sets too in case the movie failed    personally i liked the hodgepodge willy wonkalike quality of the sets
  this looks fucking awesome
  awesome i once made a timecruiser moc but i was too lazy to photograph it also if anything i found it really hard to integrate parts in a way that gave it the clusterfuck look it kind of just ended up being a spaceship with lattice windows and taps for controllers also the technic functionality was seriously lacking so i guess having gone through that i appreciate what lego was able to accomplish
  this the professor looked like an unhinged dude who was building his shit out of stuff he got from scrapyards      a lot of current lego fans were either in their dark ages around the era of time cruisers or were too young to even be into lego back then i was about 10 when time cruisers came out and my friend and i loved it because it provided a means for crossplay with all of our sets we used to do epic time travel stories all that madness i remember he had most of the time twister sets but i had the flying time ship i used to struggle to carry it to his house while riding my bike all the time luckily there were never any accidents    even if it was just lego finding a way to deplete surplus random pieces it was a pretty fucking clever way i think the grand majority of hate for time cruisers came from casuals who got into lego through the movie a few years ago where everything had a clearly defined theme and then they looked through lego history and saw these time cruisers sets which had no identifiable theme and it made them confused and angry
  i experienced time cruisers as a kid and thought the theme was weird and probably too young to think of it as lazy wasnt overly impressed by it    however i had also been too young to have gotten the ghosts train cab and other elements that had been in sets years prior so i was very glad of an opportunity to acquire them
 oh man loved that set as a kid
old thread  
theres already a new thread pal
mp44 is a definite skip for me that backpack is giving me mp28 flashbacks
  its going to be very entertaining seeing how many people try to justify the cost though
  it looks like it leaped off my parents television in 1984 ok
  what are the best props for displaying with transformers anons do you use dollhouse props or just energon cubes/guns etc
  i occasionally will check out the miniatures section at hobby lobby or michaels for props you can sometimes find some good stuff
  this theres a ton of stuff that you can get cheap to use with your bots or other figures
    the only super accurate to the g1 animation masterpiece that ended up goodlooking was megatron and that is only because they based his proportions on the movie scenes instead of the shitty cheap cartoons animation model    so i ask why the fuck didnt they do that for optimus too
leaked concept art of op from the bumblebee movie do you like it /tfg/ would you guys want a /toy/ of him
  i cant really justify the 450 but japanese shops with it at 370ish make it a bit easier to buy   also lol dick off tfsource
    why are you being autistic like that why lie on the internet for reactions
  it literally looks like the worst of g1 and bayformers in one bot the muh 80s cartoon aesthetic mixed with the alien humanoid proportions of bays preearth designs no thanks
  how is this a lie its legit concept art of optimus from the movie
    its on deviantart its fan art we have already fucking seen what he looks like in the actual movie    
  has anyone confirmed whether or not those construction dudes are the same scale as the dianauts     if this mp doubles as a battle convoy for the diaclone reboot then fuck me ill have to consider it
  shame they didnt included a targetmaster
  the boys are back in town
  i didnt expect a targetmaster but i hope siege will provide one they actually gave him a white hand he compliments jazz perfectly im delighted
  so they can make that one the mp 60
  its the same character model genius
  really like it but 27 shipped is steep
  how long until we get a inferno to artfire conversion kit
  chinese web exclusives are siege molds      american web exclusives are potp repaints    its true hasbro is moving to china
  hasbro is moving to china  didnt they moved out of china like 4 years ago
ricochet might be an ee exclusive    fuck me
  i loke that pyra magna/inferno mold
  made by a autistic loser best ignore it like everyone does for him in his real life      if they dont collect anything else i dont think itd be a problem to them
  ricochet looks like shit with those random with patches in car mode    easy pass
so slamdance is probably going to be a cog retool or two micromasters battle patrol and airstrike patrol maybe or maybe even a mixandmatch of parts between him and sixgun  and leader prime could be any number of things a retool of um or a repaint of the voyager with a trailer addon  but greenlight thats pretty fucking obscure whats even the point  they just wanted to complete the set    part of me wonders if originally elita 1 was supposed to have a groove retool chromia but that became wreck gar and they were going to do the same for greenlight and when they scrapped the idea they just decided to use the head again    were assuming shell be a retool of chromia of course but its possible given this line she might be someone else they could pull a wildcard and make her a retool of sixgun or reflector
  yet the thread is perfectly fine and was made before this one
  tough the people have voted
  yeah and it was her turn
  fuck off      kek
  so slamdance is probably going to be a cog retool or two micromasters battle patrol and airstrike patrol maybe or maybe even a mixandmatch of parts between him and sixgun    slamdance  basically a jet and tank duocon    you somehow ignored the one actual tank/jet duocon mold
    shit server senpai
        only poorfags would want this garbage
    i need to check that out i need some furniture and hats for my transformers
  but im rich
  youre going to be paying at least 400 on that japanese order with shipping though
  cause hes the reverse of slamdance  slamdance has a jet for legs and a mini tank for torso arms  guess i just have high hopes
theres no way im buying a full seeker set of that mold im sure its fine but i dont want a team of spacejets            he looks good but it seems bizzare that theres no targetmaster when they packaged the last exclusive toys with extra stuff
who was asking for an optimus prime with a weird fucking cylindrical head
  my guess is they want fracas and the nightstick they may or may not make as regular releases since youd probably want more than one so you could give one to scourge    aimless is stuck in a set so lets see if its a special variant or thats the only way to get it
    yo like wheres her eyes
  aimless is stuck in a set    no hes wave two
  well then hold out to see what the skywarp battle set is going to be  hes a voyager but hes priced like a leader which suggests hell come with either battle masters a deluxe or maybe a slew of micromasters  skywarp leads all four air strike patrol  id get behind that
  youre right theres another bot thats in the firestormer pack with a name that starts with ai so i jumped the gun
  just know that theres two areas that have miniatures stuff at both stores the model making section and the doll houses section
one limb left to complete sharpshooter the targetmaster combiner
  welp the greebles still look awful
  then you have low standards the generations ricochet is way better than this junk
  i really want to like this starscream because the rest of the siege line has been hitting all the right notes for me and i want a starscream this fucker aesthetically looks like he came straight out of classics though what the fuck
  combiner made of various factions    retarded
  starts with ai  the problem is theres a fuckton of characters whos name starts with ai  airfill in the blank  aimless  even aileron who could easily be a prowl retool  and since the first two on that list are deluxes the third is likely one too
  the tism is strong in this one
  youre talking to the fandom that thinks third parties halfassing thousand dollar scramble combiners by just using the official configuration is justified
potp red swoop finally exists as a bbts exclusive   theres also ricochet up too
  ignore the bbts exclusive part
  too bad the gray plastic looks like garbage even if you try to switch it with a regular swoop youre still going to need to unpin the wings
  just buy a can of silver paint jesus fuck
apparently hes been delayed to april for some reason
oh no nononononono          looks like that price hike was too much for wagies and preorders were looking bad    say it with me now    fourty four    dead    on     arrival
  your link says nothing about preorders looking bad though
  cheers
  its just some poor baby trying to make others worry since he cant afford a high dollar toy
  that wouldnt match the other four dinobots though
  this i already have my preorder for mp44 and mp megatron in im willing to pay a premium for quality products unlike poorfags who have to settle for trash    if you arent buying mp44 you dont deserve to use this board period
  whats wrong with the head
  no reason to be an elite autist
  seriously ive got megatron ordered but im going to wait and think about mp44 because theres about as many things i like about it as things i dont and considering its more expensive than a console im not sure i want to be paying for compromise
  its the same head optimus always has but its on a toy he doesnt like so its the worst head ever
  im just saying that there is so much shit flinging here is disappointing a little common courtesy would be nice instead of shit talking something and everyone who wants or doesnt want a item
  thats pretty much how the entire site works new friend
  no its how you keep trying to force these threads to work go back to tfw or allspark or something
its nice to see that ironhide is taller than most deluxes fingers crossed these arent his final colors and he looks how he did at sdcc
  im willing to pay a premium for quality products unlike poorfags who have to settle for trash    wheres your tarn then clearly if youre so rich and not an autist you can look past the nontransforming part to recognise this is what bang for your buck looks like
  im glad itd only need a new head and a crane to become energon inferno
  shit character  doesnt transform  bang for your buck
  not big on those grey arms but this toy looks awesome otherwise
  they might be all the other toys molded/painted toys that werent 100 done had stickers on them saying the colors werent final    i dont see that sticker on him but i really hope they arent final
  garbage bayformer who cant stop talking about how progressive and gay he is  yeah pass
  those icky gray arms  those disgusting grey wheels  yikes glad my standards are better
  he actually sits there and transforms his figures like a fucking child  he actually wants compromised sculpts just so he can roll it around in the sandbox like a baby    oh my god youre fucking joking why would you want something that has less shelf presence when you can just buy a model car    grow the fuck up
  yeah nice try tarn isnt any of those things hes basically a deus vult type of deception who loves his cause so much that he wears it as a faceplate      packed with a fuckton of detail  currently the most articulated transformers figure who can do any pose and make it look natural  light up feature  actual battle damaged extra parts that dont look like shitty paint smears
  based but it belongs here 
  reeeeee get boobies away
  that head looks like an egg more than usual
buy battle patrol  big shot is broken in half straight out of packaging   contact hasbro  here have a shadow raider  thanks i havent seen a transformer movie since rotf it also costs a lot more than micro masters
kinda hurts knowing there likely wont be anything seen toy wise of blitzwing until nytf
  they probably had no legends available so they moved up to the next class why a shadow raider and not a potp deluxe i have no idea
  it was either that or crowbar gotta get rid of the shelfwarmer stock somehow
  you mean starscream
  shelf presence  kill yourself bobo memeface
so what do the japanese think of the price point anyone seen or heard anything
    tarn is a grimdark edgelord and fucking sucks yep it doesnt transform also true     still the best transformers figure out now
  sorry you dropped a hundred on an articulated statue
  try 400
  400  lmaoing  ure life
  after getting fucked over by bandai sentinel arcadia etc pricing its just another day tot hem
  is this a meme because i feel like were on several layers of irony here
  its a shitty bait thread  durr you cant talk about cartoons or comics because i said so  im 90 sure hes kirafag too so doublefuck him    unfortunately the mods will probably make discussion migrate there when this thread autos because they wont read the threads to see what theyre getting reports about it happened with the laugh at geewunners thread a few months back
big boi
snagged mp roadrage from hlj recently during the black friday sale for 25 bucks i like her so far except for the way her wingpack just sort of floats probably gonna get some articulated hands for her
  im so divided on if i want him or not on one hand i want him for my mpbeast wars and i know he wont get kod because no other bw mp has been hes also 320 for a simplistic transformation minimum accessories and what looks like rather mediocre articulation compared to things like dinobot mp44 prime and megatron
  honestly he seems like he might be cancelled if he even comes out youre probably looking at him going on clearance pretty soon preorders arent going so hot
  what evidence is there for lack of preorders
  after what i heard about dinobots shoulder joints i decided to pass i also dont really care for that huge as fuck stand that takara shipped with dinobot it makes it look like hes always fighting in some dirty gray hangar
has anyone actually picked up any of the keychains / pins / keshi made for sciolis gi joe vs transformers series    i loved that series and sciolis art and how the whole think looks like it came from the mind and hands of a gifted 8year old given a cup of adderall and stuck in a room with nothing but toys and markers for a month    my local store doesnt want to order a case because they are stupid blind bagged and all i really want are just a few of them
  those grey arms stick out like sore thumbs his thighs are too short and his entire torso looks like shit
  anybody who buys mp44 is doing this entire community a diservice by allowing takara to get away with such greed amd predatory tactics
  goddamn i actually want those i loved that comic
feels good to almost be done with my toybased mp collection i just wanted updates of all the diaclonebased guys since alternators and im almost done now dont care about most of the minibots except cliffjumper brawn and the 85 guys the xtb cliffjumper suits my needs well and fans toys has some good stuff coming up 3p has got me on jazz skids option is kinda trash thoughdinobots of course are 3p all i need now is a good blaster and perceptor and my autobot collection is damn near complete i feel no need to double dip on toy based options
  by not buying it youre telling takara that you dont want quality toys and just want babyshit
  so what youll just stop buying toys then do you even care about transformers why not just buy statues
  no i buy lots of other transformers and toys in general but in terms of g1 inspired stuff ive made it a point not to buy any similar looking toys again unless theyre significantly better than the mps i have thats why im sitting out potp im all for getting new designs or homages to later series though i think armada deserves a good set of new figures for example
  that comic deserves proper toys its the most fun tf media i read in ages and the designs are legitimately pretty cool
  fuck thats gorgeous
  well if everyone reported the other thread for the spam that it is
  what about this optimus make it any better than mp megatron
  sounds like you just cannot afford it
    hes doing a gobots comic right now    one of my favorite things about his tvg comic was how the joes always referred to the transformers as gobots
only a matter of time before they did this repaint i guess
  the combiner art for elita shows her with a black jazz as her right leg this was always the plan
  i am skipping siege as i am eagerly waiting for travisknightverse cybertronians    it seems like we will get studio series dotm optimus with jetpack as a leader so next year there may be more slots for bumblebee film characters and then they will just do the remaining guys from dotm aoe and tlk probably wont get much and many of their ones in studio series now are just old moulds
  go to tfw2005 then pussy
  not really we had tons of it was always the plan that didnt pan out remember waverider he had a mold and should have been released in potp and guess what happened to him    the fact stepper got released is a miracle
  a plan not panning out doesnt change that it was always the plan they planned to release ricochet they carried it out if they hadnt that wouldnt change that it had been the plan
  i cannot afford mongoloids to continue thinking this is an acceptable aesthetic much less worth 440   i said it before and ill say it again todays masterpiece figures have gone full 3p with their overengineered retardation that just ends up looking crap and makes handling them a ballache
  easier to dodge shit here than wade through it there miss sandy asshole
  mp megatron was a step in the right direction but mp44 is the culmination of what transformers should be    stop being poor
  no eyes  for justice is blind
  id be pretty cool if more new characters got toys in this line we already got the centurion drone so lets see if they keep adding weird stuff like that
  not sure why color makes it more noticeable   but his shoulders are a really weird looking combo of too low on the body and sticking out form it too much
  durr you cant talk about cartoons or comics because i said so  actually its because its the rules you discuss toys in a toy board not comics or movies
  fuck off kirafag go get banned for two weeks again
  looks like normal jazz
  so you cant refute what i said then got it
  i said the right leg
    id love more autotroopers or the legislators like in the panel or just general big drone army builder types
  the one in firestormer set is still aimless according to the chinese
anyone interested in transformers heromashers customs
any anons here good at digibashing
  im getting decent at it
  still wrong
  if possible could you one of cw chop shop colored like bw scarem ive been thinking of doing it as a custom and want to see what it could look like digitally first
      desu i dont mind it being delayed it gives me a couple more months to save up for it and now ill feel a little less terrible about the other 200 worth of stuff i preordered that was going to ship alongside it
  while im not the biggest fan of the over reliance on looking cartoon accurate most of the newer mps are very sturdy when it comes to holding together in robot mode
  not him but heres a quick shop
  go get banned for two weeks again
  forgot the arms
dunno if this is old news but amazon is running rodimus unicronus the black potp rodimus prime repaint for like 25 if anyone was on the fence about getting him
  thanks bro    blackwing is 644 too if anyone wanted to bother
    thanks anon this is exactly what i wanted
  youre getting played for 440
  why is it so much
add items on sale to cart  shipping ends up costing more than the products in itself still have to pay a shit ton  kinda defeats the purpose  how many times has that happened to you
  probably a lot of factors i have a feeling that these mps are becoming harder and harder to price cheaply and that takara is feeling some pressure from lower sales
  same reason why encore has jacked up the price so much on the latest releases  low sales have to be compensated somehow better to at least get something out of the ones that actually buy them
  never because im american
goddamn i wish i didnt wake up so early turns out targets are starting to release siege figures in my town so heads up to everyone still waiting for their brick and mortar releases
  free shipping but shipping cost is added to item price  discounted item but discount is added to shipping cost  rules of the universe
  transformers is a toybased property and the media is made to sell them therefore its toyrelevant and belongs here now go wash kiras clear jizz off your face you dense motherfucker
  the backpack is meant to hook into the car doors making up the sides of her torso with some slot/tabs but its not terribly secure    you can try tightening it by putting a bit of floor polish on the tab/slot to make them stick together a bit better
  because hes an idiot who cant buy it from any site who will be offering it at a lower price he probably shops at bbts and wonders why toys cost so much
  prices increase  sales drop   price increases more to compensate  sales drop    the cycle continues       buy from nipnong sites for a 30 dollar discount  pay 30 dollars in shipping  buy domestically for full price  free shipping
  implying the discounts on japanese sites are only 30 dollars when the thing is as expensive as this one  kek dumb walmartonly buyer
  thicc
  i love how you dont even have a counter argument to what i said also im not that faggot kiraposter either
  bought a swoop literally an hour before these are revealed  i think i like that colour better anyway especially the golden head
based 4channel ads
  all american retailers are offering it for the same price not to mention save for hlj youre sol if your copy has qc issues or something theres also the matter of shipping unless your in europe or asia your not really saving that much
  shame its a lame figure /
maga jazz sells for 7 on amazon    this is what they call winning i guess    its proven that stuff targeted to sjws doesnt sell though    nor does shit with your branding on it but im sure you can pretend its not the same thing
  have you lost your mind
  well make up for lower sales by raising the price and ensuring it sells fewer copies    takara goes under hasbro cant afford to buy them out or even the brand because 3rd party and mlp being crap have tanked their toy sales    buhbuhbut the sjw sw is why    bullfuckingshit these fags are too cowardly to admit its 3p killing them bad and the hateful conservatives like diversity  comics are too busy pushing a narrative to admit it too because they cant magically blame the imagined sjw menace on this get used to it in a few years official shit will be dead and only superior 3p will remain
  true beats being told how to enlarge my penis by sexy older women in my area who know how to become rich but are being shut down by millionaires who are shocked how celebrities today look though
  or games that cant be played by under 25s
  you again seriously
well this paint job looks pretty sweet  that face    goddammnit its even more of an amorphous blob than the jazz one  how did they not learn from their mistake
  is the jazz mold actually as bad as people say maga memes aside it actually looks kinda cool
  this amorphous blob is 20   for the price of 4 of them you can get this version of the character instead
  maga jazz  cybertronian based black guy  civnats will never learn
  the shoulders are shit and the forearms a mystery
  its a bad shellformer mess with much of the car just being clear plastic kibble much of which had to be painted over to please the 30 manchildren who insist on clear windows to see robot kibble inside the shoulders are crap and both limb modes suffer terribly from the giant car kibble either hanging loose or pegging in very poorly on the 2 waferthin tabs it tries to rely on to keep in place    but since trumpets think star wars isnt a hit because it pandered to sjws rather than the solo movie just being poor and competing with 2 other blockbusterschrist even oafenet couldnt defend it id refer to feel this toy sells like shit because some asshole stamped maga on it rather than it being a crap toy hey its okay when /pol/ does it
  culmination of what transformers should be    so ridiculously overpriced over engineered panel/shellformers with gratuitous backpacks and paint chips all over the place     have fun with that my dude
wonder of if my order gets cancelled
  there is already three different versions of this guy using more modern molds with the latest using the rid jazz mold and didnt the g1 rerelease not even sell i dont understand why they think redoing every jazz mold as this super obscure japanese character would be a good idea
  warden  having a good idea  ever  good one next youll try to tell me kira is a woman
  cant you get that shelfwarming piece of shit for like 8 at retail now
  he cant go his entire life without having a good idea at some point he has to get the idea to retire
    you sound bitter that nearly every classics figure has been replaced
  warden has been the only one to consistently get proportions right regardless of limitations in budget and engineering  get fucked archerfag
god i know these arent worth the price but i am a 100 sucker for tiny robots especially targetmasters and micromasters hasbro totally has my number on this line    decepticon plane bros confirmed for the best
  toysrus germany still sells him for 25
  todays masterpiece figures have gone full 3p with their overengineered retardation that just ends up looking crap and makes handling them a ballache    you obviously dont own a single one of them if you think that megatron is great as an action figure and one of the best transformers i own as far as staying in one piece in robot mode and articulation range/balance goes its actually pretty damn baffling given the involved transformation but its the truth    its so damn good in that regard that i can look past the minimal paint wear easily and im really anal about paint defects on my figures
  so this is a combination of the consumers being obsessed with cartoon accuracy and the designers with overengineering
  these arent worth the price  what did you buy them on amazon
  no at target the small guys like lionizer at 6 just seems over the top but maybe only like a dollar its petty but its just barely enough to make me think twice it doesnt really matter anyway this whole hobby is a money sink anyway
  ok but do you acrually care about ricochet enough to buy four of them
  i did yesterday mods just dont care that one autist managed to scatter the general across multiple remnant threads by sheer nature of nobody wanting to talk to or even share a thread with him hes just shitposting besides see how he had no answer to this anon    but kept shitposting at the other one hes just doing it for attention
  okay then i guess you should post comic pages since they wont be deleted for being off topic oh wait 
see like a child denied daddys attention
you still havent posted any comics 
posting that face should be a permanent automatic b for offtopic and extremely lowquality shitposting
glad that its triggering you
  yeah i noticed that it just barely holds there while tranforming her back and forth last night floor polish did the trick and its a lot more secure
found flywheels/skytread today at target    i cant get this one tab in the tank mode to stay in other side works just fine but i cant figure out whats wrong here anybody else experiencing this
hey lads i dont really follow transformers much but ive been in the mood for a nice fancy transforming figure to go with my few chogokins and gundams for a while and ive seen the mp10b for about 75 ive heard nothing but good things about the mp10 and i know you cant go wrong with a optimus/convoy but is that price good for him
  its the typical price of the standard mp10 so if its just a recolor then yes
  the crotch piece with the holes for that is fully painted so tolerances for that joint is inconsistent across everyones pieces youll need to shave/sand off some of the the paint in the offending area
  huh thought it was brown plastic thanks    trying to remove the battle damage on the lower half with isopropyl alcohol its not working great normally i would just bathe the parts but i dont want to lose the paint on the treads
    yeah thats a pretty incredible price
  just dont use it to kill someone geist
if you cant get flywheels to tab in properly try the fix posted in the last thread  
    thanks lads just ordered it now havent had a transformer for a long while now so itll make a nice change from model kits and the like itll make a fun little present at the very least      i cant promise anything
  kekd at the drawing good job
  its a design that nearly works the clear plastic feels too worryingly fragile to recommend him      im pretty sure these arent final product paint jobs
how would combiner wars prime look with jazz and stepper as legs and novastar and moonracer as arms
got ss jazz for 12 pp rodimus prime for 22 and lg astrotrain for 34     today was a good day
  nice anon good finds
i wonder how hightower will look like since he has two different concept art pics
  rodimus was part of the amazon sale no one mentioned him so im not sure how long he was up    since all the pp leaders eventually dropped ill probably wait for the siege leaders to drop around the same time next year
  be careful with rodimus some of them had loose knees out the gate i still need to fix mine
  from the trailer or small one
  the trailer legs that are used for rodimus prime form if its loose you might have to knock the pin out and thicken it a bit which is sort of a pain in the ass the small hot rod robot form is pretty solid
  thanks
    man i hope hes like that
    the other design was the one dragging a wrecking ball around yeah if they were truely going for film accuracy then it should be that one
    man the designs in the second movie we weird at times  transform everything into a million pieces  hey what about the treads and crane arm  leave em why would they change
  its definitely weird but i liked how often you could still find big pieces like that just hanging out
  mhmm
  yeah i dont hate it but it really stands out like how scavengers lack of hands was actually accurate
  i wonder if that makes him and the other constructicon gay since when they turn into devy their balls are touching
  rotf devastator should have no wreaking balls in the first place and even if he could how would they get to his crotch 
  the constructicons are actually terrifying in rotf imagine standing under that fuckin thing if it was real  its a shame the movies just treat them like durrr big robot go punch then he get shot durrr you could add a great horror element just focusing on these things lumbering around at the height they are
  its almost amazing how squandered they were its like the most basic action set piece idea in the world and bay still fucked it up  already huge giant robots are hard as fuck to fight  they unify together and become an even more unstoppable monster that the heroes unite to stop    instead we got  six unrelated construction vehicles just have an orgy  they fight the two smallest and weakest transformers in the movie  smash some rocks  gets killed from an offscreen gun
  i totally want an aileron fig       a legit war scene on cybertron would be amazing youd have minicons scrambling in street trenches while big bots try and take cover in building rubble street to street like stalingrad while combiners battle like fucking kaiju and titans fistfught like angry gods towering above it all while seekers engage some oc autobot seekers in orbit
  im talking about the transformation you dumbshit mp10mp24 were actually fun to transform where the later ones are a massive pain just for the sake of animation accuracy autism   i also have mp36 who sucked the fun out of living so your obviously so full of shit i can see it coming out your mouth
i thought he was pretty good even if ive technically bought him four times
  i only bought him to modify him into pyro
think theres ever gonna be a sg megatron mp fellas or would the extra molding for his big blue cannons and different face/helmet be considered too much work
i still can think of a bunch of carformers i want to get the mpm treatment  jazz  ratchet  sideways  sideswipe  shatter  dropkick  evasion optimus
  being this ridiculously hyperbolic  having trouble handling involved transformations  so youre not just a retard but also have sausage fingers sucks to be you anon    i also have mp36 who sucked the fun out of living  going by the fact youre seething over fucking toys im sure you do the same to everybody around you
picked up studio series megatron and i really like him he looks great took this shot and thought it was awful because its so busy that you can barely tell whats going on but then realized thats pretty movie accurate haha
  its so busy that you can barely tell whats going on but then realized thats pretty movie accurate haha  looks like three bots standing for their portraits sorry you have a short attention span
  no problem apology accepted 
    this short interaction here just shows how shitty the transformers general is when monitorsan posts in the robot damashii thread he always gets respectful and courteous replies but post in this thread and the first response is from a snarky asshole taking personal offense from a completely harmless comment
  big grey bad guys
  shame we cant all be autistic rays of sunshine like you
  they look good together i must resist the urge to buy them i was weak and bought classic camaro bee stinger and jazz
  not saying things need to be some faggy hugbox or whatever but youre right that theres an awful lot of shitposting in that needlesslyconfrontational style telling someone you disagree on taste is one thing but some anons feel like they need to meme it up hard and wind up just looking like friendless autists its too bad that every other place you could go to talk tfs is even worse in their own ways
what gives you better results /tfg/ target or walmart
  remember kids   never do underbase  because greebles kill
  lately target back in the glory days of rotf walmart
  this tiny insignificant interaction shows how shitty the general is   look an the rest of the thread and remember where you are and deal with it it only happens sometimesfaggot
  i find it a touch shocking the underbase has never been used outside of the comics
  what is sarcasm
  ill do you one better who is sarcasm
  be sure to give him cw shockwave as a weapon in combined mode
  better image quality
  better image quality  not by much looked shitty back then looks shitty now
  even a single underbase use could be enough to give you a greeble infection
  underbase not even once
  yeah but the words were all fuckedup if you zoomed in at all on mobile and it was bugging me
  ive transformed it several times without issue you shithead its not fun   but its good to know the mongoloids who support these practices just want more shitty figures go figure
  now that i think about it is it possible that the machinina combiner wars series was making a really shitty oblique underbase reference with what happened with starscream and the enigma  starscream finally gets his hands on the cosmic macguffin   he absorbs the its power into himself    turning him into a giant special effects ridden version of himself  starts ranting about having gained infinite knowledge and ultimate power  the power abruptly overwhelms him and he promptly exsplodes as he screams  the becoming a screaming star jrpgbossthing nonsense which followed directly after was all machinima though
  this i already have my preorder for mp44 and mp megatron in im willing to pay a premium for quality products unlike poorfags who have to settle for trash  they havent even been released yet so we cant say theyre quality products and lets not act like takara hasnt put out some qc duds
still buttmad i see      ive transformed it several times without issue    the later ones are a massive pain  so you can transform it no problems but its a pain to transform its either one or the other make your mind already    and if you hate involved transformations that much why the fuck would you buy figures that are clearly made that way leave those to people with actual patience and keep buying simple toys    also it doesnt matter if you call them mongoloids who like shitty figures the fact is that they are able to enjoy the hobby while you are throwing temper tantrums in a cantonese picture board like a child better take care of that butthurt asap and find something that brings you happiness too
  sorry im not autistic enough to spend money on pricehiked pile of trash the mp line has gone downhill and this is rock bottom an overpriced panel mess based solely so it can look exactly like possibly the worst version of optimus prime the cartoon design was a mistake and to add insult to injury they add in some parts to make you think it looks like the movie if you want your toys to look like this just get a nontransforming figure for fucks sake dont drag the entire line down with you not even the ver anime robot damashiis are this autistic with how close they have to look to the animation to appease people and those dont even have to transform
stop liking things the thread
  so it can look exactly like possibly the worst version of optimus prime  theres no masterpiece energon optimus prime
  robot testicles
  stop being poor this piece is made for real fans not walmart waddling manchildren retards like you make me fucking sick because youre damaging the hobby as a whole in your refusal to support quality products     this is what optimus prime is supposed to look like real collectors want an eyecatching piece for their displays and this will be the centerpiece for all true fans if you dont have it then you might as well just quit collecting because youre incapable of running with the big boys
mp44 looks like fucking garbage what an absolutely shameful product
why even bother posting
  hell thats the transformers fandom motto
  implying five years from now there wont be another optimus figure someone makes this exact same post about
500 dollarydoos cartoon accuracy prime  doesnt even come with a basketball and hoop
  this man is now the leading authority on what optimus prime should look like regardless of his many iterations this man is also someone who has never worked a day in his life lets let him make all the design and pricing decisions on transformers now
    be aware of the risks of oding on enigma    especially if the enigma may be laced with cgi or other dangerous additives    for your own safety please only take enigma which has been prescribed and distributed through licensed professionals
  i bet you dont even own ultimetal optimus prime you disgusting poorfag
  i am guessing its not in the writer guides that hasbro gives to brief potential new writers the enigma on the other hand is right from the 500 grand binder hasbro put together
  third parties need to make something because its not missing much else   besides a pistol mode megatron
chosen prime is offering payment plans on mp 44  having to make payments on our hobbys now  when dose it end lads
  when your collection is complete  are you complete anon is the roaring emptiness within finally sated
  in hasbros defense the enigma  combiners and combiners  multitoyselling gimmick potential  at best the underbase might be an exscuse to sell a line of yellow panellined repaints which theres no strong indication fans would be into enough to buy then again if that works for allsparkempowered/armor versions maybe its worth a shot    for nontoy driven series it definitely should get used as a macguffin again though  if you think about it its basically a lot like a less unexplained magnificus
  didnt bbts start doing the same thing a long time ago because tf fans are notoriously poorfag and cant budget to save their lives
  i wouldnt mind that on flame toys tarn would make the ridiculous price more digestible
  im in that weird place where i can budget but are poor but still buying figures  a mass produced figure of that size should not cost over four hundred dollars though
    lol i hadnt ever thought about this i like it a lot
  lots of expensive hobbies let you do payment plans sideshow has had it for as long as i have paid attention to them   convoy 3 is stupid expensive yes and hopefully he will be the most costly figure this franchise has for a long time coming   a lot of the hate i see on it i feel is that people just cannot afford to buy it and vent their frustration bad mouthing it
  its weird to think that transformers now reach a price higher than hot toys now
  and with none of their quality
  it looks better than hot toys optimus though   lots of expensive things coming for me bw megs 30 maybe this
  hot toys  quality  pick one and only one     i think for most folks its more about justifiing the price rather than being able to afford it though ive always viewed the mp line as a mid point in high end collectables price wise mp 44 takes them into the high tier where bandai and sentinel products are
  i feel is that people just cannot afford to buy it and vent their frustration bad mouthing it  im on the bandwagon just because i think it looks like shit and the price is absurd i wouldnt even buy it for the memes if i had a mountain of cash laying around
reminder to migrate to this thread no need to make a new one        
no thanks
  a lot of the hate i see on it i feel is that people just cannot afford to buy it and vent their frustration bad mouthing it  any dumbass here could save up money from this point on until it releases even if they miss preorders and the initial release theyll most likely be able to grab a reissue down the line still doesnt mean they will save up because they know this new mp prime is not worth the price at all
  did a tf collector beat you up or something  because i find that pretty unlikely were a doughy lot
  nah hes just a salty idwfag
  /thread
  i hope he is not that faggot that tries to shill that nontransforming tarn on every thread he can
  fuck off im making a new one
why is that shit thread still in the catalog
  fuck off kirafag go get banned for two weeks
  go get banned for two weeks kirafag
  cool well be there when you post link  unfortunately kiraposter is coming along for the ride to shitpost but we can just hide his gay shit and carry on as if hes not even there
  mods dont care about /tfg/ if they did the shitposter wouldve been permab last year
  hes kiraposter you idiot
  just dont reply to him its what gets him off   imagine a thread where he just kept shitposting but nobody saw his posts nobody responded to him nobody even acknowledged that he was there
report hide and hope the mods wake up
  they wont but i still encourage every anon to simply hide the shitposters shitposts without acknowledging them starvation is the proper treatment for this cancer
  then make sure to post that until he goes away or gets banned preferably for life
  sure put that in every thread header instead of his gay shit make sure every anon knows the drill
is anybody going to make a real thread
  there is already one  
  fine give me a second
  cool thanks anon
  here      
  character    arent he and artfire just cobbled together repaints with added targetmasters to fill out the tail end of that years tf line up
  when dose it end lads    here in canada they just increased prices of deluxe voyager and leader class figures by 10 in the last 6 months    30 deluxe  40 voyager  70 leader
  it ends when you impeach trudeau for the libcuck he is
  id really like to see crowbar or lockdown
    yeah yeah keep saying that till you believe it
  cool you guys have 3rdworld msrps now
  just wait for the 150 knock off
  i mean its actually kinda crazy right everyone bitches about the quality of the toys going down plastic integrity articulation transformationis muh die cast     they respond by jacking up the plastic density trying to answer the very vocal minority concerned with cartoon accuracy and then the price is reflected accordingly    then people bitch about those decisions     i swear that im not part of any other fandom that bitches this much about the thing theyre emotionally and financially invested
hi /toy/ i need some counseling on this one  i bought a figure from bbts an sent to my loot box waiting for a better time to send it to me 3 months goes by and finally ship it using the usps priority mail express international i was waiting and knew that it was bound to be taxed here for the price and the shipping cost being high no problem  but then the problem started  the customs informed that due the lack of information/too generic info written about the description price informed and shipment they were going to send the item back to usa ive reach the bbts asking for documents to prove the values written on the invoice but they said that all the info sent was correct nothing was wrong and etc i searched through my email and sent all the info ive got credit card transactions info about the shipment and all that the package was the returned to customs to another verification but the results came the same but with some more explanation and all that but basically stating the same thing  i contacted again the store seeing if i could get some deal because it was 40 usd to ship this toy and it wasnt right to just lose like this  no deal they just said that they are experienced in this area that they did nothing wrong and that when the package arrives in their warehouse they will either send me again through another payment or refund the price on the figure  i asked then of they could scan the invoice sent so i could file a lawsuit against the customs/post service here  no deal again they couldnt do it and that i should use the info on their website that should be enough    so im stuck with this situation /toy/ what should i do    pic related is the toy
  so im stuck with this situation /toy/ what should i do  well knowing which country you are in would help as its going to differ on your country
  i live in rio de janeiro brazil
  i tried to send some manga to a /toy/soldier in germany once it got sent back because they couldnt find the customs form it was there they didnt look properly and the usps told me they didnt couldnt do anything because its germanys fault so he had to eat the shipping costs because i sure as hell wasnt going to theres nothing bbts or the usps can do about your country being retarded and its not their responsibility to give you free money over lost shipping costs so tough luck op
  fair enough but who is to say that the customs fucked up this time why didnt i get to see the invoice if theres no problem on it surely wouldnt give them trouble send me a copy through my email isnt
  just start calling up places and complaining    id start with your customs people and ask for proof the item wasnt invoiced correctly
  literally a shit hole
old 
  i dont have any plans to get him but i cant deny it being a thing of beauty
  i never buy nontransforming tfs but i need him need
  if they make someone i care about ill be in trouble     10 is a nice masterpiece version of the toy 44 is a nice cartoon masterpiece version the other two are a ok mix but 44 hits that mix os no visible truck pieces besides the fake windows
  the coloring gives 44 a little more credence but i still cant see the 450 there even taking a trailer into account just as a comparison beast wars megatron is 320 so even if you ranked the figures / base accessories themselves at the same price youre left with a 130 trailer  which alone is what the price of ms01 is im not sure i could get to point where id freely throw around light of freedom and i still really love the brighter colors that magic square is going with as well as something more of a dynamic chest over the kind of simple rectangle that 44 and te in my brain i want to say tfe since transform mission was tfm are doing    it would definitely be interesting to see if someone did a full 4way or at least the new 3 comparison of the figures john garringer comes to mind since he did do a 5way compare for all of devastator and a 3way compare for predaking
  10 is a nice masterpiece version of the toy    you dumb fuck its got nothing resembling the g1 toy wrong head red biceps with no silver stripes wheels hidden away square box gas tanks no sticker detail why do you hasbro fans say stupid shit    id love to see modern updates of the toys but manchildren paying 300 for simple cartoon drawings is what sells shame you cant get hooked on opiates for that money instead and just fade away
  im a tomy fan thank you very much angry boi
  that is about as irrelevant to the point as your existence     please go be one with the matrix
  mp10 is solid figure and a fantastic optimus
  is there a price on that guy yet
  jesus mp44 looks so bad especially for 450    im still going to stick with mp10 because it offers the perfect blend of g1 toy and g1 cartoon that i want out of an mp which is why im pretty upset with this massive push for toon accuracy that we are seeing lately but if mp10 werent an option ms and te look so much better that it isnt even funny and they cost a third of the fucking price
  if hes bigger than tarn then i say add another 3050 to his 399 price tag
so if i got things right from the last thread there should be around 3 of us that are getting tactical commander in somewhere in the range of saturday/monday with hopes after getting to nj early yesterday morning it has since disappeared to in transit to next destination which is about as vague as you can be in terms of location i wish i had more space that i could dedicate to doing base mode displays but ill at least try it out just to see it in person for a bit
  i eagerly await your comments lads
  its not a thunderjaw but it might just do in a pinch      looking at things now saturday or monday is far more likely than friday still no sign of it reaching the regional distribution hub
get maketoys downbeat today  those fucking leg transformations and sharp plastic    and there seems to be a design flaw with the foot heels twist bending due to touching the curvature of the rear lights its better to not have the heels folded out at all
  mp44 really does nail the cartoon look but i think they went full retard with the engineering its not even impressive adding a bazillion panels is the easy way out    i miss the older mps with their creative transformations
  i decided to wait for the green one since mft is making ko green dianauts sets
  the leg transformation isnt that bad but it certainly helps that the instructions can barely convey how to actually do it    and yea the little flip out heel is pretty much pointless since on top of not colliding with stuff the spoilers on the back of the legs function as heels anyway
    been waitin for 3rd party star sabers and this is definitely a need
a 3p toy with official addons where do you post this
  in the trash
  if you think downbeat is sharp i can tell you dont own any seacons
  can he transform  no  can he at least stand on his own with a huge black stick up his ass
  not wanting huge black sticks up your transformers exhaust pipe  what are you gay
  i own seacons but i think destruction scorpion would like a word with you
  considering its a star saber you could probably fold him up and make him look like his retarded jet mode regardless of its intentional or not
    destruction scorpion took me about 3 hours to fit together     anon who mentioned the qc was not to the normal stands was right his hips are loose and i couldnt fit the tail in without filing the tail isnt super tight either and the feet dont angle around much either the sculpt is phenomenal though and i will give mm as pass because their recent fort max is legendary
bipbopbobibble got his hands on commander          i never had major issues in regards to d scorp just that hes so spiny all over hes not a fun guy to manipulate / transform there can be an issue to note with the head master in that he comes out a lot easier than he goes back in but it isnt a problem with a little patience odin yes is quite phenomenal but isnt without his own problems too for me the grey armatures are still just so tight i cant manipulate them properly unless i go at them with a small pair of pliers for the extra grip the other really small gripe i have is that the handle for his gun doesnt have a spot to lock in place and it droops just a little little bit when he holds it
    gun droop ill give you the hands should lock better because you get it to the specific angles and the wrists move    his wrist blasters were tough to get out but i got a spudger check amazon just like uncle bobos and it did the trick
  schrodingers wrist blasters they cant be there unless i observe them myself
    absolute enablement on that ms optimus prime friendo its murdering mp44 with aplomb
  bilbo struggles through base modes too much sure hes not into it but if he isnt gonna respect what the toy can do how can i respect him
  i wonder what the range on mss shoulders will be like considering the shoulders look the same as mp10 ive seen some complaints about the open joints on the v3 but id rather a full unobstructed range than not
    honestly thats one of my biggest beefs with 44 in particular and honestly most of the new school of mps butterfly joints are great and more transformers should have them but you dont need to look like a cracked sidewalk to do it
  to play doubles advocate mp10 was met with derision upon its announcement from people who were happy with mp01 and didnt yet realise that the smaller scale and new aesthetic were going to be part of a uniform push to do a fully fleshedout mp range with scaled carbots etc obviously mp10 has stood the test of time well arguably better than mp01 as much as i loved that figure there were some horrible engineering choices like the ratchets in the hips ensuring the impossibility of a shallow astance limited elbows limited shoulders bad weight distribution weak ankles etc so the question is will mp44 end up being betterregarded over time    my take is that i honestly dont think so third party wasnt really a thing in the mp01 and mp10 days now weve got two companies immediately offering a cheaper product that a good number of people think is more aesthetically appealing or will fit in with their collection better this is to say nothing of the possibility of big beasts like fanstoys mmc/ocular max maketoys etc maybe sensing blood in the water over that 440 price tag and fandom dissatisfaction and attempting to do better themselves
  weve also sort of been here for a while but this is the first time where were having a real takara/3p deathmatch for the same character releasing around the same time the excuse has always been that third parties werent really competing with stuff like mp dinobots or combiners but shits brazen now hastak has a lot of skin in this particular game if they were ever gonna do something itd be now
  is that the toyworld max i always wanted to pick him up but never got around to it
  ive basically completely given up on mps because of exactly this plus theyve hiked the prices so much that they arent even the cheapest option anymore either       to push back a little bit while mp10 was the start of a new unified aesthetic the cartooncentric thing is already the standard going into mp44 so id say the fact that people are upset despite the market already being primed for it isnt a great sign for them    i do have to wonder if there will be ramifications for this on the 3p market though releasing a 600 version of some combiner only 10 people on earth care about is one thing but this is takaras marquee release of their 1 character and its being met with incredibly stiff competition at release you cant even buy mps at major western retailers anymore so the only place to get it is specialist sited where its sold sidebyside with nearly identical toys selling for a fraction of the price
  welp
  no fucking way he didnt
  nice b8
  its coming out tomorrow have your snack of choice ready
  oh is it on patreon or some shit
  check is fb page which is where i snagged the pic from
  i am absolutely not fucking watching that
  jesus the absolute state of this faggot
is there something im not getting with all this bobby discussion
  to sum it up bobby was talking about the price of flame toys products and said you can afford them and anything else if you just worked harder to be fair he may not play that hand again but i wouldnt be surprised
    hes a firm believer in supplyside robonomics pull yourselves up by your bootstraps and dip into your kids college fund to afford it
        bobby is peak boomer
  isnt he more of a zoomer
  im going to watch it with popcorn to see what kind of hoops blobby jumps through to justify that price and his helpful tips on how people can afford it such as selling a relatives kidney or becoming a crack dealer
  boomer is not about age its a state of mind      thats what he wants he gets paid whether you hatewatch or actually watch    just yell at him on twitter or something
  with the amount of ad and script blocking software i run thats unlikely
did anyone ever figure out a way to loosen up gcreations rebels shoulders i took mine down again after a couple months and hed be a top 10 figure if not for those things    i remember trying shock oil molybdenum grease everything and they still feel like they wanna snap off every time i move them
big robot booty
  now that makes it very tempting
  i want a blackarachnia from this company so bad and a thunderblast
  oh my
  that hand positioning   were just going to get a lewd modelviewer and not the actual figure arent we   i really like the minor but major for an arceebased figure knightly aspects to the look please let the figure become real      if their arcee turns out as planned i feel that they could make thunderblasts shell into something quite appealing in robot mode
  i have a mighty need
  he gets paid whether you hatewatch or actually watch    he doesnt get jack shit if you use hooktube like a non retarded person
so now i have 2 of mms bust sets and im wondering if i should get the one for apollo also its kind of a shame that the bust pieces cant do anything on their own aside from light up if you put batteries in but at least cerebros can exist outside of odin i also have d scorpion so ive given passing thought about the head piece for him as well
  between arcee not usually looking like this curvy while supposedly being able to actually transform and a lot of the design choices im getting some vague 02/strelizia vibes   if this shapes up nicely i just may have to get a second i think ive already decided on making something reference the horns rather than add actual horns though or strelizias single horn
  were just going to get a lewd modelviewer and not the actual figure  money saved their loss
best tanks im feeling pretty nostalgic for transforming tanks i had as a child with the armada demolisher being a favorite of mine
  iron factory burning slug is good if you like smol tanks
  this guy has a lot of personality i like him
  mmc commotus is freaking great but hard to find now i think the other version of that mold should be solid though if you like the look
  that insertion slit
  yeah commotus is pretty rad but i wouldnt even bother trying to find one at this point if you want the figure youre better off just getting spartan instead which had a wider release and even a reissue i think though his version of the tank cannon is a bit less cool looking
    here it is for those interested
  so basically right now he views it as too expensive because it doesnt check all his boxes speaking of boxes  expected a toy companys logo that just made merc to appear on the box  ffs bobby also they are still making some pokemon products so their not totally done with it besides while its loss may be a blow to them i dont see it as being that drastic to increase the price of their other products
  lol just buy a sideshow statue    no wonder that tasteless faggot would want one of those ugly things yeah i totally want to see every little dimple and fiber and vein on some overmuscled steroid freak and display that in my house
i need cash for a new ipad pro and im contemplating scalping my commotus or clearing out a lot of my masterpiece scale 3p stuff commotus is in perfect condition with all accessories could i make 300 for it
    omega looks great both ways desu
  why do you need the new ipad pro
    so i can sit in coffee shops and draw my transformers comic while shit posting here
                                  ha get btfo he openly says he doesnt think the figure is worth any more than like 200 and wont be paying the full price for it
dammit toyworld you couldnt package your green version like this too make me do all that extra work      the only thing im not keen on with the set would be the hoses which i know at least one anon in these threads reported on them basically disintegrating in something like less than a year      yeah i really dont see tt attempting to make up profit from one area by drastically increasing costs in another but i will say having worked at tru from december 2006 to just april of this year pokemon sells a lot another subtle hit i know that they took was when fisherprice took over the thomas the tank engine brand from rc2 / learning curve tt being parent company that line is gangbusters      if i were to reinvest that amount of money id go the washer / dryer route except it would have to be one of those small combination machines id hook up to my bathroom sink
looking for some advice the really big transformers like metroplex trypticon and the combiners like devestator how much do they usually cost and how good are the 3rd party made ones also are figure stands needed to hold them up
  the 3rd party ones will run 300 to 400 the hasbro ones will run around 100 right now none of them require stands except the hasbro ones if you want to dynamically pose them
  why are the hasbro ones so cheap is the quality that terrible for the official toyline run
        that should hopefully give you some idea of the differences that exist between hastak and 3rd party releases
  quality isnt that big of a factor quantity is official sells in large volume so their rd and mold costs are spread out across numerous units    3rd party sell in far less quantity but their toys are often more intricate so their stuff end up being 23 times official items of similar size    kos save on rd and sometimes quality so their prices are about half of what theyre koing  3p or official
    that was educational thank you
  id also point out that there are oftentimes multiple kos of the same figure circulating so do your research about which version is has the best quality
the cost varies from 300600 depending 3p is great no stands     fedex can piss a guy off theyve jerked me around on my past several deliveries oh well comfy feels watching for fedex out the front window on a rainy saturday
    if youre interested in the idw metrotitan bbts has it discounted i havent gotten it yet but im definitely picking it up
  stop doing this bbts my wallet is staying in my pants
    planet xs redeco of their omega supreme is a little smaller than the big city bots but retails for under 200 is still in stock and comes with a flight stand for alt mode
    if he did to just buy a statue instead of wanting your transformers to look like animation errors then hes right the people mp44 is targeted for dont acrually want transformers they just want something to sit on their shelves until they die      he probably read this thread and had to do a last minute reshoot
  it bothered me how they wasted money producing a dated figure sure gento may be fine but the clipon armor is bs these days reducing his range of movement by 60
  thunderblast
  it amazes me that laser optimus has been remade like a halfdozen times and the original mold is still the coolest looking
    thats what she said
  not as bullshit at the time it was made and keep in mind it was originally an addon for a hastak product the figure later sold with the armor wasnt particularly dated when they made it for their notnovaprime or even when they made the choice to do that    man its weird finding people who dont remember the history this shit has gone through
i wish a 3p company would catch on to this   
christ this thing looks great
finally got my tfc supreme tactical commander he is one impressive beeflad i have to say solid ratchets all around hefty as hell and a good size especially when in super modefairly dynamic range of motion all around despite the bulk too
  is he a must have im really tempted to pull the trigger
  all i know is mine is somewhere between out east in nj and here in ca hopefully it gets hereby wednesday im glad that power baser is going to have a fellow beefer to stand alongside      id say for as much flak thats given them the videos that bobby  ben have done should give you a good look into it id say the one thing youre going to want to decide on is get the red  blue thats available now or wait on the camo green thats still to come
  dose the head look like it can come apart easily those dead eyes kill it for and id have to paint them whyd theyd put light pipped eyes on a figure like this is beyond me
  i dont think ive liked a single movie megatron but sweet jesus that silver is disgusting whos making this
so whos down for this fella 
  i remember it was great at the time i owned two of them one was a ko tho gento was a waste of resources because he came out so long after the original project that he was dated right out of the gate the original maketoys set was great but they could have spent the time making something more up to date rather than gento    if you are enjoying him thats great though this is just my opinion and it doesnt matter anyway because gento exists either way    3p history ive only been around since fp city commander if you wanted to talk about dated still cool but i dont own one anymore
i dont suppose any 3rd parties have attempted 1/1 scale figures maybe some guns outside of megatron
  i was about to really got paid yesterday and all  doesnt transform  the scary thing is that i almost didnt consider that as opposed to not caring im no stranger to buying nice looking robots looking at you dx gridman but when it comes to a transformer id rather hold out for one that has the transformation that i like plenty in both modes still its really nice looking
  im all the way onboard ditching the transformation if it gets you a more accurate/articulated robot mode because man did the mp look nothing like the movie honestly the only things giving me pause is that im not familiar with 3as quality and the fact hes so fucking tall for a short character dudes like 9 inches or something right
  my experience with 3a is that the paint is fantastic almost always but the plastic can be very fragile and the articulation ranges from average to subpar
  well thats good to know the range at least looked pretty good from the promo pics but those can always be misleading i guess not everything can be sentinel
how badly am i going to fuck myself if i buy this first time buying 3rd party transformers
  do you like painted figures there is an unpainted version that is just as good but currently sold out    painted figures may not be as play friendly
  this may a figure that will make you hate all other transformers fig in that this figure is an excellent figure that has the perfect balance of an action figure and a transformer    it is the first action oriented transformer fig
  the problem with paint of a transformer is you are going to gave it flaking on parts that contact during transformation    it is safer to buy the unpainted one there are even kos of it now for about 50
  hes honestly one of the best in that size class solid build quality and the type of posability you rarely find on a transformer a 90 degree abcrunch and butterfly shoulders are basically rare as hell on transformers and his work incredibly well my only gripes are how his tiny heels can be annoying and the gun he comes with kind of sucks aside from that hes one of the toys id grab if my house were on fire the new metallic paint looks great and im considering triple dipping    if you end up liking him id also recommend the megatron that goes with him rioter despotron hes not as good but only because striker is a really high bar theyre pretty much my goto prime and megs
  it is the first action oriented transformer fig  id contend that a lot of the legends sized stuff is definitely action oriented or at the very least play encouraging and play oriented
  a lot of legends stuff is probably more intended for play just due to the pocketsize but theres still a lot of 90 degree knees and elbows going on even in iron factorys best stuff the burden of having to actually transform means its pretty rare to see something with strikers level of articulation much less in the voyager size     im not even really disagreeing with you but striker is definitely unique
  i would totally buy a non transforming figure of blitzwing the robot mode just looks too good
  i would as long as parts werent missing for such a high price i didnt mention to earlier but part of my gripe with bee is the lack of chest weapon am i just missing something like that not being in the movie anymore or something
  someone on tfw2005 took it apart for exactly that reason and said it was easy looking at it myself theres exactly one screw on the back of the head holding it together      this is my second third party tf total the other is green giant which i also love but is a bit older and this thing is wonderful heavy ratchets for every joint fully jointed fingers really solid posability for how big and bulky it is surprisingly easy transformation etc head has a huge range of motion on its hinge and balljoint joint it has thigh twist which might be the only nonratcheted joint that isnt the neck or fingers    the only issue i can possibly find with it is the diecast weapons are unfinished and could have used paint and the weird power cable thing on the rifle doesnt really offer anything to justify its existence     went ahead and grabbed some pictures heres it with war for cybertron soundwave a deluxe to give an idea of scale
  my only gripes are how his tiny heels can be annoying    in general i find strikers feet a bit annoying to pose that little inner hinge part is really annoying to manipulate and he doesnt have enough of a heel really
    id argue pe warden was the first figure focused entirely on the action figure element as far as third party goes i just picked him up and aside from the range on the foot rockers and headmaster range warden can shit all over a lot of recent releases i dont know how perfect effect cant get their shit to this quality anymore     on that notepost warden fanmodes his tank mode is fucking garbage
  i really want his energon axe i just wanna say that the sight of a striker manus/striker noir loaded up with his entire arsenal of weapons still makes me giddy with delight even after all these months
  not him but i believe it is the black mamba ko
  that mode is garbage too
  chest weapon the new movie bumblebee only seems to have an right arm cannon if thats what yore talking about
  i went ahead and ordered mine from bbts yesterday would have gone with tfs like usual but for some reason their login page wasnt working at checkout    hopefully it arrives soon this is my first 3p purchase since beast gorilla ater beta and stray    now if only somebody would restock challenger sometime soon tfs says december but i dont trust like that
  they gotta hurry up with the camo version goddamn
says right here that you need a metallic coated  vacmetal version of tw constructor
  im perfectly content with the green one i already have you wont get me a second time tw
  how badly am i going to fuck myself if i buy this    not at all its very good
    ugh i want him but at the same time i dont because hes so far from any established media    its at times like this my autism kicks in fullforce
  i dont know how perfect effect cant get their shit to this quality anymore    on that notepost warden fanmodes his tank mode is fucking garbage    his head mode is fine it sits on my fort max to this day
  kick your autism to the curb and get yourself a gi prime either that or just wait for the camo deco and that way its not like its butting in on anything
  this ones black mamba the other is tf dream factory
  there was no ko of gento and the waste of resources as you put it actually gave battle tanker a sorely needed size boost vs using the smaller rts figure
i wonder if any of these bayformerdinobots x mmpr x ultraman chinky kos are worth getting
  maybe add gundam in there too they certainly look like it in robot mode
finally
  not exactly a clean all mode though
  i am on the fence until next weekend after i see the movie   i just fear i will want a optimus and a blitzwing oh and shatter
      cant this bullshit company produce stuff like this its always highly inaccurate hollow turds that cost their weight in gold other companies even small ones with way fewer resources can produce a better product and more accurate depictions of its own characters what a fucking disgrace
  eh could be worse and that robot mode is worth it
so diam choc inadvertently shared an old video of one of these autotransforming robots by senpower      this video shows their classics optimus hound and scrapper    you guys think theres any chance hasbro or a 3p ever manufactures these
  oh also another over a year and a half old thing i found copied onto youtube from a somewhat hard to pinpoint source  someone designed transforming protectobots/defensor as anime girls      pretty sure ive seen this before elsewhere but again hard to track down the exact source
    these are the exact same video
    fuck  here we go  
  wheres a good place to buy kos
  yep his feet and neck are sort of his only flaws i also wish theyd figured out a way to keep his amazing shoulder articulation from disapearing when you put the chest armor on him but even then it just drops to ok other than that hes a ton of fun idw fort max has always been one of my favorites and warden really delivered     i also cant help but feel he would have been a better more solid toy if he didnt put so much effort into the most obscure altmode ever but hey ill take what i can get
  taobao aliexpress or showz store who also has a store on aliexpress if you dont want to buy from there website
so this never happened
  correct
  armored cores thinker is playing in the background  so when do we get a new ac game
  fyi the power cable on the gun is meant to plug into roller
  ah got it thanks
  how are the diecast cannons i really like the figure overall but they seem like theyre prone to going completely loose if you move them a few times which seems like it would be really shitty since all the dianaut and titanmaster promo shots seem to imply they intended for him to be fairly playoriented          im not too interested in their decepticons aside from those stunticons they seem to have forgotten about but thats pretty good    alt mode isnt super clean but considered its a legends scale botlet theres only so much you can do i think the worst of it is the nose they could have reduced the size of that pinned hinge and maybe not even bother with having a little needle nose flip out
  the ones that they mean for you to use microfigs with have plastic joints for their moving parts to avoid direct metal on metal contact the more unfinished guns up front seem to be just raw diecast on diecast though      oh i know its just a pain to do and whos really going to have roller dragging it around most of the time
  looks more like something from srw
  i know that feeling
  who makes this
  magic square
  3p creativity really has made me haaate official messes if its a ball ache to paly with i wont enjoy the toy especially not for 400    wheeljack was a blast to play with in both modes tracks for me was the start of groooaaning to deal with figures mp10 isnt the most accurate or appealing but hes very fun
  i can just feel mp44 coming apart as soo as i start to pose
  gotta enjoy the movie before i jump on this
  tracks for me was the start of groooaaning to deal with figures    its a fucking pipe dream but i really wish id get a v2 of tracks someday such a terribly weak figure in many inexcusable ways for one of my favourite designs and cars its only redeeming quality is that stores knew it and constantly put it on sale for like 20
  instead of releasing recolor 5 or 6 how about releasing some more of those extra parts i want my damn purple barrel ive had on preorder forever
  whos that supposed to be in the background
    big convey as some sort of mammoth zoid
  leonidas was originally lio convoy/liger zero  perfect effect had plans to also do big convoy/elephander
  the redesign they did on lio convoy is apparently from the tbeast artbook still i hate how scrawny it looks gorira is a big bulky monster and i wanted the other two beast convoys to be that chunky
  i just wanted a liger
eeeeg
  i guess its like an extremely tiny cupola or something
  no its from that iron factory tom and jerry set
  
  unique toys and no its just too different
  all these passes through the chinese factory and still no ko yet
  has it really been selling that well
  doubtful but it is being sold as the biggest devastator ever and fits as a combiner against an mp line
  nope just have to wait on the diaclone version the shattered glass version and the transparent versions of both      well i know i contributed by buying a green box set myself but you can preorder an orange or translucent orange set for 300
    im almost expecting shattered glass diaclone or a black repaint eventually toyworld really have nothing else to carry them yet on and theyre the only game in town so best strike while the iron is hot as soon as someone makes a stable comparably sized devastator thats moar geewun with better robot modes all of these versions are going to be dropped hard by the shelf presence enthusiasts
    yeah toyworld really has nothing left in their property rights since zeta broke off from them and devastator is their biggest claim to fame it fails as proper mp style constructicons but most people buying it just want a devastator now and dont want to wait for another company to take a better shot all the redecoes are funding toyworlds other future products right now theyre trying to do the same with predaking since no one else seems to want to do an mp predaking    when fanstoys does theirs this thing will become the new hercules where it sells for half the price people bought it at
  ill admit if i hadnt spent the money on constructor which compared to buying individually at 100 each was a decent discount box price of 470 part of me was swayed to gts black gravity builder at least in official photos it looks a damn sexy animal if zeta take on computron following superion i might be in a world of trouble
  gb looks like the coolest of all the devastator options i love his detailing in vehicle mode i keep meaning to buy the oversized set though because im a size queen and the price is right i do feel bad not supporting gt though but value rules all
  didnt their leo convoy come before that artbook
  before i got constructor i did get set a of the jinbao os and they really are good figures and if you were interested id sell them at 50 shipped weapons mia set c is on the precipice of being released but isnt out yet i cant say that any full box set is planned for it like what happened with the nbk release or if you just have to order each set separately the only thing you have to keep in mind is that as far as can be told jinbao doesnt have any plans for adapting the upgrade set that gt made
  supposedly theres no intent to release a boxset of osko gravity builder at this point in time theyre not even intending to do the already existing addon that gt did for it at this moment
  im all in on a transforming version that nails the proportions from all angles its basically up to ut/dx9 or toyworld but its 100 inevitable right
  bonus points if this is possible
  the whole front of the car just sucks into a void in bees chest
  while i would enjoy seeing that it would be one too many vw bees for me seeing as i have the mpm already and am looking at the 3a one
  christ thats fucking atrocious i first saw how bad the transformations were going to be when blitzwings cockpit just fucking clips through his body in the first trailer but this is on a whole new level
so whats the opinion on this guy
  other than the terrible choice of lp eyes hes a fun solid figure from what ive heard
    there were a few issues with hip tolerances and things like the arm armor not really having a place to lock in if youre cool with the heads lifeless eyes hes a solid toy based on the idw prime gcreations is more accurate to some of the art but you have to deal with a clusterfuck transformation
whats a good gateway third party figure for someone whos only owned one masterpiece and generations for everything else since 2013
  voyager  commotus/spartan if you can get either for cheap striker manus otherwise  leader  im fond of thunder erebus or whatever the optimus color is the cab also works well with legends stuff  mp car  downbeat has annoying legs transformationwise but hes still pretty solid  legends  try bridge watcher or one of his kos    are you looking for any styles in particular it gets a lot easier to recommend stuff if youre into something like idw or movie designs for instance
  are you looking for any styles in particular    something g1 or idw i hate the bayverse pile of scrap aesthetic because its so indiscernable also something i shouldnt be afraid to pose or transform not terribly big on legendssized stuff unless the characters are supposed to be small
  mmcs kultur is a pretty solid tarn and you can probably find people offloading one with the sentinel one coming out about now     maketoys made a swerve and tailgate trashtalk and rearend that are very comic accurate and very fun id probably reccomend them most if you can find them but they come packed in with stuff you might not want     sxs has a really accurate rodimus hot flame but his build quality is pretty polarizing
  if youre willing to blow your wad on something big id recommend getting a fanstoys dinobot theyre enormous and wonderful
  way too big and expensive for my blood
  i completely understand grimlock is probably the biggest single thing i have
  not the anon youre talking to but how did you get your rodimuss face swapped out mine has the grim looking face stuck in place from the factory
  its a pain in the ass for sure im pretty sure i just ended up unscrewing the back of the head
  i just ended up unscrewing the back of the head  kek well thats at least an idea i didnt think of yet will try that thanks man
  damn thats a gorgeous figure wish someone would do 3rd party braves its like transformerss cooler cousin
    i think i used a rubber spudger and a hell of a lot of force
  a rubber spudger  i have no idea what that is but it sounds fun
  torso kinda looks like one of thos collapsible cups
  thats how they did alot of the transformations in the past utilizing frames per second and just pushing parts away     fucking megatron in tlk his jet mode just shrank into his back as his body emerged from the jet
holy shit is weijiang for real  i keep pulling out my tape measure and thinking this has to be a mistake but then again i saw their optimus
  the funny thing is it probably wont even be that much bigger in bot mode than commander blackouts bot mode is like half kibble and backpack
  the body of the helicopter is 26 inches long  well it looks like im never going to have this this in vehicle unless i get a stand for it
  not to mention the blades make it almost two feet wide
  swerve and cogwheel set at least has two mechs and a tray of energon goodies in itthe rearend one has an extra head/hands for cyclonus and a few accessory bits and thats it if you want a semiaccurate swerve for cheap i know igears veer is a pretty decent toy and ive been seeing him cheap as chips on ebay lately
ms figures seen to use a lot of friction to keep parts on for example these three guys heads are attached by 3mm pegs    theyre secure enough but its a bit weird
  as long as they arent flimsy my ms red alert has the sexiest tolerances ive touched on a transformer in a while everything just fits
  my only issues i had with them was i needed to clean a bit of mold flash off infernos ladder to make it extend and retract more smoothly and i heeded to put a speck of floor polish on the tabs in sideswipes legs to keep them together they really liked to pop out when i moved him    other than that the tolerances on these is pretty good
  as much as i want this brave hasnt had nearly the impact transformers has on china to really warrant it the only thing that would come close to that would be braves nostalgia in korea
  i really dont understand why the heads arent ball jointed
    i like him
what is this im seeing about fanstoys rogue getting an upgrade kit
  just say you saw some titties for rogue youre grown
  what this anon said     seriously if can do it no problem in just about every figure why cant ms
  i didnt see it though thats why im asking    is it that knightlooking arcee that we saw renders for a couple days ago
    everyones just whining about it and tfw banned discussion of it so i have no idea what everyone is talking about
  tit arcee
  what am i looking at here    replacement titplate what do the tits look like
 thinking about getting the mft seeker set    what is going on with their necks
  three sizes plus a squishable regular plate youve seen nipples before they are under the censorship stickers
  something carried over from dx9s design maybe they couldve fixed it while upscaling the mold idk
  so this is for ft rogue because i am 100 into that maybe theyll make a waist upgrade too
its kind of hilarious that tfw would shut down one of their most civil threads sex is worse than toxicity apparently
  tfw2005 is run by weird old boomer prudes
  those are some ugly ass titties why couldnt they be energon colored or sculpted engine boobs or something i can buy a thousand figures with generic human tits
      i just realized it doesnt even open to reveal the tits either the plates just partsform on
  noice i wonder if theyd consider making a set for the mmc one which will be my mp arcee of choice
  mmc  manfaced mongoloid cunt
  those are some ugly ass titties    matches those shitty arms
  hot gluing your toys isnt sex anon
  when is this getting released so i can have some release
  wait they shut the thread down  everyone seemed all for it outside of a couple of people
      if theyd shown those boobs before we saw this arcee render i might have been interested but im just completely uninterested now      if theyd included some kind of upgrade to fix rogues waist i might have gone for it though
    i think its just a size thing they have pretty damn small heads and trying to get a balljoint/socket going on would leave you with nearly sub1mm thick plastic to worry about assembling and quality control with compared to if where their figures usually have really big heads    they do seem to be trying though their huffer has kind of a ball jointed head in that the ball is on the neck and the socket is on the torso    either way i kinda think a swivel is enough anyway
  yeah looks like the rouge thread might implode any second too    personally this is making me consider getting her i mean hell fanstoys set the precedent with that o face of hers
    they didnt just shut down the thread they banned discussing the figure anywhere on their site thats fucking insane sure its a little over the top cheesecake but its not as bad as some of the others stuff posted on there selective prudish outrage has really got to stop were regressing as a society not progressing
imagine being triggered by robot boobs
  i mean its not my thing but how the fuck is a more sexualized arcee worse than say any of the overwatch figmas
  cause majority of the transformer fanbase are incredibly immature      transformers is not art
  i assume itd be like if there was a 3rd party figure for scarlett from gijoe and no i cant think of another example right now and released her in a bikini they gave her bigger boobs put her in sexual poses at least i assume the reason is because theyre messing with the characters design anyways though with a franchise like transformers you could easily just say this is from a different version of the universe and frankly could belong in the kiss players line alongside some little boys who could kiss her       also who cares its something for weird folks i wont call them perverts but theres all sorts of this kind of junk on the internet and what not not a big surprise
    id say its comparable to those marvel bishoujo statues those are official licensed cheescake versions of their characters
just saw this posted in another place i havent seen the original so i cant verify the accuracy of the translation
    i would love to have that but i imagine itll cost several hundred dollars
  what a baffling translation are we to interpret that as this isnt even real and nobody is producing it so all preorders are lies or is it just saying that anybody who has it listed for preorder right now is full of shit because they dont even have a projected date or any retailers lined up to carry it yet
    slightly better translation dont know what that guy was using but this is with chromes built in one i think its basically saying theres no preorders available for their stuff yet so if you see one its probably a scam and that the arcee might not even be planned yet but theyre acknowledging the enthusiasm for it
    source is official weibo  so just check the official weibo      theyre saying that no preorders have solicited yet so any info from other channels are lies or speculation their owner is 75 convinced about producing it
    i want to know what the fuck the chicken machine is
  probably a bad translation of the figure or company name
  their company name is big firebird toy probably just a mistranslation of that
  not really a mistranslation just the poster referring to their company in a cute way
  where can a nigga get this i think that its jolly good fun
  thatll get you some vagene bro keep it up
  the chicken machinbe felt your enthusiaism  aka your dick was excited
    they might as well rename the damn site reset era 2 or allspark 2
  well they do have kids on the site i dont see the problem with telling people to take that particular figures discussion elsewhere
  he was probably upset when they made some of the transformers gay too        yea i was getting modded hardcore and wasnt even saying anything that was worse than i had seen in other parts of the site    honestly at this point they are shutting out what could become an entirely new part of the fandom
  its just kind of pointless if a kid wants to see tits they can just google tits
  well they do have kids on the site  999 of tfw population is made up of boomers also they could just tell people to not post lewd pics and not out right ban discussion of the figure what this boils down too is it triggered individuals like this  who threw a tantrum and the mods/admins caved
  shit quoted wrong post 
  that and the fact they would rather not loose the advertising shekels over fat robot tiddies
  well they do have kids on the site  doesnt stop them swearing every other post they dont give a fuck that theres kids on the site if theyre the same puritan bunch that care about tits youd think theyd care about muh sweary words too
    theres a big difference between kids can find pictures of tiddies if they want and we run a site focused on literal childrens toys and many of our members are underage we probably shouldnt have a thread about ten lbs of pussy  ass the toy
  and again they could have just said   no lewd pics allowed  their was nothing wrong with the render pics only the hand drawn teaser images with caution stripes plastered on it were kinda questionable
    good show
anyone else on the fence i was all in on ms but takaras offering looks good also sans price
  transformers is not art  depends on how you define art  i take a pretty liberal interpretation of the term and say that art is largely in the eye of the beholder  which admittedly does mean that most things period could technically be considered art    now wether they have artistic merit or value though thats a whole other story
  compare the backpacks and the answer is clearly ms
  i like the rounded hands on takaras the solid yellow crotch parts and more opaque tiddie windows look good too magic squares are too translucent and the matrix is distracting also feel like takaras headsculpt is better however it looks like the backpack on takara is gonna be a goddamn mess
  999 of tfw population is made up of boomers  quit throwing around terms that you clearly dont know the meaning to boomers were the ones buying the original g1 toys for their kids in the 80s its the kids that are buying them now not the senior citizens who never cared about them in the first place
  neither but i think i prefer takara because at least we havent seen a prime that looks like an autistic cartoonfags dream not going to buy it but i can at least appreciate what its trying to do even if theres some very debatable aspects about the toy  i want to like ms but the aesthetic seems like a washed out mp10 and i cant stand that it wants to act as a replacement but it trying to be the middle ground between the old mp aesthetic and flat cartoon just doesnt do it ms has the articulation i want but id rather pick up a striker manus since i dont have a prime that looks anything like that
  lurk more newfriend
  reminds me of the time someone from toy commissioned this to be made
  for the record though i think it was pretty funny backing out and not paying the customizer was kind of a dick move
  weirdly enough ms reminds me of prime in beast wars which is how i first saw g1 optimus so im actually nostalgic for it
    the classic just be warned that thats a jin custom and now youre going to attract that one retard who loses his shit whenever jins customs are posted
  it was just a prank bro
  fat balding sack of white shit has nothing to contribute except complaints  why am i not surprised
  tamara smokestacks look dumb
  the sjws of today are kids that grew up in catholic hardcore protestant and orthodox jew families no matter how much they hate religion theyre exactly as nuts as their parents and hate even the slightest suggestion of sexuality
  the koreans make some decent mecha figures iirc but theres no way theyll make unlicensed stuff now theyre one of the biggest markets for stuff like gundam so theyre in deep with the copyright shit
  explain the lgbt community then because theres a pretty substantial overlap and a lot of those people definitely dont act like prudes
  makes sense for why they turned out that way they ran all the way down to the end of the square shoulders the character model would refine the arm so that where the silver stripe wound up would become a bicep most optimus designs after just push the smokestacks up to the shoulders exclusively
  he probably means sjw in the boogyman sense
all of them just jackin it tonight
  they may not act like prudes but many of them want the same thing when it comes to sexuality the destruction of feminine images they dont agree with its like the on thing they agree on
  is that jackie mp as good as people say ive heard praise but its robot mode just looks dorpy to me
  speaking of tcp just got his chain smoking brother in they also got ms blaster and trailbraker instock
so whats more pervy guys buying a sexy figure or a chick buying a dildo cuz i really dont see a difference
  thats pretty transphobic why is he insisting a transgender character should not have breasts    literal nazi i cant even etc
  while i dont agree with your premise i do agree with your point
  first saw prototypes two months ago  already finished produced and shipped across the ocean  what the fuck      is the guy gonna use the arcee as a sex toy     is the chick gonna put the dildo on a shelf next to her collection other dildos inspired by a 1984 cartoon about dildos is bobby skullface gonna review the dildo and dock it points for not having paint
  im gonna send him one now
  explain a tiny community that gets coopted by angry straight white kids who want to get back at their parents and its barely even a community its a lot more fragmented than the media portrays any sort of unified lgbt community is even smaller because half of the actual bi gay lesbian and trans hate each other or hate the other genders altogether and many others are ambivalent at best tolerate is really the right word for it in any case the vast majority of moral policing cunts are just straight angry white millennials who got beat and touched by mommy and daddy and the priests so their support is just for aesthetic because its a fringe issue thats an emotional battleground between generations but their core values are the same as the hardcore bible/torah thumping boomers that raised them       no i dont think so thats mostly fat landwhales and their orbiters and i guess misogynistic gay dudes maybe theres a surprising amount of them who just outright despise women which was a shock to me based on my experience i would assume most trans women would love to be cute or hot babes being able to fit or blend in is important to them though im sure theres some resentment too
  i think it would be a waste to hide a sexy figure/toy/statue youre supposed to gawk at it and play with it and whatnot  generally a dildo lacks aesthetics theres no big loss in hiding it once you are done doing your deed but if its some 200 dragon dildo well then the rules are different but lets not dwell on that  so both are pervy but im gonna hand it to the guy if they have the audacity to display such a piece a person whos proud to display what they like says a lot more than a person who tries to hide what they like
  its a lot more fragmented than the media portrays any sort of unified lgbt community is even smaller because half of the actual bi gay lesbian and trans hate each other or hate the other genders altogether and many others are ambivalent at best tolerate is really the right word for it  this is actually pretty true the extremely militant minority of the lgbtq community only serves to divide it further because they are so fucking strict and absolute with their perception of being lgbtq if you dont adhere to their standards and agree with everything they say then you are just another bigot to them and you are part of the problem    theres a gay trap on youtube channel is themonroeshow if you care to look him up that does shit about video games and he made a video outlining the problem with the lgbtq community pretty well basically he talks about how he gets flak because he dresses in girls clothing but he doesnt consider himself trans they also give him shit because he uses the word trap despite being a self proclaimed albeit jokingly trap because its offensive to trans men
  hes a bit of a brick in my opinion also one of the clear wings on mine is cracking at the hinge while the other is perfectly fine  i still like the toy but thats probably because i just like g1 wheeljack a lot im the kind of person that would pick up a cartoon edition of mp wheeljack just because of how much i like him
  link is he cute
  he is yeah you have his name you can just google him
migrate when ready   new   new 
  just brings up a big black guy
  damn that was quick wish all 3rd party stuff went from reveal to release that fast
  i cant believe this was saved i was fucking about with kneadable eraser and then jin came out with a real one
anyone else collect the loyal subjects lines  i have the main 4tmnt ones splinter and slash and am currently waiting on a macho man one in the mail their quality seems a little hit and miss some of the turtles pose well and some are kinda loose   im considering trying to get the power ranger set and possibly heman and thundercats
    oh and the dragona ball line
i only have a few from verboten horse  as hefty and partiallyarticulated as they are 12 is just so much to spend on a blind figure
i recently picked up the nicktoons line from hot topic some of the ones there are actually visualboxes but theyre recolors which is a tradeoff im okay with
  they vary motu seems pretty good though power rangers is kinda hit or miss      gamestops may actually have the horses at 488 motu too if your nearby stores still have any
    thinking about picking up ren and stimpy now thanks anon        ah gotcha ill look into motu and thundercats then also i forgot about street fighter and mega man
  ren and stimpy are commons in the general release theyre easy to get stimpy is heavy as fuck    hot topics exclusive case only has naked stimpy which goes with the outdoors ren they offered at sdcc with the fire dog stimpy skip that if you dont need it cause its a chase    street fighter was kind of a soso line because they were seriously loose jointwise like more so than other loyal subjects figures mega man line was decent though
loyal subjects are basically us version of nendoroids for those who want nendoroids that are a of american properties and b not 999 chicks     the early gi joe and transformers ones are pretty garbage but later gi joe ones and later properties heman thundercats power rangers attack on titan dragon ball etc are pretty good
  loyal subjects are basically us version of nendoroids    not at all
i have a few between tmnt transformers street fighter power rangers and gi joe and think theyre all pretty terrible i dont know why i bother when i find them consistently disappointing
  yeah loyal subjects are objectively better figures
the wwe line still isnt out other than very select 711 stores    fucking come on already
  ive got two gi joesbeachhead and copperhead id like to get some of the heman and ninja turtle ones but i can only find those online and sold as a whole case the mega man ones look like shit and im just not drawn to the street fighter ones
  fleshy stimpy recolor
my tmnt figs i like how slash is a little bigger than the main turtles as he should be also i bought raph mikey and donny on sale at gamestop but leo is a blind bag i want to replace him but i havent found one that matches for a decent price
  try ebay     i get most of them due to the fact that its easiest way to get the figures you want without having to spend 13 a piece for the chance of getting the figure you want
  i did the same when the street fighter stuff came out and the other series started rolling onto ebay wound up buying a bangedup case of tmnt s1 for 50 the only stuff i wound up keeping or purely aiming for on ebay were  4 turtles april casey  blanka ken ryu  heman skeletor manatarms  liono    really been happy with with them all and seeing that macho man has me jonesing for one as little vinyl collectibles go these things are worth hunting down because theyre actually fun to pose and play with
ive got some of the heman figures be careful because the legs can pop out of the hip joint
waiting for loyal subjects motu wave 2
  i need that orko
      op here again i just go ryu out of a blindbox and im pretty happy with the quality so probably gonna pick a few more street fighter ones     clean your desk    i know
  fyi the heaviest figure is blanka and the lightest figure is chunli
  i just buy what i want from ebay if i dont feel like gambling through blind box hell
  why the fuck does he have five fingers    first funko now this is a redesign incoming or something or just a case of lazyshititis
    thanks for the tip ryu just happened to be the last one they had on the shelf at walmart ill have to go to another store to look for the other ones  i do definitely want blanka though
  blankas hands down the best outside of zangief who i dont have hes super versatile
eh doesnt have any appeal or improvements over the revoltech ones
we could see azumanga nendos in our lifetimes
  chibishit  call me when she gets a real figure
meh  call me when she finally gets an anime
  she already has one
  anon i
    i meant a new figure  the revoltech is kind of outdated and weirdly scaled
  i meant a new figure
oh wow a nendo i actually want      never ever
  i just saw a new azumanga gacha machine in ueno the other night theres hope bois
  a new figure that isnt worse than the revoltech
  whats wrong with it i only have the model kit version and it seems fine to me
  new
  wow this really brings back memories of when yotsuba was the it toy to own on /toy/ i think mine is now in storage at my parents house but ill probably never sell it or get rid of it too many good memories there
  lets bring g yotsuba back
  chibi    fucking disgusting dont talk to me or my real yotsuba figure again
  shes so cute    the mangas ongoing right i saw barnes  noble announce they had volume 14
    the revoltech is only okay the scale is weird and the hips/knees are really outdated      is this the koto kit
  its the action figure version of the kit
can anyone identify this toy its made by disney and i believe it is part of a bigger play set when i press the button on the front the light flashes and it makes a siren noise
help
  maybe from a buzz lightyear toy or his space command show that looks like his backpack    no size  fuck you
thats some buzz lightyear of star command shit
    its not that old i think its from 2010 onwards
  yep its buzz  
  thank you how did you find that
  im bored
  but for real how
  do you know the name of the toy so i can find more
  someone in the thread mentions its buzz he takes that information and searches it on ebay/google and finds information come on son
  what did you type in because we have been looking for hours we tried every variation of blue buzz lightyear with jet pack and everything and couldnt find it and we cant even find any other versions of that same toy it doesnt even have an official name
  disney electronic toy then i eyeballed the listings
  this brings me back my first buzz lightyear was from this line it had this cool drill/wingpack that only made lights and sounds
   chunky woody   
previously on the transformers general   ignore and report/hide any shitposters as always    post neato customized transformers
  an actually clever custom  in the flesh  am i seeing things
  i kinda dig it actually altmode
  not mine i gotta check the source    other than that here pretty nice actually
  paint is a little thick but i like the concept and its mostly been done well whats the base i dont recognize the shape offhand
  whats the base  looks like studio series stinger
  could be a ksi sentry actually based on the head
  i see now not too familiar with the ss so not surprised i didnt know it
   whoop mightve spoken too soon
whats a good cheap airbrush to use for painting transformers    i keep seeing this small lowcost thing from testors at michaels that looks simple or not but dont know if thats suitable
scooped my scoop from the mail today little dude is pretty cool i rather like him so far mine or maybe more has an issue with the rotating shoulders in that they are not perfectly aligned so it makes the getting the front tires right a little fucky fun little bot otherwise i dig the little guys too
and another pic
    you the anon i convinced to buy scoop a week or so back i hope you enjoy him as much as i do anon his shoulders are a bit wonky for sure wish theyd done that bit better but it doesnt hamper my love of the orange boy
  heh lol if you are the one that pointed out he was 8 at bbts then yeah you convinced me mine needs a squad to join as he is somewhat out of place in a sea of mp carbots but i do have generations jetfire and the clone autobots for him to squad up with more pics soon but im trying to make dinner right now
  i think there was one other anon singing his praises but yeah i pushed my scoopy boy hard when asked im happy you gave him a good home anon though i agree he doesnt have many squadmates to pal around with im holding out hope for landfill to show up eventually quickmix too i guess but i have no attachment to him like the other two
  thanks for the suggestion then damn i was wondering if his bros got updated toys but maybe someday
  im one of the anons who is going to join the scoop group soon  only issue is that turns out the shipping costs more than himnightbeat and strongarm  so ill have to wait just a bit more on him but hes already in the cart
  pay 6 shipping  feel like im being ripped off  so is this that privilege thing ive been hearing so much about
got a classics voyager optimus and magnus on the way should i post pics when they arrive on friday
  yeah anon why not i enjoy when you guys post pics of recent additions
  you tell me
  seems like cause for revolution anon  seriously though how is it cheaper to ship from vietnam to us to wherever you are as oppose to shipping directly seems crazy to me
  im liking mine so far youll dig him too crazy shipping man where are you
  again you tell me since im already going to play so much might as well pile up on some extra tfs so the shipping is at least justified  planning on throwing that t30 arcee/chromia set too    pretty much stuck to the underside of murica
  lol mexico im in new mexico
  as long as you can stack up an order large enough to justify the criminaltier shipping i suppose it works out shitty though seems insane that it would be more expensive to ship a few hundred miles south of us directly i mean the ships are already on their way why not deliver one directly to tacoland so you guys can get toys at a reasonable price
  yes    yeah i dont get it either shipping prices are extremely jacked up here so ebay is pretty much useless is it really that hard to send it here  at least theres online stores here too that can find me some occasional good deals but going toyhunting is hell since its all just whatever shelfwarmed in us but times 10
stole an another idea off tfw and did some more cutting on primes top piece and they really should have molded the top of the cab to fit this way im still convinced theres extra tooling to make it look more earth styled
  from what ive heard there isnt extra tooling just that this design started its life as a g1 prime before the lines gimmick was cybetronian alt modes much like how shockwave and magnus are hold overs from potp with added greeblies
  and its been hasbro standard practice to engineer extra uses out of their molds from the get go for years now what better way to do that that to produce a more earth friendly truck mode then replicate whatever repaints they want in either mold layouts
diamond apparently leaked generations select monstructor set 129 usd im guessing it will be 6 bots going by the price    im afraid that people will skip this one and therefore further doom the seacons to obscurity
  theres no way itll be 6 bots they wont have engineered a two bot torso just for a repaintbot    maybe itll be 6 guys and one limb dude will be interchangeable justifying a true seacon effort but i doubt itll be a 6 max combiner in the same way unless they go the gay lazy route and make one a chestpiece legends dude
the transformers amazon hub went up early and apparently gave listings to shit that might be coming    its looking like the best part of siege is going to be the exclusives holy shit warden outdid himself i thoguht power of the primes exclusives like counterpunch blastoff and repugnus were just there to give a bone to the completionists but nope looks like its literal whos all the way down
    t h i n y o u r p a i n t s
  6th bot could be a weapon like a pretender shell and primemaster liokaisers was a little micron weapon and that counted as a 6th bot
  his paints are fucking fine you retard theres hardly any if at all glopping maybe just the windows ive seen you thin ur paints retards crying out on single spray paint jobs nobody is buying it cameras now reveal paint imperfections we wouldnt even seen in person these days      and that still wouldnt count
  what i said was youll be disappointed if you expect this to be a g1 prime any time soon that idea was seemingly scrapped and converted into this i didnt say that the mold contains no planned pretools
  t loser who didnt thin his paints
  lets see your thinly veiled masterpieces then hascuck    oh wait you wont post any cause you dont paint and know nothing about the whole process
amazon hub leaks  slamdance is a multipack component  this is the same as the chinese listings    skywarp pack comes with rumble and frenzy  chinese listings list this also as a multipack    feral recon squad  this is either slugfest and overkill or beastbox and squaktalk alternatively its the japanese dino cassette transformers    ai in the multipack turned out to be airwave patrol  these could be blaster cassettes
  posting gundamshit in a tf thread that isnt even his  great retort ill file it under cant argue his way out of a paper bag
thin ur paints    actually worked great on this i overly thinned them and easily created this scratched up heavily damaged look
    based fake news anon
im more pissed that theyre wasting another leader slot on optimus    for combiner wars we had two full optimus combiners titans return had powermaster optimus and magnus prime as well as primitive skateboarding optimus power of the primes had optimus nemesis prime throne of primes optimus primal and transmetal 2 optimal optimus    enough with the fucking leader optimuses already give us someone new like thunderclash
  maybe you missed my post earlier in the thread which was taken on the same shelf            but hey in case you missed it
  ok anon see this leak image see the chinese text next to the ai its 目标战士散漫 copy/paste it into google and tell me what you find
how much you wanna bet that leader prime is a direct remake of 1984 prime complete with base trailer people will see a 50 dollar mp10 and then buy out the whole fucking stock making it impossible to get
  not funny anon were not allowed to say the nword here even if its in a different language
  too late ur on the fbi list now
  oh wow still no painted transformers wowie kaplowie you sure showed me mister
  and that isnt relevant ive proven i paint and with single coats looks fine contrary to your autistic protests    oh    wait    whats this
  again
    well why didnt you just post these in the first place and save everyone the trouble    these look awful by the way congratulations on not thinning those paints
  heres another not even in my regular style      thinning paints on a quick single coat spray    ok retard ill get right on that
  thinning paints on a single coat of already thinned paints
  tvirgin who didnt post anything better    you gotta do better than that ur too obvious
being this mad you were called out  you might as well crawl back to your tfw2005 cesspit
  you want something terrible heres one of my first documented full repaints did this with paint markers which are already watered down and no long lasting
  oh first it was gundamshit that doesnt count because its not transformers   and then it was still no transformers  but then it was lmao it bad cause ive been pushed back into my goalpost and need to move it now      then tell me mister master painter judgeman let me know how i did on this guy here
  wow i havent seen you here in ages
  fuck i would buy the shit out of that pharma
  i cant say im shocked that maketoys didnt push a line for power core connectors into full production    it was like a super limited project
  being recognized    not sure if thats a good thing or bad
  i made a few more comic only characters some more original than others heres one im not sure wins as much but i like him spanner from marvel
  oh ive since filled in those purple spots that show through i often post my stuff right after finishing so the harshest critics can let me know what ive missed usually the camera lens showing things my eye cant pick up but then i fail to follow through on touched up photos
      good lord this mold looks about a thousand times better with the shoulderpads flipped down like thatthe promo shot transformation looks like shit     also like someone else said the paint is thick and globby but this is conceptually sound and i would honestly pay so much for a welldone version of this it also highlights how cool this mold actually is it looks criminally boring in its default blacknblue colors
wheres the leak about a new monstructor coming from again nothings coming up when i try to find it
  now matter how your custom turns out someone is going to bitch i have a few people recently bitching that i shouldnt have made any cw customs because the scale is all wrong
    tfw never armor parts for sentinel
  scale sucks and i dont like the mold that much but your paint is fine my dude
  i would never reference any original art done by raviolli ramalamadingdong fuck that guy absolute worst regular idw artist
question whats the best soundwave and shockwave on the planet figured i would get them before i die since they were always my favorite you can include 3rd party
  whats the best soundwave and shockwave on the planet  mp soundwave and quakewave cant remember what 3p made him theres a boxset of ko mp tapes too
someone said taobao and aliexpress were the best places for wei jiang which is the easiest to use and which has the better selection
  quakewave  man no one every mentions him but i 100 agree i absolutely love mine
  quakewave  fuck off get quakeblast infinitely superior speaking as someone who owned both and the mp i sold the other two because quakeblast blows them out of the fucking water
  which is the easiest to use  aliexpress as its in english  searches made in english usually come up with what your looking for also there customer service is better than most  will most likely side with you if you get chinkd  which has the better selection  ultimately taobao but the website is difficult to navigate if you dont understand chink or can type in chink hasbro china hides there shops from foreigners so you cant import it for less also you may have to use a forwarding service which costs extra due to them not shipping outside asia i think they do ship to the us but you may find it near impossible for support if anything goes wrong    t bought chink g2 cw bruticus  the dreamwave upgrade kit of ali
    fanstoys made quakewave i used to think he was the best shockwave out there but after mp shockwave came out i became increasingly bothered by quakewaves boxy wide torso seeming lack of a neck and strangely shaped head with tiny eye    dont get me wrong mp shockwave is by no means perfect either but it did get a lot of things right proportionally
  quakeblast  finally someone with sense best mp shockwave you can buy while also being the cheapest
  i think mp shockwave would be perfect if he was just a bit bigger any os kos
  personally i just wish theyd made him with more vibrant colors a deeper purple on his main bits and a nice shiny silver instead of that pale purplish grey he really looks odd next to soundwave since soundwave does have exactly that shiny silver  deep saturated colors
    i could never buy him in that color
  it will be all 5 regular size combiner bots and a dinky one as the 6th member like with the g2 sets
      its been a long time i have to wonder  is fakenews anon legitimately getting his news from somewhere and is just gullible  or is he a podcaster seeding news on the internet so he can speculate in his cast and get clicks
  in short  taobao  you using google translate  aliexpress  chink sellers using google translate  guess which ones cheaper
bionicle thread what could have been edition    post bonkles and concept art    enough bitching about wahhh muh dead thread either post or git out where else you gonna go huh fuckin bzpower get in here
  google plus its being killed of in ten months but it has a bioniclr community there anyway i was going through my parts and rebuilt these guys some of their limbs were broken so i had to improvise
  maybe bionicle shouldnt have a general anymore lines dead and not coming back theres nothing else to talk about besides shitty fan projects
  you are ham hands
  true also nices trips     what
  go to /bant/ and talk about it there they wouldnt mind so long as you lurk a little and read the room
  in times of old in threads of yore lost to time forevermore it was said that one day a post with trips would reveal the way so prophecy foretold    its over lads
  looks like a morrowind character
    and these now remind me of this
  true but the busou shinki line has been dead for years and that never stops the threads from being made the shinki anons just moved to frame arms girl and megami device and kept posting
  hf  bonkle
  enough bitching about wahhh muh dead thread either post or git out where else you gonna go huh fuckin bzpower get in here    thats the least of the problems here you didnt even try with the op and you know it  for fucks sake you didnt even link to the past thread
  ether way the last /biog/ thread died about 8 or 9 hours before this one was made and stayed on page 10 for 2 days plenty of time to make a proper op
  the fuck did the op even have a link to the discord and what else its not the end of the world you child
  problem is we dont even really have anything to move to unless lego finally get off their asses and make a new constraction theme are there comparable lines from other companies aside from our beloved chinese knockoffs
  go work for lego
  im not smart enough for them 
lets supposse you become billionaire and have the chance to contact lego to make bonkles again  would you do it would you start a new 3rd gen would you continue the 2nd or nothing
  id buy the ip and keep it as far away from lego as possible while handing it over to someone who actually knows how to properly handle the franchisewhoever thatd be  bandai perhaps since not only do they already have made ccbsesque figures but theres a chance thatd theyd also let sunrise create an animated series for it
  and how about buying the ip and paying lego to do bonkles again but however you want it  just asking dont even know if it could work
  id do what  said put the story into good hands and let lego make the toys probably adapt the g1 story in a broad strokes fashion keep the basics the same but fix the old lore and storys multitude of issues  make a continuityheavy atmospheric and mostly mature but not edgy animated series for netflix or whichever platform still accepts nonanimu action cartoons and promote the shit out of it it would cater to old fans but would be completely accessible to a new audience and stand on its own merit instead of being a slavish adaptation the lore and terminology would be gradually revealed instead of dumping it on the watcher at the start the storytelling media would be the backbone and the toys would be secondary theyd be modern updates of old g1 sets and possibly some flashy new ones sold at affordable price points and utilizing the smaller mixel joints
does this mark the end of /biog/ proper is it finally dead
  i wouldnt contact lego id contact someone in the comic industry and get a stand alone series made id go the transformers or power rangers comic book route so that its no longer limited by toy releases or catering to retarded children who need a dumb play pattern just tell and good story with great characters and an immersive atmosphere     then if lego or someone else wants to make toys based on it go right ahead
  id be cool with just statues or something or like 3a hyper detailed and stylized toa just give someone besides lego a shot at something marketed to nostaligafags
  i wouldnt contact lego id contact someone in the comic industry and get a stand alone series made id go the transformers or power rangers comic book route so that its no longer limited by toy releases or catering to retarded children who need a dumb play pattern just tell and good story with great characters and an immersive atmosphere    theres nothing stopping you from doing that now make your own elemental robot story with blackjack and hookers and pitch it to image
  i personally liked metru nui eighty four and its orwellian themes
  the general looks to be on its last legs but there are plenty of hey guys remember bionicles i had the x one threads to come
  youre a fucking moron whatever you think lego did wrong with bionicle youd do 10 times worse and it would tank hard why do you toy and game obsessed manchildren always think you know best if you knew anything youd be doing it you wouldnt be a fucking loser huddling with others losers talking about toys on 4chan
    continue please
    more gay ass maymays  stop
      i expect a 100 chuck 0 sneed in there too since youre clearly some fag who orbits /pol/ and /tv/ what else an npc reference neck yourself discuss bionicle or get off the thread    wouldnt it be g8 to take these memes and bottleneck thwm thu a bonkle filter lol   youre the equivalent of a brony making pony versions of memes and pop culture references because youre that fucking desperate
  unironically using the term libtard in the current year  your jokes are stale and youre a faggot
  deliberately trying to rustle my jimjams doesnt negate the fact that you suck dicks m8
  chill
i still feel a twinge of fear while reading the part in the kingdom where makuta is a hulking abomination slowly crawling to the surface to kill everyone because he has nothing left to live for
  ill share my grievances regarding anons autism if i so choose its bad enough my hobby and its community is dead its worse when the people still here to share it with are spewing shit everywhere
  bionicle is nothing more than meme fodder these days
  dont make excuses what   is doing is just like the shit bzp would pull like trans tamaru or making shitty calarts human toa where onua is black and gali is butch its gay the lego general has new sets sure but a huge chunk is just anons making shit why is nobody here doing this im broke so my wips havent gone anywhere for months but what the hell is everyone else doing cmon dont resort to fucking memes were not /vg/
  i dont post here often because im too poor to buy more sets comics or even parts for mocs but recently i have been sharing mnog with my friends two of them still have yet to play it but they are interested in it one of thems played a bit and called it super comfy and the part that makes me happy is that none of them know about bionicles story the fact that its still captivating to not even kids but guys in their 20s says alot about how captivating the series really is  im hoping that if they play the game through and are still interested ill send them the comics from biomediaproject and eventually maybe the novels and movies if we ever get around to it
    good job dude glad to see someones keeping the fun alive    where do you play the mnog the emulator i found runs too fastthe flash is all rapid and jittery and not comfy at all i guess maybe i need a version thats more adjusted to the shitty internet speed i had back then    all these pessismposters in this thread    psh you guys can never kill my love of this line ill be 65 and playing this shit with my grandkids you just watch
  you say as you feel the need to respond to an anon days after he posts faggot
  get on maskposting then
  excuse me what is this thing  looks cool
  biomedia project bro
so the super battle droid was cancelled
move the discussion here            no shitposting allowed bionicle is dead done
  i downloaded the builtin save version from biomediaproject you have to go on their games page and then scroll all the way to the right to their downloads section past all the years otherwise youll just play it on their host
  yes along with the walker  clone trooper set goodbye ccbs    dreamed that someone found a 2019 leak it was the toa mata names again but the images were all fakes or placeholders  the ride never ends
  comfy technic thread hijacked by bionicle generals limping corpse
    ditch ccbs in favour of technic and system  smaller sets  lower prices  show right off the bat  cg with cartoon textures  new story  more women in the story for the fandom to waifu and lewd  a darkness has spread across the land  the animals have become hostile the judgement of the rulers unsound bandits ravage the land and people whisper that the shadows are moving on their own  pohatu is the toa of friendship  concerned over the state of the world he sets off to do something about it  he travels to a place of learning to ask the sages of these strange events  there he befriends an apprentice named gali who is generally curious but also thinks she knows almost everything  the two set off together to investigate  along the way they meet tahu kopaka onua and lewa  tahu is hotblooded and angry he tries to fix the world by beating up beasts and bandits but his blind recklessnes has earned him a reputation as a dangerous outlaw he is written by go nagai  kopaka believes that emotions cloud judgement he is training alone at the inhospitable mountains to achieve constant emotional clarity  onua is strong but facing difficulties he cant address alone after the team helps him he joins them happily  lewa is a snarky woodsman  tldr elements aside the toa represent ways to cope with fear safety in numbers knowing being angry instead remaining calm being strong and laughing at danger  makuta is a disembodied evil and it is unclear whether he is a person or an idea  his power is fear it panics the beasts it robs people of their will or sound judgement  cultists have taken to worshipping makuta in secret to appease him  for the most part the toa are unaware of makuta and his nature dealing instead with beasts unhinged or ambitious warchiefs and their armies and cults for the first few years
    the real change they bring is through example  people are starting to cope with fear  then the rahkshi attack the toa giving them a solid lead for whats really going on  after consulting the wise keetongu the toa set off to find the legendary lair of makuta by following the taint of fear to where its at its worst but they are repelled  the toas allies start forming an army but come under attack by an army of yellow bohrok  once the army is complete and the bohrok vanquished the toa and their allies campaign to the blighted lands which bear signs of an advanced but destroyed civilization  there they fight all manner of twisted creatures contest lineup the visorak horde chief among them  the toa split from the main force and manage to fight their way into the lair itself  there in the depths and amongst technology and magic they meet umarak the mastermind behind the plague of fear  he claims he is doing the makutas will though it is intentionally left unclear whether he is mad and hearing voices or if the makuta exists and commands him  the toa tell him that he has lost and should surrender while he still can  gleeful umarak informs them of their real importance and gloats that with them before him his masters victory is more likely than ever  he transforms into the destroyer and attempts to destroy them but he gets destroyed instead
  trips of truth  whats wrong with things like mocs though maybe /biog/ should rename to /laf/ lego action figures
  i like the idea but it wouldnt be the same also compatibility would be a nightmare
  its a meme about out of touch companies its ironic
  or move to lego technic general            /biog/ needs to go to its origins which are technic
  thats fine but what about ccbs calling inika builds technic is a stretch but ccbs is a bit too far
  ccbs uses the technic system anon ccbs is part of technic the inika builds were proto ccbs
  i guess and would agree however its evolved it its own thing
  true that but ccbs works just fine with technic i would wish lego made more molds for ccbs to unite with system and technic more ccbs big thing are the shells
to anyone that has them please post more like these
            as a bionicle fan who doesnt really give a fuck about non bionicle technic sets i see it like this    option 1 stay in a mostly dead general with lots of bitter exfans grumping about how their line is never coming back  option 2 fold our stuff into /technic/ and maybe get good moc ideas from stuff posted there while having double the activity and able to keep threads afloat for once        hmm i could be pointlessly trolling or pointlessly elitist  wait why not both    you are sad strange little man and you have my pity etc
  ive never even owned a non bionicle technic set unless you include mindstorms however it appears that technic general dislikes us
  oh come on you mention bandai and sunrise but you missed it     model kits bionicle characters in the original style would greatly benefit from being kits imagine all the pistons functioning with a gear function gimmick of course that puts it well out of the hands of the intended audience but it could be neat
  its been petering out for a while because most people arent creative and dont build so theres less and less to talk about in that regard
  what the hell is your second response even supposed to mean the thread was about a different topic
  hes just buttmad that someone doesnt condone the derailing of a seperate thread with /biog/ bitching because nobody outside of the 20 or so faggots in this general my dynamic ip alone has bumped the count up by at least 5 posters even tho im one guy give a fuck anymore notice the shit posted in the technic general had fuck all to do with sets but everything to do with drama and lore related crap like faber he lashed out with accusations of trolling and elitism from  because god forbid some says anything negative about bionicle and this is coming from an avid bionicle fan myself dont spam that shit where it isnt wanted
    my dynamic ip alone has bumped the count up by at least 5 posters even tho im one guy    look out we got a badass over herejpg
  at least i think thats the term im a phonefag with 4g every few miles my ip changes not trying to sound cool boyo
  ive got you anon
  also if anyone has the source for the pics in that last post put them here ive got some of them but my collection is incomplete
  
  and thats all i was able to save honestly these were some of the best memes to come from these threads even better that they didnt originate from the discord circlejerk
  oh and how could i possibly forget
  man the phone network ip at my place was banned because someone used it to post cp
toa going to confront overlord makuta
concept art book  
                                thank you does anyone have the one where tahu comes through the screen and snaps that guys neck
  oh man i love evangelion
  just to be as real as i can be i think that they had a shit ton of great ideas and that they got neutered by corporate who just didnt give a fuck for serious theres no amount of money that would have stayed the opinion on bonkles if that shit came back with the tooth and claw it had back in the day    imagine if instead of all the sporadic content blinking into existence from the ether with little or no flow they had a story of a nomadic people under siege from a looking threat in the distance imagine if they had to explain the usual for the okotans through events going forward telling of what had already come to be for example and in complete asspulling this cos it really is so easy if the okotans were secretly fleeing the grasp of a great unknowable terror and by taking a final stand they invoke their destiny and become master protectors the toa parallel of the new generation    so yeah maybe the lego heads really dropped the ball on that one but its okay im happy we got all that we did and better still im no longer the lost matoran in a mysterious world im now the turaga the one who tells the stories of old to inspire new heroes such is the way of the bionicle no
  thats not much of an insult anon
  did he ever draw more gali i want some grotesque tiddies
post some good looking vorox mocs  zesks are fine too
good lord this is sad ive only been gone a few months and this general is beyond dead i think fan projects actually managed to kill interest faster than it would have died without them  well i became a tokusatsu fan so peace out forever /biog/
  for a moment i thought that portal was a hauesque shielding bubble
i tried really hard to get into the reboot but man it was so embarrassing beyond the initial toa all we got were lazy designs and shitty animations     pic related was the first big indication that lego really didnt give a fuck
next thread should be renamed dead toy franchise general and merged with the other extremely niche /toy/ generals so you guys stop wasting space in the catalog and maybe get more than 3 replies a week
  im just so fucking done with these retards every time i posted anything including my own mocs since spring ive gotten pretty much nothing i distinctly remember fuckers spamming the sw figures and doing the typical disneyshill posts for yous and that was the only time the general got any real traction ive been here since 2014 and its gone died somewhere in the summer of 2017 the fansites are barren and this general has gone the same route any anons still on /toy/ are in other generals now because orbiting around the same handful of faggots from the discord and that one retard promoting his shitty bionicle lewds is not worth it and im doing the same /lg/ should be fine at least they still actually appreciate the brand beyond nostalgia and using it as a springboard for memes and porn   inb4 some jackass calls me a faggot for having a negative reaction to my experience here for the last few months
  /lg/ should be fine at least they still actually appreciate the brand  pretty sure a vocal majority of /lg/ despises bionicle its not like we even need to fold into another general either plenty of toylines have comfy occasional threads
  retard alert
  the occasional thread is fine imho trying to do keep a general going is doing nothing oh and i meant lego as a brand not bionicle physical figures have barely been seen in these threads for ages mocs included but whatever ill see myself out been fun guys
  ywn see mahri nui arc fully animated in your lifetime
  god i want this mask so bad
pick 1 to be your friend
  wasting space in the catalog    you know /toy/ is one of the slowest boards on the site and many threads last months right tmnt is twice as dead despite having active media and merch and full of /co/ tumblr refugees go sperg at them for a minute while the adults talk
jump ship you faggots 
holy fucking shit /toy/ is still making bionicle threads this is amazing
  i require the rest of this guys art i remember his roodaka was a qt
fucking ccbs is fucking awful id much rather they dropped the shells and reintroduced greebles but by making the sets multipart buildable kinda like the liandri bots from ut3 or imachines from id0 ive been trying to make various bodies like that but the heads are always either too big if they are wearing masks or helmets too bland if they are using just the basic headsor too abstract if they are using systembuilt heads id like to use krana on moced heads but i cant come up with anything good
  get good only idiots cant understand how useful ccbs is
    you cant be serious
    how in gods name was the art for g2 so incredible and the story so limp it makes me sad
ive had a thought a while back in terms of lore and how it relates to the sets if at all and was wondering what you guys think   it seems to me that all the toa we have came to be through unusual circumstances   mata/nuva were custombuilt  ignika were boosted by the red star spoilerhow the fuck it decided to do that i have no clue/spoiler  but the toa metru came into existence by the normal means matoran pulling energy from toa stones and becoming a toa the metru also share designs with iruini and norik though im sure thats coincidental it works     that leads me to believe that the metru designs are the standard toa designs the ones that most normal toa would adopt
anybody think this thread might look like its dying because op didnt put a searchable /biog/ in the title that shit makes it hard if youre lazy to find the thread so most people just dont bother     its not a problem on faster boards where a thread goes by in an afternoon but here threads last for months     i would also be trying to put together my own mocs/redesign projects but i dont have any of my bionicles or legos with me for the extended future so its not much of an option the subreddit for bionicle is still pretty active /r/bioniclelego usually has a few new posts every couple days
  the last general where we had that alien contest lasted months with the proper op face it anon its just that nobody gives a shit anymore no amount of suggestions will make everyone who left come back
  do you mean without the proper op   because well maybe but im not ready to give up on bionicle just yet and the same applies to /biog/  where else would you recommend i go for bionicle stuff then biomediaproject is fantastic but doesnt offer any discussion the reddit is nice but slow is bzpower still around   ive also seen similar sentiments on the subreddit and that worries me a good bit i hate to see a community die just as i was becoming aware of its online size
  im pretty sure gregs explaination was that when matoran become toa they turn into what they think a to should look like the metru looking all the same since the only living toa at the time was lihkan who had that design as for norik and iruni i think he said they were lihkans heroes or some shit
  norik and iruni i think he said they were lihkans heroes or some shit  that sounds stupid but i love the idea of likhan fanboying like vakama did to him
  is bzpower still around  it is but its barren i think most people have gone to places like shitty fb groups or one of the handful bonklerelated discord servers  i like the bionicle threads that occur every now and then on this site theres been a minor upsurge lately on various boards but theres very little activity
  i see i see makes sense   know any good discords
  no i meant with the proper general op it was around for like two months because the general was so dead ttv is barren bzp is barren honestly i would say post in the technic general or lego general with mocs because they dont mind i asked myself and maybe /co/ for the lore discussion i feel like a general for bionicle on its own has lost purpose since the topic itself has lost this much steam
  i see what you mean   im not quite ready to give up quite yet though the subreddit is still pretty active posted pic related a few hours ago as custom matoran designs that i thought were pretty impressive   /co for lore discussion   could do it /tg/ had a really great thread the other day but the second one has come across a little forced it could use a boost
  wait are those made in some kind of program what is it i dont remember ldd being that good
  get good faggot there are hundred of ccbs integrated mocs that look about a thousand times better than that bullshit you posted
  no the thread is dying because weve replaced it with /tech/     stop posting in this one you fucking brainlets
  thats studio if i remember correctly     no you decided that i will happily post in and bump both threads i dont care about technic and they dont care about us spamming our admittedly autistic bionicle lore
  dude we created that thread were not invading anyone just migrating somewhere more relevant technic is still a theme bionicle is not bionicle came from technic it makes sense for the general for bionicle discussion to be /tech/ from now on
  so talk lore on /co/ faggot this thread is pointless outside of that and theres only a dozen guys here who even bother discussing the lore portion
  theres no such thing but from the ones i seen the reddit one seems to have the most consistent bonkle discussions because fans from all sorts of places congregate there
  ill check it out then thanks
    oh so you were serious show me good ccbs then not ccbs plus system or technic just ccbs if you cant then show me mocs where the bones arent visible in the limbs through the of legal connections with other lego pieces
tfw made a thicc matoran moc and ashamed of it  but still also kinda proud    i feel like i accidentally became a new chrischan just by building it feels dirty and not even in a good way structurally it was quite fun to work on though
  maybe not be a faggot and actually post pics whats the point of talking about it without pics
  meet my impossible standards or youre wrong  name one g1 set that doesnt use technic and is strictly bionicle parts you cant because its a subset of technic itself just with new molds on top pins liftarms gears its never been pure its still technic at heart ccbs is the same way youre telling him to show you a ccbs moc without technic but motherfucker even with the very first ccbs figures hf wave 2 figures they had technic connections system parts because ccbs is an evolution of a subset of technic its an evolved subset of fucking technic its never been purely sockets and armor never will be and like anon said if you cannot use ccbs and make a good moc its not because the building system is shit its because your skills are the only thing you say is shit are the limbs okay the limbs can be made of other parts without utilising the armor plates so you dont have the exposed sockets use the old bionicle hand connectors and some liftarm/connector hodgepodge for the biceps/thighs and then tada no exposed sockets git gud
  and why do you care anyways the system is dead aside from being used in the occasional mech set
  well post pictures of it you fuck
  jagu
  you better fucking post it faggot
    you are one watermuddying cocksucker you make an evidently right unrelated argument g1 was technic pretend i disputed it prove it and pretend you showed me  the argument started with me calling ccbs shit anon said its great and that im shit then he tried to move goalposts by saying that there are good hybrid mocs incorporating ccbs instead of staying in ccbs mocs i dared him to prove that ccbs on its own is good since the initial argument is that it in particular is shit failing that and proving my point he could then post hybrid mocs    ccbs is the same way    ccbs sets werent released under the technic line you epic mongrel    bbut muh pins    and studs so i guess elves now counts as a technic subline on account of its dragons    the limbs can be made of other parts without utilising the armor plates so you dont have the exposed sockets use the old bionicle hand connectors and some liftarm/connector hodgepodge for the biceps/thighs and then tada no exposed sockets git gud    ccbs is good  but the limbs  replace them with nonccbs ccbs is still good and youre bad    i mean come the fuck onits so crap that you have to replace it  ccbs has a bunch of issues for example gaps and wobbly torso shells but at least these can be fixed by putting crap under the torso to support it and fill the gaps not so the limbs the bones are glaringly visible and instead of a multipart robot they look like a noodle humanoid wearing junk the steamlined look of the shells making the limb look like a long box cut in the middle doesnt help either there are addons but they suffer from lack of variety and add bulk to the one side that doesnt need it
  cont    and like anon said if you cannot use ccbs and make a good moc its not because the building system is shit its because your skills are    then prove your point by showing us good ccbs mocs if your issue is that even the official sets arent strictly ccbs then post mocs made only by pieces from hf minus the first year super hero ultrabuilds chima ultrabuilds and g2 hell lets make it the monthly thread challenge but no spamming system parts or technic beams because the official sets didnt spam them either inb4 impossiblestandards        because we have piles of it the company is still using it in constraction and if we get a new constraction line then itll be using it and be expensive too
        anticcbsfag pls no bully    i tried    ha ha time for thicc
    an attempt at dat ass was made    not entirely successful but at least the design flows except for that fucking balljoint on the back of the neck that shit triggers my autisms
  post your epic mocs using only bionicle parts no technic do it faggot
bionicle may be dead but this is still the funniest thread on /toy/    thicctoran
    shes a big girl    4 u
   so is ccbs still shit if it improves the look of hybrid mocs with its parts library as a sole system its the least versatile of the three but can be done well greivous is a prime example of ccbs looking good on its own at this point its pretty much just a subsystem used for system or technic sets but it actually makes shit look better and has sugnificantly more durable sockets than old g1 parts they streamline with the other systems much better too a system set like a mech looks infinitely better with ccbs connector sockets than it would with the old technic/mata ones its lukewarm as a standalone but it lends itself to the others and vise versa the uniters and ekimu were just starting to show how great hybrid sets could be and if we did get a new theme i bet you my left nut that should it use ccbs they would also use the techniques shown in the 2016 sets ccbs is the worst but i wouldnt call it shit its the least good but still alright
    dont worry friend my anger is reserved for the foolish like this peddler of bullshit over here     you know when people get backed in a corner and give a different response like the conversation was about something else in an effort to change the subject where they pretend the things that cornered them were never said and prevent the opposition from reestablishing its points having it address other points of course you do youre doing it right now youre challenging me to post my supposed epic mocs as if ive been bragging about my skills and you want to impose a limitation that both sides of the argument have acknowledged to be wrong g1 was a technic subline and its pieces were technic  so in addition to being a shill and a watermuddying cocksucker you are also a hypocrite    now to get back on track ccbs is shit you claimed its great and that people who hate it are shit instead i asked you to back your claim by posting cool ccbs mocs and instead youre trying to talk your way out of it meaning there fucking arent any  now post them
  where is this pasta from if its not pasta i think the sentiment at the end is nice
    ccbs durability is undeniable its one of its only two pros im thinking about making some heretical bones for older sets with it  now about hybrid building im all for it if itll make a better moc however  1 ccbs does not synergize well on account of its complete lack of cross holes and very limited use of peg holes  2 lego sells ccbs sets not hybrid sets you can modify your sets but when a product is so bad that it needs to be fixed by the consumer right off the box then its unacceptable especially for the price lego is asking    greivous is a prime example of ccbs looking good on its own    thats because grievous and the cis are the ccbs of the sw universe skellies with a bit of coverage here and there its a case of the system matching the source material battle droids wouldnt even need shells on their limbs    the uniters and ekimu were just starting to show how great hybrid sets    hold on are you refering to the shoulders
  id forgotten how good the music for bionicle was whoever made this needs more work
  shoulders chest internals weapons legs like with kopaka
a shame my bionicle parts are up in the loft and studio doesnt have all the parts because id love to make an moc based on the rahkshi as they appeared in the movie specifically those fucking heads    jesus the rahkshi were fucking creepy kinda like xenomorphs except literally spawned from actual cyborg satan
    per the wiki all makuta can generate kraata  all makuta can make satan spawn body horror xenomorph exosuit worms because     what did greg farshtey mean by this        chef_kissesjpg    fucking love that entire album you can still feel the freshness and the excitement of the brand sinking in even two decades later those shitty synthesizer composers had no idea what bionicle even was they were just told to make cool robot music and dammit they delivered
  apparently hes still releasing smooth jazz albums every now and then i was so psyched when fans discovered a couple of previously unknown bionicle tracks a while back they still had that heavy sense of 2001 atmosphere  bonkle had a lot of good music during its run but i always found it a pity that it didnt have a signature motif that carried through the entire line the films the games and animations had their own sets of themes with little to no carryover between them on one hand this made each piece of media sound unique and gave them their own identity on the other unity was supposed to be the main virtues of the line
  try bricklink studio maybe     because theyre really fuckedup bastards what the great beings were thinking when they put those fucks in charge i got no idea
  what the great beings were thinking when they put those fucks in charge i got no idea  at times like this he wonders if the great beings are truly brilliant beyond imagining or hopelessly mad or if theres even any difference between the two
    this is fucking pathetic dude
  thats what im using iirc its other name is studio it has the classic rahskshi parts to be fair but it still lacks a lot of bionicle parts might still give it a go though
    still the best movie rahkshi moc ive seen
  no it uses ccbs that means its shit havent you been paying attention to the thread
holy shit this is fucking dope
  i fucking love when people replicate the imax designs with irl lego bits
how is still around unironically
  this thread is surprisingly good at enduring     you arent kidding thats almost pictureperfect anyone know what the piece they used for the helmet is
  looks like the top is a slizer visor with some black teeth for the side bits i assume the internals and jaw are system
  how the hell does quick healing work as a power  i mean did the rahkshi on bara magna just reassemble themselves or regenerate from severe wounds
posting some of my bonk pics
this was when i had just gotten all of the initial wave back in early 2015 i got a 200 from my granddad that christmas and was able to collect all of them say what you want about how objectively good or bad the sets/reboot was these toa will always hold a special place in my heart
  i guess i forgot to crop that one /
  wave 1 in 2015 is the best imo the sets are all cohesive you got an army of enemies built right off the bat and the wonder and mystery of not knowing how g2 was going to pan out was just great
  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka  go piraka go piraka go  piraka go piraka go piraka
   bzpower  bzpower  now thats a name ive not heard in a long time a long time
maybe lego will be able to make enough money with all their goddamn movies that they do a big budget bionicle film series
fucking bzpower oh my god
  i remember playing with my bionicles in elementary school outside at recess in this wooded area on the property it felt just like in the promotional pictures and comics from lego
say what you will but the 2015 bonkles look amazing together
  not the triggered  one fucking job
  aesthetically and setwise they were honestly pretty damn great good piece quality nice colors and designs decent gear system story was just aborted   even the art from the artbooks is absolutely incredible its clear they had tons of ideas they just did a poor job of putting pen to paper and lego aborted it
i miss the good old days bros
  forgot to add the pic
  the only bohrokkal i never had i know some people disliked the kal for just being redecos but i loved them but then the bohrok were probably my favourite bionicle enemies in general
i loved that in the early days that the toa were basically the tribal equivalent of the greek gods with all their showing up unannounced and sorting shit out i loved that anyone running into them would recognize what they were but not strictly who they were i loved that the story didnt expressly tell of all the rules for what magic could do and what it couldnt i love the constant allusion to more adult themes i love the characters all acting as insular characters even while in gatherings of up to 10 characters in a room i love that the stories carried this somber dread with them even in the happiest of times just because of how large and oppressive the whole world seemed i love that i love it all    i just love bionicle
  for just being redecos  thats not the only reason to dislike them
  what did they do wrong
  krana should have been the metallic version of their primary colors but they fucked up with mixing ta/nu/pahraks colors up  no clear marbled with silver or something so the krana are totally obscured anyways  at least those are my complaints
for me it has to be the toa hordika especially for imax film designs but the rahkshi are top tier villains
  what is this from when was this in the story
  this had so much fucking potential its unbelievable to conceive that it never went anywhere
  from the g2 concept art book it was never used in the story
  speaking of wasted g2 art
your plight has moved me /toy/ i am going to make the spiritual successor to bionicles ive already started 3d printing the prototype models and laser cutting figures based off of the following character model sheet
tfw bought loss at walmart for 5 in case im able to build g2 makuta  never get around to getting the other things i need  end up using loss parts to modify my von nebula to look better  and i gotta say that i like how he looks now will upload pics later
  mtown was fucking based the vahki were awesome too heck i would make them real if i could
  i think one of the reasons why mnolg was so fucking good was because the toa were seen trough the eyes of matoran making them look like the legendary demigod like heroes instead of a bunch of quipping morons like later years and g2 seemed to portray most toa as
  excellent
  i wish i could see a constraction line with a lego movie budget in my lifetime    lets be honest though it would be the least successful lego movie in theatres yet
  me too man metru nui was written as this massive spanning metropolis that you could get lost in just exploring shit sounds awesome     i get what you mean but i think its hilarious that both are true matoran see toa as unstoppable crazypowerful heroes on demigod level toa see each other as a bunch of squabbling fucknuggets   they may have gone through the oh fuck now were the toa twice with the metru and inika arcs but honestly them growing up to stand alongside their heroes and realize theyre people too is just so kino   but yeah on the more heroic side the different speeches that the mata/nuva gave when things got tough are just great
bionicle thread  its never end
i posted my waifu gali i made a few months ago heres a newer build which im happy with for now
  here is my current prototype this is tino leader of the group
some questions that popped into my mind about lomn  why didnt the toa metru specially vakama due to his job know their mask powers if their kanohi are common as fuck in their universe  why did vakama knew about makuta teridax when they found dumes sleep ball
  i always thought the first was just shitty ass writing also since the movie was a prequel i already knew what their mask powers were so all the suspense and mystery was lost on me i guess its one of those well we wanted to tell this story so we threw logic and established lore out the window kinda thing  as for the second i believe greg or someone explained vakama was literally a crosswired freak and his brain accidentally received signals from mata nui hence his visions    gotta also keep in mind the movie was rushed as hell the animation is barely finished at parts and the script was just as much of a mess
  anon if you upload these to shapeways in all available materials id gladly get a steel one or some shit as a desk knicknack
  the animation is barely finished at parts  i didnt notice that  but i find it more jarring that the same door in onu/po metru is used twice for the kanoka disk sequence and the escape from the vahki after getting to turaga lhikan
  framerate drops at random points and half the time they didnt bother animating the mouths they even recycle shots here and there its not like the other bonkle films lack any blatant technical shortcuts like pic related but theres an extra scent of cheapness and tight deadlines surrounding lomn in particular  designing all those elaborate metru nui locales must have eaten up way too much money and time
 it hurts bros
  i am working on the prototype to cut down on rendering time and overall not look like shit once i finish that give it a week ill upload the files for you and get started on the modular limb system ive got kicking around in my notes
  updated character bible for the animated series im working on
this is neat  i found an old japanese bionicle fansite  
  didididididid you see all the frightened ones  didididididid you see all the falling bomb
  jagu  has no friends  has no grace  but this bot has a funny face  
  if rushed as hell the miramax films are good imagine the result if they had more time
might as well post this here anyone who knows anything about the fate rpg system feel free to offer input im trying to recreate the feel of g1 but i think ive failed so far anyone have suggestions on what kind of rpg would best fit bonkle i want to avoid d20 and focus on minifigure and mocbased play like actually playing with the toa as a kid but you have a whole world built and rules for their quests and things    
hey ace you dumb faggot let me into the bionicle discord
  this is cool thanks anon  too bad i dont have any friends to play with 
  very similar to the mctoran i like it
  i agree that the reboot was shit however how does the gali mask show that collectibles were one of the key parts of the golden years
  yeah but galis transparent mask was never released to the public it was a bonus gift produced in a limited quantity for some lego inside tour that fans werent even informed about youd think it would be a nobrainer to release it as a collectible item since it has the same color as galis original mask fans would eat it up but no every other toa got some kind of transparent or partially transparent mask released in some form except for gali
  oh right i see where youre coming from i suppose collectibles are kind of pointless if theres only a couple that are just held back more than anything else
  does the shaping stay consistent from behind
heres my new self moc    thoughts
  just call it a self insert
  digimon universe appli/ appmon
  id say so ideally id like to have something on the back of the upper legs to make the shaping better and have the nuva ass stick out less as a result system pieces might work but i dont have any in gunmetal i considered putting urukhai shields there but i cant find a good way to attach them
  hes cool personally im not the largest fan of ccbs bones though but i like the grey you used which set is that from
hey ace  you fucking idiot open up let me in your little server oh wait you dont browse the thread never mind
    fuxk off you dumb cunt if you arent going to contribute anytging meaningful    i really like the sand blue shells still bummed about the lack of solid color protector masks though
  we originally planned on a cast of 9 squatbots but the last 3 pic related were cut due to them coming across too much as individuals while the other members could easily be apart of a greater tribe these felt too unique and personal for what is going to be the first line we have planned
  wrong pic
  on the shells its sand blue like the og motoro those pieces came on jango fett    still bummed about the lack of solid color protector masks though    it would have been great if they had mask packs like in 2001 it could have had regular villager masks rare masks and the golden toa masks rather then them coming with the sets
    forgot to reply to you
solid protector masks would be great
  yeah looks good btw howd you connect the nuva armor to the legs
  oh cool i agree though mask packs would have been great
  t seething lbtard
  i wish theyd kept the mask packs going desu can you imagine the metru or mahri masks in all 6 colors
i guess this could be considered concept art this is an early preliminary model of tawahi from bionicle the game
do you guys think a lego movielike bionicle movie would work
  thats what they tried to make so many years ago before miramax sort of actually did what they wanted i think the lego movie works as it does since the lego brand is so diverse in its themes and properties whereas bionicle is a single plot thorughline for the most part
  that would have been so cool
  and the tripple pin piece is connected to an upside down vahki torso which connects to the metru chest piece this build does have a few illegal connections but no broken pieces at least the upside down vahki torso also makes it that the legs cant be tilted in theres probably a better way to make the torso and i might have a new idea right now
    silence libtard
  forgot pic
  it barely worked for ninjago which is way more popular and more inline with what people think of lego than bionicle ever was  should they ever make another bonkle movie and i dont think thats a good idea to begin with they should keep it rooted in its own universe and follow its own tone and style rather than try to imitate something thats radically different from it
    ah thanks
    playing that game on pc with a keyboard was a fucking nightmare i think its the reason it took me so long to get back into gaming
where the fuck is my cute heartwarming lariska x nidhiki shipfic
  do we even know what the fuck she looks like
    im still mystified why lego thought it was a good idea not to orient the new sets around collectibles    like for fucks sake 90 of the appeal of the toa was you could send them on quests and collect masks and shit what can you do with the masters slap a monster on their back fuck off i want my exotic weird masks hidden in ancient temples and shit and the masters never had any reason to work togetherthe toa were forced to try unity and duty because they needed the kanohi
  why did vakama knew about makuta teridax when they found dumes sleep ball  the whole visions thing  in my headcanon vakama made the replica of dumes mask himself as personally requested by teridax so once he saw dume he immediately put 2 and 2 together makes vakamas whole deceit and selfinterest line a bit more personal as well
  just that she has bluegreen armor and a fully mechanical arm
  and the masters never had any reason to work togetherthe toa were forced to try unity and duty because they needed the kanohi  this g2 seemed to have a messed up understanding of what unity meant a lot of the times it wasnt working together and helping each other to accomplish a goal while learning that its okay to rely on others it was literally combining with some other creature to attain a powerup or just smashing into/shooting powers at an enemy to overwhelm it through sheer numbers the g2 toa didnt even meet until they had already got the golden powerups robbing them of any sort of chemistry or development for the first half of the year
    counterargument by being on their own they had the spotlight to themselves first you establish a character and then you move onto interactions in theory at least there wasnt time even for a single character and most of it went to one character anyway similar to how the budget wasnt enough for the project and most of it went to a single thing the prizes for the golden mask competition    or just smashing into/shooting powers at an enemy to overwhelm it through sheer numbers    i liked the idea i remember the g1 toa using their smarts most of the time instead of the elemental powers and physical attributes that set them apart from the matoran it was quite rather queer and mundane you have powerhouses and you have smashable problems fucking smash burn shit if youre not going to utilize what makes a toa toa then you might as well make a little guy story about the matoran countering force with smarts
why did roodaka have tits
  here is another level this one was completely cut from the final game due to time constraints
    what fucking time constraints they had the level finished and put it in the game files too in fact this goes for all the included cut content in any game time constraints my ass
  agreed the reason the time constraints even happened was due to procrastination although not fully finished it is the most completed unused level left behind in the files
    do you have a picture of the toa meshes handy
  hows this these are from the pc port ripping the models from the game is actually fairly easy
    nah i meant the more accurate ones from the cancelled game how did you rip the models from the mol game ive used 3d ripper in the past to rip them and the guys from the glatorian arena game
  the model format was reverse engineered back in 2014 there was a python script that extracted them from the first chunk of a decompressed archive from the pc port the script was filled with bugs but i have corrected a few over time
  masks powers arent determined by their shapes
      shit is there any way to access that level on the pc version i think i fucking still have that game installed
i hate how we never got mask packs past the mata nui years the smart thing would had been to not only release masks in various colours but also give them marking patterns or double colours people would buy the same mask molds even more times in order to find a striking pattern on a set of colours that would tie moc palettes together fans would blow their loads and their money especially if the lore assigned professions and deeds to the markings
  its only in the ps2 port it took me months to get it working
    do you happen to know how to rip meshes and textures from ds games i remember looking it up in the past but the tool links were dead
  on an actual ps2 or emulated
  emulator only you need to use a hardware hack to even see anything hoping to fix that soon
  do you like have a link or something
  i want to make a few adjustments but ill probably leak the iso after that
  neat
all this talk of vidya reminds me anybody else play the gba bionicle the game if i remember my reading right that was the only one where you could play all 6 toa the 6 toa nuva and takanuva good open world times     controls sucked dick though
hello again /toy/ i just got back from 3d printing the new squatbot model from here i plan on sanding down any rough edges making slight revisions to the file and work on packaging for these things as well as start a new prototype modular system for replaceable limbs/features in case anyone is interested i will dump the file so anyone can access it thanks
  i played it briefly all i really remember is some awkward platforming as gali
  yeah the platforming sucked too honestly it wasnt a very good game but i have great memories of it
important  watch  
  suck an egg you braindead grapefruit
  jesus christ i shouldnt laugh but i am
i know everyone considers the mistika bad sets but are the phantoka sets also considered bad
    theyre pretty similar but the mistika are hated more because people have had enough of the genericness of the inika build at that point personally i find the mistika much better than the phantoka and mahri tahu looked like a ninja with his mask and lower legs and onua had the jap heavy weapons guy look with his broad hatlooking mask and heavy weapon
  for the most part fans seem to be more accepting of the phantoka because they at least minimally resemble their old counterparts i think all the grey makes them look way too dull personally whereas all the silverpuke gives the mistika a unique shine  honestly i dont dislike the phantoka/mistika toa as sets but i agree theyre pretty pitiful as revamps of classic characters and the need to give them those bulky launchers made most of their weapons rather uninspired
want to make a combo toy series  book series about tiny robots on an island  seriously considering calling it afterman    how quickly would faber sue me
  honestly i really liked the colors and designs of the phantoka/mistika they werent great revamps but then i dont personally think they should have been the toa nuvad picked up a fuckton of adaptive armor at that point so it makes sense theyd be different     piece quality was pretty bad though i have a lot of snapped joints from 08 on
    it was a dark year both physically and in the story bats underground cave/swamp avtoran are being exterminated and terry wins    silverpuke    g2 certainly handled silver and gold a lot better by making them parts of the colour scheme instead of spamming them to indicate power up but then it got replaced by transhit  the designers supposedly use silver because it gives a sharp look which is bollocks because its the shiny chrome that gives this look not the dull silver and mustard gold that the company is using        ask him
    the thing is the toa nuva had not been represented in set form for 5 years they had been delegated to background presence in the story and say what you will about greg but if he hadnt kept giving them appearances in the books and serials theyd have been all but forgotten    this was their big return for the grand finale of the story that began with them if there was any time to cash in on nostalgia and create faithful recreations of old characters it was then
  theyre the skulls of rahkshi she killed she wears them like trophies
  are you the same guy working on that tumblr becausd theres already a person doing a bionicle successor called project afterman
  omg a jala mask
  wtf a silver kanohe mask
  you know thats a fair point i get that if i had been older i think i would have been frustrated but i was like 12 at the time so i wasnt too bothered   maybe a moc that combines the aesthetic of the originals/nuva build with newer pieces and flight would work
  makuta used them as hands
  doing something new is always better than rehashing the same old shit originalitynostalgia this stunted manchild mentality that everything needs to be a recreation of something old is a cancer on society 2008 lewa and pohatu were two of the best canister sets ever
  i like 08 pohatus design but forgetting what made your series good or ignoring what came before is a good way to be really shitty real fast   also phantoka pohatus mask sucked photoks is way better
  are you the same guy working on that tumblr  afterman founder here that first post wasnt anyone from my group were doing a story only no attempt at toys
  normally id agree especially as my experience with transformers fans gave me a distaste for this lets be fed the same shit over and over forever mentality too but the 08 toa were the classic og team and lego went all out with the media to tie them back to the earlier parts of the story they were presented as recreations of older things  the story team and set designers should have worked more closely to tie the merch together with the story and media take the nuvas base designs and update them to suit the theme of the year i think the phantoka pulled this off for the most part and much later the g2 designs were also a nice balance of classic traits combined with updates hero factory managed this too i never felt the mistika did it and making gali a hunchback over onua felt especially off  to be fair back during g1 this was the norm updated or mutated characters barely ever resembled their previous forms
  they werent very original though
  whats the point in making such a fanfare about the original toa coming back if they look completely different and have all sorts of different powers  they might as well have been a new team or they should have stuck to the original plan which was to have a 3rd year of inika team
today we celebrate that we still exist    new /tech/ thread        
does anyone have a picture of the preliminary master tahu mask that they changed in the last minute
anyone remember the morbuzakh that thing gave me the creeps when i was a kid reading the comics and indestructible force that just keeps growing in the bowels of the city
  yeah man shit was wild   also are we making a new thread or forever living in /tech/ from now on
  just do a new one
where is my bionicle legacy line huh lego
    they killed space for star wars they made arctic/underground/adventure parts of city they killed the futuristic knights they killed castle they killed the line with the cheap creative sets and great joints they made g2 into a minimum cost cynical cashgrab they cheapened their plastic quality and they are charging their own fans the royalty fees to make star wars and harry potter merch  now the painfully generic multicolour team is getting a legacy line while the line that saved the company is getting shit fuck this gay company legos shitty decisions have earned it a place in the gutter and by shitty i meant mean spirited in addition to ill conceived
  it was a neat fillerboss but it arguably set the precedent for the generic not setbased tentacle monster baddies greg was so fond of using in his stories
  new thread hop on in
cheap as fuck  articulated  great for army building  more accessories and better sculpts than hasbros toys that cost double    was pleasantly surprise with their kong rampage and jurassic clash lines
  lanards were literally the only western made action figures i had growing up i thought they got trashed but somehow they survived the toy purge    i simply called him redcap as a kid and made him the team commander but looking at him now thats a fine south american communist revolutionary if i ever saw one    modern ones have wrist swivel do they this is the only thing that bugs me about these 12 yr old toys
the head sculpts on their figures are a mixed bag but theres a lot of good stuff in their toy lines
  tfw you remember when lanards corps figures were articulated like 8294 gi joes    i think theyre using a mix of conversionera 2002 molds with new stuff that has slightly more articulation in 118 scale you really cant beat them on price/availability
  are those dino rider esque guys getting released in the us
  what fig is on the left
  looks like a microman umi sonoda
  how are the microman arts figs
  their 1/6 scale line was also pretty good for the price they sold around 10 bucks you got a figure and a bunch of gear to play with i still have a bunch of 1/6 scale ultra corps and 1/18 th scale corps figures
  what is this
jurassic clash series
  only problem is the dinosaurs cant be posed and the rex looks like 2015 hasbro jw toys
  better sculpts than hasbros toys    ya had me until that point i love lanards stuff used to get them to help supplement my lack of new joe stuff but theres no way their best sculpts can measure up to hasbros best work     though they did get the 4h to do their rampage figures sadly the qc and articulation on them is pretty weak but they make great display pieces
  this fag again you going to lost those old ass head sculpts again there
  its way better than jw rex mattel fucking blows them up with their fk line      well i mean modern hasbro with 5poa articulation and yeah shitty sculpt i really miss the vintage collection days in my country theres no black series figures at least the 375 ones    and for the rampage line i think its pretty their city brawl sets are amazing lot of stuff and a cheap price my only complaint is georges hes really underwhelming       planning to get this one    smoke is my favorite so far he kinda looks like nicholai from re3 and el jefe reminds me of turok
  what us stores sell the smaller dino sets ive only been able to find the bigger ones at go calendar
  dont know in my country the kong and rampage lines came out almost a year after the us relase all in the same store
  weebshitposter here its a great reasonably priced figure the draw is that you can play with it rough like a kids toy but it looks like an import toy should as opposed to a shitty childrens cheapo toy    articulation is spongy on the knees and wrist due to the use of polymer tubing to cover the joint and rubber molding respectively shoulder articulation is also restricted by the joints being quite deep in the torso the arms cant be tucked into the torso
  extremely chad pose
  not him but those old ass sculpts are still better than most modern sculpts from anyone not hasbro even from collector lines despite being only 118 scale       i mean modern hasbro  cant really speak on the shitty 5poa crap but they current 375 star wars black series figures still show hasbros a game    and the photo youre saying really shows how soft the sculpt is on lanard stuff even the 5poa star wars shit has sharper detail than that  everytime i see the corpshit at stores i always feel bad that they have nice designs but everything about them is hampered by the sculpt even if they werent so cartoony id buy them as cheap background fodder for my 118 collections but i have mattels crapacular jurassic park figures for that cheapo paint and little articulation but they do have nice sculpts and i can always add some paint to bring out the sculpted detail
can someone post pictures of those socalled better sculpts than hasbro im not familiar with lanard but all the ones i could find on google have proportions and paint apps that are even shamed by the star wars 5poa line these look like fucking discount bin toys for hells sake
  the hell are you on about i havent talked about lanard or hasbro toys on /toy/ for months and i usually dont to be honest freakin auto word replacement crap because of spergs like you not everyone who disagrees with you is the same person      well i mean modern hasbro with 5poa articulation and yeah shitty sculpt i really miss the vintage collection days in my country theres no black series figures at least the 375 ones    i wasnt really thinking of hasbros sw stuff as i never bothered with their smaller scale figures and only have a minimal amount of their 6in black stuff i was mostly thinking of their modern era gi joe molds which had some sculpts that were just absurdly nice boss fight studios was responsible for a lot of their best figures iirc and they seem to get pretty positive feedback around here    hasbros weakness has never been with sculpt its always been the paint apps time after time theyd release a figure with a derpy face out of the box some half way decent modder would repaint the face and the figure would see a massive improvement the shape and sculpt is there its just covered by crappy paint apps    and yea the big city brawl sets were great values and i wish they werent a walmart exclusives and b not a short run product im still kicking myself for not getting some ralphs when i had the chance as its impossible to find him at a decent price nowadays    unless i actually go into a walmart shudders
i like their stuff sometimes they have cool accessories     their sculpts took a huge jump forward a few years ago but they havent really followed that momentum up dinos look cool tho
  these look like fucking discount bin toys for hells sake    you mean like the last jedi line that nobody want 
last thread didnt die it simply faded away    post little plastic men they can be army men cowboys and indians space men knights cops etc if theyre small plastic and unicolor theyll do
  army men are awesome
these are my favorite threads on /toy/ theres relatively little infighting and is mainly just people sharing childhood memories and trying to relive those memories you guys are great
what do you guys actually do with army men other than set up dioramas and shit
  as with any other toy roleplay and act out conflicts anon
  god damn i loved the army men series even as a kid i knew they werent the best but i didnt care air attack series the best    maybe its time to break out some of my old soldiers and relive the nostalgia of playing with them while watching a war movie
  go for it anon its healthy to act like a kid sometimes 
  setting up battles is fun but a lot of us do in fact roleplay and pretend battles are going on it just makes you feel like a kid again
      there is indeed rules to play with them as tabletopgames in different settings
  great pic
would a little green army men webseries be something folks are interested in
  what would you mean by webseries exactly are you suggesting something like a photocomic strip using army men to tell stories cuz thatd be pretty cool
  photocomic was a good idea im running with this
  make sure you provide us with a link i recommend starting your own thread
  relevant thread  your classic little green army men with an italian twist  
    i want to get a tube of these someday if only to have some token italian troops too expensive to armybuild pic related were originally italians in my childhood armies think they were packaged with an italian flag too but i realized later on that theyre actually australians
bump
  is that officers pistol based on a real gun
  no its based on the austin magic pistol
      kek
  i have that very same soldier but from italeri 172 i truly dont know why they would make the pistol like that italeri had the original beretta
wheres a good place to buy a decent amount of army men preferably ww2 or early cold war
  amazon local toy store ortoy soldier depot  if you want tanks then go to a dollar store/thrift shop/3d print them
  i wonder why a company thinks its ok to release a dangerous toy on the market like this and lawn darts too
  agreed
bumping this thread with more mega nam boys
  all you need is some little plastic emus and you can recreate some of the most fierce combat seen in aussie history
  seeing a bunch of army men take cover behind a candy bar barricade really takes me back thanks anon
are there any brands making roman soldiers
ive been thinking of making a small battle scene has there ever been a zombie or alien set
  ive been thinking of making a small battle scene has there ever been a zombie or alien set  pretty sure you can get a bag of 100 zombies from any wargame store
  sometimes they pop up at dollar stores i think ive seen some at walmart and walgreens/riteaid with mostly cartoony green zombies vs blue nam era army men
so do you guys have any neutral forces or smaller armies in your collection im thinkin about getting a cheap bag of guys and spray paintin them to represent a mercenary/rebel army
  i got boers armies in plastic taliban/mujahideen armies in plastic and i use some of the texans from the alamo from some playset i dont remember the manufacturers name cant post pics now maybe later theyre all online though
  there are about one hundred distinct units in my plastic armed forces ranging in strength from a handful of men to hundreds generally speaking theyre all subject to division into two distinct sides however theres leeway for neutral or flipflopping armies i even have certain units identified as mercenary and several others could also fill that role if needed
question where do you guys get your army men i only see them at the dollar store and walmart
  online
anyone know if there are martial arts army men around it would be cool to have like a kung fu set or something
  can you be more specific
              
    i got aussies from dgn ready to slay some emus
  another glorious evening in this mans armyamazon really does have some legit army men stuff you just gotta browse some
  they used to make ninja army men back in the day and i think you can still find them online
ninjas eh
  is this them    as a side note natsoc ninjas confirmed
soon
  yup
which would be the best for imperial guardsmen
  there are starship troopers arent there   or colonial marines
  they do make colonial marines and xenomorphs army men
    i got these and theyre kind of neat but i wish there had been a flamethrower dude included also the queens more like a praetorian due to scale but whatever
bumping in hopes of reinforcements
oh snap my ninja arrived today
40 in one bag 39 in the other was a dead bug so good news i got the chase transmorphing ninja bad news i prolly got chinaman aids now    79 aint a bad haul in my books now to autisticly organize them by color and mold
12different molds  missing one from each color set   reeeeeeeeeee
  are you missing the same one
  nope 3 different
bump too swamped with work and school to have much army men fun so heres some zombies i got last halloween
  awesome
  is that a famas
  clearly it is an ak47
    you both need to get your eyes checked its clearly an ar15 assault rifle with a bananaclip and a shoulderthing that goes up
  not recognizing an assault musket with springloaded bayonet
man i remember i had lots of tiny indians and cowboys troops around 15 cm tall i act out huge battle with my gunpla and tanks i think theyre on my parents house now
  pretty sure its illegal to use a swastika as a weapon since its antisemetic how did they get away with this
  by being asian
i so want terminator army men
  bless the inventors of the swaskita      id suggest the megabloks terminator figures but theyre impossible to find now
  mfw the liquidation centre here has about 30 of the terminator armybuilders and a wall of the singlefig packs    never saw them in stores here either outside of one sighting in dollarama
  from the dollarama comment im guessing you are in canada    im in to and i have never seen those guys
  yeah alberta here i didnt see them myself at dollarama but a relative did the one time see  and  in the mega thread for my finds
  i just see a bunch of minions here in ontario    there used to be cod about a year ago there was some other stuff including turtles but no sign of that now   my local walmart has some halo stuff dont know exactly what as im not really into that and there were 2  cod things winter troops and a antiaircraft gun i dont really have interest but may pick up the winter troops if they are there thurs    the great canadian superstore has heroes and lots of pokemon    the toys/babies r us has lots of the big crawler and a couple of overpriced viking ships some halo but no cod monster high or anything else
does anyone here still play with their toys  like moving them around and voicing them and all that
  i sure hope not
relevant to this thread
  i swear out of all the weird shit ive seen on 4chan in the past 15 years the weirdest of all are the people who click on a board just to tell the people on the board i dont care for this topic
  ye nothing wrong with it
  i browse this board every day and collect toys my man but it still amuses when i find out that grown ass men actually play with toys
  the stigma is already against us the moment we collect and own the toys     may as well use them as intended right its not like normies will stop judging you if you dont play with your toys
pic reminds me back when i was a kid i had a variety of toys figures and legos with all that imagination bloomed it was pure bliss like i was creating my own tv show in front of my eyes now when i try to have fun or recreate my action figures its just derp shit i just want creative kid me back
  i dont voice them but i fiddle around and put them into poses and shit
  megazord btfo
  oh look its this thread again
  oh look its this reply again
  i dont really do voice or real time moving i pose out battles mainly
  i really love having effects with my figures now
  kid me wouldve shit my pants over this it also feels like a fun dbz battle to me but i certainly dont do voices    i find it relaxing to smoke a bowl and pose for an hour or two before bed its a fiddly unwinding session
i send my joes on patrol on the backyard when i have the time ie almost never probably like 3 days in a year and take pics of them but i lost the hability to make voices and dialogues it is not so much the cringe than what i come up with is never good enough they have no real motive to be on a patrol i dont know wtf they are even looking but it is fun posing them and moving them around
  no
  well this shitposter constantly makes this thread every few days of so so of course its going to get called out

  just renact the holocaust with your toys thatll inspire your adult creativity
okaythis is gonna sound turbo autistic but yes i still play with them but its more than that i own a large range of action figure at roughly 112 scale a bunch of marvel legends imports star wars black series and dcuc not too mention spaceships from star wars star trek basically whatever ships i can get with a bunch of these i have over the course of about 5 years since i turned 18 creating a massive sprawling narrative   the setting is set in the far future and any sembalance of a unifying government body has been gone for centuries some worlds are post apocalyptic others are cyberpunk in a way its a bit like star wars in its variety there is magic in the setting a la the wheel of time with different weaves of magic for different effects there are also personal forcefields a la dune that either take a lot of firepower to overload or swords the main plot follows my anakin skywalker black series toy as he goes from simple farmhand to a conqueror unifying the galaxy against a great evil i act out all of the battles and most characters have their own ships and alliances ect the rest of the time i just display them all if i see stuff in sci fi tbat i like i usually find a way to add it to my imaginary universe and plot     most of the time i buy action figures based on id i think there is a place for them in my universe  pls no bulli i know its turbo autistic but in every other part of my life im actually quite normal got a steady relationship good job nice flat ect
i stopped playing with my toys fairly young upon realizing that if i just imagined the story instead of acting it out i wouldnt have to clean up my toys afterwards thats the same reason i quit building forts     on a related note timeouts stopped being an effective punishment once i realized i could just picture stories in my head to entertain myself       what effect piece is that
  creating a massive sprawling narrative  ive been doing that for as long as i can remember starting from my first figure ever up until the last i dont play with them per say but every new purchase gets added in the overall story i have in my head which at this point in time has become quite complex the setting ive come up with is actually quite similar to yours but the most accurate way i can explain it is to imagine warhammer 40k  a miyazaki film with some classic superhero tropes thrown in there i also incorporate each specific characters real backstory and mesh it into the bigger picture so for example darth vader can interact with someone like tarzan i just finetune tarzan to be a rougher version of himself to fit into the world ive created since i cant really use the disney version of the character  like anyone else i have specific characters that i like more than others so they naturally play a bigger role in the story or i amp up their powers while still staying mostly consistent with their repertoire so i wouldnt give batman laser vision but id increase his overall strength to above average levels if the situation demands it  for the record ive sold or disposed of 90 of my old figures but they still play a big part in this internal narrative ive even thought about writing the whole story down and i might just do it one day i just dont want it to feel like a ready player one type of deal i want it to be organic as if all of these characters come from the same universe and nothing seems dodgy when you see pinhead interacting with superman
  just to be clear i have to own the figure/statue in order to incorporate it into the story for example i would like to add michael myers in but i cant do that until i get my hands on a figure i also wont be incorporating the god hand from berserk until i have all of them and so far ive only got two
  sh star lord effects i sold star lord and kept the booms
  not him but i too have part a narrative that ive imagined but cant play out and it sucks cause the figures i would need would probably never come out   id like to mix some of my berserk figmas with kingdom hearts and final fantasy characters but ff only does 10 play arts now and ideally id want them to be 6 and for kh id want to have vanitas terra xemnas and riku from pic and etc   but thatll probably never happen so ill have to come up with something new if i ever wanted to really continue that fantasy
  i used to use my star wars figures in a story that would very loosely follow the clone wars/rots basically war and anakin becomes vader but then i would pretend the world would become really war torn and obi wan barely escaping the empire would basically trade being a jedi to becoming a soldier using my old snake figure and i would use old mgs villains as partners of vader that would fight snake and his rebels
  mechacatfight
  ill think on that thanks anon
  shit ive had a story thats evolved and been revamped to hell and back in my head for over 20yrs the original idea centered around my kenner aliens figures i always loved the xenomorphs design even as a kid so with one exception all my xenos were good aliens with sentience and could speak like humans just fine the one exception was the scorpion alien he was not only a dangerous xeno but superpowered and cruel with the desire to conquer the universe he and the gorilla alien were twin brothers in my mythos the gorilla being a defender of the universe from his brother the scorpion alien would routinely get defeated and killed exploding gimmick but would get resurrected for every billion sentient lives that died in the universe since his last death and so the cycle continued endlessly this big bad villain has been a concept i kept developing for years until eventually everything changed about him the current incarnation isnt a xenomorph anymore but still shares some of the features with them no eyes lithe frame and instead of being hellbent on conquest hes now obsessed with pushing life to its limits to force it to evolve into a perfect organism think dr manhattan meets dr mengele in a vaguely gigeresque package
      these are great the effects really do add another dimension on the flip side seeing photos like yours make me sad as im shit at posing everything of mine feels static
  i wish i still had the imagination to enjoy doing that
i dont voice them but i do fiddle with them a lot i was about to say i dont really play with them but then i remembered that i was literally flying pic related around like an airplane when i finished building it
      aside from creating arcs repurposing characters and modifying their backstories  ive established an entire universe in which the adventures take place complete with locations physics rules etc only once have i done a fullon universal reboot to keep things as concrete/streamlined as possible til i feel like doing it again here is some of my lore    takes place on a doublesized earth for freedom of adding any new countries or major areas but not too much same old countries still exist but not as politically/cuturally accurate countries include   a usbased country with various points of jurisdiction by various hero teams and birthplace of most human characters an anthropomorph country disney country the sortof secret lego country etc    an entire/vastly uncharted solar system full of planets serving as birthplaces for various extraterrestrial beings planets include cybertron planet bungee the revoltechian moons etc    most wild fauna is either nearly extinct or farmraised with pokemon being the main wild species that roam many parts of the earth any other animals previously migrated and evolved to their established country where they live among themselves and even move to the primary country if they feel like it    all pokemon exist from gen 1 to gen 36 with many indigenous in their specific parts of the world every time a new species is introduced it also means the governing system that controls the sport/license to raise said species has been approved of its use in such    the main universe is also part of a giant multiverse this particular one being the prime and very close/accessible to other universes such as  the magic realm the digital world the retroverse etc    i dont play with time travel all characters live in the present motoko has teamed up with wolverine mega man and x are allies sometimes also are related    and thats pretty much it other half of the fun is modifying characters
  my friend and i did this so much when we were kidsa huge world with different sections of toys but all interconnected in a story i miss those days
no i pretty much just stick them on a shelf its why i buy cheap stuff like marvel legends if i posed them played with them and took pictures then id buy imports
i dont play with them like i have characters for them but i definitely like moving them around like theyre fighting a bit especially when i first buy a figure its boring if it just sits there or stay packaged for life
  no sakurachan
  thanks i was pretty shit at posing but using other peoples better poses and copying them really helped me find a groove for what looks good and what i like    also just angles some very intimidating looks can only be pulled off in a pose that look ridiculous from any angle other than below
  as a transformer fan not a collector but i have a bunch i like to rotate them between storage shelf and desk storage is where they go when i get bored of them shelf is for doing poses or intermediate storage desk is for fiddling with and is usually reserved for the smaller and more fun figures
  shes still alive i need her for another episode when she battles syaoran
bump
  i want to see how goofy it looks in other angles snap some pics my dude
  yes ive got kids  its fucking sweet
  they have no motive to be on a patrol or even know what theyre looking for just made me think of early episodes of red vs blue where its basically just dumb/asshole/lazy future soldiers with nothing better to do and only one guy even wants to be there and do his job at all     or like some kind of progression where the joes were super serious and enthusiastic about their job back in the day akin to your own childhoods take on them and then years later your adulthood they know they arent going to find anything in their patrols and when is this war even going to fucking end but they still end up trudging out to do their job nonetheless with a more easygoing demeanor and they mostly joke and have conversations that might not be out of place in calvin and hobbes clerks or space ghost coast to coast depending on your tastes
  i never really voiced them out loud unless playing with another kid i just imagined dialogue and made explosion noises under my breath since quiet kidskids who got more toys in my family i also lost the ability to play with them at around the age of 12 just looking at things and imagining them until i got into warhammer at 16 which filled the void     but as an adult i absolutely love building lego sets and transforming transformers
panzar forward 
  if theyre small then i suppose i do what counts for play id fullon play if i didnt have games stories to read videos to watch and work ive always liked articulated versions of a character or preferred to wait for one most times over something nonarticulated since i really like making poses especially based on things they couldve done in their story and just didnt  voicing  once youre older you should have the memory to simulate what voicelines you want even if theyre things that the character never said granted i dont have a talent for replicating voices with my own

  what is this display  i need it
  7268572  these are some weird looking beyblades
  100 yen store cases with mounting tape    
what are these things
    this fucking guy
  for why
anyone know what the deal with jungle is ive been getting a system maintenance message for the past week
  jungles a scam site bruh
  all those shakariki sports  the absolute unit
any chance kuuga agito hibiki kabuto and decade ss figuarts will get rereleased next year
  let me ask my uncle at bandai and ill get back to you
find a genm watch on manda   its a storefront item but pop an order down anyway cause maybe ill get lucky  i did    aw shit kami watch is mine
  i think hlj actually saved me money but jewwing me out of my watch now i will have a complete set once i get kabuto double and decade if i got the genm watch then i would feel obligated to keep going with nonmain riders  im not just trying to convince myself its fine shut up you dont know me
  you mean all the kamen rider chronicles
  ah that would make much more sense
  the only other watches i want outside of main riders are the rest of the exaid gang especially cronus and poppy i wouldnt have bothered placing an order for genm only the watch was 2500 yen which is cheaper than what ive seen it for in a long while
  i saw that earlier and thought about grabbing it but passed youre welcome
    nakano and sahra still have them
  fixed it just for you
do any of these have newer versions
  find out for yourself its not hard
  no they dont
  an absolute psychopath
i really want to get the neo decadriver but if it doesnt have attackride and final formride cards for w through zio i dont see much point to it
      it has attack rides and its one thing to get the voice actor to announce the names of the riders that came after but the final form rides with maybe the exception of w literally do not exist yet
kuuga watch is still up on both amiami and hlj  w watch is order stop/discontinued on both and the decade watch is order stop on amiami and not even up yet on hlj despite the heisaber being up on there    this is the worst
  it comes with final formride cards for phase 2  they dont show what the riders turn into   what a nightmare
got these 5 showa rider shfs im really just left with the rest which dont have a ss    not sure if i should just go for it since they may get a ss anytime soon i could only get these in confidence because they were either recent releases or recent rerleases
  oh nice
  no it doesnt
did anyone else who ordered the thunder gridman minipla kit get a processed order from hlj yet mine still says discontinued and i contacted there cs and they have no idea hopefully they get them in this week but who knows now
  i did the same said they still awaiting stock and thats its discontinued because they cant fill anymore overs what they already have logged my cs rep said to email him back if i hadnt at least gotten a payment request by midweek i got my po in late so i am kinda worried mine wont get filled due to manufacturer shortage
  yeah i got mine pod in an open spot that lasted like 20 minutes back in oct 13 i believe doubt ill get mine in time but its not a p bandai item so i dont see why theres a shortage
  i dont see why theres a shortage  its pretty simple so try to keep up they didnt make enough to fill all the orders   if thats confusing simply reread it until it makes sense   
  anon was just asking a simple question its frustrating when shit like this happens and yet here you go acting like an elitist niggerfaggot hope all your items have a shortage smug bitch
  found the retard
  its not a p bandai item so i dont see why theres a shortage  this doesnt even make sense pbandai items are made to order unlike regular release anon you are confused
  you are confused  youre right i was confused on that  id still like to know why ordered demands arent met and why a mainline release wasnt manufactured enough in its first run
  i think they underestimated the amount of newfags that would hop aboard the gridman hypetrain
  newfags  gridman  i could understand if its the anime variant but nah this is coming from someone who owned the dx jp toys and has been a fan since i came across the vhs of ssss in 96 but sure plop me on the anime only bandwagon
  i dont think he was specifically referring to you
  you can be a fan of original gridman all day long and still be a newfag to this site to the process of ordering collectibles online to almost anything
  ive been on this shithole for years and still dont understand half the inner workings of my hobbies i still enjoy them though ive just never had an issue like this with hlj
  still dont understand half the inner workings of my hobbies  you and me both friend it doesnt help that new stuff is always coming out improving everything
  i have had stock shortage notifications on preorders happen with hlj amiami and hobbysearch
  im saying if it did and that were the case that would be my nightmare i know that they havent confirmed final formride cards yet
  are you same fucknugget that had a goddamm aneurysm over people asking questions in the last thread people ask questions when something happens thats outside of expected norms yes its always a possibility stuff like this could happen but when you shop with a place for years and have no issues and then one run of the mill item gets hung up and cs gives you a uhhh check back later its completely understandable to ask questions you fucking fag
so ive looked around a bit im looking for a sh figuarts rabbit tank for a decent price i dont care if its the rider kicks version or not i just love that design does anyone know of a place where i can still buy it more or less for retail  im from europe if it helps
  looks like its still up for preorder on bbts
  are you same fucknugget  no i different fucknugget
  mandy
  i checked yeah they dont have it sadly      its pretty pricy on bbts though no  i feel like the regular price was far less
  normally bbts scalps the shit out of imports but 50usd is about what the 20th anniversary version of build retailed at the regular retail build was cheaper but this one was never reduced
  ah right then i would have liked to have it by christmas so i may try to find it somewhere else but ill preorder it at least to be sure to get it
fucking where is the kabuto ridewatch why isnt it coming back in stock on hlj
  because you touch yourself at night
  that cg another kuuga is so out of place
  ive ordered from jungle several times and not had issues i wouldnt say its a scam site      does this mean another kuuga wont be in the show
  does this mean another kuuga wont be in the show  what makes you think anyone here knows
  if it does appear then it better be a regular suit
    hes movie form
looks like the neodecadriver got pushed back to may    i wonder if theyll keep any of the csm only sounds from the regular decadriver in it so people who bought the csm cards get a nice bonus
  i think something went wrong with making denos suit the picture on the ridewatch looks was different something didnt translate from his concept art
  why do that when they can just sell a csm newdecadriver later
  the rider kicks went for like 35 on nippon yasan bro
okay guys quick question if sento is such a genius why doesnt he save the extra time to henshin by keeping the full bottle caps in the correct orientation theres literally no reason to keep them twisted out of place
  gotta show the kids watching the toys gimmick sento is smart enough to know that his show would get retooled like hibiki/gobusters if they dont sell enough merch
  the transgel becomes a liquid after being shaken up so if he kept the bottles open while moving around a lot their contents could spill out
  if thats true they shouldve made the bottles only insertable when oriented correctly but since it doesnt really matter it just feels like a useless gimmick
  you forgot to take into account that nippon also charges rape shipping
  dx time mazine geiz mode  diend ride watch  march  source
  i just got stronger in the mail last week and he looks just fine alongside ss ichigou and amazon
  
has anyone started getting their anniversary figuarts yet i preordered ex aid which shouldve came out this month
  its a shame theyre just a single watch with just a faceplate you swap out
  any other decent showa figs to recommend anon i want to complete showa but im afraid of ss releases popping up and destroying any value they might have
  but im afraid of ss releases popping up  jesus christ tripfag youre acting like were getting ten ss figures a year wed be lucky at all to get v3 next year and maybe another showa one the year after they dont just arbitrarily throw out ss figures for everything  i dont understand why newfags think ss figures are constantly dropping/something to worry about let alone that ss figures existing at all somehow ruins the original figures that almost always have more accessories than ss ones
  showa ss  hopefully they dont release any more and focus on riders that are cooler or have more interesting designs that need rereleases instead
  eh its more of my autism that makes me want to get the ss over the originals
  not that bad actually if you combine shipping and dont go for three day delivery or you could wait two months with sal somewhere else if youre poor
  that almost always have more accessories than ss ones  are you a poorfag in denial or something because thats not true at all
are these sic bandai figs any good i just finished s2 of amazon riders kr amazon and amazon alpha is just so dope but the sh figuarts are too pricey becuase their old but the personally not worth the cash for and old body type does anyone have this or any other kamen rider fig from this line
  they are not old
  having pulldown hips does not mean they have an old body type get over yourself  just so dope  oh i see youre one of those troglodytes
  all the amazons figuarts are new sic are garbage
  yeah but they have the old hip and shoulder joints is my main point so not old just not rereleased in a 5060 range so any info on my question my boy
    you are an actual retard and have no clue what you are talking about thanks for giving me a giggle i guess
  jin was dope he killed amazons and doesnt afraid of anything
 it the articulation they look like the suffer from play arts stiff pose syndrome
  theyre rereleasing the amazons figuarts only with some blood stains mandarake also has omega for 60 and alpha for 80 which isnt horrible
any canadians are you noticing a huge slowdown because of the postage strikes  i ordered some stuff at the start and got it in the same time frame as i have past orders but i recently ordered some more stuff and i am worried it is gonna take quite awhile
if you missed figuarts wizzles hell be available on amazon in january he costs a little bit more on amazon though
  it was going relatively well for me but as of last week deliveries have gone silent as long as nothing gets lost ill be fine
    i had a delay with the gridman amiami order not being able to shipped out till now    though i dont know if thats the result of not having enough of them to ship out or if the international is now being allowed to ship out
did anyone here get the genm watch from amiami i just got my sal shipped preordered time majin and it was sans the watch
  no one that ordered the time majin from them got theirs same thing happened to me
    nobody that didnt physically buy their toys in person got a campaign watch
have to wait until january to get dan  suffering
  im still trying to hear back from mandyi tried to order one yesterday morning
    thanks for the responses anons that really blows though im 0 for 2 on the campaign watches so far
      yikes i dont think ill even take the gamble next time theres a campaign ill just mandy it i guess they were getting frustrated at gaijins snapping up the rare stuff instead of those in their honourable clan
  amiami only did the promotion for a specific listing for the driver
tfw when a president fucking dies and all us post offices are closed for some reason  reeeeeeeee   give me my damn package
  oh come the fuck on really theyll call a postal holiday if a dog shits i guess
  i think you got lost and meant to post here 
anybody at all gotten a payment/shipment/any kind of notification from hlj about the gridman minipla noticing the reviews available on yt are all a week old and seem to be exclusively japanese im assuming there is some kind of issue getting the online retailers their stock for shipment or something
  dude did you pick the private warehouse option its a selfpickup service and you need to pick it up at their office at kurohakamacho 1621 sano tochigi 3270813 japan
  i know how hlj and their private warehouse works its just that 8 days past the release date is a little odd never had something i po and have released take this long maybe a day or so but not 8 i know its not a terribly big deal but considering its a surprise birthday gift i really hope some fuckery doesnt occur and i have to resort to ebay i knew other threads could be testy but hot damn ask one question not related to karate bugmen and people get pissy
  dont worry buddy ill mail hlj cs right now with your question i guess they dont respond via email so ill have to do it retro via snail mail thatll take 2 weeks is that okay with you
  had the payment process like a week ago or something maybe they just couldnt fulfill your preorder
i have a question for people with build drivers are the silver pipes below the bottle slots supposed to be able to be pushed in or is that just mine
w watch popped back up on hlj  click on it  discontinued already    motherfucker
previous thread   didnt think this needed to be said do not reply to shitposters  report and hide  now with that said what is the worst figure you have that you cant help but love
  movie dreadwing hes shit but his big dumb cockpit face is somehow endearing to me
  fatboy energon prime is the best bad fig
  now with that said what is the worst figure you have that you cant help but love  prime knock out hes not a terrible figure compared to others but hes so hollow and his clear plastic arms are a nightmare and yet hes such a fun and charming little fucker
  the worst figure you have that you cant help but love  probably this lil nigga
will they ever take another crack at a deluxe arachnid obviously the prime deluxe is trash but the legion is cute and i just like having a female con who isnt just begging to get dicked onto the good team  i never got a second one for that naviko custom either regrets
  probably not happening in this lifetime
  too bad i like bad girl bots and wouldnt mind a rotf lockdown style makeover for the character just to have an extra bad bitch on my con team oh well theres always slipstream i suppose
  which wont get a good toy either with what cyberverse is doing  only hope left is that the shadow striker scout has windblade tier poseability so she can work as an actionmaster
  the energon yellow keep scout with the red energon axe all the energon figures are too damn tubby and squat    the only good scout i had was the white falcon decepticon drone with his green energon arm blades had a cool face too never got the dino drone one
  oh fuck me sideways what are they doing
  gerwalk  hope this has knees and a waist otherwise no good fembot figures
  this waste of 300
  jesus is that her entire upper torso and head sticking out the back the lack of elbows is already a dealbreaker to begin with holy shit will she get a real figure or just this flipaction garbage
  welcome to cyberverse where gimmicks are more important than being a functional tf figure  will she get a real figure  hahanogif
  do people even buy these i feel bad for the vietnamese kids/women who have to assemble this shit just for it to get clearanced out at big lots a year or two later what a complete waste of plastic time and money
  if how rid did is any indication warriors and scout are going to sell with the ultras being the shelfwarmers and anything past that not called prime/bee is also going to be glued to the shelf for half a year  shame especially with shadow striker shes not only a fembot shes a frankenbot
  it doesnt matter once they hit the shelves the damage is done   hasbruh still gets their cut this continues for a few years until retail puts their hand up after contracts expire
  frankenbot design  neat that couldve been great id have been on board  god can you imagine crosscompatibility with weaponizers you could make genuine frankenbots using various limb parts no balljointpopping required oh well
  if youre lucky shell get retconned into a g1 character and show up in wfc youre gonna have to wait for a ten year prime anniversary for anything else
  she officially got a g1 version in star trek vs the transformers
  you wouldnt happen to have a pic would you
  unfortunately shes hideous
  issue one had a slightly better shot but i cant find it have this for now
  that is one shit character design looks out too of place to fit in geewun
  dropkick could be an easy retool if they ever wanted to do movieverse
    apart from her dumb crest i dont mind this id buy a decently articulated chug version     she and windblade definitely dont fit the g1 but star trek too motif but i dont mind having them around in general
    if they gave her a prettier face and a less boxy torso it would be alright
  not to mention that unlike star trek which appears to be in continuity with the animated series transformers is not in continuity to the tv show its a micro continuity very loosely based on it
    ohthats unfortunate thanks for the pic though
i would like to buy an optimus prime preferably one thats in production and cheap any suggestions please
  siege optimus prime
i would like to buy a die cast metal optimus prime that can transform does such a thing even exist anymore i had one as a child but it got stolen by the usual demographic
kinda new to /toy/ honestly but i did remember having and enjoying the occasional beast wars toy or whathaveyou as a kid damned if i remember which ones i had though i think a scorpion some dragonthing and a jet looking thing i was a retarded kid that lost parts of the toys all the time and even chewed on them  ive still got a soft spot for transformers though and kinda want to get one but im not sure where to even start aside from pick one that looks cool like when i was a kid  i would say im too old for this but hell im sure theres people older than me on here so whatever well met and all that
  pick one that looks cool  thats honestly just about the best policy
  it figures niggers have the goodest of tastes   you could always try the war within optimus
  not aware of anything that uses primarily metal parts these days maybe another anon is as previous anon said the new seige optimus is probably a good entry point if you just want optimus prime on your desk he comes with some battle damage paint that looks like trash but it comes off with some rubbing alcohol if you want honestly there are so many primes out there both official and unofficial that i feel like we should have a chart for recommendations    scorpion  either scorponok or quickstrike as for trying to buy new tfs youve got the right idea when you say pick one that looks cool thats really the only criteria that matters here whether or not you like it id say first step is decide what you like/want do you want a completionists collection or a shelf of random cool figures bw cast or g1 or some other set gotta figure out what you really want before you can start shopping around
  im a simple man of simple tastes  2 warrior class toys one before frankenbot one after frankenbot  if they were rid tier i would buy them
  i know prime knockout is bad but im being tempted by the beast hunters one is it worth it      what makes them bad
post bots you regret not buying
    actually like what they did with slipstream in cyberverse made her a constant failure who starscream and shockwave verbally abuse and insult constantly and she just has to take it while hoping she can prove them wrong one day  shadow striker has a rather dark backstory where shes now made up of parts of her former lackeys after an explosion that killed them and damaged her taking her down from a bot who could take down optimus prime to a fucking gimp retard out to kill bumblebee for revenge     way to make me want to actually buy characters from a cartoon again just to give me this shit
  i should have carried my wallet by the time i was able to get it and head back he was gone
  he suffers from the same problems regular knock out has but for me thats not really a dealbreaker kinda gotta decide for yourself on this one but i personally would say hes still worth it
  twinshot
    not in america
  dreadwing well hes just no good  his stumpy little legs his weird bulky arms his giant nosecone head hes a mess of a figure   i got him for free though and after posing him around a bit i found a strange fondness for him
  you can still buy him right now even amazon still has him in stock for 18 bucks
  only 5 bucks if i include the shipping cost seems cheap enough  havent seen prime but i already liked knock out from the few clips i have seen from it    triggerhappy    nope    hes the one peeking from the wall
  hes the one peeking from the wall  thats dreadwing yeah hes a weird lad but he pairs nicely with movie swindle and payload
  only 5 bucks if i include the shipping cost  oh yeah then hes definitely worth that at least
  oh i see what you mean now  he pairs nicely with movie swindle and payload  werent those very good figures either
  mp ratchet and grapple  theyre the two holes my mp collection has now
  a past thread said the gimmick rid figures sold like twice as well as the normal rid figures with kids hence why cyberverse is literally all gimmicks     i didnt see a source but hey it makes sense at least
  if i didnt include the shipping cost still its only around 13 with it
  theyre not the best without the claw gimmick payload right would be better but i sort of like the cannon gimmick swindle left has i like them as a group with dreadwing though they all have that singleeye drone look to them i think they were drones in one of the movie games but im not certain
  rip
  finally got one for cheap    good things do happen every once in a while      you could get the ko grapple i keep hearing its apparently good
  i meant i know both have their issues such as swindle useless head and payload being prone to falling to pieces  but they look good for me but maybe thats because i like monoeyes
  i missed the chance to get one for 20 or so at least i bought soundwave and soundblaster
  i feel like we should have a chart for recommendations  this is a really cool idea    maybe something with quality fun and looks points for each figure
  wiki quickstrike  aha that was him  but yeah i just want maybe some cool ones on my shelf  im not too familiar with the scale of the toys either in terms of size and i guess complexity its usually deluxe up to voyager and then leader class is what im understanding with some things getting bigger or smaller depending  ive been watching some reviews on the tubeyous on some transformers that catch my eye well see where this goes
    i second the notion of a recommendations chart some anons have found some true diamonds in the rough either cheap or really underrated  it would be fun
  this seems like a character wed get in siege eventually if it makes you feel better     unlike poor sky lynx
  well if you like them and dont own them go for em if you can find them for cheap i bought payload on a whim during a drought while he shelfwarmed and wound up liking him more than id hoped     even just a chart with robot/altmodes for each optimus and a name labeling what it is otherwise its creation would get bogged down in opinion wars over which is best all id want is a visual comparison    go for what catches your fancy then anon if you dont still have your childhood quickstrike get one off ebay hes a great figure and i still love the one ive had since it was new and think he holds up well compared to modern figures
  it would be nice god knows i need another expensive collection hobby though
  finding 10 years toys no matter how hard they shelfwarmed is harder than what it looks especially when living outside murica and ebay charges you more for sending the toy to you than what the toy costs to begin with
    let me do something about this
  we might get a titan sky lynx if the pattern for titans releases continues but it wont be out until 2022
  as much as i love sky lynx im unsure how well a titan class would actually sell    i could imagine seeing a tidal wave titan class before him
  godspeed anon id suggest just starting from the earliest optimus and working your way forward through the years topping the list off with notable 3p versions and the weird shit like playstation optimus and that one whos a pen wip should be posted for other anons to fill in any overlooked gaps for a complete image of how many optimii there are out there
      i think skylinx would work as two leader class figures that just happen to combine it might mean they do something interesting with the launch crawler lynx part if they did it that way
  theyve released a rival to each of the titans well scorponoks suppose to come out soon so theyll have to do skylynx if that pattern holds up    plus its pretty hard to fuck up skylynx he doesnt have weapons to lose or end up gimped due to costs the transformations are pretty simple at best hell have some compatibility with whatever new gimmick they push
  i feel you i got into collecting about a decade ago and even then it was difficult sifting through the decade or so worth of toys id not paid attention to and trying to pick out anything i wanted to track down not to mention picking up g1/g2/bw stuff i found i wanted just go for what you want and dont overexert yourself trying to get everything at once youll have a good time
  yeah im still learning that  and trying to not fall off the other edge of can afford something but cant decide what to buy
  part of the fun of this at least to me is indulgence not to be confused with impulsebuying if a certain figure has been on your mind lately above all others go for that one even if youve had others on a backlog waiting until you could afford them buying something onsight without knowing about it beforehand though thats impulse buying and while it sometimes produces unexpected surprise favorites it sometimes produces regrets its a gamble going in blind thats why i love /tfg/ where i can learn about a toy before committing to buy it
  yeah i tend to watch at least 2 reviews for a figure before making my mind on it  works around 90 of the time but sometimes only does things worse
is there a cheaper place for transformers other than tfsource i feel like im getting ripped off from those guys
      i only took into account the figures of the main g1 lines of recent years
  amazon ee if youre buying a full wave but its not always cheaper if they increase the price bbts if youre desperate cheap shipping in continental usa but they almost always go over msrp
  have i really not got a mainline optimus in three years huh
  bbts also has gouge prices amazon is really scalping you whats ee
  pretty good start and pretty background how far back are we taking current generation though i feel thats an important distinction to make   pic related obviously a single complete chart of all extant optimii would be massive so narrowing down sections like this might be a good idea 
amazon canada has siege ultra magnus up for 90 preorder
  thanks and now that those have been brought up  how good are the tr optimus toys  i have been interested in both
    i actually wouldnt mind if you included or made a separate chart for all the recent primes from everything else the past few years    lord knows weve had a lot
  i only have that mold as octane but its pretty good cant attest to how well it works as an optimus though seems like it wouldnt fit as well to me
  yes thats what i meant by going over msrp and amazon itself doesnt scalp you most of the time they tend to do it with the smaller size classes as long as you keep an eye on it you should be able to buy them on amazon for msrp    ee is entertainment eart they also go over msrp on some items but since they sell most of their stuff in sets full case of deluxe figures or one copy of every deluxe in the wave most people avoid it if you want the whole wave you can get it there and get free shipping if the pre order amount goes over a certain cost
  hmm ill see if i cant throw something together anon
  thanks will check it out
  well im not interested in optimus prime im interested in laser prime
  i was thinking the same lol    as in stuff you can still buy new in box easily    i have heard that war for cybertron siege is really cool i also have the chance to play with the potp one looks really cool in robot mode but feel a little fragile and truck mode is not that cool
  oh god there are like 50 g1 style optimus toys out there  i mean just check out tf wiki
  fair enough that repaint looks sick i say jump on it    i think everything here is recent enough to fall under that catagory though im less familiar with the 3p stuff since
  i dont have idea on 3p also they have a dedicated thread for those   btw i leave bayformers out because the aesthetics are so different
  fair enough the bayformers chart could be its own thing for anyone who wants that and i was just thinking to myself that the /3pg/ anons might be able to compile their own 3p optimus list to be combined with our own itd be neat to see everything available in one huge image
  you could make the charts in the image of prime as well optimal
  god thatd be hard itd look cool though maybe just a massive grid like there were during the 3p dinobot rush before the threads split might be the neatest way to line up so many disparate optimus primes from across multiple toylines and decades
  will try next night i have to work on sunday good nigh guys
  tfw still torn on this figure  apparenly with some kind of alcohol you can remove the battle damage but youd end up having to remove the insignia as well  and then buy a sticker  any news or insight on whether that might be feasible for megatron and ultra magnus    the robot modes look alright to great for most of these figures just this halfassed cybertronian thing and fullassed battle damage thing is driving me up the fucking wall
  you just need to use rubbing alcohol 91 isopropol
i swear people ask for stupid prices on this guy but you try to sell one and its just crickets
post pics of customs youre proud of
  isopropyl that was it was just worried about the battle damage being on painted parts      thin paints  noneyepiercing neon  thats downright heroic
  soundwave superior
is vector prime really that good someone already bid him for 50   also the box is in korean
  ohh i really dig that
  thanks if you want i can list the paints i used for it    now that is awesome if you painted the eyes blue that wouldve also worked as a reverse convoy
  its good for the looks but otherwise its quite a brick with a stupidobvious transformation korean packaging ones are officially licensed sonokong ones
  hes part of an incomplete combiner set i was working on that was going to be all g1 decepticons    autobots got a lot of g1 as combiners in the cw line but decepticons didnt get the same treatment and that bummed me out
  can you imagine if he actually had articulation he would probably be a fucking grail and the top dog
  i love this brick so much i have 2
  well i want one but not more than 30
i found the three final terrorcons for 30 dollars each on my country is abominus worth it
  do you need a 3rd      hes infinitely more bricky than i expected
  ah im not much of a customizer myself i wouldnt really know what to do with the information or where to start but thank you      right that was what someone did i think i tracked down the post and they said they had to use a sticker the backpack is still pretty sad whatd the likelihood of an earthversion retool be    but man what a great profile the prices went up in canada but hopefully i can get a rain check for a big sale and pay like acceptable prices
  vector prime looks great and is decently articulated not incredibly so but you can get a few good poses out of him the transformation is simply but i guess it gets the job done for a super cool transforming robot toy he fits the bill not the best but certainly not the worst
  rotf blazemaster and his repaint squad
  i dont have any to post thanks be
  my budget tarn
  tweet it to roberts
  my headmasters jr
  now with that said what is the worst figure you have that you cant help but love  g1 battlechargers    unlike the throttlebots their gimmick is actually cool still need to pick up a runamuck that works
  any more pictures of that cab im really curious as to why the hell would you use rook for him
  giving a hoodie design to cutthroat when their design doesnt do hoodie  aw shit altronage what are you doing
  theres a couple fembots i regret not buying when i had the chance tm2 blackaracnia now around 100 and gf thunderblast
  why the hell would you use rook  same arm transformation wheels on torso and hes a deluxe
  bludgeon cant breath  oh no
  damn thats kinda brilliant
    the clonecons
i wish there was a line like robot damashii but for transformers they can be non transformable but be highly articulated and detail cost around 4060
    i really dont understand why her new head is a 4 eyed sunstreaker     was her prime design really not suitable enough all they had to do was add a nose and good enough right
  go to ollies hes 7 bucks there
  better squeezeplay than hasbro would do
  and wouldnt mind a rotf lockdown style makeover for the character  archers gone this is wardens line now
  revoltech sold like shit
  and it shows no effort since 2014
  you mean 2011
  no painting involved buy im still very pleased with my cindersaur
  its been shit for so long i cant even remember when the last good figure was made sad
dropkick for 16  still not cheap enough
  the early indication is that theyre not really moving like rid2k5 not enough people are buying them to discover how utterly disappointing they are out of box i will be shocked it they have much shelf presence by christmas 2019
  i bought the windblade gerwalk one but other than that cyberverse is an insult to the superior dotm cyberverse
    i think theyve overestimated how much kids prefer gimmicks over articulation i know as a kid id be super bummed if i got a toy like cyberverse optimus and he didnt have an elbow on both arms makes it seem like a halfassed gimmicky baby toy rather than doing one thing particularly well
  warriors and scout are going to sell  i dont see that working out this time the scouts dont have vehicle modes but have about as many steps as a legion would to get to a lame attack mode the warriors/deluxes are an absolute downgrade trying to fit a major gimmick in so dont see those doing all that well either
50000
  nobody wanted shitty dreamwave designs with revolting tech joints  shock
  to be honest if it werent for the fact i just dont want nontransforming transformers id have gotten some the articulation on them was insane and the stylings were pretty neat kindasorta devastationesque i still sorta want the megatron he looks cool
  what the matter anon   dont want to save up for that catastrophe
anyone else buying the dream wave abominus upgrade set theyve finally got colored promo images and its looking pretty nice desu
  weird thought to have to actually save to buy a transformer for once
  bullshit cyberverse thing  kek
  im getting one i love abominus but the base set is so bad looking
  is it finally in stock
  its because the plastic joints are clear and get fucked up easily so intact ones arent too plentiful but its ultimately not very good
  its the only reason i picked up abominus on black friday
is tr sixshot for 40 bucks worth it
  i would say so if you like the character and the tr gimmick doesnt bother you i like mine but hes not the best
  if you dont buy ur your a poorfag
  if you buy it you are insulting everyone who cant afford it   no way to win with the new convoy
  the aesthetics just clash one is unicron trilogy/energon and the other is early chug it doesnt work
  what exactly was so wrong with mp10 that required a redo other than takara being greedy
  its kinda limited in articulation the toylines direction has gone to animation accurate robot modes  mp10 is still a good toy but sticks out robot mode wise since the aesthetic change
  articulation its my biggest gripe and while takara fixes that with mp44 it sadly looks like a cartoon fuckfest  magic square was close to giving me what i wanted but they decided to fucking remove the small details like the rivets and silver paint it looks like some mesh between cartoon accuracy and mp10 and it annoys me that they couldnt make up their damn mind on what aesthetic they wanted
  articulation and to represent the new direction the line is taking now its more articulation and g1 cartoon accuracy    i personally dont like it specially with optimus because he just fold the the front of the cab into the back and it all feels so unnecessary had this not been so slavishly faithful
  somewhat realistic cab for prime  all the while needing to have a cartoon robot  the solution to this nearstark contrast is to fold everything into a backpack  this justifies 440
  and even if you dont like the headmaster gimmick you can mostly ignore it on sixshot
  i remember when people were excusing the bad articulation on mp10 years after release  i think the price is really affecting the reception of it if mp44 was about dinobots price people here would be divided but shills wouldnt be wholly discredited from the get go like they are now
  all this chatter about mp44 made me dig out my mp10 which i havent thought too much about in a while and while i agree the articulation on this thing could be better i always forget how excellent the aesthetic of this toy is it seemed like it was redefining the look of g1 for the modern day     kind of like a what if diaclone were coopted as transformers in 2010 theres clearly a lot of toy inspiration on mp10 from the use of silver and chrome to the shape of the windshields to the particular shades of red and indigo they used the fact that they tried to hard to get the truck mode to look like the freightliner caboverengine that the original toy was based on really makes me wonder whether or not some kind of reimagining of the original toy line was their initial mission statement especially since officially licensing the cars that the original toy line boosted was their next order of business i love that the headsculpt is so completely its own thing like clearly inspired by g1 optimus but immediately identifiable as mp10 more than anything else i love the wideshouldered smallheaded hero look that this thing adopted it gives him a taste of japanese mecha which certainly suits his origin    and that fucking transformation forget about it i can kind of see why mp44 decided to go such a different route because mp10 is basically the pinnacle of flatnose semi into robot transformations it is the absolute perfect balance of complexity and compromise the best way to get from truck to humanoid without making a mess of things i love how welldefined and solid his torso ends up looking with minimal kibble no part of the transformation is unsatisfying and its deceptively simple too and even though the gun looks a bit shabby for being able to collapse that weapon storage is perfection it kind of makes me pretty certain that the original idea behind the mp line was definitely the original toy if it were made today
ironhide is pretty tall for a deluxe
  im hoping there was a goof with his colors since it looks like they swapped his the use of black plastic to gray which according to the renders should be the wheels the front bumper and the shoulders    were shit out of luck with the forearm since that piece apparently cant be red unless its painted over
  no its normal sized for a deluxe the rest of the deluxes in siege lost some height because warden is trying to crash the brand for trying to give us less for higher prices    a p o l o g i z e
  sideswipe and hound are a bit short for deluxes
  apawawise  oh shut up
  and yet both of those are better than cyberverse
   s e e t h i n g warden dick rider even those were better toys than siege with it smeared on shit
  barely nothing to be proud of
  durr i wouldnt be proud of hot shot
  and i wouldnt be proud of the absolute trash called siege or the studio series line
  absolute trash called siege or the studio series line  now were getting hyperbolic
  personnel  its personal you fuckin retard of course archer shitters would be fuckin illiterate weeb trash
  not getting the joke  i always knew warden dick suckers was retarded but i didnt know they were this retarded now go back to buying your overpriced op covered in wardens shit while i enjoy the vastly superior classics op
  christ thats terrible  idw at least had the sense to just use the original design in taao    and yes a new figure of airachind also knockout is a must
  vastly superior  classic optimus  pfttt hahaha   look at this guy  mr archer  you really  are   too  much
  vastly superior  classic optimus  you heard me retard take wardens dick out ya ear  maybe youll develop a sense of taste other than wardens sperm  his shit found on siege op
why dont you idiots get that the archerfag is the same spammer shitposter
  i think theyre both the same guy replying to himself
  man i feel like getting geewun reedun redux sideswipe since it fits in better with the other toys than the universe 20 one but im wondering if they will ever do a sunstreaker to go with him
  you have fun with that arm kibble anon
  i will have fun with its superior possibility  looks you have fun licking off wardens shit of your toys
    f i g h t
  they are using the g1 scale chart for siege that is also why soundwave and starscream are voy      the gray parts are from the resin prototypes the toy is clearly incomplete as it is
remember the op you imbeciles  do we really have to add that to every general from now on
  thats what the guy who designed it said it was for its to give you the toy you imagined you had when you were a kid that captured key aesthetics about the cartoon without being slavish to it
  i sure hope so unlike the ss toys on display ironhide didnt seem to have any of the colors not final stickers on him
  i think we do actually yeah
  what do you mean the op looks fine to me
  yeah but they are already forgetting to read it
  oh right i see what you mean    i mistakenly thought you meant that thing the autistic keeps spamming
  of course not that  do we seriously have to add a reminder to not give yous to any shitposter in every thread
  well if there werent as many whiners like you around no
  i mean at this point it could only help
  id like to say no but some of the dumb asses on here fall for it every time
is warden vs archer a new forced meme since hasbro and takara merged and you cant do takara wins anymore
  your essentially admitting that anyone who has a different opinion as to what toys you like is a shitposter because if so  snap
  yeah the shitposter periodically switches up his tactics and isnt above samefagging
  well theyre still butting heads with hasbro look at the big powered lg giftset
every optimus prime toy should come with an alternate head with yellow eyes
  not having mppv as your chugimus
  he looks so soulless
  while i like the blue more i definitely dont hate the idea of a second head with yellow eyes looks cool
  dont forget the lines on the faceplate too
  well the g1 toy was originally intended to be so its apt
  youre soulless
  fine but i need to know if it uses rubber if theres a version with no rubber ill buy it
so i really like heavytreads design and managed to get one for 20 hes just missing his little armor guy    what are some of the better power core limb drones
  if youre buying a set constructicons and destrons are the best sets
  the drones are mostly mediocre imo but id say go for the pcc crankcase ones the best armor partner is chopster and the purple drill guy
  if you want the minicons the arms micron ones on sale are pretty much the same
  proportions and articulation like everyone else just said
i was not informed this exists and i kind of want it
  united ex flew under the radar ever since pcc became the shelfwarmer line  i plan on getting that one soon
  shit i just learned tankmaster is a thing too i really like heavytreads design but goddam look at that sweet ass g2 megatron paintjob
  that looks neat  shame about takara leaving the baby blue pegs untouched though
  apparently theres a better military limb set in terms of color with united ex but its also like 55 to get them
  superior poseability  when the arm kibble has more mass than the entire torso  lmao
  the pale green parts make it look like an unfinished prototype
  transmetal 2 blackarachnia     leftover useless parts from an aborted third mode  remaining third mode is absolutely terrible to me as an adult even if as a kid i probably would have liked putting it on then shooting a missile at her and taking it back off  extremely asymmetrical from head to toe and most noticeably on the face and not in an aesthetically pleasing way  literally cannot stand up by herself thanks to a very badly executed spin kick gimmick that didnt work from day 1  most limbs are loose not even advertised as being able to stand up on the spider legs    but for all the flaws im still a the sucker for spark crystal gimmick especially her ability to swivel hers from maximal to predacon the spider mode does look good if you can get the legs to look like theyre actually holding her up i love vacuum metallized anything even when it starts to crack due to age and the one i got off ebay has the removable bra piece which was a nice bonus not to mention now that i have a full collection of blackarachnia figures i can see that shes the standout as the most visually striking among them in a good way
  is that a customized head or a legit version of it
  im glad we are finally free of these ugly combiner limb bots
  legit just painted eyes
any good cog combinations youve come up with /tfg/ not able to think up anything interesting myself yet
  thats one of the bigger problems with combiner wars really unless you were a legacy combiner bot your figure was bound to come out as an unwanted retool or as a replacement bot nobody wanted
  i feel like i was in the minority that adored combiner wars
  pretty much put everything i like about my mp10 into words and why i prefer it over mp44 aside from price if you want sunbow accuracy all the power to you but i like the toy more than i like the original show and mp10 is a nice balance between the two for me     also do we have confirmation that mp44 will have diecast or rubber parts or not im just curious
  there were some things i wish theyd done different but overall i like now having seven interchangable combiners plus one more if i manage to find some limbs for elita
      as far as i know theres only two third party add on kits for the power core combiners i have them both    maketoys mobine that comes in various colors  cool set of limb parts that can be swapped around to be either arms or legs or even combined with a second mobin set to do whatever you want    tfc toys iron army set thats two wwii tanks and planes  limbs also have they own robot modes
  can you make like a gun so long it takes multiple cybertronians to use
  outside of /toy/ everyone basically loved it keep in mind /toy/s loudest voices hate everything ive been here since like 2007 or 8 or whenever it started and every single tf incarnation has been hated on in some way since 2010 or 2011 or so
my predacons arrived i was not ready for such chonky boys or 87 foil stickers
  i disliked armada as a kid coming off rid but as someone with a 4 year old nephew armada toys are great seriously all these new simple kiddie lines should just model themselves after armada big chunky toys with easy transformations and fun gimmicks
  fuck yeah i really wanted that mobine set but its expensive as hell      i think my only complaint was i felt we needed at least one more good core robot something like a tank or something i wanted a megatron torso i could have fighting my optimus torso bot    i got so frustrated with the lack of this i made one
  yeah the stickers took me like 25 hours i realized using a hobby knife to guide them in helped but i still wrinkled a few not very noticeable i probably should have used some tweezers     i used emgos videos when the instructions werent clear also the example images off tfwiki
  mp10 is still a good toy but sticks out robot mode wise since the aesthetic change    and so do the datsuns the lambor mold and even wheeljack and ironhide/ratchet to an extent mp collectors will never be satisfied and well jus end up seeing 3ps and takara endlessly remake characters to conform into the newest aesthetic anytime a character is different me im just splitting the difference and going for more mp10 style mps
how good is this thing
  waves 4 and 6 sucked everything else was fine
  not very i had lazerback and he basically fell apart
  nah none of those stick out only mp ten does because his proportions are so weird theres a reason they can release anime decos of the lambor and datsun mold but prime has to be given a complete overhaul
  i dunno i liked a good chunk of the wave 4 and 6 deluxes    cw ironhide is 100 what i started collecting again he was the first transformer i picked up in years back in 2015 he was just so simple and chunky and kind of easy to fidget with and transform while i was working
  was the qc that bad  well that would explain why its so cheap
  effect parts on these little dudes  thats really fucking neato
  you can also plug the effect parts on the larger figures to simulate gun fire battle damage or thruster exhaust
  your not the only one regardless your stance on the reused assets it was just pure fun i thought it was clever to have some back up dudes in case of injury or some one flaking out over some stupid reason i wish they had made more fist  feet like the ones included with the ruination  computron sets
  yeah it was awful the plastic was so crap that the balljoints just ground themselves down to nothing
2016  takara released five original mp molds   2017  three original molds  2018  one new figure  2019  maybe two figures  the hell happened
they got pretty creative with the minicons for a while
  didnt a shitload of those things wind up in dirtcheap 2packs at big box stores i seem to recall seeing pairs of bh deluxes seranwrapped together for 20 or less some years back at walmart
  poor sales
  the reviews didnt say that good to know avoiding that one like the plague then
  japan has negative population growth so the market for toys is not good and tfs are just not a hot property compared to kr and ss
  that  creative  glad to see how low your standards are
  aerialbots  stunticons  constructicons  combaticons  protectobots    it was a good line and gave people something they had wanted for along time    but then again i also liked titans returns
post recent figures you never saw in person
  i always liked this little submarine guy i think i got him randomly packed in one of the early classics boxes mightve been the floptimus prime vs tank megatron one im not sure
  theyre not too bad but i can easily see the vast majority of this sheet is for divebombs wings
  the redecoes dont really work though their proportions dont stick to the cartoon at all
  i love how the minicons had a different aesthetic from the larger robots makes them different from the minibots or micromasters the minicons are more traditionally robotic with tools instead of hands tube arms and legs weird faces etc theyre more like droids or other robot toylines like zbots
  zbots  now theres a name i havent seen in a fortnight
  while its unlikely since they change pegs often id really love it if they kept the cw peg as a cross line compatible system
  theres no way the cw peg goes away as long as warden is in charge when he an gi joe he was all about crosscompatability with lines and if they dont 3ps and 3d print designers will make adapters
    zbots  my niggers i remember how cool it was that the burger king ones were essentially the same as the retail ones meaning they folded into your collection nicely without feeling like cheap knockoffs
transformers studio series number 14 voyager class autobot ironhide    any chance we will see this fucker in stores i feel like i have seen everything but him so far
  niggers  hoi doi dont use that word we polite police here
  i wouldve liked to have gotten tr perceptor maybe kup and hot rod as well
    are you in us def seen him at target already
  your counting is weird either you arent counting the bw molds or you are bw dinobot is the only new mp this year g1 didnt get new mps this year just redecos maybe you are counting sunstreaker for 2018 but apparently the buttend of 2017 was his release date
  nice upper arm wiring detail  gramps bot  cane and axe  sexy blackbird jet  tfw you see jetfires ugly underplane kibble and it ruins the toy for you    its a staple of plane bots i guess but still you can see his face ffs
  i am my stores have been slacking guess ill get it online
  its only slightly better than rotfs where the underkibble extends to the needle of the jet
    people waited for the ko
  that bee looks better
  you havent seen him from beehind
  show then
    i was so wrapped up in a need to own it i didnt even realize it was bumblebee
  not a behind pic but you can see how large the back kibble is same results during a showcase in london
  does ss cogman not come with the headmaster
  and it still looks better than the other 2 ss bees
      i had lazerback as well and i didnt have any problems with it the only area i can think of that were a little loose were the lower leg hinges other that it was a decent figure most of the prime predacons have basic transformations and articulation but make up for it with some really vibrant color palettes and neatlooking designs if thats your aesthetic then give it a shot id recommend looking at ripclaw pic related as well
  pretty sure its just a rerelease
  thats what i thought but i havent seen them show off the gimmick yet
  i know when i see green jeep i immediately thinkbumblebee
  if you can squint at the pic you can see the square sides at the back of his head had he been just a head they wouldve took the legs off and made him completely round
  2016  ironhide  hot rod  shockwave  primal  inferno  2017  cheetor  megs  sunstreaker   2018  chopperface  2019  bw megs  sunbow prime
  really happy were getting an updated bonecrusher from this line it really is about time after 11 years      honestly wonder how this guy looks compared to older versions of him still have the original floating around somewhere      neat but the original voyager suits me just fine      so rampage is a voyager and the new guy is a deluxe interesting      what is it with red bots and having huge missing paint apps on their face looks really offputting
  they need to show the back already i want to see how much is different from the first one
  im not really asking for lazerback though mold degradation is a thing on the repaint or no  and how good is the articulation
  id like to see one more announcement for 2019
  we could get hound at the tail end like sunstreaker last year i was honestly expecting him to drop before prime
  bones and sideswipe seem good megs is a straight downgrade with an upsize and skipjack is movieaccurate taller than bumblebee
migrate when ready        
  chopperface  come again
  i liked all of generations although im biased since i watched beast wars as a kid then g1 as a teenager with my dad but missing pretty much every other cartoon so stuff like animated prime and especially the movies just doesnt do it for me
  i like minicons conceptually but i dont care for most of the actual figures i really have a hard time finding a place in my heart for anything without elbow articulation
  yeah but i think headstrong is the easiest following the instruction order for who to tackle is pleasant
  while its unlikely since they change pegs often  i thought that only happened because they could never get it right    whats wrong with the current combiner pegs
  the hells going on with those gorilla arms
  if a based cogposter does this lets name the creation dakkatron
  i had this and got rid of it i love laser prime but the plane mode made the whole thing so unstable and i couldnt keep it
what is a beastbox/megabox  its a tiny cube that can turn into a robot  where can i get one  amiami   topop 52toys amazon store   bbts   but theyre sold out  theyre restocked frequently keep an eye out    previous threads        
i got a ghost dog as my first one hes pretty neat but a little smaller and more fragilefeeling than i expected im worried im going to break something when i extend the legs
i got myself a set of these chinky beastboxes i mean  52toys is a chinese company but these ripoff the concept and tiein with a madeinchina kids show 快乐酷宝3 happy qbot 3    first thing youll notice is that the box forms are more hollow and have that cheaplooking glossy finish
  the engineering is not bad on these for their price they have locking tabs to secure the boxforms and the joints are tight they wont come apart even if you throw them across the room    unfortunately the workmanship is pretty bad there are many skinslicing sharp edges the paint apps are thin with plastic colors bleeding through stress marks around ball joints and nubs etc
  if theres one you should check out its probably the gorillacop its the least hollowlooking one and goes well with diocop here the price of these 45 cm box form ones are like 3 each
  now for the news   nuclear jojo is out and youve probably missed it  luban 7 from chinese moba is expected in november after 11/11   megabox getter 1 is estimated to be released within the next 3 months   52toys is taking preorders for the above two megabox toys on their tmall store as part of their 11/11 campaign
    getter robo is getting one of these  wow interesting that this line is starting to licenses now i havent bought one of these in a long time but ill definitely be getting the getter one
    i want the frog and the gorilla where can i get some
  all over taobao maybe aliexpress punch in 快乐酷宝3 note that there are larger 15cm ones and springloaded gimmick ones
  were also getting a predator the xenomorph queen and a power loader colorway for the alien somewhere down the line too
   jojo is out and youve probably missed it  i absolutely need it and i am willing to overpay at least to a point does anyone have any leads on where this might be bought
these threads convinced me to get one of these i got my sakura dio in the mail today and i absolutely love it
  beware of it melting
will we be seeing getter 2 and 3 with the getter line
  too early they did show off a black getter prototype
  huh is this a new one i kind of want it to go with this guy
chinese review of megabox mo zi  
  pretty cool looks kind of like an lbx design boy do i miss lbx
  oh nice black getter is my favorite getter so i might need to keep an eye out for that one
    ooh yeah same here thatll look real nice next to my sentinel black getter
  wait for real these guys melt what a drag i know theyre hollow but geez    anyway i saw this guy on twitter and i gotta know if its coming to america at some point those arm blades are niiiiice
  sakura dios scent beads release some chemical that melts plastic
  i have one to oh noooooo      i hope this guy comes out too i want him
        ive had sakura dio on release and mines just fine
  this has happened to literally no one and is speculation blown out of proportion from previous threads about the longevity of scented toys
  i guess is me but the way that this mo zi transforms into a box looks boring as fuck not as interesting as the dio moma or jojo does  i wasnt interested in getting him in the first place so now iam even less interested which is better for my wallet
  i found the japanese web page for him but i dont know if there anyone who can middleman for him    
  anon finds a japanese middleman to help him buy stuff off a china website  would be a fun read
  comes to 4chan and cant recognize moon rumes  thats chinese anon use taobaoring as your middleman theyre good and are even having a sale right now
    their official tmall page i guess ordering delta and alien now
    even if there is evidence that sakura dios scent beads will harm plastic over time its pretty easy to fix just pop a craft knife into the gap where the hip plates are glued on crack the glue pour the beads out and glue the plates back on
  how are you buying from them proxy service if so which one are you using
    mine is still in exceptional condition and even still has its scent and i got mine on day one you sure you didnt put yours too close to a heater or get something on it that dissolved the plastic
  tmall is part of taobao a domestic china equivalent to amazon theres a whole rabbit hole about buying from there googling it is better than what we can tell you here
      i just saw that both these are the same shop  i read chink runes and they/taobao started shipping to my cunt sea a few years back so no middleman
i got the police dio that bbts had on preorder since forever and i guess they fixed the qc stuff his hips are very solid and the forearms are great too compared to the first run ones i got
    and now i need it too i havent gotten any of the monkey moulds yet hmmm they could do a reverse dio too
    i can tell from here those arms look better than mine gosh darn it
    my dream of custom robo figs becoming real is finally happening
dio based on this classic when
  is this a newgrounds game
  what is this
    old flash animations mad popular one too from the newgrounds heyday of long long ago
  fucking dad game
  is there a still working link for this
    was pretty catchy back in the day
  but the way that this mo zi transforms into a box looks boring as fuck  i guess that cant be helped with humanoid figures they just look like people doing yoga 52toys flagship shop has lu ban 7 available with a short video reviewing it  
  what the hell that lu ban character looks even worse than the mo zi guy this one cant even into a decent looking cube look talk about lazy design
dio  jojo    hmmmm
  the first 4 releases are in evangelion colors too
  i bought a sakura dio and it melted my skin now im a skeleton
  didnt the artist say he based this animation on a dream
no clue what this is i guess the parrot
  id guess that too the wings look about right and the penguins shouldnt look like this      i wont blame them cashing out on the casual chinese masses if that means more megafauna boxes
  look morty im a bird box
can anyone tell me how this guy in box form compares size wise to beastboxes in box form
  its quite bigger than the beastboxes and since the company was a small one there were some instances of loose sliding joints its great however it does not have any mechanism to lock it into box form it just sits folded
  thanks for the info
final production sample for dio looks better than the last pic that surfaced not sure if they changed it back from yellow/gold to tan or if that was just bad lighting
  how many dios is this now
  im mr parrot look at me
  looks great now i just have to pray that they release the camo jojo
bump so i can find this thread on 4channel
  if you count the four mahjong dios as one and throw in the ghostdogs this is number 14
  what prowl is that
  iron factorys hard to find now
fyi for western buyers that white and green programmer jojo is on amazon currently no clue when itll come off but i figured may as well grab it now while you easily can
  its also on aliexpress for a pretty good price with free shipping im surprised they dont have more on there
mfw i still cant find nuclear jojo anywhere
  hlj also has it up right now not worth the shipping if youre buying it on its own but worth noting if you already have an hlj order going
is it weird that my alien headhugger and egg come panel washed
  nice any eta on when this might hit shelves
  aw they arent doing an evas colors this time
  kinda wish the colors were swapped i would have been all over a pink and purple hippo
  phelddagrif
  00 tv ver  delta  00 test/rebuild ver  d10  01  jojo  02  moma    considering they got all the major ones aside from 08 i dont see them doing any more intentionally
  the gun is a little frog  im still not a fan of the whole swappableweapons aspect but thats a fun touch
    those colors makes him looks like crap  better wait for better recolors if you ask me
should i get my kids a mighty car this christmas
no not the shitty new ones the old actually cute one
    nope only you were all children
  my mother had one i took the batteries out she only complained a little damn thing was annoying as fuck
  i had this exact one i still have it once it woke up in the night rocked forwards off the pile of toys i kept on my bed and hit me in the face
  kek what is it
nope nobody remembers that    nobody on this discussion board specifically for people who are interested in and know a lot about toys has ever heard of one of the most popular childrens toys in history most likely during the childhood period of most of the community    nobody at all
  hmm you know i figured that might be the case    anyway its called a furby furby was a sort of electronic pet and you could interact with one in all sorts of ways  rumor has it that it was based of a chatector called gizmo from the movie gremlins an obscure movie from before you were born
    i had this exact lil dude too named him burbo in my defense i was like 8   he had a stroke or something when i was in 5th grade just kept saying furby hungry and sighing even though id feed him every time he asked shit was traumatic especially because i wanted to be a veterinarian and hate seeing anything that even resembles an animal in pain
  mine had a stroke too kept moving its face rapidly without making any noise took his batteries out and that fixed it but i remember throwing him away when i was like 14 or something anyway
  new furbies are cuter
my sister used to play with a pink one annoying as fuck
  yeah im actually listening to a phil hendrie episode from 2000 where and old man calls in claiming that he was sexual assaulted by one right now
anyone knows what are these gloves and where i can get them
theyre just disposable nitrile gloves dude you can buy them like anywhere that sells cleaning supplies
  they look like fabric to me
  youre dick looks like fabric to me
  uuuuuuuhhhhhhh
  are you blind
  i mean youre wrong but the closest thing to that in fabric would probably be polishing gloves
  not that guy but i just ordered some small polishing gloves my pinkie ends a full inch before the gloves pinkie does where the fuck can tiny people find gloves that fit
  tamashii gloves 7000 yens a set you can only order them every second friday on the month on bandai premium
  tamashii gloves  yeah i just checked the price on polishing/jewelry gloves and they might as well be that

any update on mako
my brother come join me
7259951  kill urself my man
soon
rerelease never
  these bimbos get figma  2cute anoshiras ii and best boy calibur never ever
  i would really like anoshiras ii shes cute woud buy a figma
  youre really just baiting for that dumb sperging mha fan picture that really has nothing at all to do with the subject right
7259951  7259955  7259959    are these false flags
max factory continue the garupan line with best historiboos next
  false flags
  post characters from a wannabe /k/ anime
  sure would be cool for him to get a figma but never ever
  would be really cute but less likely to happen than even rikkas moms nipple hair
  the gay tokushitter didnt get what he wanted  this makes me happy
  figma as a standalone gridman for displaying in dynamic triggerstyle poses  gsc one to enjoy the transforming and combining factor  i didnt say it before but nows an even better time after having just put in my order for the latter thanks for your insights i like the gsc look more anyway but im glad to not just be basing it on looks even for a figure    nice little update they made to whole thing looking forward to seeing how the figma itself turns out especially for those dynamic poses i wonder how itll compare heightwise though i wouldnt be surprised if the figma is the same height as the gridman in this set
  id considered grabbing one of those because everyone seems to love them but i mainly grabbed the figma for the size knowing it would match up well with the windranger if i get a bigger more detailed figure that needs a horse those are my next options
  cuckman ssss is barely toku its just more trigger homage bullshit in a new package
    wow you guys are really cool
  cooler than any tokufag is
  i wonder how itll compare heightwise though i wouldnt be surprised if the figma is the same height as the gridman in this set  close i guess but we wont knoe for sure until po for gridman goes up  approximately 210mm in height in full power gridman mode gridman alone is approximately 140mm in height
figma when
  when we get a chaika     seriously though the devs at blizzcon got upset when i asked if orphea was based on her like i was the 10th person to do so they swore up and down that none of them had seen it
its not 20k  im actually surprised but even then wholl actually buy this
  given that hots is full of anime references theres only like a 100 chance that they have watched chaika but of course they cant admit it because that could land them in trouble    personally i dont care that shes unoriginal i love her design none the less a figma would be so much cooler than a neca which the previous hots/sc figurines have been and i wouldnt pass a nendo either
  this  i wasnt a gup fan mostly due to the shitty tank animation and bland as shit main characters but man did i love its side characters  also please uncancel katyusha gs
  only 200mm in length not even big  13000 yen
  why is there a trex bursting from the chestbursters chest
these nendo clips are fucking great
  oh dont get me wrong i love the design too would love a nendo to go with my dva     the way blizz is going full moneyhog this year i wouldnt be surprised if they expand hots to nendo since overwatch seems to be their only figmas
  did you even watch the movie
  what movie has a trex bursting from the chestbursters chest
  i dont get why this the dou space ships or the train are made in the figma linedont get me wrong is nice that fans of the rtype game get a figure of this boss or the other already mentioned ships/train  but this boss seems that doesnt have any type of articulation and it just a plain statue  this boss the ships and the train could have better fit in the plamax line and for a cheaper price  these will end up in the clearence bin soon after release
  a figma just a plain statue  his head neck  giant anusbead are articulated try reading from the official site
  oh youre right still think that this have worked better as a plamax but that me
  hopefully someone else will pick up the license and actually do something with it
  anon youre replying to here  i like the gsc look more anyway  yeah the megahouse one looks really wonky in combined mode i preordered the gsc one the day before they updated because i found some pics of the max power combination and it just looks perfect
found some pictures of ann
    she is cute i wanted to see her without the mask though
  shis cute
futaba looks great but too tallshes supposed to be 411
  oh boy here we go again
  yeah there was a real pseudo loli feel to her in game that i am not getting from the figma at all  outside of joker this whole subline seems to run the gamete from bad to mediocre which is a shame
  why she is only one with casual clothes
  she is only seen as navi in briefing rooms and inside her persona so not as much as the others in their phantom thief suits her casual clothing is a totally different story though
    wow she looks way better than i thought she would honestly    these pics convinced me to put her on the list to pick up     idk why but i thought she looked way worse in the promo pics like just as basic as the celty figure but for some reason i actually really like this ann figure
  yeah shes supposed to be noticeably shorter than the protag
  because the people in the marketing department have shit taste here navi outfit is way better and matches the rest of the line up
  not going to sperg out about scale the way certain people do over a few cm or unnoticeable difference like over in the pokemon thread but there really should be more of a height difference here she just looks weird being as tall as the male characters also yeah using her casual outfit is pretty stupid when everyone else has their thief get up
so is panther already being send from amiami
  rip nintendo x figma
  and nothing of value was lost
anyone know a release date for pred and alien besides the general dec
  sure let me hop in my delorean and go check
  why what happened
  the retard thinks its dead because they havent announced any new ones
  so thats a no
  no shit sherlock
  well hello sunshine
its a shame they never made more silent hill figmas pyramid head and the nurse are amazing    i definitely would have bought the first three games protagonists and a bunch of other monsters especially a mannequin and lying figure
  this    i was really hoping for a james
  i have no interest in the mc of the games but more silent hill monsters would be neat for the mc you can insert any of your other school girls figma or any male figma you have in your collection and recreate some interesting crossover scene with it
  i would nut a new entire galaxy if heather was ever made into a poseable toy
        yeah
man ill pay top dollars for hulkmode motoko complete with interchangeable torn limbs
  im glad that futaba is getting her casual clothes which are pretty cool but now she will stand out like a sore thumb if they dont release her in her phantom thieve outfit making the series incomplete that also means ill have to track down uniform protagonist to go along with her
  this is a little different since futabas whole thing in the game is that she is the little sister type and she is noticeably much shorter than the others  it would be like making a nanako that was the same size as yu
  dont worry mf will release it as an overpriced wf/shop exclusive
jesus tittyfucking christ what part of nonscale toyline do you chucklefucks not understand
  the sublines are almost always at least in scale with themselves
  nonscale means its not gonna be perfectly 1/12 and not necessarily in scale with other lines or even figmas from other franchises figures based on one ip should still scale with each other
  says who fucktard
    im retarded and dont know what nonscale means
  nonscale  while figures in their own individual lines tended to be in scale even with the nonscale  while id still wait to see how futaba looks since its hard to tell from the convention photos acting like the figures cant be scaled within a line just because of the nonscale label is plenty retarded especially when its common practice in the figma line to have characters scale properly with each other if theyre from the same series eg the monogatari series with their respective loli characters
    this is a weird thing to get so aggressively defensive about  anyway the sublines almost always scale with themselves silent hill madoka monogatari ect so i am not sure why this line should be different
    figma joints utilize the same joint parts  shares a universal predetermined size their figures are built around these joint system and their size are dependent on these not the other way round hence nonscale issue just a hypothesis building futaba into loli size might make her look like having large tumors on all her joints also various sculpt aesthetic issues arises
  whats wrong with agelegal futaba you fucking pedo if its anything they should increase her boob size
  anyway the sublines almost always scale with themselves  no they are not always just look at he p3  p4 figures stop making shit up
  yeah faggot he said almost always  why is the gsc shill sperging so hard here
all this because of one anon whining my futaba is not loli enough well the sculpt is final suck it up  stfu about it go cry to gsc/mf see if they care
  i see figma has its own version of the marvel legendsperg
  cry moar faggot
  because you are making him regret his purchases
  i dont understand you addressed a justification for her casual clothing making sense and then immediately say her casual clothing is a totally different story    does anyone understand what this chap means
  funny i was going to post complaining its over 10k which it should not be
  wholl actually buy this  people who like rtype what a weird question to ask
  rtype dimensions was just released  pew pew pew
  entire p5 party gets at least one figma protagonist has two  still nothing for mainline  thanks gsc
  persona is the mainline it hasnt used the smt tagline since 2
  persona is the mainline
  man the things id do for a varna/serph action figure
  it doesnt matter if a spin off becomes more popular than the actual thing the main line will always be shin megami tensei because it came first and persona is a spin off from it
  but hes still allowed to like what he has i dont like the figma i purchased any less just because i aim criticism at new releases  why are we being partisan about fucking toys
  that wasnt an issue with shinobu hatchikuji nagisa conan or any of the other short characters in the line so i dont think that would be it  maybe it was based off of some 2d concept art where she was taller or something  either way it is a little irritating that they nailed the scale on everybody but one character
  wah wah why  cry moar bitch you still aint getting a smaller figure
  then why get upset about persona having more merchandise if you just admitted its more popular    by the way god fucking damnit i was mostly planning on just having joker anyways but futaba was my next most wanted yet they made her a giant freak i will unfortunately have to pass which stinks because the figure looks great but unless i display it all alone it will stick out like mad i want futaba not a giant
  there are clearly joints in that pic anon
  go back to the marvel legends thread
  pedo  
  just a hypothesis building futaba into loli size might make her look like having large tumors on all her joints  that wouldnt be an issue at all considering that theyve made smaller characters than futaba like shinobu and hachikuji that said its hard to tell from if futaba actually needs to be shrunk down so im not really complaining especially since the one convention photo we do have shows her in comparison with the others at the worst possible angle
        i just learned a thing today thanks guys    ive only played a bit of persona 3  i really need to get back to that
all this complaining about futabas height  the fuck are some of you even looking at learn about perspective the picture from the show has futaba closer to the camera and at an angle that pushes ryuji further back did you not watch lord of the rings and see all the forced perspective and how it made the hobbits and dwarves tiny despite the real actors not being that tiny    even if that werent the case is it really that big of a deal to go from bottom of chin height to middle of face height her official height is 411 joker/ryuji are 59 meaning even if her middle of the face height is real she is basically going to maybe 53 tops its not that big of a deal though it would be slightly annoying if they made that mistake    the art the one guy posted makes her look like a damn loli though have some real art
  she looks significantly smaller than everyone else there  her shoulders are at boob level with makoto and a little under boob level for anne  also ryuji isnt really far enough away for the perspective to significantly mess with his height
  the picture from the show has futaba closer to the camera and at an angle that pushes ryuji further back  yeah thats pretty much what ive been saying based on the one photo we have even then she still looks short asis
autist flips out about literally nothing
  the one who cant accept some due criticism being lobbed at gsc  yeah that ones a huge autist
  
  yes lets
  still too tall  red line is how tall she should be
holy shit yeah ssss gridman is kinda boring
you boys think the bloodborne hunter will get a rerelease
  i doubt it unless mf somehow feels inclined to put it out again if they actually end up making lady maria
  i hope so i only played the game pretty recently wish i had sooner so i could have bought him when he was new i enjoyed the game quite a bit and would love to have him since it seems like every other figure related to bloodborne is at least 300     anyone here have him thoughts i have seen some go for 80 which ive considered as i do like his design but im still unsure
  
  pretty solid and detailed i love the figure i dont regret buying it too bad the holding hand for the saw cleaver is a little bit loose on mine
  autism
  cool
  other then a high rate of derp eye and the grippy hands being fairly loose pretty solid just wish he had come with a wider selection of trick weapons
  your perspective lines are off shes still a bit taller than she should be but only by a little bit did you not notice ryujis stance is wider as well
  its loose on mine also i think its just an issue with the figure    the details on this figure are amazing though i cant think of another figure thats this intricate
      the elbows on mine are a little bit loose its like the joint wont go into the socket all the way is it supposed to be like this
u/noe
  i would like this to happen but knoeing how imcompetent mf is it will never happen
  lol shit  thank goodness it wont happened
  i dont give a fuck about the game i want kpop sluts
  the bootleg is not a bad alternative especially for 20         im pretty happy with mine
  do not post gore
  haha poo poo lookin ass arms
  after mf do a proper anchovy figma fuck that figfix shit
  mine doesnt have elbow issues so you mightve gotten a dinky one or maybe i got lucky    the only consistent qc problem ive seen is with him not being able to hold the cleaver tightly
  u/noe  /u/ knoe
    thanks i guess ill just wait for a rerelease as hopefully they can fix some of the quality control issues     thanks for the suggestion but my autism prevents me from buying bootlegs i dont look down on people who do somethi g about it just bothers me internally i feel like if i was a bigger collector i would be more open to it but i rarely buy anything unless its something ive thought about it for some time
  bootleg shit  can you fuck off to your own thread already tired of seeing you poorfags
  probably a figfix if anything
  probably a figfix if anything  figfix were a mistake
when was the last time they put a figfix up for preorder pretty sure the line is dead and buried
  last ones were the last two love live cheerleader figures to complete that set iirc and then the line have been dead for good
i dont know why but this figma always looks to me like it has darker skin than most  am i seeing things
  might be due the contrast of the colors and that color theory stuff
went to sleep  woke up  anon still complaining about futaba height  dont you have something better to do
  and pepperoni
  yeah /v/fags ruin everything
  no  you dont understand  two nonscale figmas arent in scale with each other  waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  incoherent screeching
  i have two of her and their skin is the same basic tone as most figma
  thats nothing a little dremeling cant fix
  agreed
  they look like trannies
  i want to jerk their dicks off
  if you got a gun up in your waist please dont shoot up the place   cause i see some ladies tonight that should be havin my baby baby
  figma biggie would unironically be toy of the year all years
  what if they get the size wrong though
  league of legends garbage  featuring in a koreaboo cancer video  no thanks
god just stop complaining that figma hulk is the size of figma lolis   its nonscaleeee reeeeeeee
  isnt figma hulk pretty hueg
post figma queen
  think of this if they made one of these the thread will be flooded with lolfags demanding their waifu and the 8405830658 different skins in no time
  fairly big yeah most females figmas would probably reach mid chest on him
  went to slep  woke up  anons still defending two figures from the same subline not scaling  dont you have something better to do
the only scale difference that ever bothered me was archers permanent manlet status
  never own the figma avengers we had manlet america followed by thor whos a good deal taller then iron man whos at least a head taller than thor im not going to draw up diagrams to show exactly how tall each character should be in comparison to each other but when theres this much of a difference between characters goodsmile can and should do a better job of scaling them
  is she too tall or is he too short
  yeah thats why i pointed it outfor people who like persona and are going to display then together its a little annoyingnot a deal breaker or anything thoi dont know why people are getting so angery when we talk about scalingif the inklings were as tall as link would that be ok
  woke up  theres your problem
  seriously lacking in ass tech
    eh i can see it quite a bit there still annes more known for her tits though whereas makoto is the one thats known for her ass/hips
  arent they using the same ass tech though i doubt makoto will fare better
      amiami wont even let me pay for it because canada is retarded
  u wot
  i wonder if figmautist necanon 4hanon and the legendsperg are the same person
  canada post went on strike again should be ending soon though the government ordered them all back to work
fate general died  4 inch nel general died  posting this here then
  i thought all you canadians were all hand in hand peace loving now you all decided to smoke weed legally like heathens
  i just got a international package today tho you must live in the shantytowns of ontario
  owo
deku
  what about green naruto
  nuts
  finally
  no amiami just straight up wont let me buy anything
  finally what
  finally theyre rereleasing deku dumbass
  why would you want it though
  cause i like my hero idiot
  deku reissue is coming  bakugo is in limbo hell  kek i can hear the future whinning of bnhafags
  no not when you can make you own
  iirc hlj still lets you order
i fucking hate kabans hat
  so is deku gonna be fucked over in licensing hell like the previous release
  
  excellent they actually sculpt the zip that goes all the way up her anus
  i mean i might actually get one this time to make a couple hundred bucks but other than that i dont really care  i just want phos the mummy and the moai statue
  why for
  banned  lmao
  i just want phos the mummy and the moai statue  good taste there gemfriend
  its a bitch to keep on due to its peg on one of her hairpieces
gsc shipping update    dear customer    thank you very much for your support of good smile company products    the shipment date for the following wonderful hobby life for you 28 items has been confirmed    shipment from wed december 26 2018  nendoroid shielder/mash kyrielight casual ver  nendoroid ram  rem childhood ver  figma shielder/mash kyrielight casual ver  figma hero
    seems like bakugou have not been forgotten after all    
  not the same guy but if i could get kdasluts i dont care what happens to this vietnamese papercraft discussion site
  what a shame
  groovy
since they announced that theyre making a mako figma will this girl ever get rereleased
  how about not posting it
  idk but you fucked up when she was going for 50 everywhere she was so cheap i got two
  rereleasing dekus first costume  fuck gsc is really throwing insult and injury my way this pretty much guarantees that theyll never do his later costumes and i cant even laugh it up about getting the original for msrp anymore
  he thinks theyll ever make any more boku no pico figures than already announced good joke
  they should just let figuarts take it over if theyre gonna waste a potentially very lucrative license
does anyone want my casual mash preorder from goodsmile ill even cover the shipping i just dont want it anymore
  let me guess you cancelled an order by just not paying
  nah amiami has essentially blacklisted canaderp temporarily because their postal service is being a bunch of jews
  no hes right amiami wont ship out until they are sure the canada post shit is done with they sent an email out to all canadian customers not sure why this guy doesnt know that
    did i just waste 400 on deku
  any dates on these
  yep
  yes
  cute bait
  saber 20 anon died for our sins
  cant wait to remind friends who paid scalpers on this news
  no hes not    but maybe amiami just likes me because i pay for all my orders
  probably different people but same mental illness
  translation
  put deku figma on display  gscs weird school shooter girl oc looks more interesting  just make the vigilantes trio already
  the arms are too long and make the figure look strange
  well yeah i got that now too though i can buy stuff still and havent paid for the last 3 pre orders so who knows how it goes
  elbow ends at waist  hand ends at shoulder     how short are your arms anon
  2nd aga  not the indian midget or kuudere megane    hard pass
  did you honestly think the main character from the most popular running shonen series rn wasnt gonna get reissued once gsc saw the demand was enough to drive the figure price up to 400 especially with all of the reissues theyve been doing
  shoulda just sold mine months ago instead of being lazy
  indian midget is already going to be a model kit
  if you dont want something and see its going for insane pricesalways sell quick as possible especially in todays market with all these reissues the fact deku had licensing issues pretty much meant theyd one day iron it out and get the line rolling again    if you actually cherish something then dont worry about all this aftermarket speculative crap about being able to make money you dont want to sell something and then regret it forever later when a rerelease never happens just some advice from someone who has done stupid things both ways
    it took way too long for the reissue theres no way anyone would have known deku would come back
  really hope they make this variant but i doubt it honestly
  its only been like a year and a half hasnt it
  how about not replying to him 
  its probably not as lucrative as you think mha is way more popular in america than in japan and the current licensing situation around the property in the us means that gsc cant sell the figures to the us market i remember there being talk of funko having acquired the master toy license or something along those lines no reason to make anything more than a main character or two when the market that would actually buy side characters is offlimits
cynthia or olivia figma when
  hell probably change his costume 5 more times he still doesnt know what to fuck hes doing
  funko  yuck
just paid for my p5 mc rerelease and because my birthday is coming up i treated myself to a jalter as well c    what a nice morning
  fair point but hes been in his gamma suit for quite a while now in the mango
  idk theyve been rereleasing other relevant figures that soared in price on the aftermarket like snake guts griffith and both of the mha nendos so obviously keeping mha stuff in stock was on their radar its just a case of being patient and it actually paying off
mirio when
      stop posting fake shit
    fuck off retard
  there is some things even nostalgia cant convince me to buy
  the thread is already a fucking circus anyways
gib mogs
  threads already full of retards so why not
  fatefags already do that with the 800 saber variations  at least lolfags would add some variety to the shitposting
can shf heads fit on figma
  well youre here so yeah
  jesus christ this looks like shit compared to the real one fuck off poorfag    probably the most detailed and one of the best figmas released overall yet the eyes on mine are pretty well done too
lady maria when
  canceled sorry 
would kill to see one of these bois as a figma
does anyone know if its worth bothering to put a product request for ghibli characters would they even give licencing to gsc
  we got figma of sherlock hound and annos god warrior design so theyre not 100 against letting figures be made but its not likely
  but sherlock hound isnt ghiblis
  ghibli  the most normalfag of normalfag anime  no thank you
    
  youre right    actually it turns out nausicaa also predates ghibli so disregard my post entirely
      shf would do it better
never ever
      i want figures of kiki satsuki sheeta and chihiro to lewd
  no dale no buy
  dang it gsc you delayed muh release date again im gonna kick your ass
  propane tank as gsc exclusive
  figure comes with propane grill and propane accessories
  he doesnt know
    fake there is no copyright information
  thanks captain obvious
  i wish
  is it worth the read/fap
  who the fuck judges a figma for what its from lmfao they are nice character designs and from good films
  haha look at this fag thinking somethings bad just because its popular
  awesome thats very epic how about some more slice of life figures
        if only
      triggered normalfags
  yes cheshire and bunny are top tier waifu material
i hope we get the full lineup but we need best girl
  it never hurts to put in a request but it probably wont happen ghibli is one of those companies that has a very strict view of what could cheapen their brand or whatever and massproduced action figures seem to fall into that category
  suck it up and pay the latecomer tax for the revoltech if gsc made one itll cost the same but youll have to wait through all the delays into next year or later
  but if gsc made one it would be at least vaguely 1/12
its okay i guess
  looks like the bd sell well so maybe i just hope that they include interchangeable parts from human to zombies i like them better as zombies but i feel like figma just gonna make them in human form
  i know theres no cynthia or olivia figma only lillie selene and red
        looks good
they nerfed ichi
  what do you mean i couldnt pick out any major differences if its something to do with paint then all i can say is that most figma dont look as nicely painted as promo shots but this isnt exactly a high quality shot    is she shorter now i really cant tell what was nerfed
anybody know when aqua is getting released
  hang on let me turn on the future gadget 8 phone microwave name subject to change and check
  do these figures come with regular feet or do you have to use the robo high heels
  you use the stand like youre supposed to retard
  nah nibtonian i wanna know if you get regular legs or i have to partswap cause ive seen pics of both but who knows if its just partsswapping you feel me bitchstopholes
  wow you really are retarded
im a fgo fag who hasnt touched /toy/ in years i cant decide between jeanne alter and saber of red    please guide my wallet
  both
  kek sure thing lil guy as long as you feel good about yourself its no skin off my dick      red probably comes with more stuff jeanne has some nice faceplates tho
hows the quality on the touhou figmas
        i think shes the best snow miku yet wont be getting her but she looks good
pics for figma panther    
which one of you posted this
  i really regret not getting fujiko while she was on clearance
  um shes 40 on bbts  
  amiami had her down to like 2k at one point im not paying 40 amerifats plus shipping to canada for her
  they only charge 4 shipping
  not to canada they dont
  jeanne alter is just a less elegant jeanne and that has its charm go for mordred
  i still love akira for doubling as a prey standin

  touching dat oyaji  what a slut
  fuck you
  go with best son if you can only get one    the big brain answer is red saber  saber of red tho
  aqua is due to ship out on thursday december 13th i got an email about it yesterday    so very very soon  also the date was so close to being a friday the 13th
  i had to buy two of her because the first ones arm snapped off a the shoulder    the joint was tight so i heated it and it just twisted off i just chalk it up to bad luck the second one is great
  this is the exact reason why i skipped poing her granted i know nothing about the character but those pink gloves really spoiled the look for me
