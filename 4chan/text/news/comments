  ive been trained in public relations by edward bernays  is that a lie its a repositioning
  
  so he repositioned his answer on whether or not he helped the trump campaign commit treason hopefully he does die in prison
the qanon community is falling apart    perhaps no conspiracy theory has thrived more readily in the dark corners of the internet since it was first born last october on the infamous troll message board 4chan following president donald trumps vague remarks last year at a military dinner that it was the calm before the storm an anonymous user claiming to be a highlevel government informant and calling himself q after the highest level of security clearance at the energy department began leaving cryptic messages he called crumbs which were supposed to be hints as to a widescale government operation known as the storm to take down government corruption and the new world order with trump at the center while the messages often had very specific dates many aspects of them were purposefully vague allowing believers in qanon to use their imagination and fill in gaps    in time a gigantic overarching narrative emerged in which trump attorney general jeff sessions and special counsel robert mueller were all working together and planning mass arrests of everyone from hillary clinton to liberal financier george soros to members of congress for their role in a massive worldspanning criminal child sex ring enterprise that has included every former us president  and that people should prepare martial law and orchestrated mass riots to protect those marked for arrest qs believers have claimed that north korean dictator kim jong un is a cia plant that former democratic staffer seth rich was assassinated by ms13 on the orders of party leadership and that republicans intentionally lost the special election for jeff sessions senate seat in alabama to build evidence of voter fraud at its height qanon broke into popular culture with disgraced tv star roseanne barr promoting it on twitter    
but now the ongoing failure of qs predictions to come true has started to fragment the community and two major events in particular smashed the credibility of the movement for many believers    the first event was the result of the midterm elections where democrats decisively won control of the house q had previously assured supporters that contrary to the polls there was a red wave coming    the second event was trumps decision to fire sessions who in the qanon narrative trump was only pretending to hate and was the mastermind behind all of the impending mass arrests that were supposed to be right around the corner this was a particular blow as many supporters were already trying to rationalize losing the house with the fact that any minute now trump was going to declassify huge swathes of intelligence that would result in house democrats going to jail and a series of special elections that would give it back to republicans    the end result according to conspiracy theory debunker mike rothschild is that tons of qanon believers now realize they have been grifted while the rest who have been gathered on the social network voat after the community was banned from reddit in september are at each others throats and frantically spinning ever crazier ideas to explain away why nothing q has said has come true
the notion that some of the remaining qanon believers might form citizen militias is particularly troubling as farright conspiracy theories have led to violence  most famously a man nearly shot up the comet ping pong pizzeria in washington dc last year acting on a hoax that hillary clinton and her inner circle were running a sex trafficking ring out of its basement    whatever happens the qanon conspiracy theory was never fated to end well for its believers and the whole saga is a cautionary tale about being careful what one believes on the internet
/pol/ is so weird half of it is larpers the other half are /x/tier crazies
  no they actually believe the shit they shovel thats why theyre called /pol/ppets
a salon and rt thread on the front page    okay
  thanks for the bump
salon  into the trash it goes
  no other media outlet would be willing to test their sanity to showing a bunch of /pol/ppets and trumptards getting grifted  now it looks like they want to form a terrorist group which cant be ruled out sine one tried to shoot up a pizza shop and another committed mass acts of terrorism with a serial bombing
  at least theyre stupid enough to plan it out in the open hopefully the fbi will be able to stop them before anything happens
hate to say it butq predicted this
  you mean attempted acts of terrorism because not a single bomb was detonated
q predicted this
    im going to hazard a guess that q did not actually predict this
  q predicted this
  doubt it
  q predicted you would say that
  doubtful
  devastated  they still believe a pizza parlor is a secret base for a child sex ring what could possibly devastate them
  coping qtard detected
is it honestly considered rational to disregard the possibility that the pizza idiot was used as a scapegoat    i mean the pizzagate stuff is undeniably compelling im an actual socialist btw so dont think im some butt hurt alt right type
  its almost impossible to toss this kind of article for being fake news since basically what hes doing is an imgurtier clip show of anal devastation    the article is a somewhat bland explanation of the qanon movement with a few inaccuracies here and there and several compilations of anons butthurt that the whole house of cards is tumbling down
  an actual socialist im honestly tempted to derail this thread to discuss the practicality of socialism in the real world but eh butthurt /pol/tards are also fun
i cant believe people actually thought some top level government worker would risk their job talking about high security things on 4chan of all places
  really rather stupid in hindsight isnt it
  i thought it was stupid when /pol/ first started jerking off over it no hindsight required
  fair enough
  it was painfully obvious the guy was just mashing his keyboard theyre so desperate to be a part of something special that theyll believe even the most transparently fake nonsense its ridiculous
salon  real journalism  not gawker tier clickbait
  beyond obvious it was literally methodically proven to be keyboard mashing by some security analyst
  you  not a faggot  not to say i have anything against gay people were trying to turn faggot into a new term disassociated with homosexuality and referring exclusively to people such as yourself
  thinking its working  thats pretty gay
  q predicted you would say q predicted this and that
  so thats what it was about  see i was more or less under a rock so i hardly heard about this qspiracy
  im happy for you that you missed it it was monumentally dumb
  im so happy weve moved beyond it dear lord was it stupid
  doesnt seem to be any where near over voat is still active with this shit probably wont be until trump is out in 2020 and the thumpers wake up to their bitter reality
  doubt that will wake them up theyll continue crying for the next decade that it was all a deep state conspiracy and the voters didnt want him out and no matter what there will always be a website thats happy to harbor them    all we can really do is outvote them hope the majority of them continue to be pussies who wont commit any violence irl and do our best to stay away from them
what the fuck is q
  literally methodically
  can you not fucking read
  heres a pretty good summary from about a year ago when this shit was fairly new  
  anonymous user claiming to be a highlevel government informant and calling himself q after the highest level of security clearance at the energy department    read newfriend
    i remember seeing those threads on /pol/ a while back they were as vague as they were stupid only dumb people took it seriously
  only dumb people took it seriously  well fortunately for q /pol/ is chock full of them
  the entire comet pizza has a basement with 6 million children trafficked through it was a red herring tossed in by people who wanted to decry that the right was lunatics  pizza gate got its term from both old slang cheese pizza which shares its initials with child porn hence the term being used for it and for podestas emails seemingly speaking in code revolving around pizza    the entire premise of the conspiracy was that theres human trafficking happening in the us and rich and powerful people were involved in it and its undeniable that human trafficking occurs in the us its the biggest economy in places like san diego the grand majority of the people invested in researching it were talking about human trafficking in general and connections that it may have with rich/powerful people it was bipartisan as well casting suspicion on both republicans and democrats as well as non politicians     then some idiots insisted on comet pizza and a basement and the left doing what it does best autistically fixated solely on that one disproven point theres no basement in comet pizza therefore no human has ever been trafficked by anyone in america investigating further makes you a lunatic racist neo nazi conspiratard and refused to examine any other aspect of the entire human trafficking debate parts of which revealed actual human trafficking in areas like tucson    simply look at the reaction to the term pizza gate being said you get people pouring out of the woodwork to go   hurr stupid right wing retard theres no basement  when that wasnt even the name sake nor was it the focus its a form of dismissal to push any discussion out the window you will get retarded boomers that will insist on the point but thats boomers they forward chain emails because theyre scared a girl will smother them in their sleep if they dont    also check wikipedia its pure denialism without any adequate portrayal of what was being discussed
  boomer santa claus  he was there to tuck them in at night and tell them dont worry everything will be fine so long as you do nothing which most of /pol/ realized was bullshit which is why it got exiled to infinity chan
  someones butthurt that they fell for someones shitty make believe game
  here we see the exact thing im talking about
  this scares me only because my county mostly rural but somewhat urban/suburban has the highest rates of human trafficking around  not to mention theres almost no work around so many people turn to crimes such as squatting though thats homeless people or people in a real pickle so its not as bad drugs especially is common and one road a few miles away is called the drug capital of this subregion guess its name fantasy island
   its a form of dismissal to push any discussion out the window   i distinctly remember being shouted down for pointing out how stupid the pizza thing was  there was most certainly people on the right who believed in the pizza conspiracy 
anyone with have a brain knew it was a shitty larp but then literal retards that belive anything saw it and went oh shit look at this anonymous guy saying this shitq predicted this
/pol/ confirmed for easiest board to troll
  even if q was real theres no way the deep dish state or whatever wouldnt have had him killed already
  
  youre an idiot just accept it this damage control is only making you look desperate
  holy shit even before his analysis why the fuck would a secret code literally start with code these people are so fucking dumb
   to say i have anything against gay people were trying to turn faggot into a new term disassociated with homosexuality and referring exclusively to people such as yourself  holy shit go the fuck back rebbit please
  this damage control is only making you look desperate
  im going to greentex this entire post and hope that gets my point across  this is literally just a less obvious versi9n of no u step up
  you shoulda just ignored it he handled his response so stupidly that he actually made it look like he agrees with me
  you the socialist or the trumptard the reply chain is so convoluted its impossible to tell
  lol what is socialist about any of these posts i dont get how someone who uses the word trumptard can fall for any of their scarewords
  see    one of the two in the original reply chain is a socialist he says so
  the left declared human trafficing doesnt occur because pizza gate was false  no just pointed out theres no way there were children being kept in the basement there and that people were crazy to think there were
  oh yes certainly theres not more than two people involved in the reply chain in this thread where the ip count is 34 and the posts are anonymous
  i just wanted to debate an actual socialist the op topic is kinda boring and i havent seen a lot of people who use the term with no qualifications usually they dont know what it means or are engaging in some comical doublethink
  what if claims that its a failed conspiracy are yet another disinfo tactic spread by the conspiracy
  at this point if you cant see its a failure from looking at it yourself then youre genuinely retarded you dont need any media to tell you its stupid it should be inherently obvious
  dont worry everything will be fine so long as you do nothing  what does this mean was q actually a clever tactic to lull trumptards into complacency they thought it was all taken care of so they stopped paying attention and that let the democrats sweep the midterms good stuff
  glorious
  hillary was q all along
people actually take salon seriously  point and laugh at the retarded children everyone
  points and laughs at you
  yes trust the plan was the line   when people got antsy about things not happening blatant corruption etc hed just go trust the plan and have everyone sit down and wait and wait dont worry its coming in 6 months 6 months go by it doesnt happen but dont worry the plan is still on just trust it     should we be worried about all these odd ballots and disproportionate turn outs no trust the plan should we worry about this blatant underhanded trade deal no trust the plan should we etc
  im just saying    isnt me nor are any further responses to you    you called me an idiot because i highlighted that the core of it was about trafficking which it was and that the name pizzagate came from podesta using the term pizza in strange and unusal points within his emails in a way taht 4chan used the term cheese pizza  heres evidence of the 93 generals made to study and combat human trafficking but you dont give a shit you just want to own me and if that means tearing down anyone that studies human trafficking well a few thousand raped kids is a small price to pay
  no u faggot
  using 4chan archives from /pol/ as proof
  if q was just someone longterm trolling /pol/ thats god damn amazing
bet q was a libtroll trolling everyone all this time
  the theory starts on /pol/  the primary aspect focus on human trafficking became its own general to differentiate its self from pizza gate  thats not proof
  i hope so it would be yet another example of /pol/ getting owned by the libs
  they literally owned an entire country full of libs during a certain 2016 election
  theres entire conventions dedicated to bigfoot and the flat earth people waste their time on some real stupid shit just because you personally wasted a significant amount of time in those threads means jack shit about its existence it just means your gullible
  they  who do you think youre fooling    stop obsessing over 2016 btw you just got clobbered in the 2018 midterms because you cant let go 2016
  i dont think you know what salon is it doesnt mean hair salon you fucking autist
  saloncom
  must be lonely at the top
  no youre right its a news site made for paedophiles by paedophiles      
  if you legitimately believe theres absolutely nothing odd about the way these sick individuals are speaking of cheese hot dogs handkerchiefs and the ages of such things you clearly havent the depth in your brain to be a part of the discussion
  youre describing shadows to a man in a cave he wont listen
    t deluded qtards
  if all your evidence is just some supposed code you worked out and a bunch of posts of retards hyping each other up then youre probably not as intelligent as you think you are
  what is a paydo file
    friendly reminder that comet pizza didnt even have a basement 
  issac newton spent his time trying to decipher code in the bible to uncover the secrets of alchemy  smart people can believe in dumb things
  i doubt there are any qanons who are nobel laureates
  believes theres something off about the way people talk about cheese    worldwide pedophile demon conspiracy
  and lets make it clear that theres nothing particularly odd about the conversations conspiritards are making connections where there arent any    seriously ask them to provide even one example and itll reveal how full of shit they are the most forgiving way i can look at these people is that theyre pretending to believe this stupid shit in an attempt to demonize their opposition and that does not make them look particularly good
  so where were all pingpong tables located then lmao
  lmao im so calm and collected look at me laughing at this i dont care at all its such a big joke to me lmao but actually im really fucking mad haha
it doesnt take an oldfag to remember the pedowood threads on /pol/ in 2012 and 2013 all that the pizzagate people did was combine hillary conspiracy theories with pedowood and then after that was all played out qanon revived it
  kind of like how people claim charles mansons rants are profound even if really was just random nonsense
q predicted this
  this the qanon shit is just a repackaging of a conspiracy that had already been memed to death  which makes me think that the current iteration are a bunch of newfags
  seriously whats with q like y not call it t or something
  newfag detected  he claimed to have q level clearance with the us doe in his larpings
  on june 26 2018 wikileaks publicly accused qanon of leading antiestablishment trump voters to embrace regime change and neoconservatismtweet 1 qanon had previously pushed for regime change in iran69 two days later the whistleblower organization shared an analysis by internet party president suzie dawson claiming that qanons posting campaign is an intelligence agencybacked psyop aiming to round up people that are otherwise dangerous to the deep state because they are genuinely opposed to it usurp time  attention  trick them into serving its aims
  plus its that james bond character did anybody yet bring up that livestreamer using the trip code live  much like trumps presidential campaign q was a larp that gained more traction than the author expected so they kept running it to sell as many t shirts as possible
  youre conveniently glossing over the fact that this whole conspiracy came about from food references in the podesta emails the conspiracy was solely about the comet pizza shop in dc it was defiantly not about high level human trafficking     i was there on /pol/ when the emails were leaked and in the thread where this retarded theory came up     stop rewriting history idiot
  qanon fucktard detected
  human trafficking doesnt exist like bigfoot and flat earth   stop investigating human trafficking the government lies about it for more funding
  oh i was living under a rock mostly this whole time
  the first line in my post is about where it got the term from the usages of pizza dominos handkerchief and the like all strewn about in a very unnatural and awkward way podestas pizza place became an area of concern not because it has a basement where they keep the kids but because of the creepy as fuck pictures on the instagram from the place and all the child targeting sexual things it was a connection between the usage of podestas unnatural uses of the words pizza and children being sexualized
  that reminds me of little babys ice cream which as far as ik has unconfirmed rumors of it being some secretive pedo organization or some subliminal shit  it seems to be a weird but harmless ice cream company
  never said that im just saying pizzagate and qanon is fucking stupid
  lbic is creepy as fuck in the marketing department but i dont know anything else about them being strange     the best way to describe pizzagate is that it was all smoke and people were searching for fire but kept finding more smoke because they were trying to go top down and the anti trafficking general flipped it and tried to go bottom up and had some success there was suspicious shit absolutely everywhere including suggestive and upsetting pictures of living children disturbing and sexual depictions of children well known pedo slang being used by podestas brother chickenlover and other things i decided he was either an attention seeking edgy faggot or he was guilty but the evidence for his guilt wasnt there and so he cant be prosecuted which is why the bottom up approach is better for what can be done
  honestly if you think the food references are out of place in the emails you are a fucking idiot here read some of them     the realtor found a handkerchief i think it has a map that seems pizzarelated is it yours   but walnut sauce for the pasta mary plz tell us the straight story was the sauce actually very tasty  its an amazing ligurian dish made with crushed walnuts made into a paste so stop being so california  if you will be around for dinner or pizza on sunday would love to see you and hear about addis and california  hillary pizza party april 10   does hillary want to do 2 events that day ours as a higher dollar event  invite please pizza for hillsry  great show great speech raised over 40 grand my only regret is i did not make you a nice pizza  i consider ice cream its purchase and its consumption a rather serious business  thx for coming out always happy to babysit  lo and behold instead of pasta and wonderful sauces it was a lovely tempting assortment of cheeses yummy i am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them  ps do you think ill do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta  hope youre doing ok im dreaming about your hotdog stand in hawaii  john and mary i just received the holiday package of pasta and sauce if only i could make it turn out as special as you guys do many thanks    if you manage to connect any of that to pedophilia you have shit for brains
  either a shill or someone whos incapable of reading between the lines lmao    pizza related map yeah that sounds like a real thing that could actually exist in real life and not be obvious code talk for something else    post the line about wetworks bet thats totally innocuous too     it wasnt actually about murder theyre just big waterpark enthusiasts 
  doesnt post any of it  expects anyone to believe hes not full of shit  keeps posting the dumb emoji to show how totally happy and carefree he is when hes breathing heavily as he types this post  yup its a qtard
thinking people talking in secret code would specifically use the phrase cheese pizza when its a known code for cp that they would actually be so obvious about it so that you retards could conveniently figure it out requires such an insanely high level of stupidity that i am amazed a /pol/tard can function in society without collapsing to the ground in an autistic fit
  yeah that sounds like a real thing that could actually exist in real life  a pizzarelated map just for you 
  specifically use the phrase cheese pizza when its a known code for cp  1 context they literally run a pizza shop  2 why would old fucks be using 4chan slang
  thats exactly the point im making they would not be using 4chans exact slang for cp and its clear that people are only jumping to conclusions because its 4chans slang for cp which is insanely fucking dumb that they think theyd be that obvious about it like a person really has to try to be this fucking stupid
  you purposefully picked the food references that made contextual sense none of the playing dominos on pizza and other bizarrely worded ones
  he specifically listed the playing dominos on pizza you fucking retard do you even try to win arguments or do you just spew as much bullshit as possible in the hope that your opposition gets bored and gives up
  cheese pizza predates 4chan and acting as if this is the only linkage is low information as fuck    the guys house is filled with jeffrey dahmer tributes and his restaurant formerly has fbilisted pedophile symbology as its logo    he was friends with dennis hastert among others convicted pedophile basically fam you are either shilling or low info you can see all the circumstantial evidence for pizzagate and if you are a hard skeptic about it you can say all of these things are coincidences but saying there arent an incredible amount of data points is patently ridiculous
  for you to believe in pizzagate requires you to believe that they would use known pedophile terms and symbology for something that they are supposedly trying to keep secret so the socalled deep state which you claim is intelligent enough to manipulate everything behind the scenes is also very stupid and uses terms that they know will get them caught classic fascism insisting your enemy is simultaneously very strong and very weak and hoping your followers have the cognitive dissonance not to notice    its like some sort of reverse occams razor in terms of the logical leaps you have to take to justify your bullshit you nutcase conspiracy theorists really are so easy to destroy
not so seem like a troll but can one access /pol/ since i somehow stumbled on 4channel when i went to 4chan
  good maybe now they can dox his and his followers sorry asses
  i dont quite know what youre trying to ask but 4channel and 4chan are the same website one is used for worksafe blue boards and one is used for not worksafe yellow boards
    what i always found weird is people on this website supposing cheese pizza being slang for cp cause you know 4chan itself coined it
  yeah thats part of why its fucking stupid so a bunch of wrinkly old democrats are using 4chan slang and this doesnt sound odd    people only believe in pizzagate because theyre told to believe in it if you actually think about it it falls apart instantly
  o ok
  wwg1wga     what do you guys meet here and lie to each other kek
  whatever helps you demonize the other side of the political spectrum easier
  you cant deny the guys ig and home are filled with creepy pedophilic shit  the guy if hes not a pedophile is obviously trying to be edgy and attention seeking by being naughty i cant say hes guilty so i wont but i will say theres too many coincidences for him to not know exactly what the fuck hes doing by calling toddlers sluts and putting ejaculating pizzas near honey in between photos of children duct taped to tables while his buddies call the children sexy and use words like chickenlover   as far as evidence goes hes a really creepy motherfucker with a pedophilic sense of humor its not quite illegal but its damn disgusting and suspect but like i said its not yet illegal
  why do people return to the scene of the crime     psychologically damaged individuals dont behave according to the strict logic you are projecting onto them and nowhere did i mention the deep state but excellent job projecting your imagined enemy onto me anon    youre a grade a useful idiot low information but so sure of his copypasted convictions he received from some pedigreed information source     podesta and select friends  use pedophile symbology  are friends with convicted pedophiles  use obvious code words derived from leo sources  fill their home with pedophilic symbology and references  have obvious and incredibly fucking creepy drawings depicting restrained children in nearnaked poses posted on the internet and in their real surroundings    it quacks like a fucking duck anon    what is your reasoning to file this all as a coincidence if i may ask
  keep your head firmly planted in the sand wouldnt want to think outside of your preconceived notion of whats true nothing has ever been gained by challenging your beliefs carry on fellow npc
  for you to believe in pizzagate requires you to believe that they would use known pedophile terms and symbology for something that they are supposedly trying to keep secret so the socalled deep state which you claim is intelligent enough to manipulate everything behind the scenes is also very stupid and uses terms that they know will get them caught  but them using obvious coded language and known symbology is one of the factors being brought up in the defense of their innocence on the basis that no one would ever do that if they were guilty youre doing itright now what motivation do they have not to hint at it when thats one thing that will convince the npcs theyre innocent    the concepts called refuge in audacity
  
  whataboutism  also not even a decent example because sanders immediately went to the senate floor to publicly disavow the shooter  trump has not disavowed anyone who committed acts of terrorism or political violence in his name or attacked those on his enemy list many sides condemnations dont count either
  and accusing people of pedophile rings without evidence is called slander
  maybe if you retards presented actual evidence people would take you seriously but we both know that you dont have dick so youre resorting to memes you forgot to call me a sheeple too
failing to understand it was an elaborate psyop to get crazy rightwing nutjobs to selfidentify
  i never believed in it
  npc is their replacement for sheeple a funny thing with the right is that their memes are so bad that they have to keep changing them because prolonged use of a term by them is enough to completely discredit it remember how they liked to call people cuck and how they dont do that anymore
    angry npcs cant cope with the fact that we are able to produce memes that humiliate them faster than they can respond
  but you didnt come up with the insult you just spam it endlessly you know like an npc
  this its a massive selfown and the moment that sinks in theyre going to abandon it in favor of the next meme    they dont even produce memes fast they beat them into the ground until theyve completely lost effectiveness
  so npc like in an rpg
  youre getting desperate
is it not embarrassing to these people that the only way they can convey their opinion is by using a video game term just more proof that the right is full of edgy teenagers who are politically ignorant retards
qanon thing is dumb but people acting like this is some kind of victory are retarded only brainlets and newfags ever thought anonymous shitposts on 4chan were of any credible value  and by extension this board is comprised brainlets and newfags for thinking this is news return to your subreddits children
  yikes
  sorry i know i have to get on my knees and pledge my loyalty to alexandria cortezpbuh before im allowed to post here
  cringe
  amazing how obsessed the right is with her isnt it
  oooohhhh criiiinnnnngggeeeeee  i can practically smell you from here redditor
  only because the right is baffled anyone thought that she would make a great politician  its just proof that politics has become as equally dumb as the lowest common denominator inside of it people who worship populists because they whisper things in their ears and not actually because theyre good politicians who can get change done
    samefag
  nah brah youre just an angry redditor upset someone called you out on your behavior  welcome to 4channel
  republicans elected a dumb populist to be president and they think they have the right to question anyone elses intelligence
  great thats for republicans isnt it  why are you supporting yet another populist because your opponents have done the same if republicans jumped off the bridge would you do it too   im sick of the majority of left arguments being little more than something something trump   try making a decision on your own sometime that doesnt involve invoking his name like a magic spell
  im sick of the majority of left arguments being little more than something something trump  get used to it we got used to something something obama for eight years and he was actually competent
  i know very little about ocasiocortez but im fairly confident she will act to faithfully represent her constituents she is inexperienced but she will learn over time all representatives are inexperienced at some point trump on the other hand is just a genuinely bad person he own words and actions seem to indicate that he actually gets enjoyment out of causing misery he also seems to be incapable of taking advice or changing beliefs once he establishes them because of that i have zero faith in him to represent america in any decent way
    sometimes pizza just means pizza

oh no people are posting in news threads i dont like    ahaha do something about it republitards
  obama wasnt competent look at our health insurance for example theres a ton of things like that i could rattle on about horrible decisions with bad consequences if you drive a diesel truck made in the past 5 years youd fucking hate obombob
  look at my lap look at my larp its real  btfo by assanges mom  literally creates the boomer meme  freaks out because shrek is used in his threads  drrr its real guis look everyone on 4chan likes it  1600 threads without anyone posting in them all get sent to   npcs many such cases
veterans affairs dept tells capitol hill it wont repay underpaid gi bill benefits recipients    for weeks student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect gi bill benefit payments which the department of veterans affairs has blamed on computer issues    but on wednesday the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed two committee aides told nbc news    
remember when trump appointed some unqualified rich friends to run the va looks like theyre skimming money off vets now and blaming computer issues
  why do you think that     according to the article    the forever gi bill which president donald trump signed into law in july 2017  is presumably to take care of the vets so why would the va try to ignore the law 
  you know names can lie         at least a government watch dog is moving in on trumps cronies and you can expect house democrats to open a full investigation if the watch dog finds wrong doing  
  there seems to be something worth talking about here two excerpts from the articles you mention stood out to me    the maralago crowd spoke with va officials daily the documents show reviewing all manner of policy and personnel decisions   they prodded the va to start new programs and officials travelled to maralago at taxpayer expense to hear their views    at times perlmutter moskowitz and sherman have created headaches for va officials because of their failure to follow  government rules and processes    the maralago crowd bombarded va officials with demands many of them inapt or unhelpful  on phone calls with va officials perlmutter would bark at them to move faster having no patience for bureaucratic explanations  about why something has to be done a certain way or take a certain amount of time former officials said        so what is this all just bureaucracy mumbo jumbo   the main complaint against trumps cronies seems to be they dont understand the complications in changing government procedures not that they are up to no good
  given how trump and his administration acts its like theyre running an opposite version of hanlons razor where when you think its stupidity its actually malice
  one thing is clear the cronies have enormous influence but va officials must refuse the payments
  blaming computer issues    dr paul lawrence who is in charge of the veteran benefits administration testified in a fairly heated veterans affairs committee     lawrence said on thursday that the vba was essentially caught offguard by the it issues stating in his prepared remarks  that 22 of the 34 sections in the forever gi bill signed by president donald trump last year required it solutions two  sections caused more trouble than others he said as they complicated how the va calculates the gi bills housing allowance    congressmen from both sides of the aisle expressed their frustration with the vba at the hearing they were particularly upset  that none of the witnesses appeared to take full responsibility for the delay and that the vba hadnt alerted them to the  seriousness of the issue        sounds like trump and his cronies are in a jam they cant fire these people because they are the only ones that know the computer systems in the first place   now the va is saying even if the it issues are resolved they wont pay the benefits promised by the 2017 law trump signed
  they were particularly upset that none of the witnesses appeared to take full responsibility for the delay and that the vba hadnt alerted them to the seriousness of the issue  truly an administration where the buck never stops
  take full responsibility for the delay  is it not possible that other career officials   within the va are more responsible for the delay  there has been a lot of outright trump defiance everywhere and the maralago cronies pissed some of the career people off maybe they are intentionally trying to make trump look bad  or perhaps the trump administration did not realize how difficult it would be to implement the law and is now a little in over their head 
  or perhaps the trump administration did not realize how difficult it would be to implement the law and is now a little in over their head   im sure this is part of the case everyone with a fuckmassive ego so every one of these people thinks they have all the answers to every problem with an organization and if theyre only allowed to control things all the problems will go away overnight they didnt of course    part of responsibility is recognizing when youve been an egotistical fuckup and taking responsibility for it
  that sounds to strong for this case   the va has long long dealt with data for these types of benefits  it is not unreasonable for trumps people to assume that the twiddling of the numbers would be a relatively straightforward issue within the computer systems and the law is well over a year old
    this thanksgiving weekend while most people were busy stuffing their faces or relaxing with family a group of grown men decided to deputize themselves as unofficial informants to the internal revenue service their selfappointed mission reporting women who post sexual photos or videos online to the taxman    using the hashtag thotaudita play on the insult thot which stands for that ho over therethe men encouraged each other to snitch on camgirls and instagram models claiming the women had not paid income tax on earnings collected through social media and apps like paypal and venmo    although the men had zero proof of thisand in many cases didnt even know the womens real namesthe hashtag went viral overnight    over 100 thots just got reported to paypal by someone using the thotbot datasets one wannabe sherlock tweeted referring to an aggregator created to help identify sex workers online this is really happening    always remember thot that hoe owes taxes another man wrote keep your wits about you and stay vigilant fellow inquisitors
pay your fair share if you want to be equal ladies
does this mean an end to those fucking tiktok threads if so im all for it
  they do    youre a fucking moron
  then they have nothing to worry about incel
  says the guy defending the incel patrol
they may earn 1199900 without needing to file a return
  incorrect government attention never just goes away especially not for people who the system considers pariahs    but yeah you actually dont consider them humans so your opinion already has a sociopathic starting point
good if i pay taxes on my job they should pay taxes on their job its only fair    bbbut muh feminism    theyre only whining because they cant use their bodies to get untaxed money they should all get real jobs instead of being sluts on the internet
  and thats a good thing
  they how is the irs able to audit them  if they declared all income and paid taxes on it there is nothing to audit are you actually retarded
everyone has to pay taxes even whores
the internetvigilante justice  its like lord of the flies on steroids  just shut it down already no good can come from it
  nobody said they werent humans why so angry friend but it is impossible for them to pay their fare share if they are being audited after they pay their taxes then you can say they are paying their fare share all you want its the law to pay taxes in the united states
  a portion of them have other legitimate jobs and may earn much more without reporting it incel  they basically run small businesses and dont report their income from it   they need to report it and pay taxes like the rest of lawabiding society
  thot which stands for that ho over there  oooh now i get it     anyway yeah this is kind of bad i mean if they were bragging about how they are getting a lot of tax free money that would be one thing but reporting without proof is really bad
  but reporting without proof is really bad  is it really
all these betas defending roasties  reeeeeee internet witch hunts are only cool when i waaaaaant
  theyre not doing socially necessary labour there would be no sex work after the revolution and these cam models are not working class but petitbourgeoisie no sympathy from communists on this one
  thot which stands for that ho over there  now its that ho owe taxes
hello there internet world web im new here to channel 4 how are ya
roasties getting roasted
  they how is the irs able to audit them    well probably because dickmeup on cam7 is in reality amy kushner from tupelo who does pay her taxes but they wont know that until they perform an audit
  in reality they audit them like they do anyone else   they look at their bank account balances and activity and compare it to their decalred income and determine if more income was received than was declared  honestly not a bad idea to be doing this but considering most of this stuff is cash only i would suspect any sw that isnt dumb or making obscene amounts of money simply keep their cash in their purse rather than putting it in the bank
im not american so forgive but does this not affect benefits payments i doubt they need them but ive seen the english government go at people for less like the dude who reported to the police a wallet with 200 in the police gave it back him after they couldnt find the person and then he lost his bennies for undeclared windfall the government already does this over really small stuff like a homeless dude who did some tv show about benefits lost them because he mentioned on the show he was a do anything guy who just did whatever favours or help for money down the street i know it might be a false equivalent but even here in nv i wanted to print some magazines off here for my business since im stuck here a month and then i got slapped with 57 tax it drove me mental    on a further note paypal is getting funny with people using personal accounts as business a bunch of friends who also small scale zines or even just sell weeb merch are having their paypals closed down hence why a bunch of them are moving over to stripe and such so governments and people do check do follow up on this sort of shit   but fuck me do i wish i wasnt a disabled flat chest i wish i could have the mode that the normal women get      this and its why snapchat/findom people use venmo circlepay ect hell there was a dwarf bird whose disabled i talked to once who makes cripple pon but only accepted bitcoin
  are you having a stroke
  i cant really understand your accent but it sounds like youre asking if women on welfare lose their welfare for making 6 figures selling their ass probably if they ever had it to begin with
  im not american so forgive but does this not affect benefits payments  its not as stringent as what you described recieving 1000 from a lucky break once wont disqualify you the issue for many of the thots being targeted is that they misunderstand the us tax code so severely that they think because they call their income donations it automagically classifies their porn blog as a 501c3 charity and they can just not declare it as income benefits or not many of those targeted are making enough shaking their tits on camera to go up a tax bracket or two

  what is every 21st century rape claim for 500
the problem isnt whether the irs will honorably and nicely force them to pay taxes without any other impact to their lives if that was the case there wouldnt be a problem    no one believes the government just does what it should without meddling in other shit dont be stupid by reporting them to the irs they are outing them  many of them get their accounts frozen or shut down because sw is somehow becoming more unsafe on the internet and more financial sites are turning them away    thats a good thing anon tips fedora and smirks    k
  go to another platform paid shill    holy shit newfag just click the post number on your post your method is way to fucking complicated
  more financial sites are turning them away  hardly unreasonable if prostitution is illegal
  how do i reply to my own replies  reply to my own posts  only literal faggots shitlords and shills do this id wager your a shill
will somebody please think of the poor thots    cos they are gonna be poor after the irs has finished getting societies share out of them never forget thotties we live in a society
i wonder if anyone reported lana rain
are there any updates on who has been affected
were just concerned citizens who want everyone to pay their fair share  why shouldnt sex workers also pay their fair share     i hope none of you are dumb enough to actually believe this shit you have no more reason to suspect that a girl selling premium snapchats is skipping out on her taxes than you do some furry artist taking commissions or your barber who gets paid in cash you just dont like them so youre trying to hurt them but because youre also a coward youre trying to wrap it in some moral justification     nothing will come from this anyway you need actual evidence for the irs to take it seriously every single one of these reports is just boobie lady has a paypal link in her twitter bio and this am not allowed if thats all it took then the irs would already created a bot thatd catch way more people than the incel patrol ever could       99 of the time when paypal fucks over sex workers its not for prostitution its for porn which is legal
  6 figures  wow this is some principal skinners a billionaire type shit
  99 of the time when paypal fucks over sex workers its not for prostitution  opinion unless you have access to paypals customer auditing records
  most sex workers dont sell actual sex online ergo    prove it shill  my toddler makes more coherent arguments than /pol/butts
  please provide proof of your claim  my toddler makes better arguments than you  i dont have a toddler but if i did it would make better arguments than you
  please clarify on what is actual sex before you try to make this argument
  theres not inherently /pol/ about doubting a statement that is unlikely to be actually backed up by evidence    so ill ask you again do you have access to paypals customer auditing records
  you could just call it an exaggeration like a normal human but nobody is shaking their tits that hard for minimum wage three hours of tit shaking a week to make 2000 is not so far fetched thomas
  sorry it was 5am and im jet lagged i was making a point that people are brushing this off when governments in over countries such as the uk come down like a hammer on everything and anything even a homeless squatter cleaning a yard for a couple bucks the government getting a sniff and theyll follow on it     i see american system seems super lenient than what im used to dealing with   im wondering further then to put up a slope is that if this starts going then more stringent governments like the uk would slide into this  this anon  is more closer to my original point that once they smell blood they just hound    paypal froze a artists account because someone send a payment for a yakuza commission  go on tumblr and search for paypal zine or paypal frozen and youll see post after post of artists and people unfairly frozen for tax or income reasons   furry porn artists get constantly frozen itd give you that master post but tumblr did a massive wipe of blogs recently another russian porn artist also got hit in the wipe had major paypal troubles   paypal has been freezing accounts for the most stupid of fucking things for months
  furry porn artists get constantly frozen  and thats a good thing
  still no paypal statistics then
  three hours of tit shaking a week to make 2000  sex work is like most independent industries where a few at the top are making bank but the majority are just scraping by and just like those other industries even if you manage to land a gig that pays that well it doesnt mean youre able to land it every week every month or even every quarter not every hour of work is an hour of paid work your reasonable figure is still childishly high
    nobody is reporting quantisha or some random trailer trash in tennessee to the irsthe popular whores are getting reported and the popular whores make good money
  you are an idiot
  your problem with them is just that they may not declare everything to the irs or is it deeper
  the popular whores are getting reported and the popular whores make good money  theyre not making 666/hour on a consistent basis money maybe 1 or 2 are really making bank then theres a small group of them who are making enough to be lowermiddle class on their sex work alone then theres a larger group who make enough to substitute a lowpaying part time job and then theres a massive number who are barely making shit     and if you look at these dudes crusading its not just the most popular people theyre going after its everyone they can find     this is all moot anyway because again theres zero evidence that theyre evading their taxes
  this is all moot anyway because again theres zero evidence that theyre evading their taxes  so theres nothing to worry about then if the irs investigate nothing to hide nothing to fear
  yup
  nothing to hide nothing to fear  im sure you wouldnt mind if the cops rooted around your house because a whole gang of people lied and told them you had drugs right maybe installed a camera or two you wouldnt be annoyed you wouldnt feel violated it wouldnt be disruptive to your life at all right nothing to hide nothing to fear
  i dont personally have a problem with them i was responding to some random guys anger at my idea of what popular sex workers earnings are as far as the greater topic sure they should have to pay their taxes like anyone else but i dont really care otherwise if they do or not because its not my job to enforce that why do you assume i have a problem with them was it the word whore
  sorry 4chan makes me see everyone in a negative light around here cheers
  financial auditing  house search  financial auditing  active monitoring   if they have a warrant to search my house or monitor me then theyve got probable cause supported by due process    and if not i have recourse    so like i said nothing to hide nothing to fear
  damn for someone who hates sex workers you sure love licking boots
  this is the argument made for the patriot act    or do you prefer the argument made for obama wiretapping
  i dont hate sex workers  im entirely ambivalent about it i all ive reiterated is for the evidence to be followed    whatever you think about me are your own projections    theres a difference between collecting data or information because you can and running it for an active investigation
  theres a difference between collecting data or information because you can and running it for an active investigation  theres really not when the investigation can be instigated by something as flimsy as pointing out a girl has a paypal link in her twitter bio at that point you might as well start auditing people because they were spotted holding a hundred dollar bill
  thats why if there is an investigation and it has no credible cause  merely reporting for disruption purposes the irs can prosecute those that false report
  do you even know what ergo means  it is latin for therefore    you dont end a sentence using therefore nor is it a sentence on its own unless if you have no idea what therefore means of course therefore
  no anon the true idiot is the one that asked how to reply to his own posts
  implying    the conclusion was foregone
  not so fast there outraged thot  its quite easy for the irs to get this information and determine who actually needs to get audited by just looking at these peoples profiles and seeing who is running their own small businesses and to actually reported any taxes for any of these things in the previous year  i dont know if you ever have file taxes before but you declare the sources of your income   if its obvious youre running a business and you havent declared taxes from that business its all so obvious you need to be audited
  if there is no evidence then there is nothing to audit   what are you afraid of pay your fair share
white knighting for random thots you will never meet  why is it so important to you that these people get away with not paying taxes
  if its obvious youre running a business and you havent declared taxes from that business  except its not at all obvious that they arent declaring taxes people are just pretending to think that these women arent paying taxes so they have an excuse to attempt to make their lives harder       lol if youre so innocent why dont you like being falsely accused of a crime
  if they are innocent how are they getting audited  do you not know how audits work anon  they look into your records themselves before they formally dedicate irs agents to carrying it out
  if they are innocent how are they getting audited  so far theres no proof anyones being audited thanks to this stupid crusade also you can get audited and the irs can determine that there was nothing wrong a lot of the time an audit is just the irs asking you a couple questions through the mail and thats it
  so far theres no proof anyones being audited thanks to this stupid crusade  it will take months you digus audits are slow    also you can get audited and the irs can determine that there was nothing wrong  yep thats my point anon   there is a whole process for this shit   so all these whores freaking out over nothing is stupid all they need to do is pay like 3040 of their income and then they are legit and its not a problem
  it will take months you digus audits are slow  youre the one who said they were being audited    there is a whole process for this shit   so all these whores freaking out over nothing is stupid all they need to do is pay like 3040 of their income and then they are legit and its not a problem    yeah this thing is something the workers dont need to worry about i already said that nothings gonna come from it     but that doesnt change that these thotpatrol folk are hateful dumbasses trying to make other peoples lives harder
  youre the one who said they were being audited  huh its in the op you baka ass motherfucker    thotpatrol folk are hateful dumbasses trying to make other peoples lives harder  welcome to life dude its gonna be full of people like that until you die   id report you for 30 of proceeds too its a dog eat dog world man
  workers  hateful dumbasses  your emotional charge seeps from your post
do whores think they dont need to pay taxes
  not the one not recognizing the oldest troll reply in the history of the internet
  only literal faggots shitlords and shills do this id wager your a shill    its probably the same shill who endlessly posts / replies to himself in all the orange man bad reeeeeeee stuff
  yea they should cuck to the unconstitutional system and agency of the government same as everyone else    those ethots thot they would get by living under the federal reserve bank without paying wrong as an american i know a thing or two about cucking under my principles and founding documents and they should be debt slaves like everyone else no free rides in our utopia police state
  you are not smart
  apparantly
  id report you for 30 of proceeds too  then youd be a dumbass whod be better off playing the lotto    if the taxes penalties interest and other amounts in dispute exceed 2 million and a few other qualifications are met the irs will pay 15 percent to 30 percent of the amount collected if the case deals with an individual his or her annual gross income must be more than 200000  the irs also has an award program for other whistleblowers  generally those who do not meet the dollar thresholds of 2 million in dispute or cases involving individual taxpayers with gross income of less that 200000 the awards through this program are less with a maximum award of 15 percent up to 10 million in addition the awards are discretionary and the informant cannot dispute the outcome of the claim in tax court  the irs is looking for solid information not an educated guess or unsupported speculation  
  prove it show me their w2 forms oh you cant so much for speculation about their income
  if they pay taxes like they are supposed to it literally means nothing when they get reported
  says the guy defending tax evasion
this      all of this reminds me of citizens in china reporting each other for owning/distributing pornography hope your social credit goes up you incels uncle sam is grateful
  nice tripls its a new era where if you dont completely submit and bow down to your feminine overlords youre the bad guy
  you need seriously detailed information on a person to cause an audit trolling and anonymous tips do not cause audits
    incels  why do these roastie thots use their customers situation as a generic insult
  roastie thots  hello incel

  lmfao you are literally the same retard funding the thots guess what you are the incel
they were basically doing this to have a 100 clearance rate for the city    raimundo atesiano the former biscayne park police chief who directed his officers to frame innocent men for a series of unsolved burglaries admitted he wanted to appease community leaders and polish the villages property crimes record    even in a small village of about 3000 residents the pressure was just too much he said    when i took the job i was not prepared atesiano told a federal judge on tuesday i made some very very bad decisions    his apologies did not sway us district judge k michael moore who on tuesday sentenced the 53yearold former cop to three years in prison he allowed atesiano to remain free for two weeks before surrendering so he can care for his mother who is dying of leukemia  advertisement    in september atesiano pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge of depriving the three suspects of their civil rights because he and the officers charged them without a legal basis atesianos conspiracy conviction carried up to 10 years in prison    atesiano resigned from the biscayne park force in 2014 and previously worked as an officer for sunny isles beach hialeah and miamidade county corrections    atesianos sentencing ended an ugly chapter in biscayne parks recent history where allegations of racism  the three men falsely charged are black  tainted the police departments culture of law enforcement in the mostly white community    village leaders including police chief luis cabrera a former veteran officer in miami say they have reformed the department    over the summer three former biscayne park police officers who had worked under atesiano while he was the chief in 2013 and 2014 pleaded guilty to civil rights violations stemming from the false arrests of the three suspects     
all three excops cooperated with the fbi and prosecutors harry wallace donald tunnage and trent reichling in the hope of reducing their prison time    in august officers charlie dayoub 38 and raul fernandez 62 pleaded guilty that they falsified the arrest affidavits for a 16yearold black suspect for four unsolved breakins in june 2013 a month before thenpolice chief atesiano touted the towns 100 percent burglary clearance record at a village commission meeting in october judge moore sent each to prison for a maximum oneyear term    the charges against the teen were eventually dropped after the miamidade state attorneys office noticed the four arrest affidavits all used similar vague language  that the investigation revealed td employed the same mo and the homes had a rear door pried open    a third biscayne park police officer admitted falsifying arrest warrants for two men at the direction of atesiano during 2013 and 2014 those men were in their 30s at the time guillermo ravelo pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge that he violated the rights of the two falsely accused black men and used excessive force on a hispanic man during a traffic stop a different federal judge cecilia altonaga sentenced ravelo 37 to two years and three months in prison    in january 2013 atesiano ordered ravelo and dayoub to arrest clarence desrouleaux on charges of breaking into a pair of homes in biscayne park according to a factual statement filed with the exchiefs plea agreement atesiano told the officers to take desrouleaux into custody because there was reliable information that he had forged and cashed a check stolen during the course of a third home burglary according to the statement    desrouleaux 35 pleaded guilty and ended up getting sentenced to five years in prison he was deported to haiti in light of new evidence about his false arrest the miamidade state attorneys office threw out his wrongful conviction
also in february 2014 atesiano told ravelo that he wanted him to arrest erasmus banmah 31 for five unsolved vehicle burglaries despite knowing there was no evidence that he had committed the crimes prosecutors said in court records a couple of days later ravelo filled out five arrest forms falsely accusing banmah of the vehicle burglaries at five different street locations in biscayne park    related stories from miami herald miamidade prosecutors to review arrests in small town accused of framing innocent people the chief wanted perfect stats so cops were told to pin crimes on black people probe found expolice chief 2 officers framed teen for burglaries in tiny miami town feds saythe admissions of the three biscayne park officers to the false police arrests magnified the evidence against atesiano exposing not only his leading role in the civilrights conspiracy but also his lies to the towns leaders the police department reported clearing 29 of 30 burglary cases during atesianos tenure as chief but at least 11 of those cases were based on false arrest reports according to federal authorities    in the aftermath of atesianos indictment in june the miami herald obtained internal public records suggesting that during his tenure as chief the command staff pressured some biscayne park officers into targeting random black people to clear cases    if they have burglaries that are open cases that are not solved yet if you see anybody black walking through our streets and they have somewhat of a record arrest them so we can pin them for all the burglaries one cop said in an internal probe ordered in 2014 they were basically doing this to have a 100 clearance rate for the city    in a report from that probe four officers  a third of the small force  told an outside investigator they were under marching orders to file the bogus charges to improve the departments crime stats
how can a half black man be racist
while only one officer specifically mentioned targeting blacks former biscayne park village manager heidi shafran who ordered the investigation after receiving a string of letters from disgruntled officers said the message seemed clear for cops on the street    in the continuing fallout from the scandal miamidade prosecutors said they will review old criminal arrests in biscayne park during atesianos tenure in 20132014    atesiano was not charged with violating anyones civil rights because of their race his lawyers called into question any notion that random people were targeted for arrests or that race played any factor in the arrests of any individuals    quite the contrary atesianos defense attorney richard docobo wrote in court papers seeking a twoyear prison sentence he said the three men falsely arrested in 2013 and 2014 had a history of criminal activity in the suburban town north of miami    they were no saints dacobo told the judge on tuesday    the judge still gave atesiano 36 months in prison  three more than what the government had asked for
  meant to quote 
  its terrifying to hear about this type of thing because it makes you wonder how many other innocents have been falsely accused /pol/ likes to pretend cop racism doesnt exist and that everything is our fault even when its been proven time and time again that police have no problems framing blacks if they cant solve a crime
  he allowed atesiano to remain free for two weeks before surrendering so he can care for his mother who is dying of leukemia  god damn that sucks    i guess if you dont want to do the time then dont do the crime but it still sucks
  hes white
  raimundo atesiano    no hes a spic
  im half black myself and twice as racist
  should be 30 years not 3
you can be halfblack and racist there are plenty of selfhating jews for example
  selfhating jew is used about 5 of the time to describe actual selfhating jews and 95 of the time to describe jews who arent zionists
  once again the white side works twice as hard
  racism and prejudiced/biased is two completely different things

just in case you cant be bothered to click on it    ahem          a cache of facebook documents has been seized by mps investigating the cambridge analytica data scandal    rarelyused parliamentary powers were used to demand that the boss of a us software firm hand over the details    the observer which first reported the story said the documents included data about facebooks privacy controls    damian collins mp later told the bbc that he believed the documents were highly relevant to his inquiry facebook has demanded their return    escorted to parliament  the documents were intercepted when an executive of us tech firm six4three was on a trip to london    in a highly unusual move a house of commons serjeant at arms was sent to the businessmans hotel and he was given a final warning and a twohour deadline to comply with the order    when the executive failed to do so he was escorted to parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered the paper said    the firm is involved in court action against facebook in the us where the documents were obtained through legal procedures      
  he cited wikileaks about five times a day in the final month of the 2016 campaign    during a questionandanswer session with reporters outside the white house on tuesday president donald trump was asked if he thinks wikileaks founder julian assange should be able to go free the president attempted to deflect the question with a bizarre rant about how chuck schumers daughter works for facebook    but a few minutes later the reporter tried asking trump about assange again this time the president claimed that i dont know anything about him really i dont know much about him i really dont      the questions about assange who has been holed in the ecuadorian embassy in london for more than six years come less than a week after news broke that the us government has filed sealed charges against him    i love wikileaks    trump may not know assange personally but its impossible to believe hes not familiar with his work    as thinkprogress documented in the final month before the 2016 presidential election trump mentioned wikileaks and the hacked emails it published at least 164 times during speeches media appearances and debates trumps own intelligence officials acknowledge russian hackers were responsible for obtaining emails from the dnc and clinton campaign that were later published by wikileaks      wikileaks i love wikileaks trump professed during a speech on october 10 and i said write a couple of them down lets see during a speech crooked hillary clinton  oh shes crooked folks shes crooked as a threedollar bill okay heres one just came out lock her up is right
during an interview that aired the next day trump told bill oreilly the press is hardly even talking about wikileaks you know that wikileaks is amazing the stuff thats coming out it shows shes a real liar    on october 21 trump told his audience at a rally that we love wikileaks wikileaks they have revealed a lot theyve revealed that there is a great hostility toward catholics they reveal a great hostility toward evangelicals    four days later at another rally trump said that a terrible wikileaks was just released moments ago which youll go home youll see it and youll be sickened by it and that she can get away with what shes getting away with    on november 2 trump claimed that wikileaks just came out with a new one just a little while ago its just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion probably illegal between the department of justice the clinton campaign and the state department you saw that    msnbc put together a supercut of trumps mentions of wikileaks during the final month of the campaign        trump has spent two years trying to walk back his embrace of wikileaks    after trump won the election but before he took office he tried to downplay the role wikileaks played in his win saying information published by assanges organization had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election    trump also tried to pin blame for the hacks of the dnc and clinton campaign on democrats thereby absolving assange of blame
but since he trump took office even his top intelligence officials have acknowledged wikileaks acted on russias behalf during the 2016 election and both cia director mike pompeo and attorney general jeff sessions aggressively pushed an investigation into assange according to a recent new york times report recently special counsel robert muellers investigation of the trump campaign for possible collusion with russia has reportedly honed in on the role longtime trump confidante roger stone may have played as a liaison between team trump and wikileaks    while trump professes ignorance about assange his campaign argued last month in a legal filing that wikileaks could not be held liable for publishing emails that were stolen by russian hackers ahead of the 2016 us election because the website was simply serving as a passive publishing platform on behalf of a third party in the same way as google or facebook the guardian reported    trump meanwhile still doesnt seem to accept that russia was responsible for hacking democrats just last week he posted a tweet asking why didnt the fbi take the server from the dnc they still dont have it  his baseless implication being that russia may not have ultimately been responsible for the dnc hack and that the fbi possibly helped democrats cover up that inconvenient truth    with his campaign still under investigation for possible collusion with russia and his top intelligence officials acknowledging that wikileaks was a key part of russias propaganda campaign on trumps behalf though its clear trump believes its in his interest to play naive about assange  however implausible doing so may be
  enough republicans are distrustful of wikileaks that they could form a coalition to overturn any pardon trump gives
  overturn any pardon trump gives  thats not how it works
trumps campaign manager meets with assange during the campaign  ruh roh
  you cant overturn a pardon pardons come after a conviction and double jeopardy protects against being charged for the same crime twice even if every american except trump hated someone that he pardoned in the courts they are completely bulletproof once a pardon goes through    thats why people were pissed justice kavanaugh kept dodging the question on should a president be able to pardon himself
  on the flip side the president can only pardon federal crimes and therefore cannot pardon state crimes thats up to the states governor this is why weve seen the mueller probe charges split between federal and state courts should the president decide to pardon someone he wont be able to pardon all crimes if any
fucking drumpf
  and this is why trump is pissed the judge is letting the case against trump and his family charity fraud case go forward since thats a state crime that he cant pardon his way out of
    mississippi sen cindy hydesmith posed for a photo wearing a confederate soldiers hat and holding a rifle in a facebook post that surfaced tuesday    hydesmith took the photo during a 2014 visit to the jefferson davis home and presidential library mississippi history at its best hydesmith exclaimed    davis was the president of the confederacy during the civil war and his former estate now includes a library and museum in his honor    i enjoyed my tour of beauvoir the jefferson davis home and presidential library located in biloxi hydesmith wrote this is a must see currently on display are artifacts connected to the daily life of the confederate soldier including weapons mississippi history at its best    the photo comes as hydesmith is under fire after saying during a campaign stop earlier this month that she would gladly attend a public hanging if one of her supporters invited her she is running against democrat mike espy who is africanamerican in a nov 27 runoff    president donald trump defended the senator tuesday dismissing her comments as a joke responding to reporters as he left the white house for florida trump said he was still confident hydesmith would win    she made a statement which i know she feels badly about it and it was just sort of said in jest trump said she is a tremendous woman and it is a shame that she has to go through this    hydesmith shared four photos from the museum visit including her posing in the confederate hat and other photos of her holding a rifle and sword from the museum    several companies including walmart have requested that their donations to hydesmiths campaign be refunded because of her public hanging comment which she said was a joke walmart donated 2000 to hydesmiths campaign on nov 18
sen hydesmiths recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates the retail giant tweeted tuesday morning as a result we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations        whats more the man hydesmith is smiling and posing with is reportedly a member of a white nationalist hate group    the facebook post first reported by politico included several photos from hydesmiths visit to the jefferson davis home and presidential library jefferson davis was the president of the confederate states of america during the civil war and fought to maintain the institution of slavery in america    his former home has been turned into museum celebrating the confederacy the museums gift shop sells such items as a book called the south was right and a flags of the confederacy coffee mug    and according to journalist judd legum of popular information the man smiling and posing next to hydesmith with rifles and confederate hats is greg stewart a member of a white nationalist group that fought to keep the confederate symbol on the state flag    legum noted that the group called free mississippi has been identified as a hate group by the southern poverty law center
republicans are racist traitors  more news at 11   back to you bob
joked about a lynching    except that never happened scummy race hustling shameful
  she would gladly attend a public hanging if one of her supporters invited her   youre right she not joking she was serious
based and redpilled
  theres literally nothing wrong with public hangings europeans attended public hangings for five hundred years
  just because something happens a lot doesnt make it good
  guillotine is good too    i like how the japs do it best they dont tell you when your execution date is thats a good way to instill fear into vermin
  theres always some people out there who could use some hanging
  you say that until youre at the end of the rope
    racism is bad  people still believe this
  child molesters murderers depending on cause violent rapists those who commit violent crimes resulting in a disability of the victim etc should all be hanged people who pose a threat to society on a moral physical and biological level should be removed from the gene pool and society if i raped a child or murdered an innocent i would deserve death
  youd wipe out the right wing aka your side if you go through with that plan  need i remind you the republicans ran a pedophile last year for the senate
update on the racist republican redudent from mississippi    cindy hydesmith touts work with imaginary gop senator mixes up election date in disastrous debate      en cindy hydesmith rms is doing her best to turn a senate campaign in a state that president donald trump captured by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 into a close race  and tuesdays debate was no exception    hydesmith who was appointed to the senate in april after sen thad cochran rms stepped down over health concerns made headlines earlier this month when she joked about lynching at a campaign event    mississippi was the us state with the most lynchings of black people between 1877 and 1950  and hydesmiths democratic opponent mike espy is aiming to become mississippis first black senator since the reconstruction era    at least five businesses including walmart and att have asked hydesmith to return campaign donations in the wake of her comments    things didnt improve from there hydesmith was subequently caught on video advocating for voter suppression saying maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult for democrats that maybe we dont want to vote then a 2014 facebook post from hydesmiths account resurfaced in which she is pictured standing next to a member of a a southern poverty law centerdesignated hate group wearing a confederate soldiers hat with the caption mississippi history at its best    all of this is starting to make the gop very nervous about a potential repeat of last years alabama senate special election in which nowsen doug jones d defeated accused child molester roy moore r in a state that trump won by nearly 30 points in 2016    the race is definitely tighter than what it should be a top mississippi republican told talking points memo her performance has lately not been great
its unlikely that republicans are feeling any better about hydesmith after her performance in tuesdays debate with espy    over the span of an hour the gop senator cited an imaginary republican colleague asked for voters support on the wrong date and offered a cringeworthy nonapology for her racist remarks about lynching    in what was likely a reference to sen thom tillis r who represents north carolina hydesmith touted her work with south carolinas nonexistent sen tom thompson r    mississippis runoff election will occur on tuesday november 27 but someone might want to make hydesmith aware of this as after mentioning the endorsements of trump and bryant in her closing statement she asked for the support of voters on november the 22nd    mississippis runoff election will occur on tuesday november 27 but someone might want to make hydesmith aware of this as after mentioning the endorsements of trump and bryant in her closing statement she asked for the support of voters on november the 22nd    eighteen days after her racist remarks hydesmith meekly apologized to anyone that was offended by my comments before claiming that her comments were twisted and turned into a weapon to be used against me    eighteen days after her racist remarks hydesmith meekly apologized to anyone that was offended by my comments before claiming that her comments were twisted and turned into a weapon to be used against me    the republican senator also bragged about documenting every campaign contribution that her campaign receives even though she is merely following the law for political donations    the jackson free press ashton pittman noted hydesmith frequently needed to look at her notes while speaking      after the debate the mississippi republican skipped taking any questions from the media    hydesmith demanded that no press or audience be allowed at the debate
    will mississippians follow alabamas lead and put america first and vote the democrat in for the senate or will they put criminals and traitors over country and be the laughing stock of the country    signs point to the latter
  kill all the people no more problems
  sounds pretty based
  heritage not hate  
  their heritage is about hate though
  its more complex than that    their heritage is about being forced to assimilate millions of people who lived like feudal serfs into a society of freemen it took western europe 800 years to transition from feudalism to democracy what made the northern states think the south could do it instantly
  no its not
  the confederacy was about hatred and sedition nothing more and nothing less the dumb shits even manage to get the flags wrong and then cry theyre not racists or anything else when they get called out or even the outright brainwashing by the children of the confederacy during the crow era    fuck outta here with this shit      clearly it had nothing to do with their innate prejudices and hypocrisy it was just really hard for them they didnt do anything wrong 
  even lincoln though that blacks were an inferior breed of human being he just wasnt into the whole enslaving them business    100 of white people at the time were prejudiced against black people
  yes it is their heritage is about hate and treason  anyone who wears the stars and bars should be shamed
    you didnt even watch the video
  my heritage is a flag that supported treason and institutionalized slavery and racism  what theyre had an entire declaration denouncing freeing slaves and staying in the union the people didnt care about that they fought for themselves  and ill proudly fly it and defend statues erected during the jim crow era as propaganda  im also aokay with historical revisionism  bbbut thats not who we are were proud americans proud of treason   cletus shut the fuck up
  you know the american flag was one that supported treason too right  against the british  do you not understand why southerners thought they were fighting the second american revolution after they were invaded by the north
i much prefer the racism of kamala harris
  im proud of you mom  sam
  clearly it was about both issues im sorry youre too much of a fanatic to understand that
  thisisbaitjpeg
  i understand why those dumbasses did it they lost btw also every man had the chance to look at what their rich overlords were actually getting mad about and still willingly rebelled and fucking lost not only is the confederate flag not the actual flag of the fucking confederacy but if cletus and his inbred family would stop and actually learn about their history instead of being brainwashed i might actually find some sympathy in this case i have none we could agree on some things but we will never agree on the validity of their stance on the confederacy     by the by the south could have sought other alternatives it was literally give me muh human property or i throw a hussy fit and rebel against brother and kin while being the center for hypocrisy
  i wouldnt have gone to war with the north  that doesnt mean you get to dictate the values ff what their ancestors fought for  that guys family didnt own slaves they didnt give a damn about the slaves they werent in fort sumter and attacking the union they fought because the north invaded their home
   after they were invaded by the north  what is fort sumter
  treason is very clear cut because its only treason when you lose    america  winners  patriots   confederates  losers  traitors  they want to celebrate not only being traitors but losers shame more confederate statues werent torn down  every time one is toppled is another win for true america
  after they were invaded by the north    the war started after a completely unprovoked attack on fort sumter by rebel soldiers        america did not attack until they were attacked first
    see    i clarified what i meant by my post
  they fought because the north invaded their home  i really wish the children of the confederacy were hanged for what they did to the actual children of the south
  betray the united states  attack them fort sumter  get their shit stuffed like the retards they were  bwah war of northern aggression  sherman should have burned it entirely to the ground and statues of him erected all across georgia and the south
  betray  theres that word again
  on january 9 1861 when the first shots of the war fired by cadets from the citadel prevented the steamer star of the west hired to transport troops and supplies to fort sumter from completing the task after realizing that andersons command would run out of food by april 15 1861   emojithinking/emoji
    i didnt realize there was millions of people in that fort
  moving goalposts beyond the realm of reality
  yeah thats not what betray means
  i am not  read what i said ive been consistent his family did not open fire from fort sumter his ancestors did not own slaves or care about the slaves im not moving the goal posts i am repeating the same thing over and over again
  commiting act of war against government   ignoring and rejecting government   not a betrayal  ill never understand peoples infatuation with idiots and losers       so let me get this straight  cletus iii has no ancestral ties to the south or the actual cause of the war  yet he still flies the wrong flag completely ignoring all cause and effect all of history and the actual fucking words of the confederacy  is this the power of inbreeding woah    the best part about this is you outright implying that southerners were too illiterate and inept to read the declarations of the confederacy and understand it and too gullible to not fall for propaganda or fight a war they according to you didnt want to fight and had no connection to other than protecting dey homes      which is even funnier because their government started it    god damn im so glad these fucking idiots lost
  this they might not be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors but theyre fucking idiots if they think celebrating their ancestors sins is a good idea especially when those sins include systematic racism slavery and treason
  he has ancestral ties to the south  98 of the confederate soldiers were not in fort sumter nor were they slave holders
no white person in mississippi is going to see holding a rifle at a mississippi historical museum as more detestable than blatant race hustling for power this is another democrat loss
  as someone from louisiana i can tell you theres more to southern heritage than the civil warshe looks like a damn meth addict
  sure but if you want to honour your ancestors you should
  southern poverty law centerdesignated hate group  lady is a piece of shit but so are the splc
  no i dontsherman left lsu to fight for the unionnot everyone who was a confederate supported the confederate government who led them to slaughter over there right to own slavesyou shut the fuck up about the dead and let them rest in peace you dont get to tell me how to honor my ancestors you cocksucker
  different louisianian here my greatgreat grandpappy was a union cavalry general he probably had your ancestors killed
  honor the worst aspect of your ancestors where they betrayed the united states over slavery and got their shit kicked in  dont you have something better to be proud of
  good for him  i hope you honour him and his service to our great nation  civil war is brother against brother both should be honoured as theyre both american veterans
  you have a juvenile sense of american history recommending you read more
  you have no grasp of american history recommend you pick up a history book
  you have no grasp of history period
  says the person who thinks the confederates werent the traitors
53 reporting with cindyhyde 12 points ahead
  reminds me much of that guy at some nearby school who threatened to shoot it up turns out he was nonserious and was probably blowing steam but hes 18 and has a felon which stinks cuz he wasnt that bad of a guy usually
you can stop posting now guys democrat loss republican win no need to feign outrage
  good sturdy hold of the senate this shitty false narrative had zero purchase completely needless
    it just means alabama can lord over mississippi and it shows that racism is alive and well in the south then again racism is alive and well across american given how racist trump is and how the republicans just roll with it
    i agree with many of the things trump supports but unfortunately hes on the side of america that simply hates racial unity more than the other
  your grandaddy sucks cocks in hell cracker
  christ you ameritards and your partisan politics do you realize how fucking stupid you look to the rest of the world or are you so devout in your political affiliation that looking retarded matter as long as you vote democrat or rep
  why is america so cucked one part of the population rises up in rebellion declares independence declares war on the united states and loses the united states then allows the former rebels to continue making uniforms flags and say shit like south will rise again and openly threatening war again
  hes screwed

    things got heated in portland on saturday as leftist antifa groups clashed with police and himtoo rally participants    the himtoo rally organized by portland resident haley adams as a way to highlight false accusations against men in light of the metoo movement was reportedly attended by around 40 people including some affiliated with the rightwing patriot prayer group    men too can be abused men too can be lied about men too have the right to a fair trial the group wrote on its facebook event page
  and ofc we dont hear anything about it cuz its a man  but the fb group is right men are humans too
dailycaller  not a reporter or news
portland  not even surprised
we need to round up those antifa fellas in our f150s and tell them what america is really about that if i want to shove things up my ass its my right
  joking aside it is your right antifa are fucking scum and deserve a bullet
  yeah i know the feeling    i hate living here i miss living in minnesota
antifa are a very violent group especially to those whose opinions they disagree with whats with that
  communists and anarchists are typically known for being naive violent spergs
  stereotyping antfia as communists   lol stupid
  you didnt deny the anarchist bit
  they are literally what they claim to be against
        antifa arent one group stupid rightwingers
  yes theyre called antifa
  nope theres no uniform you cant join it theres no one leader get your facts straight genius
  everything you posted is wrong are you trying and failing to gaslight me
  ok prove me wrong who is the leader tell me
wtf guys why i cant post a pic and since when /news/ came back
  antifa are heroes
anarchists need to hang
  nope only white supremacist losers
its like im really living in the weimar republic how progressive
  well good news if the us is the neo weimar republic then you know what happened after that historically something beautiful
what is this faggot group about anyways some kind of communist retards
  you guys will never be as badass as antifa
  purportedly fighting against fascism   realistically smashing private property as a means to satisfy their own desire for revenge against the perceived slights of the state     there are a startlingly large amount of communists in antifa but only because poor stupid uni students make up a large percentage of participants
  george soros barrack obama and hillary clinton
  lets move there im down in sc
  and you must be alex jones to actually believe that
failycaller  we dont allow shareblue why do we allow this
  explain to me genius why a billionare would support a group of anarchists
  street cred maybe  anyone else would just get a tattoo but when youve got that much money
  something beautiful  what exactly though the destruction of europe   a war that killed 55 million civilians    dresden 
  wow youre really that stupid
  yes anon rightwingers are always total chumps
  muslims arent one group either yet they all share the same sick ideology
  wrong
  they think they dont but get radicalized in an instant when confronted with a true scholar of the quran
  talking out of your ass about stuff you dont understand
  they think they dont but get radicalized in an instant when confronted with a true scholar of the quran  sounds like a rightwinger
  neither are most of the antiblumpf shitposts
    theyve beentriggered
  because antifa are useful street muscle to keep genuine populist threats from organizing       antifa are lumpenproletariat used by the upper class to keep the middle class from revolting
  dorightwingers wear a uniform
    thought /news/ could do with something that mattered instead of another political attack post
  so does this  have anything to do with it
  not sure anon but they are having continual aftershocks it was a 70 with after shocks as strong as 58 i guess we will see
  dont be coy op this is clearly alaskas protest against trumps climate change denial
/
  alaskan here quake woke me up at 830 in the morning its 1230 and were still getting random aftershocks is that normal
  1230 am i meant
  nothing you could do even if it wasnt normal anyway so why even ask
  is that normal  yes unfortunately
  not normal at all have you tried to turn off and on again your tectonic plate
  that was my first guess but im still getting the same behavior after trying it /
  genuinely kekked at this 
a man shot and killed by police in an alabama mall on friday was likely not the suspect who had just shot two other people in the shopping plaza according to local reports    emantic fitzgerald bradford jr 21 was running away from the scene of the shooting at the riverchase galleria in the birmingham suburb of hoover at about 10 pm when he was fatally shot by police    bradford had a handgun and was involved in the altercation that led to the shooting of a 12yearold girl and an 18yearold man but he likely was not the person who fired the rounds that struck the victims alcom reported    new evidence now suggests that while mr bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18yearold victim hoover police capt gregg rector told the newspaper    
bradford was running away from the shooting while holding a handgun according to the report he was shot after being confronted by responding police officers    police previously told reporters that bradford was the suspected shooter of the two victims they walked that claim back friday evening saying the investigation determined otherwise    we regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate but new evidence indicates that it was not rector said we remain committed to maintaining the integrity of this investigation helping determine the facts involved      bradfords family have not publicly commented on his death
mall shooter still at large         authorities mistakenly thought emantic fitzgerald bradford jr fired the rounds that left an 18yearold and a 12yearold hospitalized hoover police spokesman capt gregg rector said in a statement    police initially said bradford opened fire after an altercation with the 18yearold and an officer fatally shot him as he fled the scene but late friday police changed that story saying that while bradford was involved in some aspect of the altercation and was armed with a handgun he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the two others    we regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate but new evidence indicates that it was not rector said
police altercation involved more than 2 people    the error came to light after jefferson county sheriffs office investigators and crime scene experts spoke to witnesses and examined evidence police said    investigators now believe that more than two individuals were involved in the initial altercation rector said this information indicates that there is at least one gunman still at large    the officer involved in the shooting is on administrative leave pending an investigation police said
the jefferson county district attorney informed hoover police friday that the alabama law enforcement agency will take over the lead role in the shooting investigation from the county sheriffs office rector said hoover police will assist and cooperate fully in that inquiry and will conduct an internal but separate investigation of the officerinvolved shooting he said    the shooting at alabamas largest enclosed mall happened shortly before 10 pm 11 pm et thursday  police do not know how the confrontation began but dont believe the 18yearold who was hurt was armed they said a gunman opened fire shooting the teenager twice in the torso according to police    an armed hoover police officer who was working security at the mall then confronted an armed man running away from the scene and fatally shot him authorities said    a 12yearold girl described by police as a bystander was shot once but its unclear by whom rector said both of the injured were taken to hospitals
according to shaun king there is video of the police refusing to call for aid to bradford after shooting him will look for confirmation
  thats typical after a police shooting and no one cares what talcum x has to say
the only thing that can stop a good guy with a gun is cops
  wait typical as in behavior or something theyre supposed to do i cant think of a reason for why you would want your suspect to bleed out or suffer a major health problem doesnt that complicate the case and the aftermath
dude nobody needs guns except police   dude why did the police shoot this guy he was just helping out  leftist doublethink
  the question we should have been asking is where the hell was the communication
  murrican cops shoot to kill if the target survives it is problematic and may lead to unnecessary investigations
common advice is not to have a gun in your hands when the police arrive typically theyre pumped up on adrenaline and going in with shoot first mentality unforentally this advice isnt commonly taught
what exactly does involved in some aspect of the altercation mean  are they implying that he was an armed assailant or was he an arned good samaritan trying to stop the actual shooter
  it could mean both its intentionally ambiguous could also be he was just defending himself
i live in hoover myself so many people protesting i have a feeling more will be there tomorrow after church the whole good guy with a gun thing only seems to apply if you are white
  probably means theyre not sure or trying to leave it ambiguous to make themselves look better in light of the new info that he wasnt the shooter
            green texting moron
  and to compound the problem the gradual relaxation of holding law enforcement responsible for their actions they know that they can shitcan their training and just shoot to kill and claim he had a gun so much for assessing the situation before reacting /
  or just plant drugs on you         then literally get away with it
    hoover police cant seem to get their story straight on why an officer killed a man at an alabama mall    first they said a 21yearold suspect shot and wounded two other people then they said emantic bradford didnt pull the trigger but brandished a gun now weve learned bradford didnt necessarily do that either  all the while the real assailant who opened fire at the mall is still on the loose  heres a quick breakdown of shifting police narrative    thanksgiving night  police report a shooting  hoover police reported a shooting thursday night at riverchase galleria mall an upscale mall south of birmingham    friday morning  police say the suspect was killed    police said two men got into a fight at the mall and one of the men shot the other twice in the upper body    two uniformed hoover officers working security at the mall were nearby police said    while moving toward the shooting scene one of the officers encountered a suspect brandishing a pistol and shot him police said in a statement    they identified the slain suspect as a 21yearold from nearby hueytown  the other man who was shot at the mall and a 12yearold girl struck by a stray bullet both survived
friday night  police say bradford probably wasnt the shooter    hoover police identified the man killed as emantic bradford jr they said bradford fled the shooting scene while brandishing a handgun and an officer shot him    but bradford probably wasnt the gunman who shot and wounded an 18yearold man at the mall police said they said the alabama law enforcement agency is now taking the lead on the investigation    new evidence now suggests that while mr bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18yearold victim hoover police posted on facebook    investigators now believe that more than two individuals were involved in the initial altercation this information indicates that there is at least one gunman still atlarge who could be responsible for the shooting of the 18yearold male and 12yearold female police said    we regret that our initial media release was not totally accurate but new evidence indicates that it was not
monday morning  police we can say with certainty mr bradford brandished a gun    four days after the shooting hoover police and the city of hoover offered their condolences to bradfords family  but insisted that bradford brandished a gun    we extend sympathy to the family of emantic j bradford of hueytown who was shot and killed during hoover police efforts to secure the scene in the seconds following the original altercation and shooting a joint statement from the city and police department said    we can say with certainty mr bradford brandished a gun during the seconds following the gunshots which instantly heightened the sense of threat to approaching police officers responding to the chaotic scene    bradfords parents said their son had a permit to carry a weapon  hoover police said the officers body camera footage is now in the hands of the alabama law enforcement agency its not clear if or when the alea will release that footage to the public    meanwhile bradfords parents told cnn they are distraught that police still hadnt reached out to them almost four days after their son was killed by an officer    they havent told me anything yet nobody has responded said bradfords father emantic fitzgerald bradford sr we havent gotten no calls and no apology    later monday morning  bradford didnt necessarily brandish a gun    hoover police issued another clarification saying bradford simply had a gun in his hand    earlier we stated that mr bradford brandished a gun to clarify the word brandish was used because mr bradford had a gun in his hand as police officers responded to the active shooter situation between mall patrons    but to brandish  according to most definitions  means to wave or show a weapon in an aggressive or menacing way    bradford was actually trying to help people to safety when he was shot said his familys attorney ben crump    crump also said bradford had a permit to carry a concealed weapon
monday evening  the shooter is still out there    hoover mayor frank brocato said the state is still investigating the shooting including the search for the suspect who remains at large    he also said the city is in the process of requesting a meeting with the bradford family    the mayor and hoover police have urged patience as state authorities try to determine what happened the police department has referred cnns questions to the alea    but crump said the bradford familys patience is wearing thin    show us the video your words mean nothing to them crump said monday  crump said he believes the officer who killed ej  one of bradfords nicknames  rushed to judgment  the officer saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination that he must be a criminal crump said
tfw your town makes news  glad i stayed home to play vidya that night those deals are even less worth it now
  how cheap is it to live in alabama new york rent is absurd
  i moved from your neighbor state the vacation one rent is cheaper thats it work is fucking impossible though ive had and lost more jobs in the few months ive lived here than the entirety of where i moved from id take it over ne and nes winter especially    but more to your point 1100 will get you a cool apt in a gated community in one of the nicest parts of town and the actual city itself is really quiet hoover is like the more modern strip mall area but the whole metro area is like a donut ring around the main city so you have all kinds of stylings of places to live and shop etc also indoor ranges are everywhere for some reason if you ever wanted to shoot a gun    just make sure you have a job secured in writing before you move
you just need a good guy with a gun guys  an armed society is a polite society
and people wonder why black lives matter is a legitimate activist group still
  i have some problems with them but they are needed yes
  nah the og black panthers are blm is a puppet stolen by campaigners none of their original scope or aim is even known now
  its regional and was never a organized movement no matter how much the media tried to paint it as such
  the whole good guy with a gun thing only seems to apply if you are white      yea pretty much open carry is a white privilege
  im going to use a tragedy to push my political agenda  why are democrats so shameful
  im a registered independent voter and i voted republican in the last election instead of trying to point fingers at the other side republicans and democrats are literally two heads on the snake try to realize some people are smart enough to see outside the rigged political game im not pushing any agenda here im just pointing that if you own a gun and are not white people or more importantly cops will see you as a threat rather than a citizen exercising their 2nd amendment rights     even with this hostile political environment and all these shootings i stand firmly behind the 2nd amendment but as a black man i know that i can only use my guns for home defense because i risk being considered a suspect if i use them to defend myself outside of my property there was a literally a case not too long ago on this board where a black armed security guard was killed by police arriving on scene for restraining a suspect you dont understand whats like to be told you have all these rights to defend yourself but know at the back of your mind they dont apply to you because of the color of your skin
  black panther  the guys who policed cops  the guys who gave food to poor kids  yes please bring them back    exactly thats why i always cringe when i see people point to one thing one group of blm people did and use it as evidence that the whole movement is rotten fucks sake blm is literally a hashtag its not like its an organization with a large interstate hierarchical structure
  this but unironically
  independent voter using dnc talking points and anecdotal evidence   wow im totally convinced youre not a shill
  if you opinions arent the same as mine youre a shill      neck yourself
  it must be tough to live with that kind of retardation
  shiablue shoo
  earlier we stated that mr bradford brandished a gun to clarify the word brandish was used because mr bradford had a gun in his hand as police officers responded to the active shooter situation between mall patrons  you cant make this up
  your position is that him having a gun would have prevented them from shooting him
  because its alabama and the police are racist so they saw a black man running and killed him  its not double think when its the police that need to be reformed since their slogan is protect and serve not what the fuck are you looking at
  as i just learned he was shot in the back three places including the back of the head
  the police dont need guns as their standard carry either    but at the very least even if you dont do anything about your toxic police culture reducing civilian gun ownership would reduce their macho paranoia and the excuses they can use to protect themselves from murder charges
  sure well just run them over instead like the uk
  federal law defines brandished as with reference to a dangerous weapon including a firearm means that all or part of the weapon was displayed or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person in order to intimidate that person regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person accordingly although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible the weapon must be present 18 uscs appx  1b11  whats made up
  well typically if someone has a gun thats when the police think twice about it
  lower the iq bar for niggers and spics can get in  discriminate against intelligent people wanting to join  its all retarded rednecks nigger spics and women  wonder why police shoot first ask questions later  thats liberal policy for you
   civilian gun ownership  no and fuck you second amendment rights are nonnegotiable besides the actual problem is felons using straw purchases to acquire firearms in the first place thats part of what fuels the endless cycle of niggers shooting each other in the back of the head over drug money
  second amendment rights are nonnegotiable      this is why mass shootings and unjust killings in america will never ever stop
dindu nuffin
  in order to intimidate that person
  he thinks the majority of gun crimes are committed with legally acquired firearms
  actually every right is negotiable this is what you 2a chucklefucks just cant seem to understand for some reason for every other constitutional right there are exceptions free speech libel and slander fire in a theater example right to vote felon disenfranchisement which i disagree with right to protest violent protest is disallowed right to practice religion ritual sacrifice is disallowed etc but for some reason whenever the 2nd amendment comes up any and all restrictions are forbidden
  youre acting as if your right to own and/or carry firearms doesnt come with a million limitations already
  he thinks that people legally own guns dont also illegally own guns    im a supporter of the 2nd amendement but to say that its nonnegotiable is throwing any chance of solving the gun problem in america the fact people in texas think the answer to school shootings is more guns in school is fucking retarded a lot of the people who own illegal guns arent just drug dealers and felons a lot of times they are just regular people who buy second hand weapons or modify there own weapons beyond what statutes allow i dont care if people own guns but gun nuts need to be open to solving the issue instead of immediately screaming muh second amendment every time a proposal is brought up       gunfags are frequently against public healthcare which might keep some of these nutcases locked up or at least screened gun regulation which would stop nutcases from getting guns and limiting the types of guns these people can get the goal is to solve the shooting problem with less violence not more
  no im not i dont know how you got that impression from my post you must be retarded    this they say its a mental health issue but are vehemently against any mental health solution proposed by liberals restricting the mentally ill from getting guns free healthcare methods to reduce poverty and homelessness its like they dont actually want to solve the problem
neverending story of nra and gunnuts not allowing tougher regulations on guns is happeninh itt i dont know why people bother every single time is people screaming you cant change the second amendment1
soros puppet beto gets dissed hard       washington  for all the buzz beto orourke has gotten about a possible white house bid since his near miss against sen ted cruz this month some democrats are also starting to scoff if orourke couldnt win in his home state this line of reasoning goes how could he hope to beat donald trump in 2020  if beto orourke wants to go and run for president god bless him he should put his hat in and make his case but he lost you dont usually promote a loser to the top of party chicago mayor rahm emanuel said thursday on msnbc becoming the highestprofile democrat yet to air doubts about the excitement swirling around el paso congressman on thursday a report surfaced that the youth wing of the new hampshire democratic party has invited the texan to meet voters in the state that hosts the first primary of 2020 the orourke camp hasnt responded  iowa democrats have already expressed interest in getting a glimpse some even mistakenly thought they had a few weeks ago prompting comparisons between betomania and beatlemania    
  yeah which is why america elected trump
    i always like it when the shill says a vote for a third party candidate is a vote for putin     if the democrats stopped trying to run marxist wankers they might get some party defectors back
beto what a joke
  kek
    shareblue not trying to bury this one is surprising
beto lol
beto more like beta    zing    owned this libtard epic style
  no we should get more third party voters    get the reform party back going like in 96
  zanzibar    lol
  no we should get more third party voters  get the reform party back going like in 96    i think moderate dems need to rise up and kick all these tranny loving antifa flag waving diversity obsessed leftist pernatriggered pussy hat wearing weenies out of the party
   if orourke couldnt win in his home state this line of reasoning goes how could he hope to beat donald trump in 2020  donald trump lost his home state though and hillary won her home state

  do you think democrats look to rahm emmanuel as some sort of national leader    i doubt most even remember who he was
  you know who lost his senate race only to be elected president abraham lincoln    bobby beto could be our very own justin trudeau get your pussyhats ready
  the us system is broken so we should continue voting exclusively for people who want us to have a broken system
    and you thing bobby beto is more than a poser
    bato/bito/beto/buto aint no jack kennedy
  you should tell all your friends to vote for libertarian or other third party candidates instead of republicans in 2020 if you think thats the case       moderate dems  aka liberal republicans aka dinos  the pendulum is swinging back after republicans shoved everything to the fringe right
  the pendulum is swinging back after republicans shoved everything to the fringe right    so that means the left has to go full pussyhat i dont buy that  someone in power on the left is reaching

    authorities in the indian state of goa are encouraging farmers to adopt cosmic farming by chanting vedic mantras to their fields for 20 days in order to improve the quality and quantity of their crops without the help of chemical fertilizers    promoting organic farming is definitely commendable but the approach of goas ministry of agriculture is questionable at least according to several news reports authorities in the indian state are currently promoting cosmic farming as an alternative to conventional agriculture this requires farmers to chant vedic mantras to their fields for 20 days which is supposed to help attract the energy of the universe into the field and help the seeds sprout faster and ultimately provide better yields    the agriculture department wants to tread the path of organic and ecofriendly farming it has been holding talks with propagators of cosmic farming and other believers of similar activities which can increase the farm yield in an organic way goas agriculture director nelson figueiredo told reporters as part of this a farmer needs to spend at least 20 minutes a day chanting the vedic mantra for 20 days in his farm the believers of cosmic farming claim that mantra draws the energy of universe into the field and helps the seeds to sprout better and gives quality yield    the states agriculture minister vijai sardesai is just as enthusiastic about the benefits of cosmic farming claiming that it eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers    cosmic farming will give you safe food without any chemicals or fertilizers under this type of farming no chemical is put on paddy and it will be grown with organic manure only sardesai said    
sardesai and figuiredo recently visited guru shivanand in gurgaon in haryana the promoter of shiv yog krishi to better understand cosmic farming    but wait it gets better apart from cosmic farming goas government also has plans to promote ecofarming with the help of yogic farming agriculture officials have been keeping an eye on the sustainable yogic farming project of the rural development wing of the brahma kumaris an international spiritual organization based in rajasthan and they seem very impressed    they brahma kumaris claim that over 1000 farmers in india are combining organic farming with meditation and it is showing remarkable results director figueiredo said adding that goa farmers are already being educated on how sustainable yogic farming can lower costs and help the environment    in a time where science and technology play a huge part in agriculture goas reliance on cosmic and yogic farming may seem shocking to a lot of people but lets not forget that this is the same country that only a month ago announced an optional engineering course that teaches students that modern inventions like aeronautics batteries as well as knowledge of gravity existed in india during the vedic age thousands of years ago
  this actually has a basis in science plants are affected by sounds to some extent and it determines how well they grow

psychiatry is pseudoscience but it says something how thousands of people tasked with studying the human experience who were bound to make some accurate conclusions decided that magical thinking is fucking retarded there was a time when rape theft and murder in the name of the church was the norm and you could be like omg john the baptist just talked to me he said we need to rape murder and steal luckily if you do that today you get thrown in a mental hospital i hate joe roganstein but one of the funniest things ever was when mike pence came up and he was like this dude believes in fucking demons yes you can refer to bad people as demons yes there is the possibility that other advanced species exist yes aliens could have created us the reason i know religion is bullshit and a dumb cult is because i am from the same source as everyone else so why would i worship myself or somebody who is me experiencing reality at a different time even the idea that they are this strong guild of pure saviors is proven wrong by how disgusting these people are and how jesus gives rednecks new ford f150s but then jesus decides to take a break from saving the world when that redneck is raping his daughter in that f150 get this gay shit out of my fuckint face im god but at least i dont make people worship me
  the best part is i love listening to these chants like om thats because its fucking hypnosis to ground yourself you could say fuck shit cunt to ground yourself too fuck religion
    im gonna need a source on that
  does this help them allocate shitting streets or graph the scat
  psychiatry is pseudoscience    thank you for reminding everyone of this  psychiatry is a huge fucking sham
  psychiatry is pseudoscience  no it isnt it most of the time works so therefore it isnt its not exact science but nothing involving humans is not an exact science just like economics
    prosecuting us attorney stephen mcallister told the wichita eagle he will recommend that barriss be sentenced to 20 years in prison providing he writes apology letters to police dispatchers and the family of andrew finch a 28yearold father of two who was shot by police who responded to the hoax call in december
  another not white terrorist
barriss should be dropped into the middle of the ocean as fish food
  will his conviction discourage other swatters
  no
  mulatto screech
  most swatters are dumbass kids that cant even consider results more than 1 link down a chain reaction so a consequence is not a deterrent   but he should go to jail regardless for being such a stupid asshole
  write apology letters to police  fuck that shit tbh the call was bogus but ultimately they still fucked up
what an ugly motherfucker
  this
  what about the officer who killed the guy
  he was just doing his job
the article about the shooting itself    open door to strange noises  be confused as fuck  officers shouting you down  officer thinks you might be reaching for weapon  get killed
  i wonder what it feels like to kill a civillian and get paid
not much justice in this story redbone should be publicly executed and the cop should have his trigger finger chopped off there has to be consequences for their actions
  my grandfather suffered intense guilt after world war 2 since he was well aware he was bombing civilians
  im sure he feels like shit over or
  im sure he does barriss made a phone call but of all the cops present hes the one who decided to pull the trigger because his helmet was on too tight    at the very least he should face resignation he made two children fatherless      following orders isnt an excuse hans  duhh barriss told us to do it blame him durhhh  this is your brain on american
i hope he enjoys getting sold for a cigarette
  providing he writes apology letters to police  if he never called us that guy would have never died say sorry   fucking hell
  hans  lol dont know much history do you
    looks jewish
  i look forward to hearing your well intentioned and sophisticated thoughts if you have any
  i was never into ass until i got into anime
looks like a nightmarish mutt from a wyatt man comic
  why would you assume hes german
  how could you possibly not know that anon doesnt think bootlickerkun is german have you never heard anything about the major events of the 1900s
  only if they include how he is going to get swatted in prison cant imagine other inmates being cool with someone calling the cops on innocent people
  yeah those rapists and wifebeaters will surely look down on him
    what a douche    people are so fugging weird
  this     okay his dude should go to jail but so should the officers that actually killed this man     they didnt have to kill him they did mostly because of incompetence
  no the reason he did it in the first place is because he didnt think he would be caught  thats the whole point
  not him but they actually do treat other people worse  youre expecting highlevel thought from rapists and wife beaters
  im betting at least a few of the cops were white though
  fuck wasting 20 years of resources on this piece of shit a bullet only costs a few cents thats more than enough for this smug asshole
  he looks like a mutt version of michael cera
  im glad i live in europe
republicans on tuesday expanded their incoming senate majority to 53 seats as incumbent republican sen cindy hydesmith handily beat back an insurgent challenge by democrat mike espy in mississippis special election runoff to become the first woman ever elected to congress from the state    with 75 percent of precincts reporting hydesmith had 340865 votes to espys 268455  a commanding margin of 559 percent to 441 percent according to state election officials    a representative from hydesmiths campaign told fox news that espy is scheduled to call and concede at 1045 et and that she will take the stage at her election party at 1105 pm et    
  lots of shill threads on /news/ crying about this lady being racist im glad it didnt affect the outcome of the election
  you mean all their complaining on the internet changed literally nothing lol you can watch her election party live on foxnewscom
  what a surprise white women the most priviliged people on the face of the earth
  watch foxnewscom  lmao why the fuck would i want to do that
  do you think all black people are on welfare
  its the only official tv news source for /pol/ppets outside of infowars and brietbart     this just means mississippi is still stuck fighting a war they lost over 150 years ago
  seething    lmao
  get necked /left/over say bye to your gay rights
  the ones that act like niggers most likely are    obviously not all blacks are bad but the majority are vermin who blame everyone else for their problems and lack introspection
    its a cultural issue more than a racial one inasmuch as the disproportionate numbers are caused by cultural infouence it just so happens that the majority of that culture is a particular race and quite possibly viceversa    which isnt to say there arent plenty of whites hispanics and probably asians who abuse the welfare system too
    im sure espy will play the race card aaaaaany time now
            whoaaaaaaaaaaaa you gained a grand total of two seats and lost everything else based republicans so this is what winning feels like
the white house is dropping its effort to strip cnn reporter jim acosta of his press credentials a defeat for president trump in his campaign against the news media     the reversal comes after the white house notified acosta last friday it may renew its attempts to revoke his press pass after a judges order restoring it expired the white house set a sunday deadline for acosta to object and said it would make a final decision by 3 pm on monday      having received a formal reply from your counsel to our letter of november 16 we have made a final determination in this process your hard pass is restored the white house said in a new letter to acosta     the white house correspondents association whca said the administration did the right thing in restoring acostas pass but criticized its new pressconference rules     for as long as there have been white house press conferences white house reporters have asked followup questions we fully expect this tradition will continue said whca president olivier knox adding the group had no role in crafting the rules    we will continue to make the case that a free and independent news media plays a vital role in the health of our republic     the development marked the end of a nearly twoweek long saga that began when the white house suspended acostas credentials on nov 7 following a contentious exchange with trump at a postelection news conference      several media organizations have scoffed at the white houses arguments saying that past presidents have all dealt with aggressive coverage without pulling reporters credentials      the decision to permanently restore acostas pass was surprising given the presidents reluctance to back away from a fight by most indications the administration was prepared to move forward with its efforts just hours before a final decision was announced     
very unfortunate considering how he acted im quite sure that all the people defending his actions do so because their political enemies condemn it which sums up americas political climate quite well 2bh
  there was nothing wrong with how he acted as demonstrated clearly by how shs had to doctor the footage to find an excuse to ban him that right there should be grounds for her losing her job
  he was being argumentative on purpose as is jim acostas schtick unfortunately you are probably too low information to be aware of that he even said i want to challenge you when he stood up a very interesting choice of words by the way its been confirmed that the video she posted was sourced from a 3 second gif that would had to have been downloaded and converted a gorillian times explaining the discrepancy thats only noticeable if you zoom in and slow down the video
  youre the white house communications director and you have two choices of video sources      widely available video that clearly shows precisely what occurred without being edited   an artifacted motionblurred gif with frames selectively stripped that originally came from infowars    which one do you use
  cant accost the acosta
  the premise of your argument is wrong the clip wasnt edited and neither did it originally come from infowars frames werent selectively stripped that doesnt even make sense and it does indeed clearly show precisely what she was talking about you are suffering from trump induced delusional paranoia
  no it wasnt  provides no proof  okay retard
  excellent rebuttal my /pol/ppet friend  not spoonfeeding me you must be lying
  you made the claim the burden of proof is on you
  so on one hand we have experts who work in the field who have reviewed the video and concluded that it was altered on the other hand we have this fag hmmm hard to know whose opinion i should trust more
      stop posting until you have a clue what actually happened
  the burden of proof is not on me because i have no obligation nor desire to spoonfeed you    you could only believe this if you have read 1 maybe 2 articles that claim it was altered apply yourself and have a little bit of intellectual integrity and you will find there are experts who say there is no proof of any editing
  just think if people who didnt have a clue were never allowed to post trump wouldnt have made it past the primaries
  thats not how the burden of proof works the onus is yours
  
  this is not a debate friend i have no obligation to do things for you i imagine you will continue to say im wrong without doing the research yourself
  frames werent selectively stripped that doesnt even make sense  the creation of a gif literally involves stitching frames together    excluding frames is selectivley stripping the
      heres a more recent article with conway herself admitting the video was edited    your move
  sub 100 iq politically engaged person is an equal authority on edited footage as a professor of digital forensics and the director of a national media forensics center   top lel
  sub 100 iq politically engaged person  you do know that she is the official spokesperson for the white house right
  top lel  speaking of people with sub 100 iq
  yes im well aware     not an argument
    kellyanne conway  white house spokesperson  the absolute state of /news/
  she is literally counselor to the president of the united states and draws a sixfigure salary from the white house for the job of speaking for it
  cant stop winning
one two three expert sources including the counselor to the president saying it was doctored    nah better double down no triple down    the absolute state of the right
acosta is an attention whore he will create a new drama so he can be removed again rinse repeat
  after how hard this backfired i doubt theyll attempt to remove him again trump fucked up hard
fascism    kek i wish
  this subject  this shitty nerdcore op picture  people still believe /news/ isnt occupied by bugmen from r/politics
  bullshit not doctor i saw it live accosta a asswipe unfortunately its not against the law to be a ass
  he was being argumentative on purpose  more like trump was being evasive in his answers and its a reporters job to get an answer also if youre crying about respect trump deserves none just based on how how he behaves
  this whole doctored footage narrative is really weak i have not seen evidence that the footage was manipulated in such a way as to make the action look more inflammatory    why not tell the truth i watched the footage what he did was fucking nothing why not say that why make up this whole the footage is fake narrative when the actual thing that happened was frankly insignificant    now if we want to talk about acostas behavior as a pattern it seems to me hes been a disruptive force going back a lot longer than this incident i personally dont see anything wrong with revoking an individuals press pass as long as the network they belong to isnt denied the right to send another reporter how is that wrong if a different reporter is allowed to take acostas place i see no infringement on freedom of press
  i have not seen evidence that the footage was manipulated in such a way as to make the action look more inflammatory  time for expert analysis      and finally      id agree with you if acosta was being genuinely disruptive but he wasnt he was called asked a follow up question the president basically refused to answer and acosta persisted for all of five or so seconds before someone tries to yank his mic    so apparently follow up questions arent allowed
   for expert analysis  wired  motherboardvice  conway states video was sped up not doctored to show something that didnt happen  acosta still very clearly putting his hands on a woman  r/politics should only be allowed one damage control thread at a time
  i just watched the sidebyside comparison of the two clips in the source you posted i see identical footage aside from one of them being far lower quality due to a lower frame rate which seems to very slightly accelerate the footage is that what people are talking about i saw another clip where they zoom and focus and reduce/increase speed for emphasis but its not like thats some deceptive attempt to pull the wool over the viewers eyes you can clearly see that editing has taken place what significance does that have    wheres the part where they edited it to look worse than what actually happened because im not seeing it are we just complaining about editing in general like i dont get it
  well see how well forbidding followup questions plays out for them considering the shitstorm that resulted from this acosta business with even fox news turning on the white house because they know it sets a bad precedent and would not be good for them when a democrat becomes president in 2020 i dont think this is going to play out well for them if they try it in the next briefing such a fucking dirty republican tactic to completely ignore the question and just say youre out of line even when its a good question    although the bigger problem here is that this was literally trumps third press conference since he became president the man constantly hides from the press because he cant help but put his foot in his mouth whenever he speaks to them
  yeah i just watched it this isnt the first time ive reviewed the evidence see      you can clearly see that editing has taken place i dont understand why that is significant the footage is the same its not like they cged acosta punching her in the face they showed what happened and edited for emphasis are we say that the emphasis is misleading because i watched the edited footage and i still thought it was practically nothing and it seems like from the reaction no one else was fooled by misleading doctored footage either so whats it really about then    so apparently follow up questions arent allowed  i mean typically in an interview or press conference the speaker has control over the situation and decides when to answer questions from who and when to end the interview has it ever not worked like that  trump said thats enough and so acostas time was up its really as simple as that  is it right thats for you to decide
  im failing to come up with precedent for the white house using edited footage to defend their position on something so yes that is bad even if the edit is minor
  failing to come up with precedent for the white house using edited footage  see this is a good reason why it might be considered significant  although the hyperfocus of our media and availability of information on the current administration is also pretty unprecedented even nancy thinks so    signs of the times i guess
  i think if reporting on trump wasnt so beneficial to the media he wouldnt have even come close to president the flipside of this is that it has made him easy to defeat in the next election because the constant coverage of trumps terrible decisions has made everyone completely despise him as the midterms proved defeating him in 2020 will be easy especially because its the primary voters who will be choosing the democrat candidate this time around not the superdelegates
  pretty much this    trump has proved quite conclusively that the 90s adage no such thing as bad publicity is wrong
  the reason thats true is all his followers are fanatics that dont care he could rape a baby on the white house lawn and his followers would defend it
  he was being argumentative on purpose  did you watch the entire press conference the president was being confrontational with many reporters from the very beginning do you think its okay for the president to treat reporters/journalists like trash
  for as long as there have been white house press conferences white house reporters have asked followup questions we fully expect this tradition will continue    oh you can count on that    just remember what comes around goes around
  the decision to permanently restore acostas pass was surprising given the presidents reluctance to back away from a fight by most indications the administration was prepared to move forward with its efforts just hours before a final decision was announced    dunno why trump pussied out on this he had all the advantages on his side
  its not against the law to be a ass    so now someone can behave like an asshole and harangue you in your own home and you cant throw them out of your house without a court order
  he doesnt own it as already talked about
  what comes around goes around  you realize its the other way around right the way you said it makes no fucking sense
  trump is notoriously a pussy runs away from all fights
      the flipside of this is that it has made him easy to defeat in the next election because the constant coverage of trumps terrible decisions has made everyone completely despise him    dont be so sure trust in the media in general is at record lows take that how you will dont underestimate the population of people who will simply do the opposite just because theyre being told what to do and people were talking almost wordforword like you are itt in 2016 and everyone was so sure that hillary was going to win and look how that turned out    im not saying youre wrong im just saying dont forget the past
acosta was preventing other journalists from speaking by refusing to allow other journalists who had been called on to speak he asked multiple questions and got much more time than any other reporter and even when other journalists had been called on stood up and prepared to ask questions acosta kept going and didnt sit down    he was being disruptive and stopped every other journalist from talking       its not edited to change the context the edit is a conversion to gif format that repeats a scene and zooms in on the incident to emphasize what aspect is being talked about
  but what was doctored  its doctored case closed  alright so what was doctored can you show me the original vs the doctored
  i see a bunch of libtrolls at it again here
  it is amazing how incompetent trump is acosta was clearly in the wrong for all the reasons you said but trump couldnt even restrict him imagine trump just said what you said inatead of the stupid shit about assult
  follow this thread    essentially the doctored aspect amounts to playing with the video speed and some zoom effects to emphasize the point of interest the kind of special effects you might find in a low level viral youtube clip
  because the way that it was sped up makes acostas action look more aggressive than it was moving your hand faster makes it hit harder its basic physics))) even the fact that the wh used edited footage is egregious in the extreme
  he was already found to be in violation of acostas 1st and 5th amendment rights plus he was using doctored footage even he could apparently see that he had absolutely no ground to stand on
  acosta was absolutely not in the wrong for asking followup questions after trump was being evasive its not acostas fault that trump cant take what he dishes out
there /pol/ppts in this thread who are denying reality and the facts that the white housed used forged evidence to suppress the 1st amendment      eat freedom and facts
  acosta was preventing other journalists from speaking by refusing to allow other journalists who had been called on to speak he asked multiple questions and got much more time than any other reporter and even when other journalists had been called on stood up and prepared to ask questions acosta kept going and didnt sit down  the person who spoke after acosta actually defended acosta and many other reporters didnt have a chance to ask questions because trump angrily told them to sit down while hurling insults if you watched the entire press conference and saw how trump was treating the press youd realize that many of the other journalists probably respected acosta for taking a bit of a stand because trump was acting like a pompous dictator
  it would probably just be more/worse ammo for cnn a waste of taxpayer money on a personal vendetta against cnn or some such
  no it doesnt thats just wait clickbaity tabloid news wants you to believe they dont actually look any different
  any news station against trump is clickbaity tabloid news  not exactly hiding your argument bootlicker
  who are you quoting
  your asspain
  they dont actually look any different  they do and the person who made the edit and posted a screen cap to prove he didnt edit the video unintentionally showed he added frames
  honestly i understand and i could see how you can see it that way i personally feel that the difference is so minuscule that in my mind it doesnt change what a nothing burger that it was he barely did anything to her and no footage ive seen makes it look like he did the only reason anyone cares about it is because theyre using that as a pretext to remove that particular journalist imo theres enough against this guy to be able to do this without the physical altercation the whole focus on this event is ridiculous and embarrassing for both sides
  he had all the advantages on his side  trumps hand pick judged not only ruled against him but outright said trump would lose if he continued to push it   someone managed to hammer it through trumps thick skull that he wasnt going to triumph if his entire plan was to take a giant shit on the 1st and 5th amendment    instead hes shifting to other ways to undermine the free press and the first amendment
  trumps hand pick judged not only ruled against him   actually this is false it cant be true because trump installed a bunch of partisan hacks into the government
  its the truth the judge was nominated by trump  and apparently even he wasnt about to throw away his dignity to defend trump
  sorry but youll have to provide some proof of that media man told me trump installed his puppet friends to the government not people who openly oppose him
  why are people still stuck on 2016 heard that again and again before the midterms you sound just like you did in 2016 and then the democrats fucking swept the midterms    2016 was a fluke and theres reason to regain that confidence now that people are awake the election wasnt lost because of people voting for trump it was lost because of people who did not vote at all people didnt think they had anything to worry about and they didnt show up what youve just seen in 2018 is people who realized they needed to vote    its like holy shit there was just a more recent election to show the state of this country why the fuck do people obsess over 2016 so much well i get trump doing it because it remains the only success he has ever had
  this 2016 was a fluke it will never ever happen again
fascist     kek the american retards from reddit and tumblr overuse this word    i grew up in a fascist country and it was nothing like this
  whitakers appointment
  ive lost how many times ive seen i grew up in a fascist country but never naming the country    tell me what country it is so i can know if youre full of shit
  and then the democrats fucking swept the midterms  yeah swept themselves under the rug no opposing party has lost more senate seats during a midterm since kennedy
  spain
  why the fuck do people obsess over 2016 so much  well i get trump doing it because it remains the only success he has ever had  bing bing bing /pol/ppets are going to celebrate their last victory even if they were just useful idiots of the russians just about every other campaign theyve been apart of was a failure the most comical one ive witness was their attempt to push russian made propaganda to affect the french election after the russians hacked macons campaign and dumped all his infomration similar to what they did to hillary but the kicker was they inserted forged financial documents where the russians didnt even bother to cover their tracks because the code of the files reveals it was made with a russia version of excel and it ended with french authorities contacting hiro and him forced to make a statement in his broken english persona pleading /pol/ to stop spreading the fake documents and making him criminally liable for their actions because of preelection laws where youre not allowed to talk about the election 48 hours before it happens                its the meddling and attack no one cared about because it failed
  no opposing party has lost one senate seat in the midterm i doubt it  inb4 hes a retard who still thinks he gained 3 senate seats
  democrats also picked up a seat in 2017 so from 2016 to 2018 there was effectively 0 change in the senate
  i think depending on whether they win or lose the mississippi race the number will be different though
    there was that mass fake bombing as well as a shooting at a synagogue just before midterms both events helped out the dems the blue wave was weak and dem support is much weaker than people think
  fake mass bombing  the absolute state the fascist right
  anything that makes my side look bad is a false flag
when will people stop going duh duh duh everyone i dont like is a fascist   acosta acted like a little fucking kid mu htrump whataboutism doesnt fucking change that
    i never said it was a false flag just that it helped the dems the blue wave was weak and it would have been even weaker if those two events didnt happen at such a beneficial time
  mu htrump whataboutism doesnt fucking change that  correct but if trump is going to act like a kid every day then he should be treated like one
  as you can see people forget spain exists
  his only crime was asking questions trump didnt like the only people who say he did anything wrong are all employed by fox news heres a tip stop watching that horse shit
  oh stfu all the cuck presidents before him were deep state fagits always speaking scripted bull shit its quite refreshing to see the trump man speak his mind  you fucking retard
  can you prove that
  its quite refreshing to see the trump man speak his mind  except when he gets a question he doesnt like in which case he avoids answering and instead berates the journalist
  makes claim    doesnt refute     takes no responsibility    gets pissy when people dont tale his comments seriously when he himself cant be bother    such retardation its overwhelming
  /pol/ppets were terrible at backing up their facts or thinking for themselves when they arent spoonfed cherrypicked data from reich wing think tanks to post
  which is assuming he even takes the question in the first place the man is a coward who rarely does press conferences because it would require him to face those difficult questions although as you said he gets away with not even answering them
  i never said it was a false flag  you specifically called it fake which we know is wrong and furthermore this is the strongest blue wave since watergate
thats what ive been saying all along dems can fight back without getting in the mud there is no reason to use the republican strategy and lie just use the truth against them they are so badly compromised that nearly all of them especially any of them in any kind of leadership position have comitted numerous crimes stick to the crimes and the crimes alone
  the problem is democrats do that and them make the flawed assumption that if you give people all the facts theyll vote in whats their best interest   republicans proved that theory is wrong because you just need to appeal to people emotionally meaning lie and slime away
  the thing is if they do that its just going to push away loyal democrats they really have to figure out a way to get nonvoters to vote lying just makes them think well everybody lies so why bother
  its entirely possible to appeal emotionally with facts    and i dont feel like the voting by emotion thing is consistently true 2016 was a poll upset but 2018 came out almost exactly as most polls predicted if not a little more blue    i think 2016 was a perfect storm of obfuscation mudslinging and being such a media circus that a lot of voters stayed home leaving behind the people who do vote emotionally who are in the great minority to swing the election    alright lemme rephrase emotional appeal worksfor republicans
  fascism is stripping fake news acosta of his press pass what i dont like is fascism wah wah wah the absolute disillusioned state of the new socialist communist left is laughable
  lol racist bigot homophobic xenophobe who uses this sort of non argument emotionally charged rhetoric as a means to shut down reasonable debate
  acosta have his pass revoked is fascism  treatment of people like assange snowden and manning are not  mmmmmm neocons
  triggered  calm down heres a pacifier
  all them committed crimesthey arent reporters
  all them committed crimes  government says exposing government crimes is itself a crime more at 11    they arent reporters  youre right theyre far better people than that
  nobody i have literally never seen anyone run on that sort of nonsense    i have seen people run on the immigration security or rather theyre sending us rapists and muh migrant caravans
its time to stop pretending there are two equal sides  there is the intellectually and morally superior side and then there are the right wingers  the right hates that we nprlistening coastal liberal elites are the winners in a servicebased globalized multicultural society because of our open worldview and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants they are seeing how america is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse and how nonwhite people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them  ive come to realize that much of american history is made up of periods where liberals drag conservatives kicking and screaming into the future then we try to compromise for a while then we go back to dragging  no conservatives were not going back to england  no conservatives were not making george washington a king  no conservatives you cant form your own country with blackjack and slaves  no conservatives you cant keep denying women the right to votes    no conservatives were not going back to the way things were before the depression    no conservatives literacy tests arent constitutional    no conservatives you cant deny homosexuals the right to marry      the names of the parties change from era to era but its always been liberals dragging conservatives against their will into a better future i grew up in one of the inbetween eras where we all thought that compromise was a possibility but im more and more realizing how mistaken i was about that its time once again for liberals and progressives to stop being nice and drag our country into the 21st century    the simple fact of the matter is that conservatives just arent offering any good ideas any more whats the compromise between we need to stop climate change and lol climate change isnt a real its like being in a group project with someone who didnt read the book
  how long did all that bullshit take you to write
  refute the fact that conservatives have always been a dead weight to america every step of the way    but mum democrats and republicans in civil war  liberals were the north conservatives were the south you cannot refute that no matter how much you try to scream technicalities
  i dont think anyone but conservatives are claiming both sides are the same
the triggering of /pol/tards on news when you call trump a fascist regardless of whether its in the article is so fucking funny
  the election night thread was a special treat
  the parties switched like 10 times  btw the sins of the father are the sins of the son pay up white people    its funny how democrat strongholds in the south from the 1800s are still democrat strongholds in 2018 but i guess the parties are in a constant state of switching you fucking idiot
  stop gaslighting
this thread is a perfect example of whats wrong with the political system today the us vs them mentality has been so instilled in everybody that you will turn a blind eye to bad behavior if that particular person is on your side meanwhile exactly the same level of behavior outrages you when it is committed by the other side    until all people start calling out dick behavior regardless of their affiliations society is doomed to continue being a complete shitshow
  if acosta had acted the way he did towards obama when he was in office he wouldnt have needed to put hands on someone to be banned from the wh his confrontational bullshit journalism would have gotten him banned
  people need to listen to dead kennedys more often
    president donald trump capped the thanksgiving holiday weekend by again expressing gratitude for himself and his administrations accomplishments    so great that oil prices are falling thank you president t trump tweeted sunday morning add that which is like a big tax cut to our other good economic news inflation down are you listening fed    the presidents post followed a similar selfcongratulatory sentiment he expressed thursday at his maralago resort in palm beach fla where he celebrated thanksgiving with his family    asked what he was most thankful for trump replied for having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country ive made a tremendous difference in the country this country is so much stronger now than it was when i took office that you wouldnt believe it    last sunday trump graded his presidency as aplus in a prerecorded interview with fox news chris wallace    look i hate to do it but i will do it i would give myself an aplus the president said on fox news sunday is that enough can i go higher than that        hes going to be so mad when people vote him out of office when hes doing an a plus job
look i hate to do it but i will do it i would give myself an aplus oh by the pink babby jebus this fucking guy
  i want this fuckers face to be smashed in so much
  to be fair his sins of pride were pretty well documented  
  says hes humble and does it in the most prideful way  gotta give it to trump hes going to check off all 7 deadly sins in decisive fashion before hes sent to hell

    brexit passes eu parliament but will almost certainly be rejected by uk parliament
what the europeans problems illustrate to me is that globalization is actually a natural process not some hifalutin ideal that is being forced on everyone else by people in power the reason there is so much infighting in the eu is that the origin of all of those countries is in times centuries ago when nationalities could mostly only coalesce within regions roughly approximating the average size of an individual european country due to technological and geographical constraints and the reason americans dont have these problems not to this extent is that america was founded much later allowing it to be a mostly cohesive society spanning nearly an entire continent granted im not sure what it would take for there to be a truly global society since the existing societies are pretty entrenched i imagine it will be much slower from now on but i think it will march on just as it has for centuries
  likely you will see conquest of whole continents until they are under a single banner then we will have intercontinental war which will finally lead to a merging of societies the only people to escape would maybe be the islanders since who gives a fuck about them and their minuscule resources this is all assuming that best korea russia the us iran or israel dont launch their nukes if they start losing which is an equally likely possibility    as for it happening through peaceful means without conquest no way in hell too many countries with warlords/despots in power for them to ever agree to step aside why do you think the un is so redundant and useless
  i suppose immigration was a failed attempt at doing it peacefully if people are the same everywhere and speak the same three languages or so everywhere then there is no reason to think of people in farflung places as other certainly not other enough to ever go to war with them its all just one planet and one species after all
this means they will have to vote on brexit one more time which basically means that brexit is off innit
  the deal has to be voted through parliament which is very unlikely after that since the eu has said they wont change it its either no deal or remain
  no deal im sure would mean at least a recession
  the only sane option is remain but do that and the herds of frothing retards who voted brexit will take revenge at the first opportunity    none of this wouldve happened if wed been allowed to vote on the maastricht treaty now were in too deep to just leave
  to clarify im referring to the retards who still think brexit or no deal is a good idea
  fascism defeated again get wrecked nazis more diversity now
  fascists cant win not because of ideology but because the global economy is now too far gone unless youre a fan of eating dirt
  but because the global economy is now too far gone  fascism can rise from weak economies like in germanys case and is pretty prevalent in africa even if they dot call it what it is
kek cnn came to mariupol to film how the locals are awaiting nato ships and support but locals tell they want good president president putin        
    russian opinion on this cnn shit    
tumbling down  tumbling down  tumbling down
why is /news/ such cancer
  i unno but i have to agree it has gotten a lot worse since the the 4channel thing that being said 4chan has always kinda been filled with trolls
    eastern ukrainians are effectively russians west ukraine is best ukraine    i know a guy who had an on again / off again long distance relationship with a smoking hot ukrainian chick in mariupol and she was a straightup putin puppet and believed everything he said she even insisted that the poles were planning on invading ukraine and turning them all back into mud farming peasants
  its just the daily /pol/ raid group they tire out in a few hours after they realize they cant spam their reddit created memes here
  /pol/ is responsible for the nearly constant leftist news obsessing over trump and polluting 90 of this board with the same inane bullshit over and over again  huh
  bug people from reddits /r/politics come here to vent about drumpf because that board moves too fast for them to have a proper echo chamber
last week the texas board of education voted to make a change to the states social studies standards that no serious historian would quibble with but is nevertheless controversial in the lone star state to teach that slavery was the central issue of the american civil war and not as previous standards had dictated a cause eclipsed by states rights and sectionalism camille phillips at npr reports the change is one of several to the curriculum that will be implemented in the 20192020 school year    standards previously adopted in 2010 were designed to play up the role of states rights and sectionalism and downplay slavery as the reason texas entered the civil war on the side of the confederacy slavery one board member said at the time according to the washington post was a side issue    while the boards democrats who first proposed the change in language in september wanted to update standards to elucidate the central role that slavery played in the civil war the republicandominated board succeeded in keeping states rights issues and sectionalism on as contributing factors for the civil war the resulting compromise according to the board will teach the central role of the expansion of slavery in causing sectionalism disagreements over states rights and the civil war    ron francis a high school history teacher in highland park calls the compromise wanting the lies theyre telling are a little smaller than the lies they used to tell as he puts it to kathyrn lundstrom at the texas tribune    during the meeting democratic board member marisa perezdiaz explained the root of the frustration saying what the use of states rights is doing is essentially blanketing or skirting the real foundational issue which is slavery  
republican board member david bradley was one of the leading voices behind keeping states rights in the curriculum each state had differences and made individual decisions as to whether or not to join into the conflict correct i mean thats the definition of states rights he said in the meeting    since 1917 when state law authorized the board which is often staffed by noneducators to purchase all public school textbooks it has maintained control of texas public school curriculum lundstrom of the tribune reports the boards standards have turned into a battleground for conservatives and liberals over what students should be taught    teachers will sometimes skirt these standardsfor instance one tells lundstrom that she teaches the reconstruction era the period after the civil war that set the stage for racial politics in the united states for the next century and a half even though it is not mandated however the voluntary nature of such practice guarantees that not every student will be taught it meanwhile the numerous topics that are included on standardized tests are not taught with the depth or nuance that they demand because teachers are forced to go through them in rapid fashion so as to cover all of the material needed to prepare their students to perform well on the state of texas assessments of academic readiness or staar test    in response to such criticism the board is working to streamline the states curriculum standards to give teachers a little more space to teach however some of what theyre editing out has also been criticized for instance as lauren mcgaughy at the dallas morning news reports the new curriculum still lists only one cause for the extremely fraught israelipalestinian conflict and it cuts out many historical figures including francis scott key who wrote the starspangled banner africanamerican poet phillis wheatley as well as several confederate leaders
under pressure the board voted to keep helen keller and hillary clinton on a list of notable americans that could be included in lessons though oprah winfrey barry goldwater and astronaut ellen ochoa got the nix the board also voted to keep in a specific description of the defenders of the alamo as heroic    while some of the issues here are distinctly intertexan battles over at the houston chronicle joanna perrillo explains that the curriculum decided by the school board also has national implications after all texas represents onetenth of grade school and high school students in the us and the textbooks written to texas standards go to other states as well
  republican  in favor of white washing slavery  im not surprised
  i am considering that democrats were the slave owning party and still treat blacks as their inferiors to this day
  right winger pushing the myth that political realignments dont happen  know your place son liberals were the north conservatives were the south  if the civil war happened with todays ideological control of the parties the democrats would be the north and the republicans would be the south
every great state falls eventually unfortunately
  im the son of nothing but northerners and people like you disgust me   you only want to cause more division in this nation rather than move foreward
november 19 2018    /news/ is not your ideological sounding board    this isnt news

  fallacy fallacy
  fallacy fallacy fallacy
it was technically both  the south wanted to separate and they thought they had a right to keep slavery slavery is the primary reason the separation and the rights are the secondary
  there is no man blinder than one who refuses to see
  you can literally flip the two and still be just as right for a good chunk of the confederacy   they required deals from surrounding provinces and werent getting them unless they joined
    states rights is and always was a bullshit reason remember how the south was against the north passing laws that protected run away slaves states rights that matter was the souths rights to keep slaves and it was an after thought to whitewash the reason for secession which was slavery
  there is no fag gayer than the one who is thee
  there is no man more deaf than one who refuses to hear
did the texas board of education finally get unfucked they had some real whackos in there for awhile  
  sadly no republicans won all the contested seats in the last election so they still have a bunch of brainwashed antiscience right wingers on the baord just not the batshit crazy ones like you listed
mark perry is on a mission to rout what he sees as rampant discrimination against men in higher education  perrys efforts are part of a larger push in recent years to challenge womenonly programs on college campuses by invoking title ix the law banning sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding the federal department of education has launched a slew of investigations into such programs perry argues they are not only illegal but outdated for years more women than men have graduated from college    i called it gender apartheid he said they had this prime space on campus where they were discriminating against half their student body    but kristin mapel bloomberg a professor of womens studies at hamline university says efforts such as perrys abuse title ix this is part of a longerterm backlash against gains women have made in education and the professions she said  enforcing equality on women is violent abuse    macalester says it simply rents space to a national program that puts on the camp st thomas said programs like its steps camp recognize that one factor in the shortage of women in engineering is a dropoff in interest in the middle grades    our hero is ending segregated diversity isolated inclusion deed equality blasphemic hate crimes original sin of privilege      
a worthy successor to milo hopefully he will go after segregated employee resource groups next   
  thank god
  milo  so when is he going to be caught diddling kids
  milo didnt diddle kids he was diddled as a kid    well i guess you cant rule out that he diddled kids but afaik theres no evidence
    good gravy  how is it that we need to bring in more refugees
  kek whats this dumb ass strawman in the pic also  conservative of color  is not a political ideology nor are several others in the list
  i think you maybe missed the point
  have you ever been to lebbit leftist subs in there unironically believe this
  judging an ideology based on reddit  shit man have you seen the donald its batshit but i dont accuse every trump supporter of being like them
  i dont know man the lefties in my family are pretty fucking nuts hardcore feminism  the works they pretty much think trump is a nazi thats what i see
  shut up you retarded nazi asshole
  i dont accuse every trump supporter of being like them  then you are the minority
  and the conservatives i know thought obama was literally the antichrist theyre the crazies not the majority as far as i can tell    this is a big claim do you have any evidence to support it
  thank god those countries arent able to walk here    i feel bad for them but like she said these things happen here   i guess you do what you have to do to keep your younger children going i cant agree or get behind it unless i experienced the same thing tho even then i cant imagine selling my child especially for 3000 paid over two years
  conservatives i know thought obama was literally the antichrist      that was a very small percentage of the population  the republicans did not hate obama as much as democrats hate trump  how could anyone even argue that
  yeah they did the republicans despised obama  and so what of course when one party is in power the other will shit on them  the democrats have more to work with because trump isnt republican light like obama and is instead a clown
  its not the same anon the average republican did not dislike obama any more than they disliked clinton  no president has ever been as hated as trump   not even close  this is new territory and you know it
  the republicans did not hate obama as much as democrats hate trump  total bullshit    the average republican did not dislike obama any more than they disliked clinton  bullshit people absolutes hated obama  no president has ever been as hated as trump not even close  provide evidence
    provide evidence  you provide evidence since you are the one making the crazy claim  any fool can see that trump is the most hated president of modern time
  youre making the original claim you short bus retard the burden of proof is on you
whats the difference between minarchists and libretarians
  minarchists are a subset of lolbertarians
  provide evidence  pull your head out of your ass sometime and youll get a clearer picture of things and im even a fuckign liberal for christssake
  its a specific flavor of anarchy  its even in the name minimal anarchist  minarchist  unless if you claim that anarchy is a flavor of libertarianism which i guess it kinda is
graph is fake news
  theyre like pussy anarchists they cant commit to the full thing so they half ass it
on a muggy october morning in 2007 miamis top federal prosecutor alexander acosta had a breakfast appointment with a former colleague washington dc attorney jay lefkowitz     his client palm beach multimillionaire jeffrey epstein 54 was accused of assembling a large cultlike network of underage girls  with the help of young female recruiters  to coerce into having sex acts behind the walls of his opulent waterfront mansion as often as three times a day the town of palm beach police found    the eccentric hedge fund manager whose friends included former president bill clinton donald trump and prince andrew was also suspected of trafficking minor girls often from overseas for sex parties at his other homes in manhattan new mexico and the caribbean fbi and court records show    facing a 53page federal indictment epstein could have ended up in federal prison for the rest of his life    but on the morning of the breakfast meeting a deal was struck  an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of epsteins crimes and the number of people involved    not only would epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail but the deal  called a nonprosecution agreement  essentially shut down an ongoing fbi probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in epsteins sex crimes according to a miami herald examination of thousands of emails court documents and fbi records    this was not a he said she said situation this was 50something shes and one he  and the shes all basically told the same story said retired palm beach police chief michael reiter who supervised the police probe        all you very concerned pizzagaters out there had better get on this one stat
so can we assume acosta would have been implicated in the crimes if he didnt shut it down
  believe women  eexcept when they are accusing someone on the left 
lets be real here  epstein didnt do it  just like hillary just like trump just like clinton and obama and putin and assad  but not paddock he did it
  the left actually talking about jeffery epstein  oh boy      
  living in palm beach fucking underaged girls who were specifically recruited for the role thrice daily  nice
      right wing damage control
(((epstein)))  hell be fine nothings gonna happen
  democrat xochitl torres small is the apparent winner of a hotly contested house race for new mexicos 2nd house district according to nbc news defeating gop candidate yvette herrell and flipping the previously republicanheld district blue    democrats targeted the seat as part of their push to gain control of the house in the next congress that starts in january the party has now picked up a net 38 seats with two races still undecided according to nbc    torres small was declared the apparent winner in the neck and neck race two weeks after election day the district received millions in spending from outside groups including more than 3 million spent against republicans    torres small a water rights lawyer ran on expanding access to health care and increasing funding for education workers and veterans    the districts republican incumbent steve pearce lost the states gubernatorial election against democrat michelle lujan grisham    while democrat hillary clinton won new mexico in the 2016 presidential contest the lower half of the state covered in the 2nd district voted more for trump    herrell described herself on her campaign website as the only candidate who supported president trump from day 1 of his campaign and aligned with the president on issues such as immigration abortion and the second amendment            salt lake city ap  democrat ben mcadams has flipped a us house seat in deepred utah defeating republican us rep mia love by fewer than 700 votes in a race that took two weeks to settle    mcadams defeated love the first black republican woman elected to congress by a margin just over what would have been needed to require a recount according to final results posted tuesday
mcadams victory adds to the democratic majority in a year when they have flipped more than three dozen republicanheld seats across the country to win control of the us house of representatives    the race had been too close to call for the associated press until the final votes were tallied state election officials will certify the results next monday    mcadams declared victory monday night after a release of ballots gave him a margin his campaign believed was insurmountable    this race was about connecting with utah he said this race was about who was best positioned to serve utah and working to not get it caught up in a national partisan election     love was seeking a third term she said in a statement that she planned to call mcadams but didnt say if she would concede or congratulate him she said shes traveling with family for thanksgiving and wont speak about the race until monday    regardless of how you voted i want to express my sincere appreciation to you for engaging in the process love said it is one of many reasons this is the greatest country on earth    love finished about 20 votes short of being able to request a recount in a race where about 269000 votes were cast    this is the second time she has lost a bid for congress by a razorthin margin in her first run in 2012 love lost to incumbent democrat jim matheson by 768 votes she went on to defeat democrat doug owens in 2014 and again in 2016    for mcadams its a victory that validates his reputation as an emerging political force in utah    he pitched himself as a solid moderate and not a typical democrat while calling love a partisan who almost always votes with president donald trump the strategy was aimed at independent voters who account for nearly four in 10 voters in the largely suburban salt lake city district and designed to overcome his builtin disadvantage in a district where registered republicans outnumber democrats by nearly 3to1
he is an attorney who graduated from columbia law school and practiced in new york before returning to his home state of utah he has been a political figure in the state for a decade he was elected as one of the few democrats in the gopdominated state legislature in 2008 and successfully ran for the salt lake county mayors seat four years later    he became known for working with the states republican leaders on issues like homelessness where he backed a narrow medicaid expansion to cover treatment and once went undercover as a homeless person when the issue became a crisis downtown    though solidly conservative utah voters have long been uncomfortable with trumps brash style and his comments about women and immigrants that anxiety is especially pronounced in the suburbs of blueleaning salt lake city and mcadams mayor position gave him solid name recognition with voters    mcadams said during the campaign that he would not support california rep nancy pelosi as house speaker and insisting hed be able to work with the president he has already signed a letter along with 15 other democrats vowing to oppose pelosi    he sharply criticized loves support for the gopbacked tax overhaul and said she had not been available enough to her constituents at town halls love pushed back hard saying the tax overhaul has been good for people in utah and defending her approach of meeting with voters in smaller groups on the phone or online    she highlighted the times shes stood up to the president like when trump used an expletive to describe her parents home country of haiti she tried to separate herself from trump on trade and immigration
trump didnt appreciate her approach calling her out by name in a news conference the morning after election day where he also bashed other republicans who he said lost because they didnt fully embrace him    love seemed to struggle to find the right balance among conservative voters as she tried to keep her distance but stopped short of disparaging the president said damon cann a political science professor at utah state university    it became very difficult to satisfy everyone cann said    voter turnout among registered voters was the highest for any midterm election in utah since 1962 at about 74 percent according to justin lee state elections director    mcadams was an excellent candidate and also probably benefited from displeasure with trump and the republican party cann said    the winds were all at mcadams back cann said        only 2 more races remain undecided
democrats in line to pick up 40 seats    drip drip drip      drip drip drip  
fun fact when trump threw mia love under the bus during his meltdown press conference she was still in the lead in regards to the vote count
say it with me   tumbling
but the orange man assured me we would keep winning
wave    more like the puddle under the door when the toilet overflows still going until it hits the carpet
  say it with me  largest margin since post water gate
  except its not
  prepare to get blown the fuck out                also theres a chance itll surpass the record set by post water gate since votes are still coming in to be counted
  down
is this what you do with your time shareblue shitpost in a text board on fucking 4channel   how does this change any of the results of two weeks ago oh right it doesnt youre fucking stupid   kill yourself      orange man isnt wrong so far hey what branches do the republicans still hold again every time i bring it up a fedora tipper in california jumps off a bridge
  shareblue doesnt need to pay people when they they live in your head rent free
  rent free  spend all day on text board posting about orange man   you dont pay rent because you dont have a home youre street urchins squatting on a 4channel board hissing whenever someone invades your safe space because this is probably the only place on this entire site where youre too irrelevant for people to argue with you
  brilliant projection my guy you should get a job at a movie theater youll be able to afford a place to live in no time
  why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time
    oh no no no
  welcome to xcom  
    republicans are furious at democrats that they dont have to steal elections to win them like they do
 perfectly standard midterm election is a blue wave  libcucks being retards as usual nothing to see here
  blue states getting bluer and red states getting redder is an interesting longterm trend but the current nonsense over this blue wave bullshit has little to do with that this is a standard midterm election no more no less
    standard midterm election    oops  
  this might shock you but it doesnt matter how blue california  new york get
  if coxs lead holds democrats will have picked up seven gopheld seats in california and will begin the new session with a 467 advantage in the states congressional delegation cutting the republicans delegation in half from 14 in 2016
  it might shock you but popular vote isnt what matters its how many seats are won and in that case it was perfectly normal  congressional district a with 1 million people could have candidate x with by 1 percent or 100 percent and it literally makes no difference
  youre witnessing a first time voter experiencing an unhealthy dose of cope they only like the system when their guys win these kinds of people will never vote again once they get over the fanfare
    trump did better than obama and clinton did in their first midterm only failing to keep up with bush
  only with the electoral collage the fact that you had almost as many people cast a vote against trump in the midterms and trump got his base out to vote is an extremely ominous sign for republicans especially since you know trump is not going to change strategies only futher polarizing the country the fact outside of the ohio govenors race it was a clean sweep for democrats across the midwest for state wide races not ones republicans could rig with gerrymandering like state house or house of representative seats was a catastrophic development especially considering the razor thin margin trump won in those states in 2016 against an incompetent opponent
  cf gerrymandering  0 results   of course trump is going to do better than obama when the system is rigged in his favor  
  everyone gerrymanders you retard the gop is simply better at it
  wrong blue states are much more likely to transition away from it republicans however are being so blatant its been called out by the courts as overtly racist
  this still doesnt matter california gets bluer and what theyre already leftist shitholes
  except this isnt actually all that ominous at all its standard midterm electoral turnover and is not actually predictive of how the incumbent and his party will fare in the next presidential election obama got fucking shithammered in midterm elections and he got two terms for example
    no you are wrong both sides gerrymander always have always will     racist  lol please like anyone cares about this meme buzzword anymore
  obama was also a competent president who had actual achievements he could run on
  again not the same level as republicans youre creating a false equivalency   as for republican gerrymandering we see exactly how republicans are overtly rigging elections      also republicans pushed forward massive with a massive voter suppression campaign look at north carolina again      it went to the courts where they found that the law targeted african americas with surgical precision the key to the targeting was what was considered valid ids ids more likely to be possessed by whites such as drivers licenses were acceptable while ids more likely to be possessed by blacks such as government employee ids were not allowed despite both being photo ids issued by the government further damning was the fact nc state legislators specifically requested data on which ids were common among each racial group to avoid racial discrimination but then ended up doing the exact opposite    if thats not overtly racist youre going to have to tell me how youre moving the goalposts
speaking of north carolina republicans tried to steal a house seat and it was done so brazenly state officials refuse to certify the results    
      here are some competent achievements for you bud
beijing announced an action plan this week for monitoring residents behavior adding that the city expects to have its social credit system fully implemented by the end of 2020    beijing plans to reward and punish its residents based on data that will be collected from various departments monitoring citizens social behavior according to a detailed action plan posted on monday to the citys municipal website    by the beginning of 2020 the announcement declares chinas capital city will have all residents officially locked into the permanent surveillance program part of a broader effort to have every chinese citizen rated on a social credit system decreeing what public services a person can use based on their obedience to laws and loyalty to the communist regime    
the government will use the data collected to assess citizens behavior to decide if an individual is lawabiding and trustworthy to the communist party    residents who behave properly in the eyes of the chinese government will receive high credit scores while residents who misbehave will receive low scores causing them to lead more difficult lives    efforts will be made to build a market supervision mechanism with corporate credit as the core states beijings municipal website adding that it will explore the implementation of what it calls the personal integrity project which will utilize residents credit scores for market access public services tourism and fields such as entrepreneurship and job hunting    higher scores can also open the green channel which will expedite residents applications for higher quality education and medical resources    those who violate the law and lose trust will pay a heavy price adds the government website stating that it will improve the blacklist system and that residents will find themselves limited everywhere and difficult to move if they are deemed untrustworthy by the communists in control
last month the chinese government removed 10000 social media accounts belonging to its citizens    the government abolished the accounts  amid reports of google aiding chinas censorship  in an attempt to silence critics of the communist party accusing citizens of spreading harmful political information maliciously tampering with the history of the communist party and smearing the reputation of heroes and china    by the end of 2020 the beijing municipal social credit regulations will be completed and the legal system will be used to guide and promote the construction of the credit system proclaims beijings municipal website    chinas government argues that it is necessary to implement the lifelong social credit system across the country as citizens have been deemed dishonest by the communist party    
china officially implements good boy points  seriously though if the us government did this and called it patriot points for showing loyalty to the nation and its values how many do you think would support it
holy shit why are they allowed to do this
i spent some time learning mandarin i still suck at it in doing so i became friends with some people from china and taiwan the chinese people i spoke to who had never been out of the country were fiercely defensive of their government the great firewall and human rights violations were for their protection and the free speech of western countries was considered dangerous they were often unaware of some of the stories about the chinese government that were big news over here and they didnt want to know the chinese people who had traveled held a very different opinion they also used vpns so they could learn about news that was blocked by the government criticism of the government wasnt something to be discussed out in public and as for the taiwanese they believe the chinese were brainwashed    all in all the chinese government can get away with this kind of thing because theyve indoctrinated the citizens whove never known anything else that its for their own good
   officially implements good boy points  seriously though if the us government did this and called it patriot points for showing loyalty to the nation and its values how many do you think would support it    surprisingly few id think
  pretty much the difference between china and hk/taiwan is that chinese from big china still think the ccp has their best interest in mind as long as that is the case the ccp can do whatever they want including reeducation camps or recreating black mirror
  probably a little less than half the country the vast majority of either political party seem to be composed of fucking children who will go along with literally anything as long as it makes the opposite party mad
  no no no    you need to tell the citizens its for their own good that its suppose to stop crime and prevent terrorism    after that the average murrkan citizen will go along with anything
  thats a good start but youre also going to need to work the nothing to hide nothing to fear tactic in there instead of being merely complacent the citizenry will actively support your attempts to control them
  many the left already does it and loves it
  recreating black mirror  go back the way you came
after the west sanctioned any provocative actions of the ukrainian regime in the azovblack sea region the escalation of tension was not long in coming     25 нoябpя 2018 г 1907  russian federal security services fsb released the video of russian coast guard ships tracing ukrainian vessels through the kerch strait in the black sea on sunday three ukrainian vessels including missile boat nikopol gurzaclass boat berdyansk and tugboat yani kapu left the mariupol port and headed towards the kerch strait according to the fsb ukrainian vessels have crossed the state border of the russian federation and they have unlawfully entered the temporarily closed area of the russian federations territorial sea russian authorities decided to close the kerch strait while the ukrainian side protested against the decree referring to international law according to a statement by the ukraine naval forces two ukrainian gunboats and a sea mule tugboat were on a planned journey from odessa to mariupol about which russian officials had been informed the statement also alleges that the russian border ship don rammed the ukrainian tugboat breaking its engine    according to the ukrainian navy russia opened fire at smallsized berdiansk and nikopol armoured artillery boats the statement said        video

  theyre all crazy im sure
im requesting music from pirates of the caribbean
  
  newstuberu  even if this were true this doesnt justify annexing crimea vlad
  there was no annexation representatives of the crimea including natalia poklonskaya im reminding they were elected in ukraine decided not to get involved in the civil war and withdraw from the fragmented through the fault of the prowestern opposition ukraine a referendum was held the population voted for crimea our
  a referendum was held after russia had already invaded a total post facto justification ivan
  first restore yugoslavia then youll throw accusations
  ah yes the spontaneous uprising of multiple militias that coincidentally had matching russian uniforms without the russian flag and all the newest exclusive russian military gear who liberated crimea using fleets of russianmade helicopters and trucks originating from the russian naval base at sevastopol yes these patriots even personally guarded and oversaw every aspect of the referendum ensuring a fair and safe democratic process        if you believed any part of that official russian version of events youre a fucking retard youre a double retard if you believed that shit was totally not an organized russian invasion force but also believed that the euromaidan uprising which consisted of a bunch of drunk hohols armed with stolen riot shields slingshots and molotov cocktails was an organized takeover by the cia keep in mind these protestors didnt even get close to former president yanukovych who fled like a fucking bitch to russia despite holding all the cards dude had a full secret police force enough popular support in the legislature to avoid impeachment and the backing of every rich tycoon in ukraine but couldnt handle a few people complaining in a single city square so its not like they accomplished anything besides amusing /k/ with their clanking antics    seriously this entire thing fell apart because yanukovych was and still is a huge coward and a completely ineffectual leader a more democratic president would have backed down from his original position in the face of such massive protests a more dictatorial president would have actually cracked down on the protestors instead he tried to play both angles simultaneously and it completely backfired on him had he actually made a decision to go hard one way or the other ukraine would be stable today either prowestern he backed down or prorussian he cracked down instead he wussed out and now were left with the current mess
  if you believe the us doesnt sponsor terrorists all over the world youre just as dumb these are shadow operations the americans made a coup in ukraine and our response was not long in coming its fair or do you think that only nato has the right to violate international law
  mariupol 2015  
  oh theres plenty of history of the us doing shady shit i most certainly wont deny that the problem is you believe that everything is a cia conspiracy the cia somehow conjured up thousands of protestors implying that nobody would naturally protest a sudden change in major government policy the cia somehow made yanukovych a waffling idiot who escalated the conflict that should have easily been solved either with policy change or tanks in 30 minutes the cia somehow made yanukovych flee the country despite there being no meaningful threat to his life or even his power repeat ad nauseam    hell ive seen one useful idiot claim the protests must have been sponsored by the cia because the protestors had portajohns really only the cia has the wherewithal to get portable toilets by this logic every large longterm protest ever was organized by the cia because clearly nobody knew they needed to shit after protesting for literal days where it not for the useful aid of the cia    everything here hinges on the idea that nobody would ever say or do anything against russias will unless theyre secretly puppets of the cia that nobody is competent unless organized by an outside force its a worldview that lets you immediately dismiss anyone who disagrees with you as foreign agents without actually addressing their argument or complaints its the same retardation as democrats calling republicans russian operatives republicans calling democrats chinese propagandists and sjws blaming the patriarchy for slipping on their stair muffin    theres no evidence beyond wild unfettered speculation and antiamerican bias that would suggest yanukovychs ouster was anything but natural outcome of incompetence    and our response was not long in coming  at least you have the selfawareness to admit that crimea was anything but a hostile takeover
  made yanukovych flee the country despite there being no meaningful threat to his life or even his power  do you actually unironically believe that yanukovych fled the country despite no meaningful threat to his life or his power
  what difference does it make john the population anyway hate ukrainians
  to some degree i exaggerate since clearly there was some distant threat against him but it was negligible in terms of actual political power hence calling him a coward im sure to him it seemed like his entire empire was crumbling around him but from the outside it looked like he still had control he still had the berkut police force which was personally loyal to him and even defected to russia with him he had friends from his home region of donbas installed in every level of government his opposition lacked the political control to block 100 of his legislation let alone impeach him he had massive money reserves and many rich tycoons in his pocket anyone else in his position would have never fled they would have either backed down maybe even resigned with some guarantee of immunity nixon style or gone full madman and started butchering everyone with his personally loyal army    if you were watching it live like most of /k/ it was clear that he had control over the situation everyone expected him to either acquiesce and revert to the proeu deal to return to normal order only slightly damaged or absolutely crush the protestors tienanmen style hence the old tanks in 30 minutes joke it was an immense shock when it turned out he had literally disappeared from his residence mere hours after he had announced he had struck a deal with the protestors it was an outcome that nobody could have predicted one that didnt make sense to anyone but yanukovych hell i dont think russia had any idea this shit was going down hence the hasty militia takeover of crimea to secure the valuable black sea port of sevastopol if they had waited im pretty sure the new ukrainian government would have kept the port deal in place since it gave lots of gas to ukraine but at the time it was fucking oh god whats happening panic mode
  to some degree i exaggerate since clearly there was some distant threat against him but it was negligible in terms of actual political power  actual political power does not matter when theres an armed mob at your door ceausescu and gaddafi had a lot of actual political power they enjoyed full command of their political power even as bullets ended their lives because it turns out that populations in revolt dont give a fig about political power even dictators who are supposed to be escorted to a peaceful retirement like diem sometimes are later found to have committed involuntary suicide due to regrettable excesses of patriotic fervor    while i dont actually think that this was the fate immediately awaiting yanukovych although i doubt you can fully rule it out given that even security service members and even technicians were shot to death during the protests its significantly more plausible and probably expected that he would enjoy a slowmotion fall from power prosecution for corruption and a long prison term the same as happened to tymoshenko when the orange revolution undid itself    it was an immense shock when it turned out he had literally disappeared from his residence mere hours after he had announced he had struck a deal with the protestors  that deal was supposed to cause the protesters to disperse they did not they advanced on and occupied the buildings of government indicating that for all practical measures he was not in control his only options at that point other than to take it like a bitch would be to run for the hills or launch a civil war and he didnt have the stomach for a civil war
ill just leave it here    
  what would you say about this dumbfuck  
  there was a planned action to put russia in a bad color poroshenko declared martial law in the countrynow he is the president for a very long period of time as the elections in the country are canceled donald trump got a new reason for his economic war everyone benefits from this performance
  who let the russian military into the crimea   natalia polonskaya and representatives of the ukrainian government then why only russia is to blame
  russia is not responsible for their own fucking troops invading another country  i didnt realize putin was so pathetic that the military command doesnt obey him
  invading another country and helping territories that want to avoid a civil war are slightly different things
is it just a breaking of the helsinki declaration
  russians officially support open borders
  actual political power does not matter when theres an armed mob at your door    the mob was nowhere near his door any political leader worth his salt would have either pulled from the putin rulebook and called all the protestors paid agents of the german eu and started rounding them up which he sort of started to do with his antiprotest laws or actually switch his position on the eu matter instead of just asking protestors to go home without actually giving them anything besides token positions yanukovych waffled and therefore lost both popular and military support    ceausescu and gaddafi    you phrase it as if they still had power but both of them completely lost it long before they died ceausescu lost support of the military because his defense minister had died in a suspicious suicide he was actually only attempting to wound himself to relieve himself of duty but accidentally severed an artery and died which would not be discovered for years after the fact which caused the military to believe ceausescu had him executed he also failed to understand the wants of the people and failed to bring any reforms that they demanded and in effect became isolated without either popular or military support    gaddafi on the other hand was willing to go all the way when faced with protests his military was completely willing to start bombing the shit out of protestors and later rebels after initial setbacks against the now organized rebels his military started pushing them back it was only after the us decided to offload a bunch of old cruise missiles and the europeans starting bombing the shit out of his army that he started to actually lose    compare these men to gorbachev who faced down a similar imminent civil war he managed to navigate it by siding with the protestors and reformers while winning over the rankandfile of the military who were sent to arrest him if yanukovych was in his position russia would be in a civil war to this day
  and helping territories that want to avoid a civil war  russia could have simply have ordered their side in ukraine to stop fighting no they wanted the crimean resources
  any political leader worth his salt would have either pulled from the putin rulebook and called all the protestors paid agents of the german eu and started rounding them up which he sort of started to do with his antiprotest laws or actually switch his position on the eu matter instead of just asking protestors to go home without actually giving them anything besides token positions  rounding people up means theres going to be shooting there is no world in which the protesters backed down without a whole lot more people being killed as for switching his position on the eu for one part its toolittletoolate and for the second part if russia abandons their support for him hes done anyway you make it sound like he decided to abdicate right as he was on the cusp of victory    he also failed to understand the wants of the people and failed to bring any reforms that they demanded and in effect became isolated without either popular or military support  so did yanukovych at least in the context of the city of kiev his support base lay far away in the east and was made of people who were not physically present to contest control of the government possession is ninetenths of the law    gaddafi on the other hand was willing to go all the way   and how did that work out for him even if you dont buy that the inane conspiracy theory that america sponsored the ukrainian revolution from the ground up the fact that american politicians were openly supporting the opposition and planning the new government indicates makes it a bad bet that an endless stream of american military hardware wouldnt be streaming into the ukrainian civil war    gorbachev was a reformer to begin with facing down a revolt from hardline communists at a time when most of the soviet union was fed up with hardline communists and most importantly gorbachev never lost the army with yanukovych its not clear whether the army was ever on his side at all
  fighting began after the massacre in the house of trade unions in odessa the current ukrainian government has discredited itself this act forced the russianspeaking population to defend themselves
  this they were after the oil because if that oil was opened to the eu it would break russias chokehold
  that doesnt make any sense the reichstag is in germany and there hasnt been a fire in decades
so youre the fucking retard 
  im pretty sure this was supposed to be some sort of hyperintellectual critical reference but it actually just comes out looking completely incoherent
  
  you just made yourself look stupid with that post must suck to be you
  yes im 100 aware of the reichstag fire and what it was    are you suggesting that separatists literally set their own building on fire condemning dozens of themselves to agonizing and painful deaths just for the purpose of scoring a propaganda coup
  rounding people up means theres going to be shooting  not necessarily by using the eu deal as leverage yanukovych could have sent a majority of protestors home and then used propaganda to label the remainder as hooligans and had them arrested there would still be bloodshed but with hundreds of protestors and dozens of cops already dead things were never going to be bloodless it might not have been enough to save his presidency but it would have stopped the complete split of his country something which he does care about in exile he has stated that he wants crimea returned to ukraine indicating his prorussia switch might have been more about personal gain and corruption than a strategic realignment to russia over the eu of course this plan would have required intelligence and courage two things that yanukovych clearly lacks    and how did that work out for him  a long time ago gaddafi made the error of being on the wests shitlist and it came to bite him in the ass decades later yanukovych wasnt on the shitlist and ukraine was protected from overt action by both the treaty that garunteed its independence which did shit for them when the russians started rolling in and the russian navy hanging out at sevastopol which would have considered any offensive action by the west as a potential threat yanukovych also had the benefit of being after the benghazi fiasco so the us was less likely to intervene it had already failed to intervene in syria despite the use of chemical weapons the infamous red line in that way yanukovych was free to use extreme military force without fear of the us being able to stop him especially if he actually had russian backing which i personally doubt given his bizarre actions theyre not the actions of a man confidently backed by a massive foreign neighbor    but youre right that in retrospect his position seems weaker than what was seen at the time

hope this faggot gets gangraped in a supermax for the rest of his life
doxxes his enemies  supported fascist parties in the australian election  had a show on rt  refused to publish the panama papers  had his political party/father meet with assad to show solidarity with the syrian government  doesnt give a crap about all the liberal toes hes been stepping on    is assange /ourguy/
  cringepilled
when did you realize assange is not a freedom fighter and that hes really just a schizo
  hes kinda difficult to pin he preaches a sort of liberal antiauthoritarian libertarianism yet seems to exclusively target liberal democracies and be sympathetic to some pretty authoritarian regimes like syria or russia i think that the overall trend is that he considers western civilization to be corrupt hypocritical and destructive at its roots and it must be pulled up so that something else can grow since he backed australia first neonazis this angered a lot of his followers who were going for the green party this might even extend to a distaste of the postenlightenment world in general despite what he says he definitely has an agenda and he definitely isnt an unbiased source
  hes the brand of virulent libertarian who borders on fascistic as ironic as that is that infests /pol/ today the transition from ron paul to trump was a surprisingly smooth one for them so definitely not leftlibertarian a la chomsky more an ancap who supports the idea of white ethnostates
    simply put assange is not a man of his word and he is in a business that requires trust this makes him an enigma and appears to serve his ego     fuck that guy
  it was certainly weird that a transparency organization was not in itself transparent
  t libertarian who borders on fascistic  how does that work
  imagine somalia but the warlords finally formally privatize infrastructure and personally invests in their own brand of hugo boss uniforms suited to the clime of course
    it doesnt a lot of further right republicans started calling themselves little l libertarians because they meant they were not part of the libertarian party but wanted to selectively use cherry picked libertarian arguments against the federal government during the obama years these are the same people who resurrected states rights politics and then got caught in trumps gravity well when the voters whose anger they had been stoking for 8 years put him in office now you have a rank and file that spouts libertarian buzzwords while furthering an authoritarian agenda and the left boosts this connection because it disrupts and annoys actual libertarians who they hate
  look up the libertarian to altright pipeline
    heres a crazy theory assange didnt start leaning to the right until after the cia tried to pin him with a false sexual harassment charge     there are few faster ways to redpill a man then to show him how corrupt and backwards modern feminism is once you see how dishonest the identity politics and false victim narratives are in 3rd wavers you begin to notice the same problem in nearly all left leaning thought you begin to realize that those in charge of the modern left dont actually want equality but to group people into various camps of oppression and then sell those people on the idea that the only way to defeat said oppression is by supporting them     they accidentally woke one of the best and most well trusted journalists on the planet look at everything assange has done post and pre august 2010 its wild
  w i p e t h e s l a t e c l e a n
  i dont know ask them
  so the altright really is just a bunch of incels then
  heres a crazy theory assange didnt start leaning to the right until after the cia tried to pin him with a false sexual harassment charge  1000 this  lock a man in a building for years due to fabricated charges and run a smear campaign against him and he will do desperate things
  he wasnt always like this  he came to fame revealing dirty dealings of large corporations like the oil industry  the wikileaks files the world according to us empire is a very good read
  it was his court trial back when he was still a teenager in australia that really turned him against the west he was caught hacking into government/military websites and though the judge decided to go lenient on him because he deemed assange was acting out of intellectual inquisitiveness he was still really butthurt over the whole ordeal and came to see modern western democracies as evil    quote from assanges blog about it    to feel that home is the camaraderie of persecuted and in fact prosecuted polymaths in a stalinist slave labour camp how close the parallels to my own adventures  such prosecution in youth is a defining peak experience to know the state for what it really is to see through that veneer the educated swear to disbelieve in but still slavishly follow with their hearts  your belief in the mendacity of the state  begins only with a jackboot at the door true belief forms when led into the dock and referred to in the third person true belief is when a distant voice booms the prisoner shall now rise and no one else in the room stands
reminder that this is what assange had to say when people were protesting his move to expose personal info of possible afghan/iraqi/saudi informants    well theyre informants so if they get killed theyve got it coming to them they deserve it
  blah blah blah the west is corrupt and decadent i wont fight that    why do i keep hearing the only solution to this being rip it out by the roots destruction of the primary power state leaves a vacuum and weve got all of two states that want to step into that vacuum russia and china who in their right mind would compare them to the west and say theyd be better    reform over revolution i say once you advocate revolution you accept that the current system is irredeemably ruined and we are a long way from that
  who in their right mind would compare them to the west and say theyd be better  assange because hes actually a double agent for russia also trumptards because they are just that tribalist and too stupid to see that theyve been played
  reform over revolution  and that is where the corruption roosts
  two things first libertarians believe in just world it doesnt matter what your initial socioeconomic status is if youre brilliant youll rise to the top the free market when left to its own is a perfect meritocracy that will elevate the brilliant while killing off the lazy/unsuccessful through deprivation how then do you fit into this darwinistic philosophy that some ethnic groups have less success while others have all the success you either have to admit that there are systemic or societal issues or that these groups are inherently inferior     second is that the libertarian intellectuals tend to be just as technocratic as their liberal counterparts libertarians believe that the cream of the crop rises to the top it goes without saying then that if captains of industry were in charge of things rather than your regular old dumbass society would be far better
  i wish they had just assassinated him instead
these days assange serves as a fantastic newfag test    anyone spouting off some shit opinion such as assange is a puppet of russia automatically ousts themselves as a newfaggot who didnt start paying attention to global politics until post2016
  did it ever occur to you that people not born and bred to be agents and informants of an intelligence service can still be recruited as agents or informants for an intelligence service later in life
  this
  whistle  there are multiple fouls in the post    libertarians believe in just world  straw man post number 315243  the free market when left to its own is a perfect meritocracy  misrepresenting the argument post number 315243  you either have to admit that there are systemic or societal issues or that these groups are inherently inferior   false dichotomy post number 315243  second is that the libertarian intellectuals tend to be just as technocratic as their liberal counterparts  additional strawman post number 315243    40 yard penalty player is ejected from the game pending official review    repeat 4th down
  jesus you could just yannow properly define libertarianism that took about 1000 characters to say 50 characters worth of information    and its cringe as fuck too
  he should post in another way because i dont like it
  improperly defines libertarianism  expects others to do it for him  personal foul projection of burden of proof  10 yard penalty  repeat 4th down
  terrible post
      libertarianism is about making sure people get what they deserve really when you think about it maybe only 01 of the population really matters these are the leaders and thinkers what i call true humans they are the ones who move and shake the earth whose coattails the rest of society rides upon if only a handful of these people were lost it would send society into a tailspin compare this to the rest of humanity the sheep or the expendable who could die in the millions without civilization coming down in flame     yet the sheep in their jealousy would seek to bottle these people and take their wealth and success from them to the sheep the sweat of these mens brow belongs to the common good as if anything good ever came out of something common libertarianism then is about protecting these great men from the shackles that the parasites would put upon them so that they may continue their work it is the only political and economic philosophy that makes sense
i may be a low iq newfag moron whom has not lurked enough but i just gotta say  this post is pure low iq faggotry one nation is a zero immigration party neonazi is mainstream character assasination the green party votes tally over to the liberal party so only idiots and beta marxist artist types vote green party i might be a newfag but you should fuck off  and suck a bag of dicks until your iq is improved   one nation while fatally flawed is possible the only non kiked party in australia
    did you even read the vault 7 leaks    10 bucks says no no you fucking didnt and you newfaggots wont because waaaaah raw data is too boring waaaaah i need huffpost to filter everything and tell me what my next socially approved approved opinion should be waaaaa
  did you even read the vault 7 leaks  no i had people like you find the most incriminating things from them and prate them at us
  are you talking about the eti and their zero point energy theyre out there all right
  molymeme  just world fallacy  great man theory  the sheep  it libertarianism is the only political and economic philosophy that makes sense    just lol this poster hasnt finished college maybe not even high school
  i remember that thread on /pol/ when this dropped everyone thought they legit uncovered real aliens for about 5 minutes the reactions were some of the best ive ever seen on this websight
    i think that guy learned everything he knows about libertarians and objectivism by playing bioshock
  thats because he has anarchist views    kinda guy fawkey
  in other words hes a moron
  in other words hes more successful than you so if hes a moron your an absolute retard
  plenty of successful people are morons just look at the president
  done nothing wrong i truly pity this man
  hes a cunt
  no thats your mother
  shut the fuck up
  guy fawkes wasnt an anarchist and nor is assange
  ancap white ethnicstate    gibe
  so sweden in 10yrs
  its always the mans fault
  speaking as a leftist i hate libertarians significant less than i hate traditional conservatives the left agrees with lolbertarians on social issues
  once you see how dishonest the identity politics and false victim narratives are in 3rd wavers you begin to notice the same problem in nearly all left leaning thought  let me fix this for you  you begin to fallaciously extrapolate these problems to every other leftleaning ideology and call yourself redpilled
  this post should win an award for most buzzwords compiled into a sentence by someone who doesnt know what any of them mean
  it seemed pretty accurate to me whats wrong with it
  russia and china who in their right mind would compare them to the west and say theyd be better     almond every war after ww2 were started by usa korean war vietnam the middle east afghanistan iraq libya syria and countless psyop in south america     can you name any war by russia or china    usa is basically a warmongering bully seems world domination by bullying weak third world countries     when the world is sick and tired of the bullying they will not support the usa as a super power anymore after 2020
  i like how this post seems to believe korea vietnam afghanistan iraq syria and libya somehow constitute almond sic every war after wwii which is incredibly ignorant of world affairs it then assigns blame to america for all these wars even though it joined late in some of them korea and vietnam or were civil wars before american intervention libya syria and of the two remaining wars afghanistan was a response to a massive terrorist attack leaving iraq and the only real warmonger conflict since the wmd claim was full of cherrypicked shit the narrow scope and simplicity of blame is hilarious    but fuck it i can play this game and im even going to stick to the strict definition of starting a war which means we get to ignore all the violent suppression of protestors against their rule interventions into civil wars against their rule wow its almost as if nobody wants to be ruled by russia or china who knew supporting the military of another nation many border spats where you cant tell who started it etc  wars started by russia after wwii  invasion of czechoslovakia  soviet invasion of afghanistan  chechen wars 2  invasion of georgia  invasion of ukraine ongoing undeclared  this list grows substantially if we include every other conflict and assuming your use of psyop means advisors and special operations ho boy does this list grow to titanic proportions its almost as if a massive cold war was fought    wars started by china after wwii  invasion of tibet  taiwan strait crises 3  sinoindian war  sinoviet war  remarkably this list does not grow that much if we include all other conflicts china has mostly focused on massacring its own citizens in the past 70 years instead of killing others
  fallaciously    lol
  whats wrong with it  for starters libertarian and fascistic are on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum further building on this by insinuating that a guy like assange who is wanted for exposing the secrets of governments commuting arguably fascist acts is himself so libertarian hes basically fascist demonstrates your understanding of assange and his popularity among certain right and left wing wing ideologies is based on nothing but badly biased tv programming further insinuating that assange and /pol/ are the same brand suggests this tv programming is limited exclusively to late night talk shows    moreover ancap and ethnostate are mutually exclusive concepts if you disagree or cite personal anecdotes you admit to not understanding either concept especially as they pertain to assange
  moreover ancap and ethnostate are mutually exclusive concepts  you must not be in touch with ancap literature see hoppe
  hoppe isnt a mainstream libertarian theres a lot more open border libertarians but again its his opinion to have
  hoppe isnt a mainstream libertarian  sure and you might argue that his views are intellectually inconsistent but there is a significant amount of people who think like him specially these days
  exactly tell that to /pol/fags that was the whole point of that post perhaps you missed it
  but there is a significant amount of people who think like him specially these days  wanting to throw communists out of helicopters/ wanting an ethnostate
  why     literally his only crime is telling you the truth  i can see why liberals hate him    no hes targeting authoritarians its not his fault that your head is full of shit and youve been convinced that those same authoritarians who are conspiring against you are actually liberal democracies     if your favorite politician is ruined by having their emails exposed then your favorite politician wasnt ever your guy if you try to blame that on him and not yourself for picking such shitty people to champion your causes then youre retarded     assange should get a medal for his work    he said something i dont like and im a snowflake who cant take that thats what you should take away from that sentence
  gee thats weird its almost like he shares the opinions of most revolutionary socialists but most revolutionary socialists are still sheltered children living in their parents basements who still get their news from the television where theyre told to hate him despite representing all of their views    well at least we dont live in a country where people are fucking stupid enough to listen to a media conglomerate that has constantly fucked them over every single time they got a populist socialist movement going right that occupy wallstreet was totally not sheared apart by the media and picked clean by their corporate vultures     better turn on the tv and go back to sleep nbc is running a special on why freethinking is bad
  leftist movements always falter and are easy to suppress when shit just isnt bade enough the french revolution would never have happened if literally every french pleb could have literally gone to any grocery store and literally bought and eaten cake with their ebt card
  yes thats why he had a show on a russian owned network convinced snowden to go to russia snowden wanted to go elsewhere at first refused to publish the panama papers then called it a cia hoax when it was published elsewhere and backed a party run by an exneo nazi in the australian election totally doesnt have an agenda
  libertarian and fascistic are on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum  maybe on paper
  libertarian and fascistic are on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum  because no one has ever intentionally misused a political term
  tbf a lot of bad libertarians are pretty much randian corportist types like paul ryan and they give the libertarian movement a bad rep in general anti government or conspiracy theory cranks also like to call themselves libertarians alex jones was pretty much disowned by the libertarian party but that doesnt stop him from claiming to be a libertarian
  is larry king a russian agent  
  just stop
  alex jones is hardly a conspiracy theorist hes the only one speaking the truth why else would guys like trump be listenting and making decisions based off of what he says     also libertarianism is the only economic philosophy that is fair and that works it is the philosophy of nature that the most fit and deserving will prevail while the lazy and stupid disappear wouldnt society be better off without lazy bums loafing about in this respect paul ryan is a pretty great man hes the only one talking about removing medicare and social security and letting nature take its course on the weaklings who suckle on the tit of the successful
  i remain committed to the faith of my teenage years to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good i stand against confiscatory taxes totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual for all these reasons i still call myself libertarian    but i must confess that over the last two decades i have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals most importantly i no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible by tracing out the development of my thinking i hope to frame some of the challenges faced by all classical liberals today     peter thiel  the education of a libertarian    basically democracy is flawed since the poor have a voice the poor will do everything to take wealth from the rich and enforce equality equality weather of outcome or opportunity and absolute freedom are incompatible since it means lifting up some and putting constraints/regulations on others ergo some libertarians reject democracy
  alex jones is hardly a conspiracy theorist hes the only one speaking the truth   you are gonna have to work a little harder for those yous
  so basically libertarians turned on democracy when it finally started to address as it inevitably does economic inequality it actually is a slippery slope in the particular case of democracy but i dont think its a bad thing provided we have the means we do economic inequality should be at the very least mitigated if not eradicated outright impossible
  is this bait i cant tell  poes law is a bitch
assange is dead
  automation will kill the only few jobs still left available to the working class unless you enjoy mass rioting every day this will have to be addressed one way or another
  wars started by russia after wwii  invasion of czechoslovakia  soviet invasion of afghanistan  chechen wars 2  invasion of georgia  invasion of ukraine ongoing undeclared    nobody okay ill will be your huckleberry     afghanistan calls upon the ussr to help the war upon an old treaty long ago help them with the al qaeda that was trained by the cia in a coup to over throw the afghanistan government concerning the ukraine and georgia they were communist country used to be a part of ussr that the usa and nato doing psyop in a coup against the government     in a way im glad they were able to westernized ukraine but i cant say the say the same about crimea as russia was able to prevent the coup     as for china what do you expect under mao zedong youre right theyre trying to expand territory and war mongering also  except for india vietnam and the gulf of tonkin was such a mess     as for tibet 80 of the population was in slavery under lamaism religion before china step in and save them trust me the dhala lama was not buddhism he is a lama that made drum out of human skin to use in their chant     those countries would have been better off being westernized by the usa but with they cant pull it off anymore with the internet and the worlds eyes watching over it     you better stop watching fox news and study some real world history     as for 911 those bad guys were saudi national as also osama bin laden
  al qaeda that was trained by the cia  no it wasnt
  social security for all
  good he is an embarrassment to journalists everywhere and was promoting fake news long before trump was bitching about it
  also consider hes never had the backbone to actually accept responsibility for any danger hes put people in by refusing to censor their names in leaks he has blood on his hands even if one soldier is killed by a jihaadi using his exposes like a hit list
  lol u r funny
  no it wasnt  yes it was it still is in fact
tfw when leftwingers have become the bootlickers
  hm i suppose neolibertarian does technically count as left wing extreme extreme left wing butits most definitely not right wing    describing him as anything but a russian stooge at this point is just false though
  theres bootlickers on every side always has been always will be
  tfw rightwingers have become antipatriots working for russian interests against their own nation
  there was a law at the time requiring bakers to sell the next highest quality loaf at the lowest price if they ran out of the cheap bread as is typical the merchant class balked at such a loss of profit and simply refused to bake the more expensive bread let them eat cake is simply the outoftouch sentiment that if there was no bread left the people should be eating the more expensive bakery items according to the spirit of the law
  this post is an absolute mess beyond butchering the english language with grammatical errors out the ass it is disorganized to the point of near incoherence and riddled with basic factual errors also i think its cute that you peg me as someone who watches fox as apparently i come off as older and conservative when talking to nonamericans with poor english either that or you think only conservative beerdrinkin guntottin redblooded americans can think that the soviets and chinese are shit which is an amusing stereotype but patently ridiculous anyway its going to take a while to break this post down    starting with afghanistan your version of events might as well have come straight out of soviet propaganda first of all while the communist government of afghanistan did ask for aid they only asked for supplies and small advisor and combat units they did not ask for the soviets to invade and overthrow them in a coup killing thenpresident hafizullah amin and his young son because the soviets dont give a shit about collateral damage and replacing him with soviet loyalist babrak karmal something which soviet premier brezhnev ordered unilaterally last i checked no government has ever asked a neighbor to help overthrow themselves further you leave out the fact that the problem was not cia alqaeda but other communists thats right president amin a communist over threw president nur mohammad taraki another communist prosoviet i might add who in turn assassinated the previous president mohammed daoud khan and his family in a violent coup who originally took over in a bloodless coup ending the afghan monarchy and turning afghanistan into a republic which conveniently happened after khan decided to forge closer ties with the west before this change in leadership the soviets were happy to just sell equipment to the afghans and let them battle rebels on their own    part 1 of 4 my god is this long
 2 of 4  second you make the mistake of confusing alqaeda a terrorist group founded in 1988 near the end of the war with the mujahedin a rather dare i say diverse rebel group consisting of many loosely associated factions ranging from local tribal fighters to nationalists to staunch islamic conservatives to foreign muslims on jihad alqaeda was formed out of the foreign element of the mujahedin as part of an effort by bin laden and abdullah azzam to continue to wage jihad outside of afghanistan from there they began their first operations in sudan before bin laden got his ass disowned by his family and his assets frozen by the saudi government for talking shit about the king though support remained among certain saudi factions so basically the soviets never fought alqaeda and because they only appeared at the end of the war they did not directly benefit from operation cyclone so no us money or cia training most of bin ladens funding came from saudi groups that would later disavow him    concerning the ukraine and georgia they were communist country used to be a part of ussr that the usa and nato doing psyop in a coup against the government   its rather convenient for you that everyone who doesnt want to be under the rule of russia are victims of usa and nato psyop and that anyone who was previously communist is now forever property of russia clearly nobody would ever want to tell russia to fuck off after being oppressed by the ussr for decades no they could have only had their minds poisoned by those evil cia masterminds its not like russia has a history of invading its neighbors to enforce its will and why so many former warsaw pact members are trying to join nato so they dont get invaded
 3 of 4  in a way im glad they were able to westernized ukraine but i cant say the say the same about crimea as russia was able to prevent the coup   this part is such a mess i dont even know what to say you seem to be making contradicting statements its good that ukraine westernized contradicts your earlier statement that ukraine is the victim of a nato coup which you say is bad and then you immediately imply its bad that russia was able to prevent the coup which also contradicts the first part of your previous statement    with regards to tibet you again seem to have taken heavily from the prcs account of events the chinese certainly saved the tibetans by killing thousands that attempted to resist starving a million of them during the great leap forward and destroying all their cultural artifacts and temples during the cultural revolution im sure theyre eternally grateful while they were certainly living in poor feudal conditions before the prc takeover every improvement to their lives seems stymied by new hardships theyve simply exchanged their old feudal lords for chinese governors    also the human skin drum is taken from someone who already died naturally typically a monk as part of a sky burial leaving the corpse to be eaten by vultures to perpetuate the cycle of rebirth not some sort of living sacrifice nobody died to make that drum this is like assuming that people are killed for medical cadavers this is the same sort of misunderstanding that led the chinese to believe that catholic missionaries drowned babies they were trying to baptize unwanted children before they starved
 4 of 4 thank god  those countries would have been better off being westernized by the usa but with they cant pull it off anymore with the internet and the worlds eyes watching over it   this is another part that doesnt make sense are you saying it would have been better for everyone to be the victims of us psyop so which fucking is it is it bad that the us psyops countries to join their side or is it good make up your damn mind    as for 911 those bad guys were saudi national as also osama bin laden  yes who was hiding in afghanistan where most of the alqaeda training camps were after being exiled from saudi arabia and as it turns out he moved to pakistan to further evade the us for years    okay im finally done man its fun writing all this shit out and researching individual claims this is why i love and hate this board
didnt he die
  if you are on this site then chances are you are not making the 1 cut
  you really dont go get how propaganda platforms work do you you dont lie out your ass with a bottle of vodka you mix your view point with half truths and lies that further your purpose     but to answer your question larry doesnt create his shows for rt instead he claims that he simply gives them license to reair them i think the original channel distributor is freeform     furthermore larry doesnt have a long entwined history of doing russia shit or needing to smuggle coworkers over there outside of the show stuff he has probably interviewed a few famous russians
  everybody in hollywood knows larry has some serious palimony/child support payments he does whatever he can at his advanced age for money its really kind of sad
  people who think this legitimately confuse me because i know youre not one of that 1 if you were youd have better things to do than defend your ideology on 4chin why do you suck off this 1 then how does it benefit you it doesnt it fucks you over now ill address the arguments in this  libertarianism is about making sure people get what they deserve  this means nothing every ideology says this about itself deserve is a subjective term  when you think about it maybe only 01 of the population really matters  more subjectivity and simplification in reality value to society is on a gradient there are people who matter less than the 1 but are still important  what i call true humans  cringe  if only a handful of these people were lost it would send society into a tailspin  not really humanity would stop advancing or at least advance slower but our society is fairly stable it wouldnt fall apart  compare this to the rest of humanity the sheep or the expendable who could die in the millions without civilization coming down in flame  do you really think this do you have any idea what would happen if say 50 million americans lesser humans disappeared into the ether chaos construction workers lowlevel office workers the people who actually hold society up all gone they wouldnt be able to be rapidly replaced like the elites could earlier on you called the mythical 1 the people  whose coattails the rest of society rides upon  in reality this is backwards they direct society yes but they are standing on top of the 999 the 99 are the foundation the legs that society stands on  cont
  yet the sheep in their jealousy would seek to bottle these people and take their wealth and success from them  you have a grave fundamental misunderstanding of reality the vast majority of the elite did not work their way into nobility they were born into it they had the deck stacked in their favor and now they work to keep it that way making use of fools like you who think that youll one day reach their level you wont   libertarianism then is about protecting these great men from the shackles that the parasites would put upon them so that they may continue their work it is the only political and economic philosophy that makes sense  let me tell you what libertarianism is lolbertarians seek to undermine government power which they deem coercive and unjust and knowingly or unknowingly replace it with private power which they see as good and effective and fair they do this in pursuit of ultimate liberty and autonomy woefully ignorant of the fact that the private powers they worship will also use force against them will also make mistakes and will fuck them over even harder than government does  private power is after one goal money it will do anything it can to get money it will sacrifice anyone or anything for the sake of it if private power is barred from certain actions it can function fine and not fuck over everyone else if it is not regulated it destroys the environment and violates human rights  lets contrast this with government government also has a profit motive but its not nearly as strong as that of a corporation government sometimes goes out of its way to benefit people corporations do not government sometimes attracts people who fight for the common good corporations do not governments are not perfect in fact they are terrible but the solution to a terrible goverent is not to scrap it like libertarians want but to improve it you cant improve a terrible corporation unless you have government
grafters    source 
once upon a time prehistoric humans and our ancient neanderthal cousins met and procreated except that once upon a time meeting is now looking less like a one night stand and more like a protracted bonkfest according to a new analysis of modern human ancestry    when anatomically modern humans traipsed out of africa into europe some 75000 years ago they headed into territory occupied by neanderthals for over 30000 years until the latter died out the two species lived side by side through much of eurasia    in 2010 publication of a neanderthal genome revealed that early humans shared more than just geography with the species    scattered throughout the genome of anyone with nonafrican heritage are chunks of neanderthal dna  the hallmarks of a prehistoric tryst between our closest hominin relatives    the presence of these chunks making up 2 on average of the genome of anyone with roots in europe asia australia or the americas pointed to a single period of intermingling  probably 50000 to 60000 years ago  not long after homo sapiens emerged from africa    but that simple story was complicated by the discovery that people in east asia have up to 20 higher neanderthal ancestry than presentday europeans    there was some debate about okay is this just random or is it meaningful in any way says josh schraiber from temple university in philadelphia us    one of the biggest debates says schraiber pits two competing theories against each other the first is that the neanderthal bits in europeans have gradually been diluted through mixing with human populations that didnt breed with neanderthals    the second theory suggests that multiple periods of interbreeding  or admixing  in europe and asia have resulted in the differing rates of neanderthal ancestry  
evidence for multiple matings already exists in the form of a 40000 year old human fossil from romania with a recent neanderthal ancestor whose neanderthal dna nonetheless did not become part of modernday human genomes    if it happened there says schraiber why wouldnt it be happening in other places    to find out which scenario  dilution or multiple matings  was more likely he and his colleague fernando villanea first looked at european and asian populations separately they analysed the distribution of neanderthal chunks across genomes in the 1000 genomes project a large public database of human genetic variation    in both europe and asia the patterns of inheritance pointed to multiple periods of mating rather than just one    but they couldnt be sure that dilution didnt also play a part    to answer the this question they would need to compare europeans and asians a task that quickly surpassed the capabilities of their penandpaper approach    instead they generated 20000 simulated or fake datasets of what presentday genomes might look like for each of five different scenarios including multiple mixings and dilutions these were used to train a neural network to distinguish between the different scenarios    once trained schraiber and villinea ran their real data  the frequencies of neanderthal chunks in both europeans and asians  to see which model fitted    what it spat out was theres multiple admixtures says schraiber    whether this occurred in short bursts or at low levels for an extended period of time is difficult to say says schraiber but dilution in europe if it occurred was a minor contributor    its not too surprising but its good to have further support for multiple events says evolutionary biologist alan cooper from the university of adelaide australia who was not involved in the study
the picture remains a complicated one early humans mated not only with neanderthals but also with denisovans and neanderthals and denisovans also hooked up    and while neanderthal genes flowed into the human lineage is seems the reverse didnt occur    another big mystery says cooper is why neanderthals from western europe to eastern asia are so genetically similar unlike the denisovans which form genetically distinct populations    more fossils  and more ancient dna from those fossils  will help to answer such questions    i think more so than getting more neanderthals and denisovans getting more modern humans from across europe and into asia will help to tease out the complexities in human ancestry says schraiber
holy shit i didnt know that dna could be recovered from fossils
  why the fuck are a caveman and a hippy in that picture pretty sure prehistoric roasties didnt have tie dye tank tops
  it is just a picture dont be so autistic
  your just a faggot dont take it personally
  your
  africans are the only pure humans
  hasnt it been long established that the primary neanderthal breeding range was in asia with europe being only an occasionally colonized periphery or is that just drugs
neanderthaled
  humans  homos maybe but humans include neanderthals sonope
  prehistoric roasties  jek
  wrong nigga theres 2 different species all of which being ghost populations the one who interbred with west and central africans was closer to homo sapiens than we are to neanderthals all humans are mutts
evolution is a hoax
you love daddys neanderthalithic monster cock dont you
  africans are the only non humans
  neanderthals were humans just not modern humans us  they were either another species of human homo or possibly a strange subspecies of homo sapien
white liberals present themselves as less competent when addressing minorities while conservatives use the same vocabulary no matter what the race of their audience according to a newly released study    yale and princeton researchers found that both white democratic presidential candidates and selfidentified liberals played down their competence when speaking to minorities using fewer words that conveyed accomplishment and more words that expressed warmth    on the other hand there were no significant differences in how white conservatives including republican presidential candidates spoke to white versus minority audiences    white liberals selfpresent less competence to minorities than to other whitesthat is they patronize minorities stereotyped as lower status and less competent according to the studys abstract    cydney dupree yale school of management assistant professor of organizational behavior said she was surprised by the findings of the study which sought to discover how wellintentioned whites interact with minorities    it was kind of an unpleasant surprise to see this subtle but persistent effect ms dupree said even if its ultimately wellintentioned it could be seen as patronizing    the study flies in the face of a standard talking point of the political leftthat white conservatives are racistwhile raising questions about whether liberals are perpetuating racial stereotypes about blacks being less competent than whites    the paper which is slated for publication in the journal of personality and social psychology first examined speeches by republican and democratic presidential candidates to mostly white and mostly minority audiences dating back 25 years          
ms dupree and princetons susan fiske analyzed the text for words related to competence such as assertive and competitive and words related to warmth such as supportive and compassionate    the team found that democratic candidates used fewer competencerelated words in speeches delivered to mostly minority audiences than they did in speeches delivered to mostly white audiences said the yale press release the difference wasnt statistically significant in speeches by republican candidates    ms dupree noted that republicans also gave fewer speeches to minority audiences    the researchers then set up an experiment in which white liberals were asked to respond to hypothetical individuals named emily and lakisha    liberal individuals were less likely to use words that would make them appear highly competent when the person they were addressing was presumed to be black rather than white said the release no significant differences were seen in the word selection of conservatives based on the presumed race of their partner    ms dupree said the competence downshift could indicate a greater eagerness by white liberals to connect with those of other races    my hope is that this work will help include wellintentioned people who see themselves as allies but who may be unwittingly contributing to group divides said ms dupree there is a broader need to include them in the conversation
lol moonies  ms dupree noted that republicans also gave fewer speeches to minority audiences  you dont say
  yale and princeton researchers found that both white democratic presidential candidates and selfidentified liberals played down their competence when speaking to minorities using fewer words that conveyed accomplishment and more words that expressed warmth
ive noticed this in my day to day life living in nyc tbh    my liberal friends always dumbs down their language and/or speaks kinda off compared to normal    when i talk to a hoodrat they always seem generally surprised that i talk to them in full clear sentences im an attorney like theyre a competent person i always see it in their face and demeanor they actually seem to be appreciative of it in a way
  they actually seem to be appreciative of it in a way    probably because the average person talks to them with low expectations
well no fucking shit
  claim to be the party for minority rights  change your behavior based on racial expectations   literally be racist  liberals are hypocrites  more news at 11
i dont think its literal cognizant hypocrisy per se i think its attempted empathy gone too far  white liberals often spend a lot of time worrying about coming off pretentious to minorities due to their beliefs about minority education its not an attempt to condescend toward their intellect even if it is so rather its an attempt to compensate for what they perceive to be their socioeconomic disadvantage    but on the other hand seeing that article has made me realize that i do it too and also that people dont like it when you highlight their faults or disadvantages in that way so its obviously something i gotta work on
  maybe its a sign that youre a racist liberal
imagine how shocked i am right now
special counsel robert mueller said in a court filing monday that paul manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to investigators since signing the agreement    in the status report which was filed after the parties had asked for a delay in the previous deadline manafort denied that he had not been cooperative    mueller and manafort had come to the plea agreement in october just before the case against the former trump campaign chairman in dc was about to go to trial a jury in virginia convicted manafort in the case mueller brought against him there where the charges focused on bank fraud and tax fraud allegations that mostly predated the 2016 campaign    in the plea deal manafort plead guilty to conspiracy against the us and obstruction of justice related to allegations of witness tampering    abc news reported earlier this month that tensions had been rising between manafort and muellers team over manaforts level of cooperation    read the court filing below    
  alt source because i was tyring to find out what exactly he lied about    manafort had been fielding questions about a wide range of topics since september when he initially agreed to cooperate the sources said but special counsel prosecutors were not getting what they want one source with knowledge of the discussions said     so he what exactly lied about having information on trump to cut a plea and then didnt provide anything he said he could provide  because if so corsi also refusing to sign a plea deal at the same time sounds like there might be trouble in muellerland  
  whats more likely is that since this came right after trump answering questions for mueller mueller has something pretty big he can nail manafort on he wouldnt have filed this if he didnt have proof and if it wasnt something worth expending the effort on
  im tired of hearing about muellers big something big surprise incoming bombshell    there isnt gonna be one this is all about wrapped up we know who the players were and what they wanted
  two reasons this is happening    1 manafort is going to take trumps pardon and fed mueller false information    2 look at the timeline this happens right when trumps protector whitaker is installed at the justice department
  what i find fucking baffling is that this shit isnt considered conspiracy theory
  whats more likely is that since this came right after trump answering questions for mueller mueller has something pretty big he can nail manafort on  that seems highly unlikely given that trumps lawyers combed his responses with with a micrometer    he wouldnt have filed this if he didnt have proof and if it wasnt something worth expending the effort on  i feel like you have way too much emotionally invested in the belief that theres anything for mueller to find in the first place
  there is nothing to find  however even though there is nothing to find i will try my very hardest to not answer questions in person because my own lawyers are scared of me perjuring myself  i will also try to eliminate avenues of the investigation from occurring by directly implementing political puppets to try and limit the investigation  all because theres nothing to find totally what innocent people do  implying trump is not a criminal is your first problem because anyone whos lived in nyc for longer than five years knows he is literally a criminal and a conman regardless of whatever else hes done thats not so public information
  because anyone whos lived in nyc for longer than five years knows he is literally a criminal  so why didnt the very democratic district attorney of new york ever prosecute trump for his literal crimes before he became president
  why dont i sue disney for abusing copyright laws  why do transnationals get to pay no tax  why do big pharmacies get to use criminal uncompetitive business practices to ensure medicine prices are multitudes more expensive than they should be  the law for the most part does not apply to rich people you are naive and unacquainted with the ways of the world if you think otherwise   probably poor too because its always the poor thinking that the world is totally fair and that social mobility will be given to them by the totally trustworthy and transparent literal conmen and wealthy swindlers
  implying trump is not a criminal is your first problem  its not but continue my child    because anyone whos lived in nyc for longer than five years knows he is literally a criminal and a conman  cool still not russian collusion and nothing dug up has anything to do with financial crimes in nyc from that time thank you for playing
  why dont i sue disney for abusing copyright laws  because the law allows them to do so  why do transnationals get to pay no tax  because the law allows them to do so  why do big pharmacies get to use criminal uncompetitive business practices to ensure medicine prices are multitudes more expensive than they should be  because the law allows them to do so    the law for the most part does not apply to rich people  well if donald trump hasnt violated any laws i guess hes not a criminal  probably poor too  i make more than the vast majority of americans
  cool still not russian collusion and nothing dug up has anything to do with financial crimes in nyc from that time thank you for playing  the report isnt out so i really dont know why you think this is something you can comment on
  why dont i sue disney for abusing copyright laws  you cant afford the legal fees  why do transnationals get to pay no tax  they do if they repatriate their funds  why do big pharmacies get to use criminal uncompetitive business practices to ensure medicine prices are multitudes more expensive than they should be  the wonders of a government granted monopoly    the law for the most part does not apply to rich people you are naive and unacquainted with the ways of the world if you think otherwise   youre naive and unacquainted with the ways of the world if you think all rich people are treated equally  probably poor too because its always the poor thinking that the world is totally fair and that social mobility will be given to them by the totally trustworthy and transparent literal conmen and wealthy swindlers  spoken like a true eugenicist
  the report isnt out so i really dont know why you think this is something you can comment on  the very fact that they allowed trump to answer written takehome questions proves this if mueller had anything actionable he would be digging his heels in
  because the law allows them to do so  because the law is flexible depending on how good your lawyer is and also because big business is gradually assimilating control of it   just because you change the rules to fit yourself doesnt mean that you arent breaking the original rules that everybody else plays by    well if donald trump hasnt violated any laws i guess hes not a criminal  he has though just not the ones that a good lawyer cant get him out of   i make more than the vast majority of americans  this is a text board so ill just let you know that i dont even have an image smug enough for you      you cant afford the legal fees  of course i cant nobody can afford the legal fees to sue disney that doesnt make what theyre doing any more or less legal  they do if they repatriate their funds  but do they  the wonders of a government granted monopoly  you really arent doing yourself any favours by avoiding the point completely doesnt make it any more or less legal    youre naive and unacquainted with the ways of the world if you think all rich people are treated equally  for the most part   its really like you cant read  spoken like a true eugenicist  i know reading comprehension is not your strong suit but even an idiot could figure out im in support of social mobility
  the very fact that they allowed trump to answer written takehome questions proves this  after a whole year of nuh uh i dont want to  the metaphorical heels were dug long ago but the baby cant handle being questioned by a professional legal team   shocker
  implying that trump has told his lawyers everything or anything
  implying you dont have to treat trump with kid gloves to get him to do anything
  just because you change the rules to fit yourself doesnt mean that you arent breaking the original rules that everybody else plays by  well it turns out that the definition of criminal and crime are determined by whats codified into the law and not what you wish was codified into the law    he has though just not the ones that a good lawyer cant get him out of   well maybe the county of new york should have elected a better prosecutor    maybe manafort should have gotten one of those lawyers
  maybe manafort should have gotten one of those lawyers  maybe trumps children should have because theyre about to take the fall for him
  well it turns out that the definition of criminal and crime are determined by whats codified into the law and not what you wish was codified into the law  you really think that the criminality is determined by whether or not you have violated the literal definitions of laws   the point of lawyers is to interpret the law and manipulate it enough to suit whatever the suit requires the codification you refer to does not exist because the law is flexible from case to case   well maybe the county of new york should have elected a better prosecutor  and if you knew anything about how the court works you would also know that defense is much stronger than the prosecution in the house thanks to precedent and vocabulary wank    of course you dont though
  well the news is dumb for constantly repeating the phrase bombshell and wearing it out but the fact remains that mueller has not yet presented his findings    similarly you have no fucking clue whether its actually close to wrapping up because he does not leak everything is just speculations
the word of the day is parallel construction    its been my assumption for the entire time this has been going on that cia/nsa have known the score at every step of the way since summer of 2016 but the vast majority of that stuff is inadmissable in court the reason this whole shitshow is dragging out so long is because theyve got to build a proper case that doesnt rely on legal authority stemming from gwbera antiterrorism laws
  because trump is either telegraphing or doing it in plain sight   remember when he admitted to lester holt he obstructed justice on national tv or how he was dangling pardons over peoples heads and while not overtly saying it greatly implied if they didnt implicate him hed pardon them
  the point of lawyers is to interpret the law and manipulate it enough to suit whatever the suit requires  trial lawyers do not interpret the law lawyers advocate for interpretations of the law which are handled by judges which are just as likely to be democrat appointees as republican appointees and are tested before a jury    and if you knew anything about how the court works you would also know that defense is much stronger than the prosecution  the budget of the prosecution usually exceeds that of the defense by a shitton
  telegraphing or doing it in plain sight  thats what the truthers were saying about sandy hook and crisis actors or the pizza gate theorists and podestas/acostas posts    if you have a theory that trump conspired with the enemy to get elected what would that make you
  except they have no proof the proof of trump conspiring with a hostile foreign power is in plain sight from how almost everyone on his foreign policy staff had ties to russia the timeline of events russia get the emails trump tower meeting trump calls for russia to find them emails are released trumps behavior throughout the investigation or how hes been putins cockholster
  carnivore
  but they have no proof  now let me outline why my theory about a conspiracy is superior by listing off a bunch of circumstantial claims
  let me describe why my conspiracy theory is superior to other conspiracy theories
  theres a reason why enpugh circumstantial evidence is good enough for most judges justices and criminologists at this point with everything coming out as regularly as it is youre the one who better have something good against all the circumstantial evidence
    cringepilled
  dont sink to their level
  pardon only covers federal charges state will still get him on other charge
    uh oh
  i like how in spite of the fact that manafort has already been convicted trumps first instinct upon finding out he lied is to blame mueller    again
  i think its more likely that trump is well aware that manafort lied perhaps even specifically instructed him to but is blaming mueller because he is desperate to discredit the investigation    and honestly its not working its not like theres been an increased demand for the investigation to end if anything its gotten lower
  he does it because its working  
  its not though
  but trumps constant lies and the fact mueller doesnt refute them is altering public perception   the big lie does work and trump is proof     on the other hand mueller tipped part of his hand in regards to how hes dealing with the russian conspiracy against the united states and its why trump is shitting himself because its not just the actual crime of hacking but those who received and disseminated information meaning stone and his network are all coconspirators and it might also ensnare trump and his family   
  does it i always just assume trump is lying about everything
  the vast majority of people alive today arent you    thats why  helpfully linked you a poll which you ignored because you personally assume trump is lying about everything all the time
  assume trump is lying about everything all the time  assume  the selfdelusion is strong with trumptards
  you apparently didnt look at the article people trust mueller over trump overall and overall people think mueller is doing a fair investigation how is the lie working out for him if mueller still has support from the majority of the country
key mueller witness i lied and im ready to die in jail    in a blockbuster interview key mueller witness and roger stone associate jerome corsi admits to msnbcs ari melber that he lied to congress that he tried to get stolen clinton emails back to the trump campaign in 2016 that he absolutely intended to help the trump campaign by doing so that he told roger stone about john podestas emails and that his lawyers are still communicating with trumps legal team as if there is a joint legal defense ari melber also presses corsi on being a leader of the birther movement which ari describes as a total and complete lie and asks him whether he is auditioning for a trump pardon by bringing the subject of pardons up during the interview    
  dude is clairvoyant lol  you cant be surprised people dont believe you when you have foreknowledge of something so specific
  ive been trained in public relations by edward bernays  wow thats a snake if ever saw one
    the incessant manipulation of the public consciousness is finally eating itself
    millennials have been accused of ruining a lot of things sitcoms cruises department stores cars and more while some of the blame may be warranted a new study from the federal reserve suggests its not totally their fault    the study titled are millennials different explores the economic wellbeing of the generation it found that millennials spending habits arent necessarily the issue but the fact that they have no money to spend reports npr aside from the common refrain that millennials merely prefer to spend money on experiences not things the demographic simply cant afford the conspicuous consumption of generations past    the study considers millennials to be those born between 1981 and 1997 and explains that they have paid a price for transitioning into adulthood during the great recession not only did they face historically weak labor demand reports npr but they also struggled through tight credit conditions    statistically millennials are far less financially stable than earlier generations when they were the same ages they have lower incomes more debt fewer assets and less wealth    these financial obstacles have shaped the millennial attitude towards saving and spending the study reports causing them to be more economically conservative than previous generations that were more established in their careers and lives at that time read more at npr
  meanwhile republicans are letting the rich hoard all the money  french revolution style class war here we come
  if you make money you shouldnt have to give it to subhumans just to coddle them    poor people are worthless parasites they disgust me
maybe they should have thought about their financial situation before taking out loans for that that degree in postcolonial gender studies
did they really need a study for this
  i agree why must the taxpayer provide corporate welfare
  how much do you make faggot
  the trust fund i received when i was 18 was fifteen million usd    not exorbitantly rich obviously but far more than ill ever need im not a spendthrift
  this is why we need to abolish federal regulation on student loans   dont guarantee them dont make sure everyone gets them make it an actual financial transaction if your loans arent backed by the government they wont loan you money for a bullshit degree and high paying degrees like medicine and engineering will get discounted rates because they know those students will be good for it
  they want students in debt for life over worthless degrees though   thats how you make a modern day slave
  the neoconservative republicans and corporate democrats maybe  trump can pick off enough enough progressive democrats to fix the system and make up for the loss of neoconservative republicans
  trump can fix the system    ok
    french revolution style class war here we come    theyll have to put their phones down to make that happen
  you think democrats have other plans
  the larp is hard with this one
    bullshit degrees arent as prevalent as they seem the people who get them are a tiny minority compared to stem law business and other traditional degrees the only reason why it seems like a bunch of people have such retarded degrees is because those idiots are the loudest and spend their time flinging shit on the internet to prop up their causes those idiots also have connections that get them into things like video game journalism where standards are low which also gives them a soapbox to seem more important than they actually are as such i wouldnt consider dumb degrees and their financing via loans a massive generational problem its just a convenient scapegoat so people can play politics    however this doesnt mean that student debt isnt a problem schools can charge crazy money because loans are easy to get and college degrees are now considered essential even though they arent actually needed for many jobs a good chunk of students will not get a job related to their degree which drives up demand and therefore prices the system needs a fix but i dont think degrees in underwater basket weaving are the core of the problem
  im 100 serious my parents made quite a bit of money when the internet was young before the dotcom bubble
  you literally didnt earn your wealth why would you hate someone for not being lucky enough to have rich parents
  people without money arent spending money  and they needed the feds to tell them this
  yes because boomers used to spend a lot of money even when they didnt have it so the kikes are genuinely surprised that we arent riddling ourselves with more debt than necessary
  this credit is fine when you know your income is stable and so you can make more or riskier investments  with the current job security landscape its not the case anymore its not a matter of generations doing things differently its mainly conjuncture and probably reasonable behaviour in this current mess
  its also programmed a lot of us to just not treat money that way     i have a stable job and yet even though i could almost certainly deal with it i am almost pathologically opposed to loans i hate on some primal level the idea of spending money i dont have
  because its still my families money poor people want to bring everyone down to their level
  what happens if your family decided to cut you off what would you do then
  its almost like we shouldnt have a system thats okay with kids who two weeks ago had to ask permission to use the bathroom taking out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to pay for school
  this is why we need to abolish federal regulation on student loans   dont guarantee them dont make sure everyone gets them make it an actual financial transaction if your loans arent backed by the government they wont loan you money for a bullshit degree  yeah thatll happen surely the loan industry wont just jack up interest rates to keep these people in debt until they die
  the larp  what does larp stand for
  underwater basket weaving is just an example of the problems of the disconnect between the cash value of the work you do and the cost of your degree
  okay so they jack up the rates on your student loans for your psychology degree  then you finish school and declare bankruptcy because you have no chance of paying off your loans  the solution to subprime degrees isnt government bailing out banks or ensuring low rates but people who cant afford to take massive loans for something that wont make them any money not taking out those massive loans
  5/7
  except you cant get rid of student loans through bankruptcy so you still have to pay them anyway
  why cant you get rid of student loans through bankruptcy    federal regulation  this is why we need to abolish federal regulation on student loans
  a new study has shown that implementing ubi will actually grow gdp
  they cant cut me off the money is already mine
  do you go along with everything scientists say
  go away fucking intern
    a young millionaire spending the weekend on 4chins instead of being out drilling the hotties     larpus maximus
  youre right global warming is totally a hoax
  im a neet    believe it or not but life is pretty boring when you have enough money to get everything    about the only expensive hobby i have is buying figurines    heres the last one i bought heather from silent hill 3     
  i actually believe in global warming i dont believe giving free money to vermin and accruing more debt will benefit the economy though    just giving money away to every tyrone and jesús is naive
  well going by what this article is saying most people in our age group are now vermin almost certainly including yourself
  why cant you get rid of student loans through bankruptcy      because literally everyone would do that they only allow you to rid yourself of students loans through bankruptcy in extreme circumstances for which almost no one ever qualifies even if you do they still put you on a payment plan we should make higher education free instead of flooding everyone into trades and ultimately driving the wages down in those industries higher education is valuable in its own way that maybe you probably dont understand a lot of upper and mid level management positions require 4 year degrees and so does the becoming an officer in the military believe it or not being able to write 20 page papers on random shit can be very important in office environments
  and what are you going to do with all that money
  probably just larp harder
  the same thing im doing right now play videogames and collect figurines and anime    its pretty boring honestly sometimes i wish i had something to work for
  you could do anything you want but youre just lazy because you were never taught or learned to have a work ethic you could start a business go to school to become something join the military for an adventure or just travel with your own money you have to plenty to work for but youre just too stupid to see it
  not denying that but its just not gonna happen    im just gonna chill and play vidya read and watch anime till my body gives up on me
  at least donate to a worthwhile charity or something
  fuck off  you donate yours if you think its important
  i do and im nowhere near as rich as you claim to be youre literally a parasite youre acting like i told you to donate your entire fortune if you donated a measly ten thousand a year to some charity you might be able to make a difference in someones life you refuse to use to your wealth to better your own life and then even further refuse to use it to better other peoples lives youre a waste of space air and money if i were your parents i would feel horrible to have had such a stingy hedonistic child such as yourself
  hes one of those people who defend the rich because he imagines himself so great that he will obviously and inevitably in his own mind at least become rich some day soon very soon this is a known phenomenon in psychology and such people actually comprise the majority of the population this is where trump/republican voters all come from  dont leech off of the money that i dont yet have but i will some day i swear
  a new study has shown    meaningless especially in the fake science known as economics
    its anons money let him do as he wants lol good on you anon im not set like you but ill never work for another person for life because i put all my savings into a nest egg that i got off the ground and now 40 acres of 25 cbd hemp can run itself while im making plans to move to cr next year
  whether you like it or not the people in power will follow these studies economics as a field may be an excuse for what the powerful were going to do anyway but neither can you stop them or if you think you can go ahead and try try to stop them
  dumb fuck dsa bernie bros arent in power those are the only people who support ubi yeah but im sure the rich and powerful are just lining up to give your neet ass free money lmao
  he thinks ubi is bernie bros  can you see how ridiculous you are
  fake smugness isnt going to save you from sounding retarded as fuck you worthless neet loser nobody serious is discussing ubi your friends on reddit and twitter dont count
  no one would even know what ubi even is if the main stream media werent planting it in our consciousness
  you really are mentally ill as fuck
  and without ubi what exactly do you think will happen when automation is adopted to the point of wiping out tens of millions of jobs
  wiping out tens of millions of useless people of course why would the rich keep you around just to consume resources
  bill gates suggested taxing robots then slave master lawrence summers came in and said no no no were still on track with ubi so guess what will actually happen
  neither of those guys have any control over policy making nor do they even have lobby power compared to even middling industry groups lawrence got passed over by obama for a woman lol
  lobby power  they are each figure heads who spout what industry wants
  that wasnt me to answer your question i do donate to several wildlife funds
  conspicuous consumption  the very phrase makes me want to puke
  people who hoard wealth do so by the labor of others
  and future generations will be even poorer no fucking surprise here the people in power are eating their own and their ways of business and governance is not only burdening their own into death but it is also selfdestructive to those whom are in authority and even their families
  people dont earn money anon its given to them much like your case except yours was from family 9999 of people who are given money arent given a fair wage for their work well i know pharmacists that only compare pictures with meds on a computer screen whom get paid near 200k to basically sit on their asses and get fat meanwhile the techs and assistants are going home with hurt backs sore feet suffering at schooling etc and they are given 30k people who have authority to change this massive disparity of pay wont because they believe in their indoctrination instead of understanding that theyre to blame for their employees suffering because they neglect their finances people think there is an infinite number of jobs out there but masters make up a role and position for a task in order to make money whilst giving as little as possible there are far less jobs than people in the country and it has always been the case so the argument of getting another job is a poor one especially when the grand majority of jobs do not pay livable wages because of a plethora of reasons some of which is because of the law regulations taxes loans insurance jews in general
  whether you like it or not  and therein lies the problem the masses are becoming woefully out of sync with their own governments to be expected considering what was done to the family unit and the religious bullshit thats out there and when it all comes crashing down theyll know it was their fault for trusting the wrong sciences instead of simply looking for themselves a leader who only acts after advisers advise him is no leader but simply a middle man for selfinterested parties to throw information at
  violence the kind where there is no victor unless they change their ways but history has shown that theyre incapable and too incompetent to develop an idea thats actually good
  just lay down and die impoverished masses lol  words said right before being escorted to the guillotine
  yeah and then the revolutionaries and proles wind up killing each other afterwards which is why the people why the upperclasses will go back to bribing the poor like they used to instead of trying to kill them all off    an endless orgy of blood and death benefits nobody
  oh ive got no illusions that a violent revolution would be a bad thing thats why im in favor of ubi and starting experimenting with it asap so that all the kinks are worked out by time we really need it
  violence the kind where there is no victor unless they change their ways but history has shown that theyre incapable and too incompetent to develop an idea thats actually good    as long as they can stay engrossed the idiocy that spews from their smart phones there wont be revolts of any sort
  loving how nobody has been able to answer you  the biggest sucker of the government tit is the fucking rich the corporations the banks and their owners who get bailed out and then give themselves huge bonuses which is still happening they deserve for their dollars to be worthless since our generation wont be using them
  as long as they can stay engrossed  they cant when they cant afford smartphones or you know food and shelter because tens of millions vanished within a generation
  and no one believes you provide some proof that everything you say isnt a lie or youre just another stupid attention whore

well well well  it all makes sense /pol/ aka r/the_donald are a bunch of betas who attached themselves to trump        from boasting about the size of his penis on national television to releasing records of his high testosterone levels president trumps rhetoric and behavior exude machismo his behavior also seems to have struck a chord with some male voters see for example the donald trump finally someone with balls tshirts common at trump rallies    but our research suggests that trump is not necessarily attracting male supporters who are as confidently masculine as the president presents himself to be instead trump appears to appeal more to men who are secretly insecure about their manhood we call this the fragile masculinity hypothesis here is some of our evidence    what is fragile masculinity    research shows that many men feel pressure to look and behave in stereotypically masculine ways  or risk losing their status as real men masculine expectations are socialized from early childhood and can motivate men to embrace traditional male behaviors while avoiding even the hint of femininity this unforgiving standard of maleness makes some men worry that theyre falling short these men are said to experience fragile masculinity    the political process provides a way that fragile men can reaffirm their masculinity by supporting tough politicians and policies men can reassure others and themselves of their own manliness for example sociologist robb willer has shown that men whose sense of masculinity was threatened increased their support for aggressive foreign policy    we wanted to see whether fragile masculinity was associated with how americans vote  and specifically whether it was associated with greater support for trump in the 2016 general election and for republicans in the 2018 midterm elections
how fragile masculinity was related to voting behavior    we measured the popularity of these search topics in every media market in the country during the years preceding the past three presidential elections in the map below darker colors show where these searches were most prevalent in 2016    we found that support for trump in the 2016 election was higher in areas that had more searches for topics such as erectile dysfunction moreover this relationship persisted after accounting for demographic attributes in media markets such as education levels and racial composition as well as searches for topics unrelated to fragile masculinity such as breast augmentation and menopause    in contrast fragile masculinity was not associated with support for mitt romney in 2012 or support for john mccain in 2008  suggesting that the correlation of fragile masculinity and voting in presidential elections was distinctively stronger in 2016    the same finding emerged in 2018 we estimated levels of fragile masculinity in every us congressional district based on levels in the media markets with which districts overlap before the election we preregistered our expectations including the other factors that we would account for    in the more than 390 house elections pitting a republican candidate against a democratic candidate support for the republican candidate was higher in districts that based on google search data had higher levels of fragile masculinity however there was no significant relationship between fragile masculinity and voting in the 2014 or 2016 congressional elections this suggests that fragile masculinity has now become a stronger predictor of voting behavior    notably fragile masculinity was unrelated to support for female candidates in the 2018 elections once we accounted for the fact that female candidates are more likely to be democrats than republicans
it therefore appears that fragile masculinity doesnt reduce support for female candidates but rather increases support for republican candidates of any gender    heres the takeaway    our data suggests that fragile masculinity is a critical feature of our current politics nonetheless points of caution are in order    first the research reported here is correlational we cant be entirely sure that fragile masculinity is causing people to vote in a certain way however given that experimental work has identified a causal connection between masculinity concerns and political beliefs we think the correlations weve identified are important    second it remains to be seen whether any link between fragile masculinity and voting will persist after trump exits the national stage we suspect however that trumps reengineering of the gop as a party inextricably tied to many americans identity concerns  whether based on race religion or gender  will ensure that fragile masculinity remains a force in politics    
one of trumps most consistent qualities is his boorish machismo he always needs to prove that hes the biggest the toughest the best  in other words the manliest hes not at all subtle about it either this is the guy who once literally bragged about his penis size on a presidential debate stage    unsurprisingly however men who try this hard to be manly are often the least secure in their manhood  and new research suggests that these ultrainsecure men are exactly the ones most drawn to trump and trumpism    two researchers at new york university social psychologist eric knowles and psychology doctoral student sarah dimuccio wrote for the washington post about the data they gathered showing that fragile masculinity correlates with support for trump    fragile masculinity they explain is what happens when an unforgiving standard of maleness makes some men worry that theyre falling short these men worry so much about losing their status as real men in society that they overcompensate with stereotypically masculine behavior and attitudes and shun anything even remotely feminine    measuring how many men actually feel this way is a bit tricky since fragile masculinity is all about putting on a show for the world and refusing to admit your own vulnerabilities the researchers couldnt exactly get this information by asking men about it in a questionnaire and expecting them to be truthful    so they turned to the one place where people can be most honest about their deepest fears and desires google search results    the researchers came up with a list of search topics related to insecurity about living up to the ideals of manhood  the phrase how to get girls and search terms related to erectile dysfunction hair loss penis enlargement penis size steroids testosterone and viagra    having searched for these things doesnt mean youre insecure about your manhood and being insecure about your manhood doesnt mean youre all about maga
nonetheless these search terms came up more frequently in areas where trump won in 2016 even when the researchers controlled for other demographic factors    fragile masculinity was also higher in areas where republican house candidates defeated democrats in the 2018 midterms    but interestingly this is a recent development fragile masculinity wasnt correlated with support for mitt romney in 2012 or john mccain in 2008 and it didnt affect voting patterns in congressional races in either 2014 or 2016    so fragile masculinity isnt inherently a republican thing its a trump thing but trump has now so completely dominated the republican party that it has become a republican thing    this data also tracks with other research we have on the effects of masculinity and sexism on politics    support for trump in particular was also found to be connected to hostile sexism hostile sexism is exactly what it sounds like a type of sexism that is overtly hostile to women or at least to women who dont conform to the gender norms you expect hostile sexism is the bad cop to the good cop of benevolent sexism  putting women on a pedestal as long as they conform to the gender norms you expect
fuck drumpf and fuck all dumb drumpf people   they are dumb  and stupid  as this article proves
  boasting about the size of his penis on national television  did he actually do that
man haha glad i dont support that drumpf idiot lmao what a loser
men compensate  who would have known
omg this is fucking epic  sharing this on my discord
i looked up some data about american population and it turns out that the number of women is higher than the number of men here is my source ttps//wwwstatistacom/statistics/737923/uspopulationbygender/  and here is another one     therefore i propose that a typical trump voter is a sexually frustrated housewife or a lesbian sufferring from hair loss    i have sacrificed whole 2 minutes of my life to find resources countering that quack hypothesis i have heard that the quality of education in usa is nothing to write home about but those people writing for washington post have exceeded my expectations dear american journalists why dont you give statistics another try this is not how it is done maybe make it a mandatory part of getting a degree in journalism and psychology since the authors claim to be psychologists it works in other countries i wonder how they even do research in their respective fields
   you missed the absolute shitshow that the republican primary debates were other candidates were making fun of his smalls hands and trump went on to say he had a big dick   of course stormy daniels then exposed that lie saying he had a tiny mushroom dick        you should write for the federalists with that crack research youre cranking out dont waste your time here
last i heard upper arm girth corresponded to political persuasion with the greater the arm girth the more conservative you are    i guess this means that the bigger your arms the smaller your dick
  this smacks of false flagger like a boss who the hell actually says that are you someones grandpa your rocker need a little oil    anyway has anyone asked if the commander in chimp thinks he has such a bigly tadger because of his baby hands to anyone else it might look like hes flicking his bean just saying
  no shit sherlock spend some time lurking on /pol/ without drinking there figurative kool aid and you will see there constant attempts to make the world around them see what big badass tough guys they are its really sad
  and what cities have the highest rate of murder because someone stepped on your shoes chicago and detroit two democratic strongholds that have been blue for decades who saw that coming
  that was some weak deflection then again you have lowt as a trump supporter so i can see how it would be hard for you to muster the strength to do it
  why are leftists so obsessed with penises
  its the one conservative value theyve internalized
  voted trump probably has a small dick and is secretly an effeminate as well t washingtonpost  another quality article how do you guys do it
  kek sure op what ever you say what ever helps you sleep at night looney tunes 
  interesting the map op posts is basically a map showing where white people live and where niggers and beaners live looks like white people are less likely to search that shit white people are more likely to support trump  hmmm it almost seems like its bullshit     the media shouldnt be trusted the decay of the old media newspapers tv because of new media like social media and forums means theyre desperate when the media is desperate fact checking objectivity are out the window
  lecturing anyone about statistics after forgetting what voter turnout is  lmao
  its another anon cant read a map episode
  closeted fag detected
  erectile dysfunction is a physiological condition its not insecurity
  thinking you have it is an insecurity or trump supporters are more likely to have it
  releasing records of his high testosterone levels  has he actually done this what was his t level
  top fucking kek
this week on low quality journalism articles written in the us learn how to discredit another political persuasion by using google analytics to cross reference embarrassing search terms until you find some that roughly match up with general regions on a map and then call it science and claim that real science is not possible in the matter  up next people in america just may be retarded watch how we view areas if the us that have searched google for the phrase am i retarded and see how it has been searched from everywhere in the us proving all americans are retarded
  surprisingly it turns out only californians and texans are retarded  
      this level of damage control from /pol/  if you look at the research they show that these patterns only apply to trump and not previous republican candidates     both in the basis of the subjects      and previous studies were done using it and no one was able to point flaws in the study or methodology    
  might  washington post  shareblue has the same headline  drumpffff  fuck off already
  did you actually ask that
  tinfoil intensifies
  whats funny is if you look at the study this correlates with older men who objectively have dick problems because theyre old  the muh trumpf boaters was shit tacked on at the last minute by tabloids
  washington post  and into the trash it goes
  furthermore this is for internet searches not trump votes there is no correlation proven because this isnt a poll of trump supporters its a poll of internet searches    delete this fucking retarded thread
  youre forgetting one thing correlation does not imply causation  even if it did darkest areas on that map are big cities which were staunchly blue notice its quite dark wheer miami norfolk el paso new orleans montgomery atlanta ect are its almost as if larger populations have a higher volume of internet users
  new orleanian here central and west louisiana have the super dark brown new orleans is seconddarkest brown
  these places have more old men  the damage control on this guy i swear
  darkest areas on that map are big cities  except for yknow new york la chicago boston san francisco portland or seattle
  even if it did darkest areas on that map are big cities which were staunchly blue  man i dont want to step into this argument because its childish as shit to insult someones manhood and i cant believe this shit passed muster at the post even for the monkey cage section ive never heard of but i dont think thats correct    first of all ill give you the benefit of the doubt for reading ops map wrong because its based on what i assume are some arbitrary google regions instead of state boundaries meaning you have to overlay a map of state boundaries to figure out where the fuck anything is ill also say that the map is shit because it doesnt give a scale we know that darker colors means more searches but it doesnt give quantities for colors nor does it say if its corrected for population and not an absolute value    so as to why i think youre wrong a lot of those extra dark areas when overlaid on a map of population density heres the 2010 census map for that  have few people living there for instance the dark patch in western texas does not include el paso which is the only high density area in western texas theres also that dark patch in what appears to be wyoming and the cluster of dark areas in west virgina again areas with few people and then theres that small region in michigan with zero population but apparently got its own region for google for whatever reason    based on this  and  id say the map actually corrects for population again something that should have been written on the map to start with and the dark areas do not correlate to high density more liberal areas          so i looked into this too and there doesnt appear to be any correlation between the median age of a county and the search density
  asked 300 men  millions of posts from 10 years of data proves that op is always a fag
according to a study of 300 anons there is a 100 chance that op is a faggot
this board is cancer
    philly antifa activist tom keenan charged in assault on marines  the alleged attack occurred on november 17th near the we the people rally    last week we told you that the philadelphia police department was asking for the publics help to identify a group of people who allegedly attacked united states marine corps reservists in old city and now police say they have one suspect in custody tom keenan who has been associated with philadelphias antifa movement    investigators say that a group of men and women maced punched kicked and robbed the reservists near front and chestnut streets on saturday november 17th around 320 pm the group allegedly called the reservists nazis and white supremacists    a spokesperson for the philadelphia police department says that the case is still open and that they continue to investigate the other suspects police have not released the identities of the accusers and it is unclear whether they participated in the we the people rally or the counterprotest in any way
  the right is so dumb
  who is the right
  look at his double chin why are nazis so fucking disgusting
  anyone whos not a psychotic leftist      theyre just modern bolshevik trash and its amusing the way think that its everyone but them thats hateful
  the lefts bogeyman
  leftist neckbeard spergs out and hurts random people  this is obviously the rights fault
  that is a picture of the antifa activist who was arrested you fuckwit  take a moment for some self reflection
  he is one of yours though
  since when are anarchists leftists
  since 1932
  proving my point    the right is controlled by their emotions not by logic
ive noticed a pattern here  every time its proved without doubt that antifa are violent thugs drones will flock to the threads and attempt to muddle any discussion with post like these        
anti fukups should be deem a terrorist group  stamped out like the uninformed scumbags they are thanks board of education commie trash
  thats the pot calling the kettle black  mushroom
  tsubhuman
  for about a century now keep up
  antifa are violent thugs  you do know marines beat the shit out of other marines every single day right
  t republican revisionist
  because thats their job
    and two more white nationalists bite the dust
  no shit leftists are cowards and obfuscators these radical homos never learn theyre first to the firing squad when the new regime needs stability to promote legitimacy
  leftists are cowards and obfuscators  and yet theyre somehow also the most violent
  obfuscating my post live on 4channel  you need a new hand book
  courage and violence arent related     ie poisoning mob attacks bombings  none require courage but they are all violent
  you think he didnt know that exhibit a on lying leftists
  they require courage to go through and actually do it  a drone strike or ordering solders to shoot refugees like trump is cowardice
      antifanazi  chill out boys lol
  what
  in my eyes antifa is the new wave of facism they kinda remind me of hitlers brown shirts they also force there ideology upon other people and are extremely racist this is why i believe them to be a bunch of cock sucking nazis
  oh no hes retarded
  what
  think trump should lock up every antifa wack job in a insane asylum fuckers are absolutely insane lol all they want to do is kill people and destroy shit a normal person does not think like that
  nice dubs dubs why am i retarded
  the left are dumb also but theyre also cowards     if they werent they should come protest and riot here in the deep south and see what happens
fuck off back to pol
damn and he really does look a typical antifa too
  in this case the marines couldnt do shit if they threw hands with a civvie no matter the reason they would be fucked
  hey answer me why am i retard
  did this ever work
this is what the average lib on r/politics and /news/ looks like
  hey just wanted to let you know for your own safety if you are involved with antifa groups get out now and publicly denounce them     we know where you live      reminder thought that all leftists and liberals tacitly approve of antifa that means hurting anyone who votes for democrats is morally justified
this guy isnt going to have much fun when the real neonazis in prison get his ass    fyi this is what happens to left wing punks in prison    that night donaldson was lured into a cell by a prisoner who claimed that he and his friends wanted to discuss pacifism with him in their cells he was then anally and orally raped dozens of times by an estimated 45 male inmates he suffered additional abuse a second night before he escaped from his tormentors two of whom were pimping him to the others for cigarettes and collapsed sobbing at the cell block gate where guards retrieved him after a midnight examination at dc general hospital during which he remained handcuffed he was returned to the jail hospital untreated either for physical injury or emotional trauma
  you sure told those libtards whos boss
  lol you snark like a 30 year old woman who hasnt gotten fucked enough
    what antifa barakstein shillhousen try to do eat the reservists
  like something out of pulp erotic lit not bad
  ive noticed a pattern here  every time its proved without doubt that antifa are violent thugs drones will flock to the threads and attempt to muddle any discussion with post like these    shareblue shillstein has been taking lessons from josef goebbels if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it    its not just that the shill who shitposts ceaselessly on /news/ is an idiot shareblue shillstein is deliberately words like nazi fascist etc where the do not apply
  dont leave me hanging buddy
one emailer wrote you are a disgusting vile jew  this is our country youre merely living here for now    a caller said you should have died in the holocaust with the rest of your people    but the calls that most disturbed tanya gersh consisted only of the sound of gunshots being fired    the terror campaign  known as a troll storm  was the result of daily stormer publisher andrew anglins december 2016 directive urging hundreds of thousands of readers to harass the jewish woman and her family according to court filings    gersh sued the known neonazi on wednesday a montana federal judge denied anglins motion to dismiss the case holding that speech in encouraging antisemitic harassment was not entitled to first amendment protection    the montana mother found herself in anglins crosshairs in late 2016 after richard spencer a household name in the altright movement gained notoriety when a video of him shouting hail trump at a conference of nearly 300 white nationalists  and the nazi salutes it elicited  went viral    spencers mother sherry spencer owned a ski home in the otherwise idyllic town of whitefish mont after facing local protests related to her sons views she reached out to gersh who in 2016 worked as a real estate agent about selling the property    subsequently court filings allege sherry spencer decided not to sell months later she published a blog post on medium accusing gersh of extortion threats and denouncing her sons views    the next day anglin called his own readers to action    
are yall ready for an old fashioned troll storm anglin wrote in a dec 16 2016 post on the daily stormer website the article titled jews targeting richard spencers mother for harassment and extortion  take action was the first of 30 about gersh on the neonazi site    anglin also relayed a set of instructions just make your opinions known tell them you are sickened by their jew agenda    to assist his white nationalist reader fam anglin doxed gersh her family and friends publishing their personal contact information online including phone numbers and email addresses    southern poverty law center attorney j richard cohen who filed the suit on gershs behalf told the washington post in the old days maybe the klan would burn a cross on your lawn to intimidate you nowadays neonazis have other ways to harass and intimidate    gersh immediately began receiving hundreds of violent and hatefilled phone calls emails voice mails texts and social media posts there were death threats and messages that threatened to drive her to the brink of suicide    anglin and his followers even targeted gershs 12yearold son according to attorney david dinielli also of the splc one twitter user suggested the child look inside an oven for a free xbox  a reference to the gas chambers used during the holocaust in nazi death camps anglin himself posted an image with gersh and her sons face superimposed on a photograph of the auschwitz concentration camp    court documents note that by spring 2017 the family had received more than 700 violent and threatening communications    the trollers used every root to terrorize gersh dinielli told the post calling it intrusion into seclusion she had to erase her presence on the internet and entirely retreat from her life    in his court filings anglin argued that the first amendment protects his posts on the daily stormer and that he could not be held responsible for his readers actions
chief judge dana l christensen of the us district court in missoula mont disagreed    christensens decision noted that anglins attack on gersh was not to inform the public about a matter of public concern more the evidence seemed to show that the publisher goaded his readers anticipating their reaction to his call to arms    anglin did not use speech about gersh to raise awareness for issues consonant with the altright agenda christensen said in his written opinion instead anglin drew on his readers hatred and fear of jews rousing their political sympathies he called for confrontation and action    christensen said anglin exploited the prejudices widely held among his readers to specifically target one individual    marc randazza anglins attorney declined to speak with the post though the new york times reported that he called christensens decision dangerous for free speech    wednesdays decision does not end the case which will proceed to discovery and trial phases gershs lawyers still must prove that anglin is liable for invasion of privacy among other claims    there is no first amendment right to call upon hundreds of thousands of readers to launch a public attack on a private individual with the intent of ruining her life thats simply not something that our constitution protects attorney dinielli said    successful litigation could offer an avenue of recourse  though a timeconsuming and costly one  for victims of online harassment and trolling    hiding behind a keyboard is an insufficient mask dinielli said well find you and the courts will hold you accountable
  trollers  5/7 perfect repartee
  hes right you can be antisemite plural not antithisspecificsemite
  you are a disgusting vile jew  based
  so this is the power of the alt right figures bet the vast majority of them would shit themselves once they are confronted with criminal charges
  there is no first amendment right to call upon hundreds of thousands of readers to launch a public attack on a private individual with the intent of ruining her life thats simply not something that our constitution protects attorney dinielli said    this is useful
idiots serves them right
    you seem happy that the first amendment is being destroyed bet you wont think its as amusing when the future muslim majority start doing it with liberal ideology
  first amendment is being destroyed  its not you still cant yell fire in a crowded theater without having to go jail its not an absolute right it never was
    inciting panic is not the same as insulting someone you cant even compare the two
  harassment is far more than just insulting someone
  insulting someone is not the same as inciting an online mob to ruin someones life you cant even compare the two
are yall ready for an old fashioned troll storm   jews targeting richard spencers mother for harassment and extortion  take action  just make your opinions known tell them you are sickened by their jew agenda  truly a shocking incredibly fucked up call for violence this terrorist must be locked up for life
  ah yes more plausible deniability bullshit im glad the judge had no trouble seeing through this    its amazing how trolls have gotten so stupid that they think plausible deniability exonerates them of wrongdoing you can just see them smirking because they think theyre the most clever people in the world get fucked in the ass by the justice system you obnoxious dipshits
  i think plausible deniability sucks
  im a retard who cant think in anything other than quippy greentext  not even going to read it
  ok
trolls in here going mmuh free speech mmuh first amendment    dumbshits fortunately a duly appointed federal judge gets to decide what the first amendment actually protects not you    it would be protected free speech to raise awareness for altright issues it is not protected free speech to deliberately attempt to ruin a specific persons life because they disagree with you
itt /pol/ppets show they only care about the 1st amendment when it protects them and dont realize that it doesnt protect them in this case because calling for violence against an innocent individual
  but he didnt call for violence
  1 calling someones home to send death threats is harassment   2 daily stormer is specifically urging people to harass a specific person
  i cant believe they complain about the antifa doxing them and then turn around and try to argue that doxing is free speech their whole ideology is based on hypocrisy literally they hate jews because they believe jews act the way they aspire to neonazis are the real kikes
  complaining is free speech  who is it filing a lawsuit over speech here
  but muh free speech something  please provide hilarious spin resident /pol/ retards      lmao well played absolutely hysterically funny
  you didnt seem so concerned with this when liberals do this like all the time    this is why liberals are not americans they have no american values
  this is really a fight about which group of original settlers were the real americans isnt it the jamestown colony and their descendants or the plymouth colony and their descendants just because the north had different values does not make them amoral and it doesnt make them any less american you dont get to claim monopoly on americanism and which set of values is american and which isnt
  theyve always been cowards who think they can do whatever they want and then hide behind the law when things start getting hairy except they dont actually understand the law on more than a surface level well this is what it sounds like so this must be what it is really its such a fucking pussy move to go out of your way to provoke people and then try and say ha ha free speech when they fight back
  heh heh heh its a fine precident that should come in handy however something tells me they wont allow this to be applied to victims of left leaning social hit squads trying to get people fired for upsetting them
  something tells me that youre fucking stupid and dont see the difference between this and that
  why dont you go to court and find out    it worked for the christian baker
hitler/erdogan/putin/assad/etc put people in jail without trial for saying literally anything against them  fakin based hehe stoopid libtards deserveit  american judge says nazi calling for violence does not fall under free speech  reeee mmuh free speach  jesus fuck you nazi rightwingers and lolbertarians are pathetic shut the fuck up or just end your miserable lives
  call for group of mentally unstable unamerican bigots to harass person  person gets death threats  but he didnt call for violence  i just slathered with you honey and dumped you in the middle of bear country but i didnt call for a bear to maul you
  telling someone to kill themselves is not free speech according to a recent us court ruling    american judge says nazi calling for violence does not fall under free speech  but thats not what the judge said    lolbertarians are against tyrannical dictators and typically in favor of free speech at least that is a consistent viewpoint unless they subscribe to some kind of karl popperesque self contradicting paradox on free speech
  not the other guy not a liberal or conservative for that matter and looking in from the proverbial outside whenever either side does this its absolutely fucking wrong and takes away from whatever the topic at hand is because the retards on one side do it that doesnt make it ok for retards on the other side to do it and whoever it is needs to be held accountable  its always literally one side doing it and defensively screaming well it was ok when they did it fucking memery is ruining us
  wow did you learn all that from /pol/   why dont you go back stay there forever and tell your buddies to stop spilling out to the rest of the website
  yea shut the fuck up being against free speech is inherently unamerican those were all european settlers who signed onto the constitution eventually your point makes no sense
  why dont you go back to /pol/  if have nothing but ignorant prejudiced hate to spew /pol/ would be a more appropriate board for your shit posts
  stay ass annihilated tumblrite 4chan isnt a safe space
kek
  so much irony
  from you
  fun fact the idea that shouting fire in a crowded theatre is the limit to free speech was originally stated by oliver wendell holmes in a ruling that sent a group of jews to prison for writing a newspaper in yiddish protesting american involvement in the first world war    that being said someone receiving messages that their time in the country is limited that they deserve to die and then getting a phone call in which they hear gunshots isnt wrong to think this might constitute a threat
its funny because bismarck is german
  bismarck would be disgusted with the neonazis if she were alive today theyre an embarrassment
  if she were alive today shed probably vote afd given her combined nazi ancestral and japanese cultural heritage
  unlikely nazis are disgusted by neonazis
  id imagine that theyd be more disgusted by the migratory policies of the cdu than by anything afd could come with up    i dont think you can construct any sort of worldview in which an actual nazi votes for germanys current policies
fuck nazis
  depends on what your definition of an actual nazi is there were nazi soldiers who served the nazis in battle but did not necessarily agree with nazi leadership

 hail trump      nazi salute    the stupidity never cease to amaze     do these people not realize a person like trump was everything a socialist like hitler hated     you would think people who call themselves neo nazis would understand the differences between capitalism socialism and communism
  anglin literally makes his living off supporting people that he hates if you go back and look at his history he supports literally anyone even mildly conservative and even a bunch of liberals because he knows it will ruin their image   the fucker glows in the dark
  what exactly is his final goal
  to get lots of money he makes money off of this thats the only way he can his reputation is too fucked to seriously make money on his own  hey support someone i dont like here is x under the table  deal
this thread has become a /pol/ppet refuge site  you do realize hiros going to be watching this lawsuit closely if the nazis lose because it means hell be held liable if you all do the same thing right   of course you dont
  hiroyuki is protected by section 203 law which gives him absolute immunity to whatever bullshit anglin is assdeep in right now
  i dont think hiro is watching anything closely see the thing is hes a lawbreaker himself he lives in france because the moment he sets foot in japan theyll arrest him for tax evasion hes a piece of shit who knows exactly how to run away and avoid justice how fucking fitting that this man is the one sheltering /pol/tards
  most of his legal trouble in japan is libelbased because japan doesnt grant thirdparty immunity for publishing the speech of others
    are you fucking retarded  oh no i hav to share opinions with other people on 4chan this isnt what my discord promised me at all  why are you fucking crying you stupid baby everyone i dont like is a polppet and a nazi is a great train of thought if youre on twitter or reddit not if youre on 4chan    you guys are fucking imbeciles and watching you piss yourselves because you have to share a board with people who have different opinions would be funny if it didnt destroy what was otherwise a perfectly good board
    back do your containemnt board
  stop posting opinions leave me alonee this is my place  ha no
  look at the shitty baby so angry that he couldnt even take ten seconds for a spell check in his generic go back to that place that has the opinions i dont like post
      back do your containemnt board
  please let me shit in my board this board is mine  no its not you go back to your containment board   
    back do your containemnt board
ive been on a hundred political boards and ive never seen another board bitch as much as /news/ does about having to share it with people who they dont agree with  you bitch more than leftypol     you dont even make an attempt to argue with the opinions you dont agree with
  oh no i hav to share opinions with other people on 4chan this isnt what my discord promised me at all  and yet youre the one triggered that people here dont share your opinions really makes you think

  you were literally shitting on the website itself solely because it hosts people whose opinions you dont like
  expecting a /pol/tard to be logically consistent  its not gonna happen rick
      back to your containment board
  muslims  not a conservative culture    bro what planet are you on the world is not divided into liberal and conservative politics is demographics right now and muslims are conservatives but because theyre nonwhite and nonchristian and because americans forget their own country engineered the entire middle east crisis right now republicans and the right are opposed to them    conservatives dont care about conservatives  they care about religions and race
what are you guys like 12    do the decent thing and ghost out when you lose the argument or ignore each other and reply to someone else whos an easy target    internet arguing is not hard newfriends but you still gotta go do your day job and play video games sometime
  he cant even link properly  lol newfag
  that would require rightards to realize that they lost the argument and ive come to realize theyre not smart enough to comprehend when they have been defeated they are consistently the only people i have met who just keep responding no matter what instead of running away once theyve been btfo
  what youre describing are neocons  classical conservatism really just cares about small government
  this is probably because you dont argue with leftards over politics
  if what youre defending is american values then i hope muslims and pajits shit up and down our streets for years to come at least their shit is honest and in the open unlike the storm shits that resort to prank calling to harass people because all they know is the small ignorant and stupid world they live in
  more like people who brand themselves right to appease their massahs holding their chains cant argue with logic because it destroys their pathetic world views
  good thing us 4channers are so smart and good looking and never make up bullshit and are just as fallible as any other internet forum board where people pretend they have knowledge of something theyre totally unaware of their ignorance of    4chan is literally the same as twitter and reddit and only newfags argue otherwise because they think theyre part of a super sekrit klub that excludes normies and only allows redpilled consorts in    you have to be a brainlet to think that youre truly anonymous on 4chan lots of ways to track people down if you want to start shit irl
  pretty much
  lots of ways to track people down if you want to start shit irl  lol
  this is entirely appropriate calling for the harassment of another individual constitutes a threat to that individual my only concern is that this standard is not evenly applied and that this case is more of a political hit job than one motivated by justice this doesnt change that the ruling is appropriate but it does mean that you have to pay attention and ensure that it is likewise enforced in all other appropriate situations else it is violating the fourteenth amendment if not the first
  this guy gets it /pol/tards love to spout shit about opinions and being contrarian beacuse it allows them to defend any retarded value anybody who gathers their ideology from a satirical anonymous weaboo politics board is 100 retarded
  kill all jews thats free speech  bbut im not responsible for saying that ok    what a cowardly little shit if hes so proud of encouraging racist lynchmobs he should own the consequences that ensue
  an unfair call for your termination is a far cry from a constant barrage of deaththreats that could turn real at any moment though r/donald and /pol/ muppets arent exactly famous for their courage
  of the millions of liberal public figure death threats that were issued last year not a single one was carried out    threats were issued and people were shot but the overlap between the people issuing the threats and the people doing the shooting was zero
  kill all jews thats free speech  who said that  you  youre the one typing out antisemitic statements
  this probably wont even apply to left leaning people calling for the killing of certain races    remember how drexel university professor george ciccariellomaher tweeted that all i want for christmas is white genocide and never apologized or lost his job over the tweet
    hasbros new monopoly for millennials isnt winning too many fans in the age group it was meant to entertain    the new game announced earlier this week is full of millennial stereotypes that seem to have struck a nerve with the demographic    on the cover of the game mr monopoly is wearing a medal presumably from that half marathon he ran holding a coffee wearing headphones and snapping a selfie    forget real estate you cant afford it anyway reads the cover of the game    that one stings according to some millennials who took to  where else  twitter to voice their irritation over the most condescending game ever    the irony of this reaction is that it proves the point that most millennials are petulant spoiled children
  draw a chance card  you have overdosed on fentanyl  pay 5000 in medical costs
  mr monopoly is /ourguy/
  kek
  belittle your target audience with your product   wtf why dont you like it    whoever came up with this is a retard itd be like if i made life for black people and the only options were become a rapper become a professional athlete or go to jail
    you forgot working for airport security or the dmv
  i think its stealthmarketed to the parents of millennials  our kids fucking suck  lets play this game that openly mocks them
  whoever thinks the millenials are the target audience is a retard this is clearly made for every other generation to mock them openly
  this is clearly made for every other generation to mock them openly    or perhaps just to understand them   god knows i cant figure them out
  actually according to this article its flying off the shelves
  my my someones a deeply offended snowflake
  sounds like the game triggers normies    i shalt buy a copy
  cringe
  makes a reasonable response      muuhh buuthurt snoowflaake   the state of conservatives and boomers
  forget real estate you cant afford it anyway  that hit a bit too close to home
  welp that is actually a major millennial problem anxiety inability to deal with difficulty giving up before youve started the word snowflake hits at the heart of the problem and while i disagree with the use of the term since its pejorative and hence unhelpful you have to admit that the underlying condition is very real this if nothing else should not be tied to any political persuasion
  hasbro themselves says millenials are the target audience in the article shame on people who take things corporations say at face value i guess
i was born in 1990 but became a homeowner at 25 and dont really care about stuff like this maybe i am one of those fake millennials
  shame on people who are unable to poke fun at themselves translation millennials
  congratulations you are a proud member of the 4 out of 10 millennials who are home owners a historic low
  poking fun at yourself and having a big toy company poking fun at your economic problems are slightly different things there
  nigger what the fuck are you even talking about youre jusr making statements retarded and generalizations about us millennials because youre old decrepit and coming to realize that no one loves you so you need to pass your bitterness and empty world view onto the next generation
  93 and 23 for me wife and i are considering bringing this to game night since we are close to the lowest income but somehow the only ones with real estate and a 401k
as a millennial i can confirm that millennials are mostly shit
  im a millennial i just happen to be interested in this issue
  oh so just because your problems are borderline lifethreatening they are somehow no longer funny you joyless killjoy you
do not worry mister zelda is here to save you from all of your life problems
chance cards say sexual harassment accusations go to jail
  if a fucking board game offends you you are a snowflake a gentle little bitch who cant take a little ribbing
  the economy is the bwasst its been in a while if you still struggle with that then thats on you
  you cant afford a home either
  as a genxer i can confirm most of us are shit too so i think the pattern can be safely extended to every single generation  if anything were shit in different aspects but shit nonetheless
  forget real estate you cant afford it anyway reads the cover of the game  anyone who thinks this is actually for millennials is retarded
  well who is it for mr brainiac it literally says monopoly for millennials do you think this is some fucking postironic advertising no i dont think so hasbro is just retarded is more likely i dont think the advertising would work either way if it is for someone else because again it says monopoly for millennials which boomer is going to buy monopoly for millennials when there is actual original monopoly
  hasbro is just retarded  answered your own question there boyo
  we can compare it to handicapped products like snuggiehowever you spell it or those self spinning utensils the person on the cover isnt who it was made for if you put an ounce of thought into it
please tell me avocado toast is a card in this game hasbro would business is the year
but who is it for boyo if it is not for millennials
  probably for people who still use boyo unironically
  lmfao  xd
  didnt answer my question i see well that is one way to reply and text is more exact than a picture i dont think the monopoly is made only for the monopoly guy because he is on the cover thats your retarded idea im talking about the big text monopoly for millennials
please tell me they have a card that has something to do with soy and a get out of tumblr rehab free card
  we can talk about computer peripherals like razer products are for gamers by gamers  neither is true  its called advertising
  and the fact hasbro has saidwith many of us being millennials ourselves we understand the seemingly endless struggles and silly generalizations that young millennials can face and we cant even so we created the game to provide fans with a lighthearted experience that allows millennials to take a break from real life and laugh at the relatable experiences and labels that can sometimes be placed on them you really have to have a twisted postironic mind if you still think it is not actually targeted for millennials even if hasbro says it is for millennials and the package says monopoly for millennials of course anythings is possible and it is targeted for boomers or someone else but it is very very unlikely given the facts
  arent razer products targeted at gamers
  yeah so they can break after using it for just 3 days just so they can make you pay more to send it back and repair it even with a guarantee    and its not even worth that much a lot of products with the same specifications come cheaper 4 times at least
  not really its more of a logo so others think you are  like sports apparel its not for the buyer its more for those who see the buyer
  prob by millennials who think its ironic or something
  bs on that last bit even older people around admit theres nothing for the young people where im at all jobs are either outsourced being so regulated that it is no real way of life or part time jobs like working at a store or doing odd jobs here and there   the standards of living dont help and almost everyone is struggling so i decided to look into the military service
  hasbro would business is the year  a say what now
  so razer is not for gamers ie people who play games  and monopoly for millennials is not for millennials even though they literally say it in the package and has said it in an interview  that must mean that diapers for babies are not for babies but fullgrown hairy men  and cats are not cats but dogs  everything is the opposite what they say just because it is advertising cant be trusted
  it really says a lot about millennials when they swear on their mothers lives they will never ever buy a game meant for them simply because it said some mean words about them at this point were all just a bunch of minitrumps running around acting like the world owes us everything and throwing temper tantrums in the cereal aisle when we dont get it at the tender age of 20to30something and in some cases 70something
  and cats are not cats but dogs  everything is the opposite what they say just because it is advertising cant be trusted  kek this is gold
  so because its targeted at stupid or young or naive gamers its not for gamers thats some tardo logic right here
  by going into the military youre only delaying by a few years what you will have to deal with when you return anyway thats why so many veterans are struggling even homeless
  youre not wrong but going into the military is a good springboard    there are homeless vets i understand but many of them have severe ptsd
  with russia and china on the move i suppose the entire economy should just convert to one big militaryindustrial complex again some of our biggest bouts of prosperity did seem to follow major wars so  check this out    it contains a pdf released by the pentagon that outlines their plans to redirect dod away from insurgencyfighting and refocusing on nation states
  im sorry your life has led you to become this
    this reminds me of how people are wondering if the draft should be enforced again i dont believe so as these days there are too many who wouldnt do good in the military especially in combat hence the whole reason why the recruiting process is rather strict
  what are college expenses and real estate value
  forget real estate you cant afford it anyway  this coming from a major corporation is fucked because of just that line i thought it was photoshop until i opened the article its like making fun of boomers getting foreclosed on in the recession
  this coming from a major corporation is fucked because of just that line i thought it was photoshop until i opened the article its like making fun of boomers getting foreclosed on in the recession    that was funny too  stupid boomers
the captains of industry put mommy to work to increase their economic growth by a factor of two with no one home mommys children were raised by their nanny television the captains of industry are today genuinely surprised that mommys children turned out feral
  yup  now everything is so expensive were all fucked
  or a teacher
  or working for the federal gubment
oh brenda if only you knew
  that was funny too  stupid boomers  kek i laughed at this lynch me if you want i dont care anymore
  spot the shill
imagine if hasbro made a dustbowl/great depression monopoly game people would be up in arms
  lol wut who would care about that
imagine if people made a 4th century bce/macedonian conquest of the near east board game people would be up in arms
  lol no one because no one had money to buy board games anyway
  i cant stop laughing at your post you must be made out of gold in real life sir
  the irony of this reaction is that it proves the point that most millennials are petulant spoiled children    please point out a generation that isnt that one that was born after the 1940s in america
  i cant  i cant okay
  or the military
  ugh i wish i was born in the 60s they had real music back then like the beatles everyone else in my class just listens to stupid justin bieber
  whats most amusing is that the beatles were notoriously antiwar and all the rightwing millennials who hate their own generation certainly would not be fond of anything the beatles had to say
  a little while ago i saw a tweet that was a guy whod supposedly been listening to rage against the machines for years get mad that he now suddenly realized theyre political and then he listed some neutral acts hed listen to instead there was stuff like nwa and public enemy
  all the rightwing millennials  i seriously hope you dont use this website as a measuring stick for how right or left millennials are you should rather look at the stats which show were overwhelmingly berniebros young right wingers mostly live in corn fields the reason there are so many of them here is that word got out that /pol/ is redpilled so they all flocked here in 2016 thats it
  draw a chance card  woman you had sex with last night found out you have a girlfriend and has decided to report you for rape go to jail do not pass go do not collect foodstamps
  maybe the sex recession is whats best for everyone
  how does that work parents dont play games
  be proud and dont take shit  also make fun of yourself and have no esteem  kirr yourserf
  only a millennial could think that selfdeprecation is the same thing as a lack of selfesteem it is actually the people who are capable of being selfcritical without being down on themselves that are the ones with true confidence and inner strength and security maybe its the parents fault fine but the fact remains that what we have on our hands is an entire generation of people who are deeply insecure unsure of themselves and ridden with anxiety and whose only coping mechanism is to act outwardly arrogant and aloof and to immediately take offense at every little negative thing that might be said or even suggested about them how the hell did this happen
  if they made a boomer or zoomer monopoly they would freak the fuck out dont lie to me
  it should be obvious a generation spawned from people whos only means of control or parenting was abuse that offense you mention the same offense people have been using on their children isnt supposed to be acknowledged   what is it that you are trying to get at   acting like the motives people are working for arent their actual motives after they explicitly say this is why we do this defeats the purpose of language
  zoomers for sure theyre even worse theyre like millennials on steroids cant imagine boomers taking to twitter to complain about a game that plays on boomer stereotypes though they hardly have a presence there to begin with
  young right wingers mostly live in corn fields    young people are always liberal until they get a few tastes of reality millennials seem much more conservative than gen xers
    why would boomers have a presence on twitter twitter is even more retarded than facebook
  to bad the the only conservative party is democrats so theyre voting along with the liberals too
  im a millennium and i think this is the funniest shit ever my generation doesnt understand self deprecating humor it seems
  youre right i guess they could bitch about it on facebook i still dont see them giving a fuck theyre too busy refinancing their 401ks or whatever they do
  again the stats straight up contradict that zoomers are the most socialist literally democratic socialist generation yet
  my generation doesnt understand self deprecating humor it seems  i can tell you arent a millennial
  stats that disagree with me are a shareblue myth though /pol/ told me so
  bawwwww mooooooom this game hurt my fee fees  not him but im a millennial too i just have a sense of humor
  i dont really think you understood my post champ
  millenials dont buy it or acknowledge it  the run was greatly unsuccessful and the company lost money trying to be cheeky  millenials disprove the game and give a fuck you the only way a corporation feels it    of course thats not what happened instead they gave it a ton of attention and free advertising and caused quite the stir
  youre suggesting no one who is a millennial could possibly not be deeply offended and butthurt over this game which is ridiculous
  being that butthurt about a game proves the games point  its very millennial of you not to even understand such a basic idea
  hey not to detract from the conversation but what will be the name for the people after the z generation aka zoomers as it seems their called now
this thread actively made me think my fellow millennials are all humorless sensitive snowflake retards
  it will be generation a1 then b1 then c1 and so on until you get to x1 y1 and z1 again and then it starts over again so a2 b2 c2  x2 y2 z2 and so on and so forth
  but the real answer is that there wont be another generation after z thats why they named it that because its the last
are we unironically getting raided half this thread is /pol/tier lol your triggered based off quite literally nothing
  personally im liberal but i think the overreaction to this is just stupid
  makes sense    then were screwed gotta head to my bunker
  this is an article literally about millennials being triggered
  there are thousands of monopoly variants to the point where i would not be surprised if there was one  
    hah fucking snowflake getting offended over a cardboard game it cannot be because of the things and messages a multibillion dollar company is heading shamelessly at you anyway  if you call a cunt somebody who previously referred to you as a nigger then you are a butthurt snowflake xd    youre not really intelligent are you
  like the other guy said its just a little playful ribbing this is not meant as a spit in the face its just that you are taking it that way for some inexplicable reason wait no on second thought the reason is very explicable youre an overly sensitive millennial i wont use the word snowflake since that seems to belong to the altright but the millennial threshold for criticism is indeed extremely low this whole thing proves that
  did someone call you a nigger when i wasnt looking
  target audience  prolly ought to see who exactly that is before you start labling them you see a bunch of board games in a 30 yer olds home now a days no
  i mean youre being sarcastic but you shouldnt be youve authored a true statement
the best part about this whole shitshow is how many great jokes we can make about the chance cards tbh    you went out for drinks went home with a girl and then kicked her out alpha move collect 100   your ex girlfriend pressed rape charges and took you to court pay the bank 5000  you tried to start up a company but got fucked by jews start over  you went to starbucks and blogged about it advance to tumblr ave
  considering im probably a millennial or an early z they keep changing the cutoff dates i think its funny cuz its true
  depends hardcore gamers tend to like all games so they would have board games but probably not simple ones like monopoly
  you see a bunch of board games in a 30 yer olds home now a days       yes actually boring white people love board games
  theyre not changing the cutoff dates its just because there is no hard and fast definition for these terms one common definition of millennial encompasses both z and y and part of x 19822000 to mirror boomer which was much broader than x y and z are individually
  what is trade school and rent  or live in a less populated area and watch the property values drop
  care to cite some sources you old fuck research has shown time and time again that younger people are more likely to go to multiple sources for news and actually do some research than older people who mostly rely on cable news look it up fag pew research
  if you do it right its not a problem you can get your degree while you serve and it depends on your mos but your mos can get you certified    t was a medic im the army  got national emt cert during training a lot states only take state emt registry but a lot of places will give you a job and a time limit to get your state cert    just one example if you got some dumb shit mos like infantry or artillery then youre fucked in terms of actual job skills dont get me wrong you can be dumb as fuck and still be a medic though
  you only cited one sauce you must be old
  maybe millenials should stop wasting money on drugs
  move to cornfield  low rent so move into apartment  apply all around town  find job making 10/hr  suddenly richest millenial in the cornfield  not a bad plan but the only jobs here that pay that well are factories and mcdonalds if you work in the factories you can kiss leisure time goodbye and mcdonalds ismt paying you 10/hr if youre crew wages are also less competitive because there are fewer jobs best way to find a good job is to get out of the cornfield but then rent goes up my point being that only old people with careers/pension money move to the cornfield because they dont have to give a fuck anymore  t person from the cornfield
  kill yourself bootlicker
  maybe you should stop beating your wife
  maybe if millenials played a game or two of monopoly theyd understand why cant they afford a house
  so if they play monopoly wages go up and house prices come down brilliant plan
i honestly wonder how theres a big enough market for all these differently themed printings of monopoly and its just a theme the core gameplay is still the same every fucking time are there really enough people out there willing to buy this or any other theme for that matter to justify a whole print run it just seems like a waste of time in terms of development and production which they could have spent one something more worthwhile like making monopoly actually fun without houserules out the ass      like the other guy said its just a little playful ribbing    eye of the beholder on that eat shit poorfag flies on this site as bants because theres an unwritten social contract that we can be complete assholes to each other here and nobody will really care it also works among friends because everyone involved understands that theres no real malice behind the words however when the insulter is some unknown third party like a large corporation it becomes hard to judge intent and this is usually where insult humor stops working    and its not like large corporations are above directly insulting their customers so you cant go with the theyre a business so they wouldnt drive away customers so they must be joking defense go on /v/ for five seconds and youll get plenty of publishers/developers calling gamers all sorts of vile shit that could never be put under the umbrella of just kidding
  dont worry if you got vet preference you can still be dumb as shit not be remotely qualified and take away government jobs from qualified individuals because muh service only taken a freshman biology course come on in and you can fumble through fieldwork alcoholic piece of shit whose never on time and has a bad attitude well turn your seasonal into a permanent job spend your day as a law enforcement officer looking for beat up old cars on craigslist to flip harass fellow employees for minor offenses or for sending emails and be heavily suspected of emotionally abusing your wife hell well promote you and look the other way
  as an ohioian this is very funny
  top fucking kek even hasbro is btfo of millennials
  whoever started the generational naming was retarded
  i think he/she just thought generation ecks sounded cool and then someone came along and said welp what should we call the next one iunno y and millennials were born at least we got the word zoomer out of it
  go on /v/ for five seconds  this do i will not
  i dunno apple treats its customers like walking piles of shit with a bank account they do their best to drain empty and they keep coming back for more
  someones uninformed  look up someone by the name of jean twenge search google for jean twenge antlantic  first result    this is just the most highprofile reposted research but having personally researched this subject in school there are plenty more such papers corroborating her findings
  heres one more popular article just for fun  
  lost
  when i was a kid we had a duel masters themed monopoly
  yes this
  snowflake discusses the snowflake problem  its pejorative and hence unhelpful  the irony
  draw a chance card  student loan payment due  pay 2000  pine after no gf  lose a turn  female coworker takes offense to your joke yesterday  go to jail  maybe my parents would finally understand
sounds fun tbh fuck the vermin who are trying to find reasons to whine
  scientifically speaking positive reinforcement is still more effective in changing behavior sparing the rod is not what caused this it was being sheltered from failure
  e cover of the game mr monopoly is wearing a medal presumably from that half marathon he ran holding a coffee weari    you forgot rapist drug dealer and welfare recipient
  being upset your generation cannot afford to own their own homes is a perfectly valid feeling
  maybe instead of you doing nothing with your life for the past 3040 years other than drinking constantly and listening to the same journey album for the better part of 4 decades while systematically destroying our economy by shipping jobs to the lowest bidder   eat shit you lazy self centered old fucks
  its just another label designed to divide us all
  idk i like spanking with a dominatrix
  thank you op for the news watching anons in this thread gave me a good laugh
  the irony of this reaction is that it proves the point that most millennials are petulant spoiled children  history is full of examples of everyone band their dog acting like petulant children and worse not too long ago gay people werent even allowed to adopt children bin the us because it would offend the sensibilities of others there are still plenty of places where women are obstructed from abortion because it hurts religious sensibilities there was a time in the history of our country where worshipping an offensive religion was punishable by death there was a time when people believed they were entitled to own other people we still believe we are entitled to farm sentient things in horrifying conditions and fuck over future generations with unrestricted polluting millennials feeling entitled to the fruits of redistributive programs is among the more benign sorts of entitlement in our past and present
  and men getting fucked in divorce court or usually not able to defend themselves against women
  maybe millenials should stop wasting money on drugs    theyll have to take the phones out from in front of their faces first
  reddit spacing  fuck off faggot
  no u
  i dont even have a working phone lol nor do i do drugs
  then you are probably one of the more successful millennials or you are just dirt poor
  im dirt poor lol which is one of the reasons y im did paperwork with the navy
  im did paperwork  im dirt poor  i totally believe you when you say youre dirt poor
  i had a feeling that the explosion in drug use is directly caused by how childishly easy the internet has made it to get drugs if something is childishly easy expect all the children to be doing it
  based crayoneater
  itd be like if i made life for black people and the only options were become a rapper become a professional athlete or go to jail    fucking kek id play the shit out of that
  hi my name is mosche judenleech of golem enterprises we would like to discuss your infringement of copyright of our latest game modern kangz
  it made sense to be liberal back then
  that anon again and rotfl    i use the library computers also we can just manage to pay the internet bill each month tho its hard
  poor  types like a retard  went into the military  checks out
  be quiet no ones perfect
  also i was typing fast and didnt bother to check which was my own fault
  so what changed was the threat of becoming a minority all it took to turn white people into nazis because i think thats what this is about and about absolutely nothing else
    stupid millennial faggots have no sense of humor at all which means theyll make great communists lawl
  boomers think its funny
  buy my shitty board game or youre a communist
  genx here we didnt invent this shit the damn hippies did this
  i like it and im a millennial 25
  congratulations anon i think its stupid   i work with boomers and they make jokes about it boomers think its funny
the best thing about this game is how it literally triggers everybody on every side and age group
  genx here we didnt invent this shit the damn hippies did this    yup  cant tell you how many former dippy hippie shits i have known over the years who as who age morph into the most selfish fuck you jack ive got mine mcmansion mongering boomer idiots youve ever seen
  millennials are angry and offended about something  so what else is new
  so what generation are you from
  i dont hear any old granny ladies or gandpas from the greatest and silent generations here  everyone keeps talking about boomers x y and z
  40 and 50 year olds playing board games to complain about their 20 and 30 year old kids  if any of them are actually doing this that i dont even know how to describe the amount of pity i feel
  reading the rules  no wonder people hate it it isnt even monopoly if someone lands on your space they dont pay rent theyre just visiting because its super light hearted and not competitive
  this is basically how gamergate came about among gen x/millenials there are these smug little cunts who think they are better than everyone because they joined the right clique/niche and got nepotismed into a cush job and then they use that minor position of employment to just shit on all the other unemployed/underemployed millennial because their job is so inconsequential that they effectively have no manager/boss looking over their shoulder making sure they are behaving         this is what burns my balls the most about the current shittalking of kids these days the older generation was effectively told to go out and work be productive your kids dont worry we business and government will raise your children and they believed them turns out merchants and bureaucrats are shit parents and now an entire generation of people are basically fucked but nobody wants to admit it or take responsibility for it not their parents for abandoning their own flesh and blood to strangers and not the merchants because they never accept legal liability for anything and definitely not the intellectuals who make up the bureaucracy that never think they are wrong 12 years of state indoctrination and not a single hour is dedicated to filling out a resume filing taxes or any of the thousands of laws an adult is suppose to inherently know and understand children are ill prepared for adult hood and are instead encouraged to artificially extend childhood by paying for 4 more years of higher learning
  not the anons you replied to but your last paragraph is spot on  i wonder why apprenticeships arent pushed more i understand the need for higher college if one needs a place to stay
  this is basically how gamergate came about among gen x/millenials there are these smug little cunts who think they are better than everyone because they joined the right clique/niche and got nepotismed into a cush job and then they use that minor position of employment to just shit on all the other unemployed/underemployed millennial because their job is so inconsequential that they effectively have no manager/boss looking over their shoulder making sure they are behaving  what the literal fuck does that have to do with gamergate  gamergate was an attack on progressivism and roasties  it was about females getting unfair treatment in the undustry because they were females
what the fuck is a millennial anyways i find it crazy that a select few demographers get to label a whole mass of people a stupid ass name without truly distinct events to tie each generation to well some terms like the baby boomers and the greatest generation make some sense using ww2 as an anchor     still theres no consensus on the specific endcap dates that a millennial is some guys say those born as late as 2004 are millennials
  what the fuck is a millennial anyways  depending on who you ask anyone born between 1976 and tomorrow
anno mundi 5779  the goyim still establish social status by owning small plots of land in mass produced suburbs   oyyyyyyy
  nice get  i greatly chuckled at the comment as well
born in 1989  bought my house two years ago  had a nice juicy pension plan set up years ago  have started to get up early in morning to mowe the lawn and trim the hedges  tfw i became the 29 year old boomer
  rule of thumb someone who remembers the world before 9/11 but not before president clinton
  anno games follow the following pattern  4 digits  at least one zero  sum of digits  9  5779 doesnt match closest are 5400 and 6003
  heya  you dont hear from most of us because were busy dying
  anno games  
  gamergate at its core was the beginning of a consumer revolt as businesses gain more power and influence customers were renamed to consumers the implication being that some people simply exist to consume products it didnt take long before consumer was used a pejorative and things like customer rights and customer support started degrading consumers are basically treated like peasants and the big wigs of industry are beginning to fashion themselves as our rulers as they control our day to day lives with little to no oversight from incompetent governments whose bureaucracies have become so bloated that they are frozen due to the accumulated lag time of ever increasing regulation     when a bunch of smug shitheads decided to use their inconsequential jobs to smear an entire group of consumers with a broad brush of being bigoted sexist ect that group pushed back and reminded everyone that consumers are not mindless animals but actual people and they will only tolerate so much bullshit and thats a dangerous idea it challenges the status quo and risks rocking the boat this is why the main stream media picked up and smeared the movement and actively encouraged turning it into a joke companies like google probably stepped in and bribed moot because his response to gg was completely uncalled for other industries could not risk their own halfawake consumers to wake up and realize they were starting to get more and more fucked over by an ever growing and basically amoral system of production and consumption     most people like to focus on the edrama on the memes but gamergate was one step away of being the next occupy wallstreet in terms of middle/lower class peasants rising up and mass boycotting entire industries
  when a bunch of smug shitheads decided to use their inconsequential jobs to smear an entire group of consumers with a broad brush of being bigoted sexist ect that group pushed back and reminded everyone that consumers are not mindless animals but actual people and they will only tolerate so much bullshit  gamergate didnt speak for the group of all people who play video games any more than the talking heads at insert media outlet here did they were a subset of hysterical conspiratorial retards who got their panties in a twist that someone once called them names    gamergate was one step away of being the next occupy wallstreet in terms of middle/lower class peasants  this claim is literally unfalsifiable and thus worthless
  theyre not just bad parents there is in fact no such thing as teleparenting its the same reason that technology can never be a replacement for facetoface interaction there is just so much more stimulation going on when we interact in real life that we take for granted but this is not lost on the brain without this stimulation the brain does not develop adequately this is borne out by countless studies and these are the results
  you could have easily googled what it meant and landed on the hebrew calendar     but instead you made this post
i blame the jews
  it sounds like you dont want to work hard to get anything and most trades take place outside factory but you have to bust your ass to get paid well which doesnt sound like your forte

  buying this fucking game
the left/dems trying to kill two constitutionally guaranteed human rights with one stone free speech and the right to keep  bear arms      11/4/18    lawmakers propose social media hate speech checks before gun purchases    lawmakers in new york have begun drafting legislation that would require potential gun owners to have the past three years of their social media reviewed before they were granted permission to own a firearm    eric adams the president of brooklyn borough and state senator kevin palmer are currently writing the proposed legislation which would give law enforcement authorities the power to check up to three years of an individuals social media accounts and internet search history before they are allowed to buy a gun wcbs newsradio 880 reported one of the main aims is to identify any hate speech shared by the users as the politicians noted that such offensive comments are generally only discovered after mass shootings occur    a threeyear review of a social media profile would give an easy profile of a person who is not suitable to hold and possess a firearm adams explained according to the wcbs report    if the police department is reviewing a gang assault a robbery some type of shooting they go and do a social media profile investigation the borough president pointed out    palmer and adams insist that such legislation is needed to curb gun violence despite inevitable opposition from gun lobbyists as well as some who may be concerned about free speech    cont
    adams also pointed to last weekends massacre at the pittsburg tree of life synagogue in which 11 worshippers were killed and six others were injured the attack was the deadliest to specifically target the jewish community in us history  the brooklyn leader emphasized that the shooters social media accounts would have raised serious alarm bells if such checks had been in place under existing laws in pennsylvania which would not be impacted by a new york policy shift all the shooters weapons were bought legally according to police    there would have been a clear indicator of the shooter in the tree of life shooting in pittsburgh the brooklyn politician said according to spectrum news ny 1 the profile of a person who was mentally unstable of purchasing or possessing a firearm would have been flagged    despite the claims of the powerful gun lobby the national rifle association and many politicians who often receive financial support from the organization studies have consistently shown that stricter gun laws correlate with fewer firearm fatalities cnbc reported earlier this year    in fact the rate of deaths by firearms in states where guns are only lightly regulated  such as alabama alaska and louisiana  is more than four times higher than those with some of the strictest laws such as new york connecticut hawaii and massachusetts    end
    from a legal standpoint this is absolutley garbage and a huge infringement on 1st 2nd and 4th amendment rights     the rate of deaths by firearms in states where guns are only lightly regulated  such as alabama alaska and louisiana  is more than four times higher than those with some of the strictest laws such as new york connecticut hawaii and massachusetts  cherry picking states like vt and nh also lightly regulate guns and also have lower gun death rates which btw is a bogus statistic than states like ny and ct    i look forward to this bill being doa and going absolutely nowhere
   cherry picking    indeed crime has always been and continues to be a local issue    the city of detroit only makes up 7 of michigans population yet accounts for 50 of the murders in the state
  i mean if youre not openly talking about killing bloggers on facebook or twitter or gab i dont see what the issue moreover hate speech is not protected by the first amendment
  amazing how you managed to reply to my post but not actually reply to anything my post was actually about
  i mean if youre not openly talking about killing bloggers on facebook or twitter or gab i dont see what the issue  the issue is that hate speech is a constantly shifting definition thats been used to describe what some consider wrong think arguments like i dont want to pay for other peoples healthcare  that aside leaving discretion up to law enforcement to decide what constitutes appropriate social media behavior for being able to practice an enumerated constitutional right is fascist any way you put it    moreover hate speech is not protected by the first amendment  hate speech is absolutely protected by the first amendment
  scotus has ruled what hate speech is the definition hasnt changed whether its protected speech or not has no bearing on whether its use should prohibit someone from buying a firearm
  scotus has ruled what hate speech is the definition hasnt changed  theyve also effectively ruled that hate speech is constitutionally protected speech but you knew that    whether its protected speech or not has no bearing on whether its use should prohibit someone from buying a firearm  it is because if its protected speech it ais legal and b cannot be used to deny another one of your rights this is how the kkk while abhorrent doesnt lose their right to assembly because they engage in public demonstrations of hate speech    restricted speech as far as violence goes must contain an actionable  credible threat
    amazing how you managed to make two posts with correct english when its not your native language
  youre missing the point that adding usage of hate speech to the standard background check for gun ownership is not restricting your usage of hate speech
  moreover hate speech is not protected by the first amendment    try again    
  youre missing the point that adding usage of hate speech to the standard background check for gun ownership is not restricting your usage of hate speech  depriving you of constitutional rights for exercising your freedom of speech in ways the government doesnt like is a violation of the first amendment
  the government isnt depriving you of speech by adding usage of that speech to a background check for gun ownership you are still perfectly free to shout out loud everything short of yelling fire in a crowded theater or creating a public nuisance
   adding usage of hate speech to the standard background check for gun ownership is not restricting your usage of hate speech    wtf is wrong with you its a violation of both the 1st and 2nd amendments
  no it isnt the government is not telling you that you cant use hate speech only that if you choose to use it then you might not be able to buy a gun anywhere else but a gun show or private craigslist deals
  the government is not telling you that you cant use hate speech  the government may not use the machinery of the state to punish or discourage speech it does not like to do so is a violation of the first amendment
  nice try but the feds already added mental health facebook posts to the gun background check its a small leap to add hate speech to the same restrictions
  its a small leap to add hate speech to the same restrictions  no its not because the first amendment stands squarely in its way    the government may involuntarily commit you to a mental institution if you are mentally ill it is not therefore a small step to involuntarily imprisoning you for hate speech it is a massive step that requires the demolition of about fifty years of first amendment law
  i suppose it depends on if usage of hate speech is a mental illness im willing to bet most experts would associate the two
  i suppose it depends on if usage of hate speech is a mental illness  it would be really nice if you could get courts to agree that everyone you dont like is mentally ill but the current state of jurisprudence makes that rather unlikely    im willing to bet most experts would associate the two  i look forwards to seeing this sentence in a supreme court brief
  killing antifa terrorists is every americans duty when the revolution hits the streets you commies will all get the bullet and we have plenty of them for all of you silver spoon white privilege college commie socialist leeches hell ill give you two free bullets each just because im generous
  okay
  batejpg
  id love to see your revolution unite the streets of inner city chicago against you oh theyre better armed than you btw
  right wing terrorist
  as a liberal who loves guns hates the rich and fears a police state and the oppression of free speech im okay with this  this is how you stop attentionseeking psychos
  having any social media in 2018    got rid of that shit almost 4 years ago and never looked back anyone with a brain could see that it was eventually going be used to as psych evaluations by the gubmint
  he thinks the government doesnt know about 4chan  i hope youre posting from like 7 proxies anon
  youre missing the point that adding usage of hate speech to the standard background check for gun ownership is not restricting your usage of hate speech  thats explicitly what its doing    the government is not telling you that you cant use hate speech only that if you choose to use it then you might not be able to buy a gun anywhere else but a gun show or private craigslist deals  then thats the same as the government telling you that you cant use hate speech learn 2 law      nice try but the feds already added mental health facebook posts to the gun background check  citation needed
  
  421   i suppose it depends on if usage of hate speech is a mental illness    mental illness being used as an excuse to disenfranchise political opponents is an old and well worn tactic of authoritarian regimes on both ends of the political spectrum legitimizing this tactic to hinder gun rights or shitty facebook posts could easily come back to haunt the left in many unfortunate ways and everyone could potentially suffer from that kind of creeping state authority
  the shit you post here will never be reviewed by the goverment unless you start posting violent threats
  yeah thats not signed into law its a proposed but failed bill that was discharged in february    
   the government is not telling you that you cant use hate speech    use one of these vaguely defined prohibited words and youll lose a constitutionally guaranteed right    how is that not a violation of both the 1st and 2nd amendments
  checking mental health id unconstitutional   are you guys sure youre not a third world country because you look like mine but white
          wheres the part about sifting facebook posts for mental health issues
freedom of speech means freedom from consequences   every  single  time  lmfao
  freedom of speech means freedom of consequences imposed by the state    its cool if you dont believe this but it just indicates that youre a legally illiterate retard
   the government can strip you of your constitutional human rights if you say a bad word   what constitutes a bad word is undefined and open ended   commiepinko democrats are totally cool with this    every  single  time  wtf
  except they missed the part where most firsttime shooters have nothing to suggest theyd do it
   checking mental health id unconstitutional    random government apparatchiks with no medical training sifting thru shitposts on social media and stripping away inalienable human rights with the click of a mouse    yeah that does sound like something a thirdworld country or europe would do
  nah if you have a history of being public about your dipshit political schizophrenia you should be thrown into a mental asylum for the rest of your life not rewarded with a gun the only reason faggots like you are clutching your pearls is because you know youd top the list
  random government apparatchiks  the fbi and atf does the background checks they are not random government apparatchiks
  the only reason faggots like you are clutching your pearls is because you know youd top the list  its difficult to even fathom the kind of historical ignorance that could lead a person to believe that the political weaponization of mental illness diagnoses is something that could only be used against conservatives    they are not random government apparatchiks  everybody who works in a bureaucracy is an apparatchik
so how does it work if you do not have social media
  dont use real name on sites like gab avoid facebook like the plague and use tails linux plus blocking all cookies and do your dirty searches porn anything involving the word for a color or name of a religion price checking the gun you want there now what is on your history they would find in the last 3 years op why did you leave behind history to find sorry but if imma gonna do something that would legally stop a gun purchase i wouldnt leave evidence existing and damn sure wouldnt be in ny or any other blue voting hell hole state come to red states tn will let you get a lifetime gun carry permit and will allow me to buy guns all day with a 15 minute fbi background check that doesnt giuve to shits if i called some asshat out on facebook for being a liberal mook that rioted and looted also who fucking cares if i called him an asshat that wont legally block a gun sale on the other hand threatening to kill someone can be legal grounds to actually prevent a sale even with out your new bills getting signed
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over 300 confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
  spot the commie
  use it against liberals too i dont care these people need help not a 24/7 feeding tube of fox news and infowars
  its depriving you of your second amendment rights for using your first amendment rights hate speech is legal and not a crime so it cannot be used to deprive you of your other rights
  granted permission  allowed to  thats not how rights work
  antifa and chicago gangs are two different groups of people   i just dont see them working well together unless antifa is on its knees giving head to bgd   ownership does not automatically confer mastery of a weapon or tool  lots most i should say gangsters cops support mos and buy it and put it in a safe and forget about it gun owners are poor marksmen     dang what a run on sentence
  literally the first thing they do when they get elected is attack the second amendment   its like theyre trying to prove trump right or something
  but it does infringe on your first and second amendment rights you fucking retard   literally why live in america if the constitution offends you snowflake
  and fears a police state  yet for some reason loves enabling it
  clear anti social behaviour no guns for you
  thats an entirely different bill than the one in the op you mouth breather      freedom of speech means freedom from consequences   it does actually freedom from consequences imposed by the state for engaging in free speech  this includes consequences hat might make it harder for you to buy a firearm  thank you for following the bouncing ball have a nice day      nah if you have a history of being public about your dipshit political schizophrenia you should be thrown into a mental asylum for the rest of your life  cant wait for all of the kill whitey white men must die men are scum ess jay doubleyou pee oh cees to get thrown into mental asylums for the rest of their lives
  chicago is not nearly as armed as say rural tennessee in terms of gunspercapita chicago has a crime problem  black on black crime sure they have guns but they are not politically active i lived in chicago for 10 years then memphis for 20 years fyi choose chicago over memphis if you ever have to    the only thing that mobilizes chicago blacks away from shooting each other is when the media starts spouting bullshit about how white people are killing blacks in droves and dont even try to argue this you know damn fucking well blacks are killing blacks at 10x the rate that whites are when the revolution comes those media outlets will be the first to get burned down for inciting and dividing instead of simply informing    guns dont come with predispositions their will only exists as the will of the person holding them chicagos guns may as well not even exist because the people holding them dont care about politics as long as their welfare checks keep coming
    random government apparatchiks   the fbi and atf does the background checks     and theyre just random government apparatchiks running a search of arrest databases theyre not trained psychologists and even if they somehow were wed needs thousands of them sifting thru bazillions of shitposts on social media as facebook alone has over 2 billion daily users    so this social media background check would consist of nothing more than a computer program simply looking for key words such as trump freedom republican and automatically deleting the inalienable human rights of americans    the dems already tried this shit by demanding that americans be striped of their constitutional rights via the nofly list another wholly arbitrary star chamber of random government apparatchiks where those listed receive no explanation for how they got on the list and have no way to get themselves off it    this is just another example of the left/dems trying to do an endrun around the constitution
  so how does it work if you do not have social media    obviously you must be lying about that which automatically puts you in the precrime database and thus no guns for you
  thats an entirely different bill than the one in the op you mouth breather    yeah no shit retard but the anon upthread mentioned _another_ similar earlier bill house bill 4240 that called for mental health background checks via social media
  id love to see your revolution unite the streets of inner city chicago against you    lol the hard right literally dreams of the day when leftists/blacks/homos/etc rise up in rebellion    watchoutnazisjpg
  yes it is moshibut you knew that soon 
fuck guns
  i lost my social media in a server crash
  so i dont want a war i want peace but lets get it straight  in the event of a war cities become complete death traps theres too many people and too little space to grow sustainable amounts of food a siege cutting off the supply of food coming in and breaking core things such as electricity sewers water would put a city into an absolute state of chaos and disease there would be killings over drinking water looting for food and then every opportunist would roam unless it was very heavily policed and even then the situation would get so dire itd be a lost cause unless they could get water running again     if you had 14/88 factions that wanted chicago to be wiped out theyd simply take out the water supply and power lines bonus points for sewers thats it its game over unless extreme policing went on and the residents would have to be cooperative so that repairs could be done and given the crime rate its most likely not going to happen    work smarter not harder just because youve got the biggest gat in the hood doesnt mean youll win if you never see your enemy who just cut off your food water gas and electricity and the only thing in your yard is weeds
  the day when leftists/blacks/homos/etc rise up in rebellion  you mean like all the other times they already have and won every single time
  hate speech isnt a thing and that meme needs to die it just means speech i particularly disagree with all this shit is just trying to circumvent that fact by supplying a convenient brush you can slap a coat of illegal speechcrime onto whatever you want and of course as was inevitable the definition has become more and more loose soon calling your political opponent a fucking idiot will be hate speech      no shit sherlocks if i hate something or somebody im going to say so period in fact particularly then that being said illegally it is a fact that it is not free speech because as you would know had you paid attention in school that only applies to speaking against the government how many goddamn times must this be explained every time somebody makes this error it reveals that they are new to political anything and grievously uninformed     incidentally i am really opposed to pretty much all the bullshit being labelled as hate speech but if the kkk wants to stand around screaming about how jews did 9/11 and homos are going to burn in hell with negroes who stole their bikes i dont care let them if anything it gives them an outlet if you actually listen to most of these jackoffs rather than trying to orwell them into silence its not very interesting or intelligent and is always extremely old repetitive crap everyone under 30 has heard a billion times i miss when people just laughed at americans who thought they were nazis theyre still just as silly and laughable except now they have the edgelord hate speech label which makes them seem like some serious threat instead of comedic villains in the blues brothers accurate portrayal     tldr if your society has to silence its dregs with legal repercussions for nono talk youre cancerous cunts who deserve to have your mouths bolted shut as well
  i find this comment to be hateful against my belief in the freedom of speech in the interest of remaining consistent in your belief that hate speech not be protected speech i insist that you turn yourself in to the authorities at once
all those retards trying to fight a race war or some bullshit brought this upon themselves if you play stupid games you can expect to win stupid prizes
  thats a nice authoritarian government you have there  itd be a shame if your politically aligned party were to  not be in charge of it
  you mean like all the other times they already have and won every single time  citation needed
  free speech only applies to shit said against the government   and youre saying he didnt pay attention in school
  the only reason you people are against losing your freedom is because youd be locked away for the rest of your life in a terrible place where you have less rights than a convicted criminal  hope this is bait    
    you know they were allowed to march right it doesnt stop being hate speech just because they marched in chicago instead
  
  nah if you have a history of being public about your dipshit political schizophrenia you should be thrown into a mental asylum for the rest of your life    hate speech noun  speech that attacks threatens or insults a person or group on the basis of national origin ethnicity color religion gender gender identity sexual orientation or disability     you just attacked and insulted people with mental illness which is a disability you are attacking their first amendment rights and saying that they be imprisoned in an asylum what you said could literally be called hate speech do you agree that you should be locked up for life for saying mean things
if you are right wing and youre not currently making lists of the addresses of local liberal leaders in government and ngo orgs youre not doing your job were going to need them
  only people who disagree with him ideologically will be classified as mentally ill you know how it is
fuck racists and fuck guns
  fuck racists and fuck guns  youll fuck anything wont change
  ive had death threats since i was 11
  just dont post bad stuff and use duckduckgo as a precaution
  you wouldnt happen to be an ass hole
  just search a ton of gay porn and accuse anyone of denying you of homophobia and support the murder of homosexuals
  also fuck niggers and janitors
holy fuck the laws these people are proposing right now who in their right mind would actually vote for anyone supporting this kind of legislation where do they get the nerve and why arent they being publicly ridiculed
  oh no im just eccentric but harmless and ppl want to be mean to me sometimes
  fuck you buddy
  fuck jews
  you can say whatever you want  but if you say something we dont like you can no longer use any government services apply for credit have a drivers license etc  why are you so eager to give your rights away for nothing trust me coming from a third world shithole inhabitant the governments definition of what you can and cant say can shift spectacularly fast you dont want them holding that power over you   today theyre coming for the white supremacists and gun owners tomorrow your question of why am i being taxed for half my income i cant afford food now that march you attended at your liberal arts college or that retweet/like on twitterface is warranting a visit from local law enforcement   hell its already happening in england and china
  shut the fuck up
  too real nigel wang chan
  not everything is covered under a right to speech  making it clear that you hope to commit or facilitate an act of violence with intent against someone is considered hate speech  its an ethical grey area because one wants to set a precedent for speech as free as possible but often different freedoms are mutually incompatible ie freedom to extend your fist ends at my face    why am i being taxed for half my income i cant afford food now  here in the us folks who complain about taxes are almost never the ones worried about where their next meal is coming from
  making it clear that you hope to commit or facilitate an act of violence with intent against someone  thats already covered by the law somewhere else   here in the us folks who complain about taxes are almost never the ones worried about where their next meal is coming from  so youre just waiting until the middle class is completely obliterated and the wage gap not the feminist kind the real kind between the upper crust and the lower masses is untenable  that wasnt the point anyway im not a fucking commie it was just to illustrate that any criticism towards the government no matter how dumb or justified it seems will get the steeltoed boot treatment if you let the government do it
  so youre just waiting until the middle class is completely obliterated  rampant corporatism is what obliterates the middle class social programs that facilitate social mobility for the working class is what grows the middle class trickle down economics always has prevented the growth of middle classes in countries worldwide because its a scam the wealthy horde wealth the middle and working class spend it at least in the past we would question whether any man could be worthy of owning private property in the hundreds of millions of dollars but wed accept that at least the wealthiest tended to do a lot of good work nowadays scamming poor people is multibillion dollar business for bankers
  the internet is full of people that want to fuck you over for any number of justifications restricting access to constitutional rights based on shit you say on social media is a bad idea especially now that digital witch hunts are so prevalent in the first world
fuck trump
  making it clear that you hope to commit or facilitate an act of violence with intent against someone is considered hate speech  thats not actually hate speech because hate speech is a again protected speech and b depending on the wording of the statement it might actually be protected speech    example   kill all cops protected speech  kill all cops on the 500 block of 44th st on specific date at specific time not protected because it is specific credible and actionable
  even if the jews eventually get brought to justice this country is going to crumble upon itself with this kind of insanity    violating natural law free will and even treating their own worse than others as if they were slaves and abandoning all higher principles to whore themselves out over money and security that was never there
  these people also forget you can get guns off the street like anything else so all they would do if this was actually enforceable is make it where no one will really see it coming because there isnt going to be documentation about it
  isnt depriving you    they do and have been book burnings and witch hunts were a thing hell even recently trump went out to try to stop a book about him that got published criticizing him you have no free speech because you wont stand up for it even now your words show your surrender and selfdefeat they are depriving you of free speech and have been doing so very slowly over the course of generations like taking 8 years to peel off a small piece of onion the onion being your true freedom to speech justify it in your head keep it there its ultimately not beneficial
guns are not for conservative poltards
  making it clear that you hope to commit or facilitate an act of violence with intent against someone is considered hate speech    its not hate speech its a death threat and already not protected by the 1st amendment people that support the notion of hate speech mean it as covering an enormous range of nonviolent speech
this is depriving people of their civil rights without due process
  it is by definition forcing you to choose between exercising your first amendment rights or your second amendment rights  if you use hate speech 1st amendment you cant have guns 2nd amendment  the bill of rights is set up to allow you all your rights without having to choose between them
exdeputy head of the us department of homeland security suzanne spoulding said that the russian media are telling the truth to weaken the americans  during the discussion at the washingtonbased center for strategic and international studies on global security the former deputy minister complained that in presenting the truthful information the russian media are simply trying to worsen the situation in the united states so it is necessary to counter this    i think it is necessary for highranking people to explain how our opponents use information wars sometimes using it tools to weaken us sometimes they dont even need to invent anything they use truthful information and repeat it in a onesided way ria novosti quotes spowling    russia is not on anyones side she is on her side and her desire is not to make us better and not to raise our problems solve them but to make us weaker she added    the discussion was attended by american experts and retired officials who came to the conclusion that the united states has two main enemies  russia and china who are fighting in the gray zone at the same time washington allegedly was always on the bright side and does not use forbidden methods of struggle    
it is not possible not to manipulate

    resident trump has begun telling advisers that he may visit troops in a combat zone for the first time in his presidency as he has come under increasing scrutiny for his treatment of military affairs and failure to visit service members deployed to afghanistan or iraq    trump has so far declined to visit those combat regions saying he does not want to associate himself with wars he views as failures according to current and former advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations current advisers said trump is not expected to visit a war zone during the thanksgiving break which he will spend at his maralago golf resort in florida    the president has often cast himself as a champion of the pentagon invoking the strength and size of the military at his campaign rallies and on twitter at the same time he has frequently criticized us military missions and decisions while personally attacking some former military leaders contributing to a complicated relationship with the armed forces he commands    although he signed off on defense secretary jim mattiss requests to bolster the american military presence in afghanistan and syria and retain the footprint in iraq trump isnt a fan of us military operations there    in meetings about a potential visit he has described the missions in iraq and afghanistan as a total shame according to the advisers he also cited the long flights and potential security risks as reasons he has avoided combatzone visits they said    questioned last week about why he has not visited american troops deployed in overseas conflicts trump indicated during a fox news interview that a trip was in the works
i think you will see that happen trump said in the interview with chris wallace that aired sunday there are things that are being planned we dont want to talk about it because of security reasons and everything else     the president also repeated his erroneous contention that he was opposed to the iraq war the washington posts fact checker has found that trump initially expressed support for the invasion and did not register public objections until more than a year after the war began    i think it was a tremendous mistake should never have happened trump told wallace     but this is about the soldiers sir wallace responded    youre right trump said i dont think anybodys been more with the military than i have as a president in terms of funding in terms of all of the things ive been able to get them including the vets    trump has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life according to a former senior white house official who has discussed the issue with the president and spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about trumps concerns     hes never been interested in going the official said of trump visiting troops in a combat zone citing conversations with the president hes afraid of those situations hes afraid people want to kill him    pressure for trump to make such a visit has been building for months eliot cohen a former george w bush administration official and trump critic has raised the issue regularly in public     the point is american servicemen and women are on the ground in these places cohen said in an interview they are getting killed i think any good leader would want to see something for themselves and they would want to do something for the troops other than using them as props
since trump took office about 60 american service members have died while deployed to afghanistan iraq and syria according to pentagon statistics including both hostile and nonhostile deaths    plans for a visit by trump arent firm several advisers said and the president has only begun saying in recent weeks that it may need to happen a white house spokesman declined to comment on presidential visits citing security concerns     the president has come under increasing scrutiny for his behavior toward the military in recent weeks he attacked the former head of us special operations command retired adm william h mcraven on sunday for his role in catching and killing osama bin laden calling him a supporter of hillary clinton and saying that the alqaeda leader should have been caught sooner in pakistan mcraven responded in a statement saying he did not endorse clinton during the 2016 presidential election    trump recently skipped a cemetery service marking the end of world war i in france citing poor weather he also did not go to arlington national cemetery two days later on veterans day later expressing rare regret for missing the occasion    i should have done that he said in the fox interview    trump has sent thousands of troops to the border with mexico in anticipation of a central american migrant caravan in what his critics labeled a preelection stunt designed to shore up antiimmigration sentiment within his base mattis has described the mission as good training and necessary support for the department of homeland security  the history of presidents visiting american troops on active deployments dates back decades and gives presidents a sense of what is happening on the ground  while sending a message to troops that the government at home appreciates their personal sacrifices
during the korean war dwight d eisenhowers pledge to go to korea helped propel him into the presidency over adlai stevenson eisenhower followed through with a visit in 1952    lyndon b johnson met with troops at cam ranh bay in vietnam in 1966 telling them he had come only to say how proud he was of what they were doing and the way they were doing it he also visited forces there the next year    george hw bush spent thanksgiving with american troops in saudi arabia during desert shield in 1990 and new years with troops in somalia in 1993 his successor bill clinton visited troops in bosnia in 1996 and spent thanksgiving with troops in kosovo in 1999    george w bush made a surprise thanksgiving visit to troops in iraq months after the invasion in 2003 and went to the country three additional times after that while president at the time the us military footprint in the country was building ultimately numbering about 170000 troops in iraq at the peak of a surge in 2007    mark hertling a retired threestar general helped organize the surprise visit in 2003    about six officers knew bush was coming he said recounting how the president flew into the international airport in the wee hours of the morning and stayed hidden until the troops were in a large mess hall bush later served turkey and received resounding applause    the troops in the field need to know their efforts are not being wasted hertling said it shows that the government and the people have their back    the troop presence in afghanistan grew during the first half of the obama administration reaching a peak of about 100000 in 2011 president barack obama visited the country four times as president most recently in 2014 and made one trip to iraq shortly after his first inauguration meeting with american forces each time he had previously visited the combat zones in both countries as a us senator
trumps advisers say his lack of a visit does not represent a lack of interest in or disrespect for the military there are military figures in his administration that he admires his advisers say gen mark milley the chief of staff of the army and retired lt gen keith kellogg a former white house adviser who now works for vice president pence    the president was persuaded to sign a spending bill that he did not like by aides who brought him lists of military equipment the money would buy  even down to the specific planes and ships current and former white house aides said     trump frequently touts the strength of the us military at his political rallies having signed off on a 716 billion budget for the pentagon this year that included the largest base budget in adjusted terms since world war ii    current and former aides said trump is somber when making military decisions and has expressed concern about troops dying on his watch they also note that trump has visited domestic military bases and visited troops while overseas such as a stop in japan last fall while also bringing military visitors into the oval office     i have never heard him show any sort of disrespect toward the military in private said one former senior administration official any time you go anywhere with him in the military he is overwhelmingly popular    according to current and former aides trump was shaken after visiting dover air force base shortly after his inauguration to receive the remains of a navy seal killed in yemen his first trip to meet a grieving family he has not returned since     the president who attacked a gold star family on the campaign trail in 2016 has shown little interest in some of the minutiae of the military and regularly complains about the headaches involved in its entanglements around the world aides said
for most of trumps tenure a trip to iraq or afghanistan would have carried real security challenges and political complications us officials said    iraq was heading into elections during the presidents first year in office and a visit by trump around the time of the controversy over trumps travel ban affecting muslimmajority countries could have further complicated efforts by the usbacked prime minister haider alabadi to secure reelection in may    in afghanistan the security situation has deteriorated in september 2017 mattis was the target of a failed rocket attack at kabul airport a month later thensecretary of state rex tillerson made a secret visit to afghanistan but didnt leave bagram air base in part owing to security concerns    still if the president wanted to visit american troops deployed to one of the countries us military officials would find a way to organize the trip as they have done in the past according to officials familiar with the matter he could easily stop at bagram for a few hours as tillerson did they said    hertling said he remembered a visit by the late senator john mccain rariz to iraq in the worst days of the conflict and mccain wanted to go to mosul despite heavy fighting the military blanched     we wanted to take him anywhere but mosul hertling said he found out about it and wanted to go there so we went         tldr trumps a pussy and doesnt like to deal with the reality of war even with all his bluster and is only considering visiting the troops because hes being shamed into it     especially when asked today when its clear hes not thinking it through im going to a war zone
nice bait article faggot
  not an argument retard
lol as if the troops have any respect left for him at this point
  you dont have much contact with servicemen do you
  another anime image wapo bait thread
  i have more contact with servicemen than trump
  be president  be pussy  be celebrated by pussies  this is why cuckservatives amuse me
  bait thread  trump refuses to visit troops in combat zones because hes scared he might be attacked  now made a general comment he was going to a war zone after being shamed over it  this explains why he only campaigned in states he won hes scared of dealing with those who might protest him because hes such a sniveling coward
  you mean you command an entire army
wapost  anonymous source  unverifiable information  trump has small pee pee we swear
  remember when there was an anonymous source with unverifiable information that a dnc staffer leaked the emails to wikileaks and was murdered by le bad kikeman
  remember when the white house refused to call this fake news only to have it verified and prove theyre liars again
and trump continues to disrespect the troops    trump dont think about troops who cant spend thanksgiving at home      as a result of trumps racist preelection border stunt thousands of troops must spend thanksgiving away from their families    many americans feel sympathy for the thousands of troops who are missing thanksgiving with their families because trump demanded their deployment to the border as a racist preelection stunt    trump is not one of them    when asked by a reporter about troops who are stuck spending thanksgiving at the usmexico border trump said no one should waste any time worrying about the men and women whose time and talent he is wasting    dont worry trump said as he prepares to spend thanksgiving with his own family at his plush florida resort    youre worried about the thanksgiving holiday for them theyre so proud to be representing our country on the border trump added    the military doesnt agree    the new york times recently reported that the pentagon thinks the entire border stunt is a colossal waste of time and resources and a morale killer to boot    some troops are missing thanksgiving so they can shovel horse manure and clean out the stalls of border patrol horses    taxpayers are on the hook for this expensive stunt which will cost up to 200 million before it is all over    some trump lackeys in congress like iowa sen joni ernst defend trumps decision to use troops as political props even if it means being away from their families for the holidays
   dont think about troops who cant spend thanksgiving at home  do you
  commanding troops from inside an ivory tower because its too wet outside counts as contact with servicemen  ok anon

    trumps advisers say his lack of a visit does not represent a lack of interest in or disrespect for the military    kek just everything else he does/says

full headline trump says he was fully briefed and also not briefed yet but either way saudi crown prince absolutely not involved because trump knows everything that went on without listening to tape of khashoggi murder    just days after the cia leaked to the washington post its determination that the crown prince of saudi arabia mohammed bin salman was directly involved with the brutal murder of journalist jamal khashoggi president donald trump said in an interview that aired on sunday that the prince had absolutely nothing to do with it and that he would not listen to the recording of the assassination given over by the turkish government    because its a suffering tape its a terrible tape ive been fully briefed on it theres no reason for me to hear it trump said in the interview with chris wallace on fox news sunday i know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it    its strange however because while the interview with fox was filmed on friday trump told reporters outside the white house on saturday morning just before leaving for a trip to visit fire damage in california we havent been briefed yet about the khashoggi murder    so is trump defending the saudi crown prince after a cia assessment on the khashoggi killing seems like a very good and reasonable question    
writing on saturday middle east historian juan cole speculated about who exactly the cia might be targeting with its story at the washington post  one that appears to reveal that the agencys assessment now expected on tuesday will conflict with what the president has been stating publicly according to cole    trump had asked for the report but it is unlikely that he wanted it made public the cia is deliberately leaking it since the agency is aware that mohammed bin salman is teflon inside saudi arabia it seems probable that the target of the leak is in the us the member of the administration closest to mbs is jared kushner though trump himself has admitted that he wants the sale of us arms to mbs more than he wants khashoggis killer brought to justice the cia may be attempting to discredit kushner and to detach trump from his alliance with the crown prince    the saudi government has attempted to whitewash the murder first it denied the killing then it blamed lowlevel rogue intelligence agents then it sentenced the latter to death so as to make sure they do not talk the saudis deny that mohammed bin salman ordered that khashoggi be whacked which is laughable since no one would dare do such a thing without his orders it is an absolute monarchy after all    meanwhile human rights activist medea benjamin said on twitter even cia says mbs behind murder of jamalkhashoggi but trump covers his ears then added trump sees no evil hears no evil when it comes to evil saudi crown prince mbs who ordered murder of khashoggi
all in all what a fucking idiot im amazed fox news sent chris wallace one of their very few competent employees out against him instead of one of the usual softball jackasses do you think theyre finally starting to turn on him itll have to be bit by bit or people will start to get suspicious
i learned when i was about 16 that the reason you want to be as truthful as possible is that you cannot remember your web of lies and the truth comes out anyway apparently when you live in a bubble like our villageidiotinchief did such lessons are never learned
  hey finding supporters that just dont care if youre truthful or not also works
  i think if youll recall fox was just as against djt as every other news organization before the primaries turning on him would really just be reverting to their original position

orange man proves once again that he is unironically bad
one positive about trump is that he has made me very selfconscious about my own talking i dont want to accidentally sound like this idiot who can barely string together a coherent sentence without getting sidetracked and contradicting himself
haha
  i think he has definitely raised awareness of stupidity in this country in general
    sheryl sandberg asked facebooks communications staff to research george soross financial interests in the wake of his highprofile attacks on tech companies according to three people with knowledge of her request indicating that facebooks second in command was directly involved in the social networks response to the liberal billionaire    ms sandberg facebooks chief operating officer asked for the information in an email to a senior executive in january that was forwarded to other senior communications and policy staff the people said the email came within days of a blistering speech mr soros delivered that month at the world economic forum attacking facebook and google as a menace to society and calling for the companies to be regulated    ms sandberg  who was at the forum but was not present for mr soross speech according to a person who attended it  requested an examination into why mr soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks at the time facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in myanmar and other countries    facebook later commissioned a campaignstyle opposition research effort by definers public affairs a republicanlinked firm which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about mr soross funding of american advocacy groups critical of facebook    those efforts revealed this month in a new york times investigation set off a public relations debacle for ms sandberg and for facebook which was accused of trafficking in antisemitic attacks against the billionaire facebook quickly fired definers
the people with knowledge of ms sandbergs email asked for anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution    in a statement facebook said that the company had already begun researching mr soros when ms sandberg made her request    mr soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to facebook the company said that research was already underway when sheryl sent an email asking if mr soros had shorted facebooks stock the company said that while ms sandberg takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch she did not personally direct any research on freedom from facebook an antifacebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of definers later work    eddie vale a spokesman for freedom from facebook said he was skeptical of the companys account    in light of sandbergs continuously changing story on the soros research theres no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value mr vale said facebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the freedom from facebook coalition or any member organizations
soros vs silicon valley  glorious let the left destroy each other

congressional democrats said thursday theyre prepared to reject a new gop plan to get president trump the money he is demanding for his border wall  escalating the chances of a partial government shutdown next week    the new republican plan would deliver 5 billion for trumps longpromised usmexico border wall by dividing the expenditure over two years  25 billion in 2019 and 25 billion in 2020    but democrats who have rejected the idea of spending 5 billion on a wall trump claimed mexico would pay for said splitting the money up over two years did not make it more palatable    no matter how many years you spread it over 5 billion for president trumps wasteful wall is too much money said rep nita m lowey dny the top democrat on the house appropriations committee while we are willing to negotiate on how best to secure our border we will never support wasting tax dollars on a wall designed to gin up the republican base    democratic lawmakers and aides in the senate also said the plan for 5 billion over two years wouldnt fly    hes asking the taxpayers to give him money  for something when he gave his solemn word that taxpayers wouldnt have to pay the mexicans would pay and has threatened to shut down the government in i guess an attempt to bail out the mexicans from his promise said sen patrick j leahy dvt the top democrat on the senate appropriations committee it doesnt make much sense        the wall will be built any day now right
democrats do not care about border security
trump said mexico will pay for the wall so why should america foot the bill of trumps failure
  that only competent americans can deliver  so trump cant deliver it then
  this the fact he had 2 years and he couldnt get any more shows hes incompetent
democrats are such insufferable cunts
  hell build a wall that mexicans will ignore and your children will pay for it
    you sound mad as fuck
  zoomer  and how old are you
  seek psychiatric help
    all this autism and still doesnt answer how old he is
  seething
all this shitposting from someone who is offended by anime   and the guy creating the threads is somehow the bad guy    the question is will the country be stupid enough to blame the democrats for trumps government shutdown
    seething
this isnt surprising the democrat party wants to be able import a new voting base to replace the white people who dont want to vote for them anymore
  wall is a waste of time money and would be an environmental disaster most of the migrants come over legally and just overstay their visa a wall isnt going to stop that
  i remember reading that most of the border crossers vote conservative is that still true do we have any value d sources on who they vote for
democrats unveiling their first bill for the new congress a sweeping anticorruption bill      meaning under trump logic the republicans will be procorruption for opposing it
  2018 proved the country is smarter than we gave it credit for people who grudgingly voted for trump in 2016 came to hate him after two years of lying
  campaign finance  public financing of campaigns powered by small donations under sarbaness vision the federal government would provide a voluntary 61 match for candidates for president and congress which means for every dollar a candidate raises from small donations the federal government would match it six times over if you give 100 to a candidate thats meeting those requirements then that candidate would get another 600 coming in behind them sarbanes told vox this summer the evidence and the modeling is that most candidates can do as well or better in terms of the dollars they raise if they step into this new system  passing the disclose act pushed by rep david cicilline ri and sen sheldon whitehouse ri both democrats from rhode island this would require super pacs and dark money political organizations to make their donors public  passing the honest ads act championed by sens amy klobuchar mn and mark warner va which would require facebook and twitter to disclose the source of money of political ads on their platforms and share how much money was spent  ethics  requiring the president to disclose his or her tax returns  stopping members of congress from using taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment cases or buy firstclass plane tickets  giving the office of government ethics the power to do more oversight and enforcement and put in stricter lobbying registration requirements  create a new ethical code for the us supreme court ensuring all branches of government are impacted by the new law
  voting rights  creating new national automatic voter registration that asks voters to opt out rather than opt in ensuring more people will be signed up to vote early voting and online voter registration would also be promoted  restoring the voting rights act part of which was dismantled by a us supreme court decision in 2013 ending partisan gerrymandering in federal elections and prohibiting voter roll purging  beefing up elections security including requiring the director of national intelligence to do regular checks on foreign threats    all this stuff is great and should have been done a long time ago cant wait to see how conservatives will twist it into something bad
republicans are the majority no why havent they built the damn wall yet
how convenient now he can just say  i tried to get the wall but the democraps wouldnt let me
president donald trump is succeeding in making china pay most of the cost of his trade war    thats the conclusion of a new paper from econpol europe a network of researchers in the european union us companies and consumers will only pay 45 percent more after the nation imposed 25 percent tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and the other 205 percent toll will fall on chinese producers according to authors benedikt zollerrydzek and gabriel felbermayr

    secretary of state bill gardner has had a decadeslong run as the legendary hardnosed guardian of new hampshires firstinthenation primary but he may not make it through the trump era    gardner a fixture in presidential politics after more than 40 years in office is on the verge of a bitter ouster from his job after supporting stricter voter eligibility requirements and participating in president donald trumps illfated voter fraud commission    though he has traditionally garnered support from both republicans and democrats  the legislature selects the states secretary of state every two years  new hampshire house democrats overwhelmingly threw their support to a rival democrat colin van ostern in a preliminary caucus vote recently    now gardner is fighting for his survival lawmakers are expected to vote dec 5 on gardners fate a month after democrats won control of both houses of the state legislature    theres drama here said fergus cullen a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party who said he is neutral in the race the result in the democratic caucus last week was stunning to a lot of people  one of the great ironies is backlash against president trump is likely to cost bill gardner his job talk about a ricochet shot    gardner who is 70 and bidding for a 22nd term has stood at the forefront of the states quadrennial effort to retain its early primary in the runup to the 2012 election gardner famously threatened to jump new hampshires primary to december of the previous year cowing nevadan republicans who attempted  then abandoned  an effort to move up their own nominating contest it was gardner with former gov hugh gregg who wrote the book on new hampshires early primary why new hampshire
while few expect a gardner defeat would have a significant effect on the 2020 primary the secretary of states defenders argue that replacing him  and his rigorously nonpartisan approach to the job  with a more openly partisan official like van ostern could put the states traditional position on the primary calendar at risk in the future    new hampshire follows only iowas caucuses on the presidential nominating calendar    decades of service have exposed gardner to his share of conflict including flareups with local elections officials and state lawmakers but democrats fumed when he agreed to participate in trumps controversial voter fraud panel  then again when he supported legislation tightening voter residency requirements in an era of intense scrutiny on state elections officials  and heightened politicization of their offices  gardners critics appear to be catching up to him    its been so long since anyone has challenged gardner said former state senate president sylvia larsen a democrat but this new incoming statehouse and in particularly the house of representatives i think a lot of the younger and energized democrats are feeling its time for change    she added bill can be kind of a stick in the mud sometimes    steve maviglio a former new hampshire lawmaker who now works as a democratic strategist in california said gardner has been masterful to hold that office over lopsided majorities that have seesawed back and forth between republicans and democrats    hes iconic maviglio said    however he said gardners participation in trumps voter fraud commission has really hurt him in an increasingly partisan political climate maviglio said it might be hard for somebody who has straddled both sides
speaking to reporters in new hampshire after the caucus vote against him gardner acknowledged last week that some may never forgive me for participating in trumps nowdisbanded voter commission which was designed to investigate the presidents unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud during the 2016 election    however gardner said it was better that new hampshire be represented than not and i was bringing the new hampshire values and my values to that commission    he added its better to be at the table than on the menu    van ostern the democratic partys 2016 nominee for governor has been openly running against gardner for months promising to modernize the office while ensuring ironclad adherence to administering the nations first presidential primary election but his platform also includes an unmistakable shot at gardner with a plank dedicated to defending nhs election integrity and fighting back against false voter fraud political attacks and inaccurate statements from elected leaders no matter the source    noting gardners legacy van ostern said he has every right to run again but no ones entitled to the office on everything from town meeting rules to website design van ostern said we really need to modernize that office have more accountability    gardner did not respond to a request for comment    still gardner maintains support from many established democrats including former gov john lynch and if gardner and his supporters can prevent van ostern from winning enough democratic votes on dec 5 minority republicans could pull gardner over the finish line    hes done a great job said wayne macdonald chairman of the new hampshire republican party hes really created the reputation that new hampshire has that this is where anyone can come and run for president and if they really work hard they can reach out and launch a national effort
of gardners prospects in the upcoming election macdonald said hes definitely got a chance but this is the first strong opponent he has had in a long long time    new hampshire state sen lou dallesandro gardners former high school civics teacher and the democrat who will nominate him for reelection called the challenge facing gardner an unusual happening    i think hes done an outstanding job dallesandro said noting new hampshires high voter turnout and reforms that dallesandro said have expanded voter access during gardners tenure nobodys perfect and i understand that but his defense of the firstinthenation primary is very significant for new hampshire and it has proved to be one of the most outstanding political achievements i think in the history of our state    dallesandro said he told gardner that he didnt think serving on trumps voter fraud commission was a great idea but he said youve got to look at the big picture the gentleman has been a very good secretary of state

  just dont be an owner of a penis its that simple you think im joking but im not castrate yourself because if you dont you will inevitably harass someone in your lifetime its like encoded in the genetic code of any penis owner you may object you may deny it but whether you like it or not you will at some point be a sexual predator no matter who you are so long as you own a penis this is the undeniable nature of things so it has been for centuries except its just now coming to light
black celebrity has money  women claim sexual misconduct to get a piece of it  this happens all the time i think bill cosby and r kelly are the only ones to have been confirmed pulling shit like this
   he responded publicly to these accusations in a facebook post id link it here but if i do that 4chan seems to think im posting spam  to sum up his side of the story   during the incident where hes alleged to have groped a woman who had a pluto tattoo he says he merely looked under her shoulder strap at the tattoo   during the incident where hes alleged to have tried to seduce a woman at his house with wine and cheese he says he routinely offers most of his guests wine and cheese and all he did during that visit to weird her out was do a native american handshake which he says he shows to most of his new friends also the woman routinely hugged everyone on set but he says he always rejected it and did a handshake instead stating if i hug you i might just want more    during the incident where hes alleged to have drugged and raped a woman he says he didnt recognize the woman at all at first but then thought back on it and remembered they briefly dated in college basically it was complete bullshit and he was totally surprised by it and he thinks this may have spurred any woman hes ever done anything that could remotely be considered sexual towards to come out of the woodwork   if what hes saying is true and hes not the next bill cosby or some shit it seems all hes guilty of is having less of a dirty mind than most of the paranoid feminists he interacts with
  getting groped at an alcohol party  we should all go back to same sex parties and chaperoned outings with the opposite sex
  he routinely offers most of his guests wine and cheese  well shit thats some delicious seducing if thats sexual misconduct id let him do that to me all the time
fools
  anyone want to guess who is next
  the science is settled a woman cannot lie he must be guilty
    washington ap  the date had been picked the location too and the plan was penciled in president donald trump would be whisked from the white house to camp david on a quiet winter saturday to answer questions from special counsel robert muellers team    but as the jan 27 2018 date neared and mueller provided the topics he wanted to discuss trumps lawyers balked attorney john dowd then fired off a searing letter disputing muellers authority to question the president the interview was off    nearly a year later trump has still not spoken directly to muellers team  and may never through private letters tense meetings and considerable public posturing the presidents lawyers have engaged in a tangled tortured backandforth with the special counsel to prevent the president from sitting down for a facetoface with enormous political and legal consequences    the prolonged negotiation speaks to the high stakes for trump muellers investigation of his campaign and the presidency any questioning of a president in a criminal investigation tests the limit of executive authority putting this president on the record also tests his ability to stick to the facts and risks a constitutional showdown    the process took a significant step forward this week when trumps lawyers handed over the presidents written answers to some of muellers questions the arrangement was a hardfought compromise trump answered only questions about russian interference in the 2016 election and not questions about whether he has tried to obstruct the special counsels investigation its unclear whether mueller intends to push for more  either in writing or in person    special counsel spokesman peter carr declined comment    even those written answers were months in the making
in the months following muellers may 2017 appointment the white house pledged its cooperation believing it the fastest way to end the investigation the administration produced thousands of documents demanded by the special counsel and made close trump aides  including his legal counsel chief of staff and press secretary  available for questioning white house lawyer ty cobb said he expected the investigation to conclude by the end of that year    but it soon became clear that mueller would want to interview trump given his involvement in several events under scrutiny the president had fired fbi director james comey harangued his attorney general over his recusal from the russia investigation and dictated a misleading statement about a trump tower meeting involving his son and a kremlinconnected lawyer    but trump lawyers dowd and jay sekulow moved cautiously    the last time a president is known to have been interviewed in a criminal investigation was nearly 15 years ago and a commanderinchief has not been subpoenaed before a grand jury since 1998 when president bill clinton was summoned in the whitewater case trumps lawyers were mindful such an interview would be a minefield for a president who often misstates the facts they set out to avoid it however possible even if it could lead to resisting a subpoena and bringing on a court fight over presidential power    but first they tried to head off a request trumps lawyers staked out a bold constitutional argument declaring they considered all his actions as president outside a prosecutors bounds mueller had no right to question the president on any of his decisions made at the white house they argued saying any outside scrutiny of those choices would curb a presidents executive powers
at the same time they worked to undermine muellers case should he choose to challenge that argument they furnished a trove of white house documents about key moments in the investigation in hopes of undercutting any claim that he could only get the information he needed by questioning trump according to people familiar with the strategy    trump had other plans    as his lawyers plotted to dig in against any interview he pushed for one believing it would exonerate him in january he burst into a reporters briefing with chief of staff john kelly and insisted he was eager to speak to mueller he might do so in weeks he said subject to my lawyers and all of that    i would love to do that  id like to do it as soon as possible trump said    what he didnt mention was that his attorneys had already discussed and scuttled the planned interview with mueller that process had even progressed to discussing logistics with kelly who had advised of ways white house officials could be ferried to camp david without the press knowing    but the interest cooled after mueller team prosecutor jim quarles dictated over the phone 16 topics mueller wanted to cover including trumps interactions with comey his knowledge of national security adviser michael flynns interview with the fbi and his involvement in the trump tower statement dowd responded that the answers could all be found in documents and witness statements provided to mueller according to a person familiar with the exchange he then canceled the interview and days later drafted a feisty letter contesting the interviews appropriateness and offering extensive explanations on the incidents in question    the investigation has been a considerable burden for the president and his office has endangered the safety and security of our country and has interfered with the presidents ability to both govern domestically and conduct foreign affairs dowd wrote
in the following months trump told some of his closest confidants that he still wanted to interview with mueller according to four white house officials and republicans close to the white house who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to publicly discuss private conversations the president repeatedly insisted he had done nothing wrong and believed he could convince mueller of that    he told one confidant last spring he was frustrated his lawyers didnt believe he should do it and snapped that he didnt understand what was taking so long according to one republican in contact with the white house    tensions were on display at a march meeting where dowd and sekulow met with mueller to discuss the need for an interview mueller said he needed to know if trump had a corrupt intent when he fired comey such as by intending to stymie the investigation according to a person familiar with the encounter dowd responded that the question was ridiculous and the answer was obviously no investigators at the same meeting raised the prospect of a subpoena if trump didnt cooperate dowd has said    weeks later muellers team produced its most detailed list of questions yet  dozens broken into different categories from trumps time as a candidate through the transition period and into his presidency    trumps own views soon began to shift he had his first misgivings in midapril after fbi raids on his personal lawyer michael cohen believing they were a sign that he could not trust mueller according to one of the republicans close to trump who spoke with the ap    as rudy giuliani joined trumps legal team in april the white house settled into a new strategy drag out the interview drama for months and use that time to ratchet up attacks on muellers credibility and complaints about the cost and time of the probe according to the officials and advisers familiar with the strategy
giuliani led the charge his scattershot arguments sometimes frustrated others in the white house as he frequently moved the goalposts as to what would be required to have an interview but the effect was to ensure the process would drag out longer    trump meanwhile continued complaining about the investigation even as his lawyers quietly negotiated acceptable interview terms    a key breakthrough occurred in september when muellers team said it would accept written answers on russian election interference and collusion the concession ensured that mueller would get at least some ontherecord response from trump prosecutors tabled questions about obstruction reserving the right to return to that area later    giuliani seemed to foreclose future dialogue tuesday saying it is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion    whether mueller agrees is a different story        what is trump so desperate to hide in his refusal to testify is it because he knows he committed crimes and maybe even treason against the united states and will do anything to keep his crimes from coming to light
trump also refused to answer question regarding obstruction of justice which makes it obvious he doesnt want to implicate himself
now we know why trump doesnt want to talk to mueller muellers found both his mole manafort and a direct link between him and the russians stone
two people are behind bars after allegedly running an illegal dental practice out of a bus in miami    according to miamidade police officials daniela sulbaran and victor bernal were arrested earlier this month for practicing health care without a license bernal was also charged with possession of drugs with intent to sell    during an undercover investigation officials scheduled an appointment with bernal for a dental procedure    they arrived at the bus which parked in a parking lot at the 6000 block of northwest 74th avenue    sulbaran diagnosed evaluated and offered to treat the officer thats when police moved in and arrested the two    while police were searching the bus they found a bag containing various prescription drugs including lidocaine mepivacaine ibuprofen and other dental products    investigators are asking people who may have been treated by sulbaran and bernal to come forward    
why do you keep trying to slide actual news op
  this is actual news
  no one gives a fuck about some random faggots in miami nice that you arent denying trying to slide more important threads also
    this is interesting to me i want to know why they operated out of a bus why they didnt have licenses who their customers weree where did they gey dental training if they did an good job or just fucked people up this could be a story about the state of health care in the us or a story about crazy people either way it is interesting
  he put saged in all fields   announcing a sage   upset people arent posting antidrumpf propaganda   heres a bump from me op
  i used to live in a school bus i can still recall it a little bit i left there when i was 2 and a half it was renovated as a camper and the trend has caught on  that said did they also live in that bus
  how the fuck do you slide threads on a board which keeps them up for 2 weeks
  sweet digits anon
  this  this board is actually decent during this time when all the shills are asleep
  florida news is always actual news newfag
  this is fucking retarded obviously the people who went to them did it because they couldnt afford a licensed doctor if theres a demand why constrict the supply
  because the licensed doctors dont want people potentially taking money away from them
  this    people do self dental all the time me included because actual working dental insurance is basically a myth for like 90 of people
  this is some sam losco shit
  if theyre desperate enough to go to backalley doctors they couldnt afford the fees of a proper doctor in the first place the unlicensed prey on the disenfranchised and poor the truth is simply that theyre a danger to public health because they cant be regulated like registered doctors
  they couldnt afford the fees of a proper doctor in the first place  the unlicensed prey on the disenfranchised and poor  yes much better those unwashed masses dont get any dental care at all    kill yourself statist
  crappy dental care from an untrained unlicensed unregulated dentist may as well be as bad as not getting treated at all sure it can work in some cases but you may as well be playing russian roulette with the chamber
president donald trump suggested on saturday that asylum seekers would be allowed to wait in mexico while their claims are processed through the us immigration system  but mexicos incoming government has denied making any such deal    there is no agreement of any sort between the incoming mexican government and the us government future interior minister olga sanchez told reuters on saturday contradicting trump and an earlier washington post report that said a deal  albeit an informal one  had been struck between the two governments    the post had quoted sanchez as saying the administration of mexicos presidentelect andrés manuel lópez obrador who will take office on dec 1 had for now agreed to the socalled remain in mexico plan    sanchez was quoted by the paper as saying that mexico would allow asylum seekers to stay in the country as a shortterm solution    following the publication of the posts report however sanchez backpedaled on those remarks she told reuters that obradors administration was in talks with the us but stressed officials who werent yet in office couldnt formally make any agreements    reuters reported that sanchez did not explicitly rule out that mexico could allow central american caravan migrants  thousands of whom have arrived in tijuana just south of california  to wait in the country while their claims are processed in the us    sanchez did however say that plans for mexico to assume safe third country status had been ruled out under a safe third agreement the us could force migrants to seek asylum in mexico    trump said in a pair of saturday evening tweets that migrants at the usmexico border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court    no releasing into the us  all will stay in mexico the president wrote    
his tweets were interpreted as possible confirmation of the possible deal between the us and obradors administration    tijuana mayor juan manuel gastélum declared a humanitarian crisis last week as approximately 5000 central american migrants fleeing violence and poverty arrived in the city  to the chagrin of many locals     gastélum said on friday that hed asked the united nations for aid to help with the influx of asylum seekers
cant matador the obrador
wait what did he say exactly that was a lie if the us rejects their asylum claim they will stay in mexico until the mexicans kick them out i dont see how this implies any sort of agreement with the mexican government
  he claimed they had an agreement in the works where mexico is forced to keep all the asylum seekers  there were negotiations for it but since trump was being his trademark dumbass self and tried to force mexico into the deal by saying it happened mexico went fuck off and pulled out of the talks
  i just read both of them and saw no indication of a deal being made he simply stated that they will wait on the mexican side of the border until a decision is made on their claims and if they enter prematurely will be detained do you have a link to the tweet or statement about him stating a deal was made
  look harder  
  here are his tweets which are linked in that article    migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court we only will allow those who come into our country legally other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain no releasing into the us  all will stay in mexico if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border there is no way that the united states will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore    i dont see anything in those about a deal being made with mexico in fact all the sources i can find for any sort of confirmation of an agreement is coming from obradors staff prior to them denouncing one ever being made
  all will stay in mexico if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border  he was announcing all refuges will stay in mexico
  and in the short term they will be unless of course the mexican government goes in and deports them do you honestly think that he meant permanently
  only if trump goes full retarded and tries to close the boarder and commits crimes against humanity by shooting refuges as they attempt to seek asylum   thats why any attempt at a deal was scuttled because trumps a retard who always jumps the gun
he literally cant keep getting away with this
  you are implying way too much here what happens when a person has their asylum claim rejected they dont just disappear and are left on the southern border with no legal entry to the us from that point on it is out of the us hands unless they try to enter illegally also i have no idea how you could have interpreted close the border as setting up a fucking dmz that is just delusional
  implying way to much  only what trump always implies
huffpo
republicans are alright with an overt racist and supporter of treason as their senator
  thats not the confederate flag cindy was a kid at the time and the confederates were mostly ordinary people who believed they were defending their country

  this thread got off topic fast its really hard to defend a racist isnt it
  then what is it alternate patriotism the confederacy was founded on bad faith and the entitlement of slavery which is an indisputable fact
  and she and others like her were lied to by their leadership who simply refused to accept the immorality and economic obsolescence of their main source of income then started spinning their story that they were oppressed underdogs during the reconstruction era if anything the neocons constant denial and downplaying of the issue of slavery is damning proof in itself that even they realise how indefensible the root cause of the rebellion really was
  secession is how our country was founded dumbass on top of that the union had slave states lincoln himself said he didnt give a fuck about slaves either get off your high horse you fucking fool
the autism in this fucking thread    slavers are shit people shut up already confederacyshit is garbage and should be wiped out of our culture get over yourselves
  he forgets about the olive branch petition  the confederates committed treason and had no intention of reasoning with the union the continentals tried multiple to ties to make peace with king george before they declared independence  i dont expect mississippi to put americas interest first and not vote for the protraitor racist but it kinda sucks were going to have to deal with the gloating from /pol/ and trump over the fact they won a race that was a slam dunk for them
  who cares you fucking nerd anyone obsessed over the confederacy either way is a stupid piece of shit with no sense of priorities
  being this upset over history  using nerd as an insult  man /pol/ is butthurt tonight
  the confederates committed treason and had no intention of reasoning with the union   the contential commited treason and had no intention of staying with the king  the continentals tried multiple to ties to make peace with king george before they declared independence  what is the 3/5 compromise  what is the fugitive slave law  fucking idiot  i dont expect mississippi to put americas interest first   i dont expect new york communists to put americas interests first either
  lincoln had a right to start a war in which he suspended ha corpus instituted a draft and killed 600000 americans  you do realize abolition didnt require a war in the united kingdom and many other european countries right  do you also realize slavery still happens in africa right what about the fact african nations sold slaves to the united states no you forget that because its not convenient to remember the democrats created the ku klux klan and were behind the majority of the lynchings
  logical fallacies the post
  ill use terms i dont understand to look intelligent  doesnt work here try a subreddit
  he doesnt know his revolutionary war history or the olive branch petition  he resorts to non sequiturs  pick up a history book but please keep embarrassing yourself traitor supporter      damage control after having his fallacies called out  you should go back to /pol/
  lets pretend the south didnt negotiate with the north  lets ignore lincolns totalitarian policies in office  lets ignore lincoln sent union troops to kill his own citizens  lets forget the fact that lincoln was extremely racist and said himself he didnt give a fuck about the slaves  this is some nice alternate history right here are you taught this in california  you should go back to /pol/  not an argument youre not convincing anyone here to vote democrat you fucking shill find another board
  i cant critically think about history so i will use dictionary terms i dont understand  this isnt model un you fucking retard
  hes thinking the confederates were americans and not traitors who should have been all executed  he thinks the hampton roads conference wasnt ploy by the confederates out of desperation  he again resorts to non sequitur  hes crying about shills on /news/  as expected of a /pol/ppet      more damage control
  people are traitors because my liberal high school taught me so  not all of us were raised in an inner city shithole again youve done nothing but spew leftist garbage that no one outside of your chicago suburb takes seriously go back to /r/politics
  i will blatantly ignore will lincoln did because my argument falls apart  like clockwork
  being this mad that the war of northern aggression you were taught was nothing but lies and you have to come to grips your side were traitors  pathetic       being this butthurt over the habeas corpus suspension act when it was used mainly against traitors and traitor sympathizers
  how could the confederates be traitors when secession wasnt illegal before the civil war retard
  lincoln sent innocent people to die through a draft  he was a great person  lincoln loved the black community  holy shit
    rebellion isnt treason  all these non sequiturs   sherman should have burned the entire south to the ground
  theyre traitors even though lincoln pardoned them  secession wasnt legal prior to the civil war  sherman should have killed more innocent people because he really cared about those poor black slaves  lmao sherman with his segregated regiments saved the based black people  holy fucking shit you have to be in some shitty blue state city ive never ran into someone so ignorant on history
  being this made youre backing traitors who lost over a century later
    so what are the chances he came to 4chan i remember way back when /k/ommandos were kicking around the idea of going there with about as much enthusiasm as a fat kid thinks about jogging    seemed like a normie facebook kinda guy but you never know
  absolutely based and savagepilled
as they say play stupid games win stupid prizes
  i hope his body doesnt have any diseases their immune system never prepared for
  i hope they all die so we can get a decent resort in pooland
  a police source told reuters that chau is a preacher who had visited the area in the past and had a strong desire to meet the tribe the source also claimed chau expressed interest in preaching to them  he was definitely playing stupid games
a chink christian thats rare
fucking retarded god botherer no surprise that he was chinese and religious only africans have lower iqs than these people
dont do thing  everyone on the planet agreed to not do thing  does thing  dies
  the chinese literally have one of the highest average iqs in the world you tard
  not especially their parents beat rote statistics trivia and data into their heads so while they have information to draw from they waste it on thinking rhino horns make their dingus into a dongus also thinking a tribe hostile to interlopers will welcome the pink baby jebus into their lives
  found the salty white guy who needs to find others to hate/blame or else he may find out the cause of his bitterness is his poor life choices and lack of meaningful accomplishments
  chinese are fairly intelligent
  nope the tests they give to determine national average iq are only handed to a top percentage of univeristy students and faculty greatly skewing the results
  ughhh whiiitee people ughhh    little dick chinaman or little dick resentful white nerd
    found the real substandardiq posters
  be american  get shot
  good  christcucks get the arrow
  chinks iq is equivalent to africanschinks get ahead by stealing or buying tech from the white man
  gunpowder the invention that allowed europe to dominate the globe was invented in china
  the fact they even get ahead like this is evident of their intelligence
  no its not
  gunpowder the invention that allowed europe to dominate the globe was invented in china  deluded misinformed opinion
when you google north sentinel island someone uploaded the black panther poster as one of the pics of it to google maps lol
  negative numbers were discovered by chinese  invented negative numbers dont exist they are a mathematical abstraction matrix algebra doesnt get discovered it gets invented
    chinese women prefer white men
    ahah joke on them watch as they all die because of disease let by its stupid body
  he only have himself to blame
  comparing 1500 year old medieval beliefs to modern chinese beliefs circa 2018   top lel
  only believes it cures deadly illness  doesnt make it any less ludicrous
  fishermen saw the tribe burying his body on the beach the following day  the fishermen saw them taking his body apart not burying it
  couldnt they take his body apart and then bury it
  its chinese americans that have tested with high iqs and thats because it was primarily intelligent successful people from hong kong that came over in the 80s since then more mainlanders have come over but again they have the wealth and intelligence to make the move china as a whole has many dumb citizens just like other countries note many of their test scores are misleading because its the highly educated in the richest cities namely shanghai that are usually tested
  i legitimately cannot wait for the meme of iq to die  or atleast everyone who spouts it like its the bible to intelligence which is hilarious because you dumbasses dont even understand it
  whats to understand
  he looks half white    in what shitty mongrelfied country do you live in where he looks half white
you have an incredible current event here india bans visitors from an island because the natives kill intruders on sight india doesnt even bother to prosecute these people for murder one fool ignores good advice and gets murdered via a volley of arrows yet you cucks turn this into a conversation about the chinese why does this board exist
  those tribes are human beings when everyone was in the stone age was murder ok of course not  i say they still need to be charged with something maybe as simple as taking some spears away or something idk
  you should have just posted idk and left it at that
  lets place tariffs on them thatll teach em
  this board literally exists because there are people too triggered to take it to /pol/   thats really the only reason its a safe space away from /pol/ and /int/ in a way its very much /int/lite
  the sentinelese have been mostly isolated for one thousand years they have no immunity to something simple like the flu just his presence on the island might have killed the people living there he risked committing genocide for the sake of getting a few more views on instagram    the indian government should remind everyone not to go there and call it even
  they kill their kids by bashing them on a log if they are mixed with whites which is frankly stupid since those children are more likely to be resistant to disease
  fair enough
  this happens when you become a religious nut he has only himself to blame    if god now exists i bet he is laughing at him for being a retard
  do you have a source on that
                jokes on you cuck the missionary was only half chinese his mother is white he looks half white    and his mother is white she hyphenated her original surname with her husbands    fishermen saw the tribe burying his body on the beach the following day a fellow missionary wrote in an email to his mother lynda adamschau of vancouver wash      his mother was lynda lee adams and her parents were both white lee adams and mary jo adams she married a chinese man patrick chau changed her name to lynda lee adamschau and their son was the missionary      lee is preceded in death by his wife of 62 years mary jo adams he is survived by his sister barbara pannabecker and his three daughters lynda lee adamschau and her husband patrick chau of vancouver washington k susie adams frost and her husband james dahle frost iii of livingston texas and kathy adams bley and her husband carl bley of birmingham alabama he was also blessed with seven grandchildren david bley brian chau karen frost amy hood marilyn chau jimmy frost and john chau and one great grandson grady hugh hood
  there she met her true love lee a adams jr during her senior year she stayed one more year working toward a masters in social work while he completed a degree in petroleum engineering she then worked as a child welfare social worker in hobbs new mexico while she was there and lee was still in oklahoma they continued a longdistance relationship until november 26 1949 when they married they had barely settled back into life in hobbs when lee was shipped off with the us army to europe for his second tour of duty she was pregnant with their first daughter lynda lee adams at the time once lynda was born jo took her sevenmonthold baby and flew to germany to be with lee there as lee tells it she fell in love with the european lifestyle and german beer
  dying of disease is not genocide thats natural selection
    the jokes on you bloviated spider monkey   there is no such thing as half white  even triple checked my box of crayolas
  inflicting plague on an entire population and committing accidental genocide just because you want to yell about jesus to a bunch of people who want nothing more than to be left alone isnt natural selection its pure retardation  india has explicit policy stating that the sentinelese should be left alone and not interacted with at all  dumbfuck tries to approach the island once and just barely escapes death  obviously the solution is to bother them again  play stupid games win stupid prizes
  how long until some nutjob goes to this island with a gun
  based and /pol/pilled
  be an idiot  die of idiocy
    they tried this    do you know that its actually quite easy to take down a helicopter with a spear
christian zealots get btfo by nativists tribe
  /pol/ is much more of a safe space than /news/ ever is /pol/ is for tardos who can only communicate with memes
  i dont think thats accurate
  and retards who take those same memes too seriously
  digits checked  pajeet here  it is illegal to go to ns islands navy patrols the waters so that nobody can get in 3 km radius around the island    this chink cunt paid 350360 to local fishermen to take him there    the local tribe was surprisingly diplomatic they fired warning shots at him to let him know he was not welcome there but being the burgeristan citizen he pushed his luck too much and was shot dead    so far the fishermen who took him there have been arrested          statement by the first and only surviving anthropologist who made contact with sentenalese  
  hover anywhere from 5001000 feet well outside the range of any thrown object that could harm passengers  shoot them down above with relative ease with no risk of retaliation  i see no reason why this wouldnt be physically possible
  those island monkeys are not much different from pajeet niggers like you
  o i must have gotten the tribes mixed up  but i remember reading it somewhere
chink    no big loss theres a billion more insectoids
  and where exactly is that helicopter going to come from some local fisherman with a helicopter carrier ship
  possibly from some countries military
  his mother was white
all these comments having pity for a murderous barbarian tribe that cant even use fire
  t slanty
  go to island  everyone gets sick and dies
  if they werent hostile to outsiders they wouldnt exist as a people anymore
  it never ends
  international soccer coach  wildlife emt  missionary    slim to none because i used to hang out with people just like him
  so what are the chances he came to 4chan  0
  also thinking a tribe hostile to interlopers will welcome the pink baby jebus into their lives  this guy knew it was dangerous he was a steve irwin kind of guy    every chinese i met was pretty smart
  im afraid they might be cannibals
  that and the fact they gotta be inbred explains a lot
  what the fuck is india suppose to do militarily invade the island to arrest those hostile natives how well do you think that will go and how well would the prosecution go after that prosecute them for what were they ever under indian jurisdiction is it even a huge crime to murder trespassers on your private property
  even worse a hapa
  hapa mulattos have a lot of mental probs
how is it that he didnt think his germs and virus wouldnt wipe out the fucking island his handwriting is fucking shit but his words were coherent enough he was stupid but not insane during all the hours of traversing and praying this possibility never came up once instead the satan stronghold is what he thinks of he was the fucking nuke to them
  so theyre on indian land and dont swear fealty to india    its tresspass invasion war
  theyve lived on that island before india was even a country they dont have to abide by any law but their own
  play stupid games  win stupid prizes
  fly over sentinel island  carpet bomb them with dirty tissues  double kill  triple kill  mmmulti kill  killing spree    victory  srank
  all he cared about was saving them by conversion probably justified it by telling himself if he could convert one it was worth saving one soul to kill all the others if he was even smart enough to consider it
hopefully god will reveal himself to them via dreams especially now they had a missionary see them
        theres been a lot of talk about the missionary killed by the natives of north sentinel island theyre probably so aggressive because of this weirdo maurice vidal portman so heres a big thread about this creep and some facts from my decadelong obsession with the island    portman the black sheep third son of some minor noble was assigned by the english royal navy to administer and pacify the andaman islands a job he pursued from 18801900 with the full measure of his own perversity    portman was erotically obsessed with the andamanese and he indulged his passion for photography by kidnapping members of various tribes and posing them in mockgreek homoerotic compositions
  its just a rudimentary tracker to see if kids need help in school and it really only helps find kids that will need help with math
economics nobel prize winner paul krugman weighs in on the brexit his arguments absolutely destroy the stupidity of the brexiters        the point is that while america offers a market comparable in size to that of the eu its much further away so that even if the uk could make an incredible deal with us it wouldnt be worth nearly as much as the customs union they have    all of this explains why may is trying to negotiate a deal that keeps the customs union intact but that of course aint much of an exit brussels will still set uk trade policy except that britain will no longer have a vote so what was the point of brexit in the first place    good question too bad more people didnt ask it before the referendum
opinion
krugman  kek
  whats funny about an economics nobel prize winner commenting on economics
  kek is the enough response in 4channel  dont question it
  too bad hes too late britland is fucked and theres nothing he can do
  the british parliament needs to get its shit together and have a second referendum    everyone knows the first referendum was a fluke with an unexpected amount of retards showing up    a second referendum would have at least 80 of brits vote to remain
  the queen should invoke her right to hold a parliamentary election right now    the labour party would win a majority for sure and they would push to have a second referendum with corbyn as the prime minister
  for starters there is no nobel in economics since alfred nobel did not establish it and there has been quite a bit of controversy surrounding the establishment of the prize by the swedish bank second krugman is a heavily politicized figure so despite his credentials it is hard to take his opinions as 100 based in truth and not being influenced by bias
  is this supposed to be an argument
would it have worked better if it were a bunch other countries that left the eu as well and formed their own economic bloc
  if you want to trust his opinion as fact just because of his credentials that is your choice you should look into watsons opinions on racial superiority while youre at it
its already been exposed that the people who ran brexit were either russian agents or just looking to line their own pockets   of course the uk is to retarded to just hold a second referendum because of mum pride
    why can you take paul krugman seriously when hes so seriously wrong all the time  if he worked for a business and was actually accountable for his balls and strikes hed be fired long ago
the eu is just getting started with its tyrannical decrees  if britain sticks with the eu it will be destroyed continental europe would love to see the anglo mindset destroyed
paul krugman is a con artist apologist for the worst neoliberal crimes get fucked t actual leftist
  but he won a nobel prize you dumb fuck that means anything he says cant be questioned no matter how retarded    centrists get the bullet too
  honest question are you an american
  paul krugman  economic facts    whats funny about an economics nobel prize winner commenting on economics  remember when he incorrectly applied metcalfes law and said the internet would be have no more of a significant effect on the economy than the fax machine
  this level of credentialism
  democracy is great because democracy is good  unless enough people i dont like vote then its bad  election results are illegitimate until i get what i want    this is why im a monarchist people dont deserve democracy so long as they let people who unironically believe this i suspect your comment is taking a jab at remainers like this vote
  hey brits dont listen to these chucklefucks you are way too cool to associate with those losers too bad bout germany tho
  this is why im a monarchist  ill get the tar who wants to get the feathers
  (((krugman)))
what is /news/ anymore
pure democracy is mob rule a monarchy is stupid    constitutional republic is the way to go
  economics nobel prize winner paul krugman weighs in on the brexit his arguments absolutely destroy the stupidity of the brexiters  its a bit late now he should have done that 2 years ago
despite his fancy nobel prize krugman has still managed to be wrong about just about everything including advocating for the generation of the housing bubble
why are britfags still trying to go through with brexit we all know its a terrible idea now worse still is that there is evidence that the whole thing was influenced by outside actors just to destabilize the west something that affects that much about the country shouldnt even be decided by a simple majority anyway
brexiters are so fucking stupid
  krugman lol
    lol i know right i have no economic arguments to make for why he may be wrong but lol its krugman
  see  and 
  baby dont /pol/ me
its there is any truth behind it surely somebody more trustworthy than krugman will come forward
  /thread ended here
  this is not an argument you did not address the economic theory behind krugmans article    instead you decided to talk about predictions he was wrong about every economist has made wrong predictions that does not disqualify them from making assessments
  that does not disqualify them from making assessments  if someones assessments lead to inaccurate predictions you shouldnt trust their assessments as for economic theory people predicting a brexit dividend probably werent going places but most of the reasons for brexit werent based solely on trade policy they were based primarily on a multidimensional notion of sovereignity the uk wants out of everything except the customs union the eu tells the uk fuck you    also this thread literally shouldnt exist given that its literally an oped also its from fucking july
  honestly who gives a hot shit what paul alkrugman has to say about anything fuck him and any libtard leftist commie who agrees with him
  i believe the guillotine is the correct party prank for this event
paul krugman destroys brexit  no need brexit is about to destroy itself kek
lets ignore the facts that krugman mentioned such as the gravity model of trade projecting bad news for the brexit because hurrr durrr krugman has made incorrect predictions about the internet
paul krugman  facts  ha
  what do paul krugmans models say about the british colony in the americas seperating from the crown and it becoming a united states of america
  lets ignore the fact that this thread is a shit festival garbage fire that openly and ambiguously breaks the rules of /news/
  muh economix    i couldnt give a fuck about the economics that wasnt the grounds i voted on at all
  because youre a dumbfuck brexiter
  enjoy your union of islamic states
  he is a double digit iq retard who thought the internet wouldnt have anymore effect on the economy than the fax machine  anyone who thinks krugman is a voice worth listening to should blow their brains out immediately
  hurrr durrr he was wrong about a technology prediction back in 1998 therefore hes wrong about everything on economics even though he won a nobel prize and attended mit and yale
  i guess the problem is not you but companies small business owners workers and everyone in between who just dont want to take a pay cut and who will urge their leaders to stonewall it because of how bad it will be for them individually dont blame the government blame those people
  all the people in this thread calling him stupid he hasnt said anything that others havent said already  brussels will still set uk trade policy except that britain will no longer have a vote so what was the point of brexit in the first place  everyone who is a mayite is asking the same question her fucking staff is quitting over it krugman comes ans just repeats what everyone is saying but hes wrong    hey i dont like capitalist economists either but in this case he isnt wrong the uk is now a vassal state of the eu the eu sets their laws pretty funny and you fucking brits can get angry and wave your legal deweaponised teaspoons all you want but the fact remains that britain is still in the eu without a say fuck you
  just like how being in nafta makes mexico and canada tributary states of the usa
  that depends do canada and mexico have a say in the nafta
  why can you take paul krugman seriously when hes so seriously wrong all the time  if he worked for a business and was actually accountable for his balls and strikes hed be fired long ago its not just the fax machine or advocating the housing bubble or predicting an economic collapse when trump entered office  hes so consistently wrong and not held to a standard
  why can you take paul krugman seriously when hes so seriously wrong all the time    but hes not most of his predictions have been correct
      hes really not done that great a job  mises  obviously a partisan source but that particular article seems to feature factual reporting
  brits getting angry  british public opinion in the 4channel age demographic was very much against brexit look to yank zoomer males for the butthurt about nyt and their journalists and characters like trump who support brexit simply because it sounds like it aligns with the ideology he would use to obtain power
he forgets he has fox news and the rest of the right wing media to do his bidding        president donald trump on monday suggested the united states should create a worldwide network to combat the unfair way the country is treated by the media saying cnn doesnt have enough competition overseas    throughout the world cnn has a powerful voice portraying the united states in an unfair the president tweeted and false way something has to be done including the possibility of the united states starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are great    cnn has both a domestic and international network    the us government currently funds voice of america an international radio broadcast source congress in 2017 eliminated the board of directors for the organization with a new ceo position created which is appointed by the president    trump has had a tense relationship with the press including a brief legal battle with cnn after the white house revoked reporter jim acostas press pass
    like the afrts/ss except trump is the programming director that would be kind of hilarious
  isnt that just fox news
this can only end well
  came here to say this the news corp/21st century fox worldwide networks including sky are already the trumpco propaganda channels murdoch calls or speaks to trump at least once a week only slightly less than hannity does    
  no trump gets his info from fox news hed use this new network to spread it out to the rest of the world
  so really this org would serve the function of making fox seem less biased by comparison
  trump wants an overt propaganda station where they tow what he says without question 100 of the time fox news feds trump information and on the occasion does opposes him like shep smith pointing out some of trumps more egregious lies
trump already has an overt propoganda station his people are conspiring with  
attack was foiled 2 pakistani guards killed all 3 terrorists killed  a female police officer suhai talpur led the security operation      clips from the attack  beginning    aftermath      whats left of the attackers who were killed by sniper fire by the pakistani police swat team  extremely nsfw/nsfl btw      
  what a couple of nimrods who tf thought it would be a good idea to march down the middle of the street brandishing aks in the open like its a parade and kicking off the event by casually tossing a grenade
  also shoutout to the sheer ineptitude of the attackers when the dumb fucks cant even understand the concept of a shoulder stock and one of the dumbasses has his hand over the barrel and across the sights you know youre dealing with total amateurs

    new york reuters  a new york state judge rejected us president donald trumps request to dismiss a lawsuit in which new yorks attorney general accused him of misusing his namesake foundation to advance his 2016 presidential campaign and his businesses     the decision issued friday by justice saliann scarpulla of the state supreme court in manhattan is a rebuke to the republican president whose lawyer had accused attorney general barbara underwood a democrat of pervasive bias for suing    scarpulla said the us constitution did not immunize trump from the lawsuit and underwood could pursue claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty improper selfdealing and misuse of assets belonging to the donald j trump foundation    underwood sued trump and his adult children donald jr eric and ivanka on june 14 after a 21month probe that she said uncovered extensive unlawful political coordination between the foundation and trumps campaign    the white house was not immediately available for comment alan futerfas a lawyer for the defendants said the decision meant only that the case would go forward     as we have maintained throughout all of the money raised by the foundation went to charitable causes to assist those most in need as a result we remain confident in the ultimate outcome of these proceedings futerfas said in an email    the lawsuit alleged among other things that trump wrongly ceded control to his campaign of about 28 million donated to the foundation in a 2016 iowa fundraiser for military veterans    other challenged expenses included 100000 to settle a dispute involving trumps maralago resort and 10000 for a portrait of trump that was later hung at one of his golf clubs
in her 27page decision scarpulla called new yorks lawsuit replete with allegations that foundation funds were misused including at trumps direction    she also said the state sufficiently alleged that trumps actions were willful and intentional citing allegations that he and his campaign arranged for the foundation to cut checks helping generate votegetting publicity that mr trump would have otherwise paid for himself    the defendants have been trying to dissolve the foundation and for this reason scarpulla refused to issue an injunction barring the trumps from running it    underwood welcomed scarpullas decision    the trump foundation functioned as little more than a checkbook to serve mr trumps business and political interests underwood said in a statement there are rules that govern private foundations  and we intend to enforce them     new yorks lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation recoup 28 million and ban the trumps from leadership roles at charities    trump faces many investigations and many lawsuits by democraticled or democraticleaning states including new york    he has used twitter to call underwoods lawsuit a concoction by sleazy new york democrats and pledged not to settle    the case is new york v trump et al new york state supreme court new york county no 451130/2018         justice in case you thought trumps only crime against america was treason with his conspiracy to with the russians well hes done plenty of crimes outside of politics and theyre all coming to light
as we have maintained throughout all of the money raised by the foundation went to charitable causes to assist those most in need  eric and don jr are special needs
  i think you mean donald
the creator of spongebob stephen hillenburg has recently died at the young age of 57    
this guy had a strange imagination but i liked it as a kid
former fbi director james comey has asked a us court to quash house republicans subpoena for his testimony saying he wants to testify in public rather than behind closed doors    in court papers filed late thursday afternoon in washington comeys attorneys also asked for an order staying the closeddoor congressional interview with members of the house judiciary and oversight committees thats scheduled for dec 3 until the court rules    today my legal team filed court papers to try to get transparency from house republicans comey said on twitter let the american people watch        based comey laying down the fucking law glad there are still some decent republicans out there
you people have to stop astroturfing this forum this shit is getting old
  waaaah stop posting articles i dont like this is my safe space  perhaps reddit is more your speed boyo
  why dont people just normally visit your websites  why do you have to artificially promote them   have you ever considered these two questions at all
  cry more
  you are very bad at marketing
  you are very good at crying
  pissing off the advertisers that come to /news/ is my hobby it only makes sense that im good at it
  admitting to being good at crying
  admitting to astroturfing a chinese cartoon forum
          being this butthurt that comey wants transparency   and i wouldnt deny saying these arent all you
  if comey wants transparency they why didnt he investigate the former secretary of state and the misdealings that was libya
  whataboutism
  muh canned responses  just ignore corruption from the last administration its okay when we do it
  perhaps you should build the wall out of clinton since you cant get over her
  you dont have a single shred of proof of clintons corruption the benghazi investigation went on for half a decade and found nothing
  why are you defending government corruption  what are you priorities
  butthurt his attempts to obfuscate are ignored      sensiblechucklegif
  you dont have a single shred of proof of clintons corruption the benghazi investigation went on for half a decade and found nothing
  cant make arguments  continue petty insults
  wasting time arguing against a tu quoque logical fallacy
  left wing article often spread over multiple posts  anime girl reaction image  glib ending sentence  how many of this threads have we seen

    deflecting                                
  isnt there supposed to be a five thread limit on news
  its ipbased if your ip has been changing and 4chan x is keeping your yous for you youre in violation
  holy fuck
  and what are you going to do about it    thats the best thing ive just fed your paranoia and you still cant stop me
      actually its a 10 thread limit and the image only had 10 yous so you cant accuse him of breaking any rules  regardless with 4chanx you can masquerade as the creator of threads since you can toggle on and off yous which makes the whole thing moot with screenshots
  huh do you have a source on it being a ten thread limit
  and what are you going to do about it  im not him but i managed to grab a screenshot       thankfully even a deleted post can still be linked to an individual user
  again what are you going to do about it
  regardless with 4chanx you can masquerade as the creator of threads since you can toggle on and off yous which makes the whole thing moot with screenshots  from the admin side they can still see which posts are tied to which user/ip regardless of what 4chanx is showing from the user side      again what are you going to do about it  report you for rules violations and spam silly
  good luck
  remember the time that someone said they were going to report you for spam and then did and then you were banned and all your hundreds of shareblue posts were deleted
  try and create 11 threads and tell me what happens      youd be banned for false reporting since he only posted 10 threads based on his screenshot
  youd be banned for false reporting since he only posted 10 threads based on his screenshot  hes also spamming so no spamming/flooding
  over a period of months yeah good luck with that
  ive never made it to ten threads so i cant do that i mean do you have a source in the code or something for that because 5 is definitely the limit on every other board
  youre just declaring it spam because you dont like what hes posting thats not how it works on 4chan nothing hes done is against the rules and guess what this is /news/ it stands for current news meaning we constantly need new threads about new events if anything hes doing the board a service by posting as much as he does      a good way to show you the limit isnt 5 is to post 6 threads post human interest or weird news like news similar to the giant cow thread if youre stuck with what to post
also it would be nice if this was reimplemented  threads older than 48 hours will cease to bump when replied to
  im still not sure why they removed that as it made sense but i figure i may as well take advantage of it
  youd be banned for false reporting since he only posted 10 threads based on his screenshot  there are at least 11 yous whether the limit is 5 or 10 somehow hes over
  its probably tied to how old the threads are then   the list of threads has one thats over a month old and one thats two months old        and it makes sense to do that because say we had a limit on threads all a shitposter needs to do is keep bumping your threads and you wouldnt be able to create any more after a while because you reached the cap    again if youre going to complain to the mods something that would help a lot more than complaining about spamming would be to get this reinstated   threads older than 48 hours will cease to bump when replied to
  he wants to testify in public rather than behind closed doors  sounds good to me and i voted republican
comey is universally hated by leftards  acts like a retard  universally hated by cringeservatives  comey is loved by leftards now  acts like a special boy and continually spergs out even though hes irrelevant
  if hes irrelevant why has he been subpoenad     if hes irrelevant why does the gop insist on keeping his testimony private    if hes irrelevant why are trumptards so desperately deflecting away from what he has to say
  nice im stealing it
  you tell me
  perhaps because hes not irrelevant and theyre afraid of what he has to say
   like a special boy and continually spergs out even though hes irrelevant  house republicans were the ones that tried to subpoena him out of the blue and he agreed to it but he didnt want it to be behind closed doors
  actually even before the subpoena was issued comey said hed come to testify willingly but only if it was in a public setting republicans refused to meet that request and then subpoena him for a closed door session which comey called out and is now fighting so he can testify in public
  fun fact comey is republican and so is mueller trump has tried to paint them as democrats since theyre not on his side quite pitiful
  so you dont know consider that next time you open your mouth
  youd be banned for false reporting since he only posted 10 threads based on his screenshot  i feel it should be mentioned that while it would be nice if he was banned for false reporting since all these threads are still here and his reports obviously didnt do jack shit the mods only ever ban for false reporting if you misuse the illegal activity button this is probably because janitors are the ones who handle the moderation most of the time but if its marked as against the law it sends out a notification to all mods on the site because 4chan is liable if people get caught breaking the law so understandably the mods are fucking pissed if they were alerted for nothing and will hand out a ban for it
  comey  decent republican    holy shit its like you dont even remember 2016 comey is the sole person responsible for trumps election he intentionally used his position to help trump win the election fuck comey fuck comey fuck comey and dont you fucking forget it
  comeys letter was leaked the person who leaked it is the one responsible comey was just doing his job
  yeah good question what the fuck is the current administration doing not investigating her are they really so braindead retarded and incompetent they havent even started the job they promised to do for 2 years
  subtle ownage i like it
  oh snap
  smooooth criminal
  anime girl reaction image  why are you even here
  using an anime girl reaction image is one thing but using an anime girl reaction image for political purposes is something else entirely
  using an anime girl reaction image for political purposes is something else entirely  who fucking cares how some anon uses an anime girl reaction image on a mexican crocheting soviet
  few things are more important than the proper use of anime girl reaction images on mediterranean weaving circles
  proper use of anime girl reaction images    if its a situation where you can be smug even in politics anime girl reaction images not only allowed but encouraged     if you got a problem with that i will start making news threads threads excursively with nagatoro and uzaki
  but encouraged   anyone actually from /a/ or /jp/ would shit on you for this
  anyone who claims to be from a board is a massive newfag
  anyone who believes this is a poser shit of the worst kind usually doing so in an attempt to ingratiate himself with members of a new board
  wrong
  try making this argument anywhere on /a/ or /jp/ id like to see it
  why dont you try making the opposite argument and see how quickly you get called a retard
  the notion that people come from boards is so bitch basic that everyone does it except a small subset of selfappointed cosmopolitan shiteaters people refer to people as being from boards all the time in those board even in /news/ itself people claim that people are from /pol/ all the time and nobody bats a fucking eye because people are fully aware that most people come from places
    ask /a/ or /jp/      the fatal flaw in your statement that shows your ignorance is that /a/ and /jp/ are isolationist boards that take proactive measures to keep foreigners from shitting up their board with normalfag memes post a pepe or wojack thread and see how long before it gets deleted /a/ and /jp/ dont care if you use anime reaction images for anything else just dont bring cancer back home with you  if you lurked moar youd know that newfag
  i asked dumbshit of course i dont know why would i ask if i didnt know
  /a/ and /jp/ dont care if you use anime reaction images for anything else  yeah /a/ and /jp/ have never expressed negative opinions of ironic weebs who use anime avatars for selfaggrandizement or the people who coopt characters for poltical purposes like maga momiji and political anime twitter not even once you figured it out
  weeb  first off tell me the definition of that
  what the full history lecture or just what ironic weebs means in the context of how /a/ uses it today    its completely fucking common vocabulary by now and if you want the full history i can give it to you but i really dont see the fucking point
  id tell you to give me the full history but youd just look it up on some website so it just makes it a moot point for being a newfag filter     either way im going to post anime reaction images for future news article ops both because its fun and because itll piss you off   there is no irony there because ironic shitposting is still shitposting
  so why did you even bother fucking asking    either way im going to post anime reaction images for future news article ops both because its fun and because itll piss you off   enjoy taking shits on the characters you claim to like
  enjoy taking shits  i dont have a scat fetish like you take that to /d/
  i dont have a scat fetish like you take that to /d/  then why do you insist on shitting on the characters you claim to like
  why are you so desperate to project onto me
  you people have to stop astroturfing this forum this shit is getting old    seriously if you took all of shareblue shillsteins orange man baaad reeeeeee shitposts off /news/ youd have like 4 posts
  all im doing is accurately describing what youre doing but dont take my word for it ask the topic boards what they think of using anime characters for political purposes
  no you arent youre projecting   also if youre so desperate to find out ask yourself
  comey knew that shit would be leaked immediately he had no reason to send it other than to have it leak and tank hillarys shot at becoming president
  i dont need to ask as ive been in countless threads where the point has been beaten to death
  so you dont have proof also youre creating a strawman where you think using an anime reaction image as the op for a news thread is somehow inherently politicizing her as opposed to people who shop maga hats on everything which is is politicizing them      thats a lightyear gap and makes you intellectually bankrupt for implying it
  /news/ is /drumpf/ now
  pretentiousness the post  you also never offered evidence to back up any of your claims other than find it yourself thats not how it works    so remain mad as anime will be on /news/
  you never offered proof of any of your statements although in your case its understandable because it doesnt exist    thats a lightyear gap and makes you intellectually bankrupt for implying it  this is the first even sightly intelligent thing youve said all day i guess after fabricating four shit arguments you were bound to find one eventually    your usage of reason images isnt quite hattier its more akin to the anime girl spam that anime political twitter likes to do sometimes but the purpose is the same to mire anime girls in political bullshit maybe use your brain for just one second and try to figure out why topic boards unanimously agree that maga anime girls are dumb spoiler its not for partisan reasons there are countless extremely reactionary 4chan users who still dont want using above characters for rightwing purposes
  yes that letter is what tanked her chances and not the russians hacking voting machines and collaborating with her opponent fucking /pol/ppuets
  arent you some sort of massive oldfag who should have seen all these things already literally any archive search for maga hat will do    as for your repeated and insistent claim that you will forever and always continue to shit on anime characters thats your choice nobody can take it away from you
  the russians hacking voting machines   do you have a source for this claim
comey says he doesnt want to testify in a closed session because he doesnt want leaks  this from the same james comey who leaked his own memos to a friend to release in order to get a special counsel comey fears a secure setting because he wouldnt be able to use his favorite response to questions from the l legislature is i cant talk about that in an open session how many times is that phase in the transcript of his testimony to date
  the leaked comey memo was unclassified and comey broke no laws in releasing it    matters that cannot be handled in open session are already addressed every time in a subsequent closed session
  the doj has leaked only damaging information about the president throughout its investigation of donald trumps campaign while hiding behind a sources and methods smokescreen to avoid answering questions about how and why that investigation started i cant believe that comey ever gave congress or the senate a straight answer about why carter page was surveilled for a year straight but never charged with a crime more than a dozen other russian agents have indictments against them why not the direct connect between russia and the trump camp if youre going to bring up mifsud as the key link then why wasnt he charged/arrested while he was in dc last year before he disapeared
  thats your opinion and its wrong
    several hundred managed to climb over the first barrier according to afp news agency it was as they tried to cross a second spiketopped wall that officials on the us side began firing tear gas
the parents willingly drag their children along to participate in getting gassed for attempting to break us law its almost as if they have no souls
  just consider shits worse on the other side
2 esdras 1517 a man shall desire to go into a city and shall not be able
  the caravan is months away
   hundreds of illegals  the migrants arent breaking us law until they actually step foot on us soil    if us troops fire weapons yes tear gas is a weapon cletus across a sovereign border into a group of nonus civilians thats not defense thats an act of war
  fuck off pedro we are full
  how far do they have to be from the wall after hopping over it until you consider it illegal juan
  i choose war
but cnn told me these people are still thousands of miles away from the border and pose no threat at all    has cnn lied to me
  excellent war is what we need
its depressing that none of them got killed
  its inevitable at this point
  love how people are spinning it like why are we shooting gas canisters at kids while im sitting back thinking why are these inept single mothers dragging their kids into confrontations they know they are going to lose   of course anybody who had even half the desirable iq of your average immigrant would have first accepted the asylum from mexico settled down there then gotten a job permit in the us while applying for us citizenship       its not an act of war if a the immigrants are not mexican citizens and bmexican police cannot hold them back if anything the us is supplementing mexicos efforts to stop illegal border crossings into the us because they know they will face backlash if they dont do something about it also its not like the mexicans want them there either
i rarely admit that trump was right about anything but i will admit that he was at least right about them getting here sooner than middecember
lethal force should apply to everyone doing this   kill everyone who isnt following our procedures and tries to hop the border   impale their heads on pikes and hand their bodies off the wall
    worked in hungary still working in fact
  make it more passive landmines would be ideal
  of course anybody who had even half the desirable iq of your average immigrant would have first accepted the asylum from mexico  not that easy        an amnesty international survey of 385 central american migrants suggests that mexican authorities routinely force people to return to dangerous conditions in their home countries the rights group said tuesday    seventyfive percent of the migrants from guatemala honduras and el salvador who were interviewed said they had not been informed by mexican immigration agents about their right to seek asylum in mexico    the report also said that people seeking asylum whose lives are at risk in central america are very frequently pressured into signing voluntary return deportation papers    in 2017 14596 people asked for asylum in mexico a 66 increase over 2016 of those 1907 requests were approved in 2017    so mexican authorities often fail to offer the option of asylum and even when they do the odds of actually being approved are very low
  us troops  not just wrong but illegal theyre either cops or ice not military
  honestly writing completely inaccurate headlines for /news/ threads should be made a bannable offense
  do you have any idea how many people cross the border every year these people in san diego arent even 01
  while im sitting back thinking why are these inept single mothers dragging their kids into confrontations they know they are going to lose    leftist groups in the us are going to them and telling them that the us soldiers and police will not kill them and that if they can get them on video getting tear gassed or beaten with riot batons then they have a better chance of getting us public support they are being told that they have lawyers lined up to represent them they are being told that they have donated money available to help support them they are being told that if they go through some indignities and hardships right now that they will be rewarded later they are being told that most americans hate president trump and that if they can just get into the us then they will have many people willing to help them    the us groups that go south of the border to help and encourage these people are using them as a tool in a propaganda war maybe they actually care about them in some abstract way but they are being encouraged to put themselves in danger so they can become a usable spectacle
  sources your gaping asshole
  oy vey
  backing up your claims is a jewish trick  feel free to fuck off to /pol/ where the brainlets belong
  fuck off rodrigo we have enough charity cases here go back to your shit hole country and stay there
      i guess its time to have obama extradited to the hague where he can be lethally injected for all the war crimes he committed
  soon hopefully these people are parasites
  following our procedures  mmuh right way    the us has been steadily closing asylum checkpoints since trump took office the right way is becoming more and more of a joke immigrants have to choose between violent oppressors and the us still isnt as bad as what they are fleeing    make more criminals guys that way we can add more to our body count to dog whistle /pol/
beans
beaners try to cross illegally  get tear gassed  call america an aggressive country  what the fuck did they expect to happen if you want to be here get papers dumbass
hello war crimes  tear gas is considered a chemical weapon under international law making the us governments response seem all the more hostile but it also highlights the strangeness of the role that border patrol is playing right now its a domestic law enforcement agency thats working in concert with law enforcement in another country to prevent people from crossing a border    tear gas is illegal for international use but not for use in domestic law enforcement local police departments in the us frequently use it to disperse crowds when someone in the crowd is engaging in illegal activity especially when someone in the crowd is throwing things at law enforcement officials    but this isnt domestic law enforcement the tear gas canisters clearly crossed an international border and their aim working in concert with mexican officials was to prevent people from being able to step onto us soil at which point the us would be obligated to hear their asylum claims without turning them back under current law
  really  thats funny because its completely legal for anyone to own in the state of california  
  it is strange the role that border patrol is playing  they are preventing people from illegally crossing borders  do you realize how dumb you sound
  and their aim working in concert with mexican officials was to prevent people from being able to step onto us soil at which point the us would be obligated to hear their asylum claims without turning them back under current law  maybe they should just enter at a legal point of entry nobody is stopping them from doing that faggot
  your full of shit if using tear gas was an international crime it wouldnt be used by literally every developed nation on the face of earth as a basic crowd control method
  scary how true this is
  also this
  shut it down obama was a good goy
  heh heh  beans
  tear gas is an international crime because someone on /news/ said it was after they could tie its use to trump
  bigly if true
  truely is bigly
  the migrants arent breaking us law until they actually step foot on us soil  then why are they being arrested  checkmate
        tear gas is considered a chemical weapon   tear gas is legal for domestics use  however it was clearly launched across international boarders  war crime at worst crime against humanity at best
  holy hell am i thankful youre not a politician or person of authority
  tear gas is considered a crowd control weapon much like pepper spray  tear gas is legal for domestics use and use likely anywhere internationally  however it was clearly launched across international boarders to assist mexican police who were also battling the immigrants and using tear gas themselves  protecting borders at the worst doing a good job ad the best  ftfy faggot  seriously war crime crime against humanity what the fuck are you smoking to think tear gas is either of those because it must be some good shit
who cares if it is considered either one thing or another you do what you have to do to secure your border from opportunists
  tear gas is like crimes against humanity like man
  if tear gas was a crime against humanity they why the fuck is it legal in pretty much every country
crossing the border is a just a misdemeanor you people are getting mad at the equivalent of a speeding ticket
  no crossing the border is criminal a speeding ticket is a traffic violation and is not criminal its an infraciton    you just won the award for dumbest comment ever
  a traffic violation is a criminal misdemeanor just like crossing the border is the only difference is crossing the border is breaking a federal law and a traffic violation is breaking a state law
  and thats not right  other countries you can get shot and killed for just crossing the boarder why does america have to have a giant welcome mat out for these gangsters
america has enough low iq brown people we dont need more
  other countries you can get shot and killed for just crossing the boarder  can you name some of these
we should go to war with honduras over this invasion force
  goes to war with honduras  now millions of refugees come instead of thousands  now this is epic
  illegals  illegaly  reported by the department of redundancy dept
  these subhumans come from multiple countries
        its not really a chemical weapon  is not a war crime who cares what the use of chemical weapons is one  who cares if they   launch it across international boarders  this is what war crime apologists say
forget to mention something most of these so called migrants are frauds many are bragging on social media about how many times they have been deported social media paints a different picture many have resources to come back often and are relatively well off by latin american standardsliars and criminals the whole lot of them
  right wing false flags dont count
  everything that contradicts me is a right wing false flag
  im glad my tax dollars went towards something useful for once
  i have no creditable sources to back up my claims
  defending your country is an act of war of aggression  woah santa maria you might be on to something
  not even the guy you replied to but you are the one making the claim you moron
  i bet you were so sympathetic to the children killed in drone strikes authorized by hillary clinton and barrack obama
  or the illegals that border patrol shot tear gas at under obamas presidency
  a traffic violation is a criminal misdemeanor  no faggot  its only criminal if you break the law bady like lets say speeding 30 over the speed limit in certain states  in the united states most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state county and municipal laws or ordinances with most minor violations classified as infractions
  north sentinal island   checkmate shitlord
  asking someone to back up their claim means you have to present proof on your side  hello burden of proof fallacy
doctors speak out against trumps crimes against humanity  
  ok faggot  tear gas is technically a chemical weapon  it is not an internationally banned chemical weapon  its use is banned only in warfare  its use is completely permitted for riot control internationally  its use is completely permitted for police likely anywhere in the world  we are not using it for warfare we are using it for riot control  go read  and shit up some other forum
  yeah their parents really shouldnt have dragged their children across several countries with the intent to break us law then the american association of pediatrics wouldnt have to be upset about it
  this   we need to hold ourselves to a standard
friendly reminder  nobody who is attempting to enter the country at a legal port of entry is getting tear gassed only the ones that are attempting to enter the country illegally and attempting to storm barricades in the process
  ah i see the problem now  you are clearly illiterate
  chemical weapon  launched across a boarder   should not be considered an act of war or crime against humanity  your arguement only works if this was used domestically this was launched over an international boarder   hence war crime/crime against humanity
  immigrants have to choose between violent oppressors and the us still isnt as bad as what they are fleeing    just like in europe with mass migration of the arabs and africans the vast majority of hispanic migrants to the us are coming here not because theyre running from violent oppressors but for purely economic reasons as they can easily sponge off our generous welfare system    trump needs to deploy the army to shut down the border and repurpose ice to exclusively bust american employers and landlords who enable this foreign invasion
  so you cant back up your lies   okay
  you need to go back and read the reply chain buddy   do it as many times as you need until you unfuck your understanding of this conversation
  americans were assiting the mexican police who were attempting to stop them from crossing the border by constructing baricades and defending them  its not like they suddenly started shooting tear gas into tj for no reason faggot  go fuck up some other board
  there is no war going on with mexico there are no enemy combatants there is no body killing each other faggot  hence no war crime  i cant tell if you are a genuine idiot or just trolling
  children  hahah good joke i remember hearing the same bullshit when hordes of adult african males started to invade europe
  youre confusing a parking ticket with a speeding ticket speeding and crossing the border are the same type of minor crime called a misdemeanor
  implying mexico will do anything about it
  i mean israel used live ammo against gazans trying to do the same  why doesnt the us either do the same or condemn israel
    because the usa is a jewish puppet state full of men raised by women who dont have the stones to protect themselves anymore
  because the usa is a jewish puppet state full of men raised by women who dont have the stones to protect themselves anymore      what is israel  dude israeli troops need diapers not even kidding the army supplies them diapers so they can more comfortably piss themselves  also jews place more importance on the mother raising the children thats why theyre all scrawny faggots
  cnn would never lie to you they will post a retraction on their text website sometime next year
  well in israel the palestinians like killing jews and the israelis do use nonlethal methods also
    if you were as ignorant as youre trying to be then you wouldnt know how to breathe m8
    consider    into the trash next to    thinking  logic  honesty  individuality  intelligence
    the fairest solution i can see is for every immigrant coming through we send one person of lesser worth to their country in trade    hopefully there are enough republicans before we have to start turning the poor guys away
  and what do you think is gonna happen when that shit from the other side spills here
  no i am not at least not where i live i dont know about your byzantine municipality but where i live   an infraction is a public offense but arguably not a crime and is not punishable by imprisonment  typically most infractions are punished with a fine only examples of infractions in california are traffic violation such as exceeding the posted speed limit etc
    i chucked over this  also israel
    hence crossing border  criminal / speeding ticket  except for the 1/1000000 like you who argue it is criminal when everything else says its not because it is convenient for your narrative
  its depressing how many of you edgy cunts exist    why dont they get asylum in mexico first   they were denied  lol why even bother dragging your child to a confrontation with border patrol  doubt many of them thought theyd get gassed i havent ever heard of that happeneing before as for why id say they wanted a better life some tear gas on the border is gonna seem like some shit worth enduring compared to the cartels in honduras to people whove experienced that violence firsthand    people fleeing violence have a strong sense of urgency in regards to getting into us and us keeps closing asylum points so caravan tries to enter illegally in an attempt to flee violence  lol fuk off juan we full  complex situations met with simple solutions time and time again by conservatives
    bbut they did it too  you in third grade anon
  and thats a good thing
  ay carumba they wont let us hop their walls anymore esse this is an act of war n shit
  how did /news/ become a reddit colony you faggots dont dare show your face like this on any other board
  i honestly think its the only board that is slow enough it can be turned into a hug box  honestly it makes me shitpost here twice as hard because i resent this boards progressiveness because it borders on retardation
    launching chemical weapons across intentional boarders   war crimes at worst crimes against humanity at best   it would be fun to send trump the icc just to watch conservatives heads explode
  this was already posted faggot and refuted quite easily several times in the thread stop reposting your same tired shit repeatedly  literally that exact phrase you said his earlier in the thread
  funny hes not there for this its almost as if your completely wrong and talking out if your ass
    except it wasnt refuted  stop being a war crimes apologist
  go kill yourself  and then read        
  im glad someone else is swinging by this board occasionally because youre exactly right about this boards retardation the fact its displayed to me in chan format makes it ever so much more glaring
  reddit colony  thats a funny way of saying /pol/  if anything /news/ is what /n/ and /new/ was like before stormfront took over
  actions used by previous administrations have no bearing on the current one  are you autistic anon this is how the real world works
  this board isnt like /pol/ at all  its like a mix of reddit an general 4chan
  personally im an oldfag from before /pol/ took over i dont think its just /pol/ and reddit the rest of 4chan isnt nearly as overrun by /pol/fags as you seem to think or rather wish it were
  someone has to fight the good fight
  the rest of 4chan isnt nearly as overrun by /pol/fags as you seem to think  i dont think this i think just the opposite  this board isnt overrun with /pol/ fags either its about consistent with the rest of 4chan with added reddit
    i think you may be arguing a general poisoning the well fallacy  this board is current event oriented and thus peoples political opinions are brought up and voiced often there is a mix of conservative and iberal thought here just like the rest of 4chan it is only voiced more often  this causes the liberals to scream /pol/ and the conservatives to scream reddit when likely its just normal 4chan users  its not like border jumping gets talked about often in /g/ or /a/ thus it seems like a redditbox or /pol/box to most people who visit here because that is what they associate the most with opposite political opinions
  im glad someone else is swinging by this board occasionally because youre exactly right about this boards retardation  im a regular conservative /news/man ive come to filter any thread with trump in the subject because its impossible to actually have a discussion without getting the full script of last nights talkshows the board being 2 pages long is just an unfortunate side effect
im the real oldfag here   cringe
  the number of threads on this board with trump in the title is really disgusting it should either limited or this board should just be named /trump/ and all non trump related news should be on /news/
  you need to fuck off newfag  im the real oldfag here   ive been posting on 4chan since it was a cb radio station ran by moots uncle out of his grandmothers basement
  the only problem is /pol/ and reddit are the same thing its just them projecting onto other people when they claim someone else is from reddit
  except /pol/ and reddit are very different one is a liberal hugbox where namestatus is all and censorship is readily accepted and the other is an anonymous anarchic shitflinging free for all where argumentative skill is king and censorship only exists in the form of leftist self censorship when they cant turn it into yet another echo chamber
  kek
  except /pol/ and reddit are very different  the_donalds existence destroys your theory
  and all the brigading they do
just put a bunch of angled trampolines on the other side that way when they jump over the fence they are immediately launched back to the other side
  landmines would work better
    except no it doesnt because r/the_donald is the ideology prevalent on /pol/ but run through the wrangle of reddit its the very dynamics of the sites themselves that lead to this whereas on /pol/ the ideology has come about by appealing to the userbase in a greater sense than any other and has not been displaced by any new incoming argument ie it has not been organically outargued through the anonymous shitpost dynamics of the board meanwhile over on r/the_donald this same ideology is expressed through reddits namestatusisall prism its arguably at its most extreme over there with the little emojis and badges they give themselves and the bots and mods they have policing the speech  that policing is not a r/the_donald phenomenon its a reddit phenomenon borne out of the basic layout of the site     tl dr you guys literally actually must be very reddit yourselves to not understand the fundamental differences between the sites only being somebody with the limited view of this phenomenon borne out of originating on reddit can explain your ignorance
  you dont understand how different websites manipulate public opinion and the organized manner in which it is done is 99 performed by people from t_d or /pol/ also t_d influenced /pol/ not the other way around theres far far far more similarity between reddit and 4chan than people like you are willing to admit sources me being very reddit
  10 have been deposited in your bank account

  what is no mans land
    palm beach county courthouse    june 30 2008    jeffrey edward epstein appeared at his sentencing dressed comfortably in a blue blazer blue shirt jeans and gray sneakers his attorney jack goldberger was at his side    at the end of the 68minute hearing the 55yearold silverhaired financier  accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls  was fingerprinted and handcuffed just like any other criminal sentenced in florida    but inmate no w35755 would not be treated like other convicted sex offenders in the state of florida which has some of the strictest sex offender laws in the nation    ten years before the metoo movement raised awareness about the kidglove handling of powerful men accused of sexual abuse epsteins lenient sentence and his extraordinary treatment while in custody are still the source of consternation for the victims he was accused of molesting when they were minors    beginning as far back as 2001 epstein lured a steady stream of underage girls to his palm beach mansion to engage in nude massages masturbation oral sex and intercourse court and police records show the girls  mostly from disadvantaged troubled families  were recruited from middle and high schools around palm beach county epstein would pay the girls for massages and offer them further money to bring him new girls every time he was at his home in palm beach according to police reports    the girls now in their late 20s and early 30s allege in a series of federal civil lawsuits filed over the past decade that epstein sexually abused hundreds of girls not only in palm beach but at his homes in manhattan new mexico and in the caribbean
in 2007 the fbi had prepared a 53page federal indictment charging epstein with sex crimes that could have put him in federal prison for life but thenmiami us attorney alexander acosta signed off on a nonprosecution agreement which was negotiated signed and sealed so that no one would know the full scope of epsteins crimes the indictment was shelved never to be seen again    epstein instead pleaded guilty to lesser charges in state court and was required to register as a sex offender he was sentenced to 18 months incarceration    but epstein  who had a long list of powerful politically connected friends  didnt go to state prison like most sex offenders in florida instead the multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the palm beach county stockade where he was able to hire his own security detail even then he didnt spend much time in a cell he was allowed to go to his downtown west palm beach office for work release up to 12 hours a day six days a week records show     he was permitted to hire his own private psychologist for his required sexoffender counseling and after his release from jail his subsequent year of probation under house arrest was filled with trips on his corporate jet to manhattan and to his home in the us virgin islands  all approved by the courts with no objections from the state    on the morning of his sentencing in 2008 none of epsteins victims were in the courtroom to protest his soft jail term or the unusual provisions of his incarceration and probation  and that was by design
emails and letters contained in court filings reveal the cozy behindthescenes dealings between federal prosecutors and epsteins indomitable legal team during the runup to his federal plea deal as they discussed ways to minimize his criminal charges and avoid informing the girls about the details of the deal until after the case was resolved    that arrangement benefited epstein in a number of ways unlike other highprofile sex crime cases federal prosecutors agreed to keep his sentencing quiet thereby limiting media coverage his underage victims  identified in fbi documents  werent told about the plea deal so they werent in court where they could voice their objections and possibly sway the judge to give epstein a harsher sentence or reject the agreement altogether    most important epsteins crimes would be reduced to felony prostitution charges giving him the ability to argue that the girls werent victims at all  they were prostitutes    i wont quote the rest because its super long but read it anyway because if you think this is bad hold onto your butts because it gets much much worse    
drain the swamp
but was there pizza
  the basement was located in trump tower all along
  interestingly one of the women alleges that she was recruited by one of epsteins pimps while she worked at trumps maralago resort     that summer when roberts was 16 she said her father helped her get a job as a locker room attendant at the spa at donald trumps maralago resort in palm beach records show her father worked at the resort as a maintenance man    there she said she met ghislaine maxwell an epstein friend and socialite daughter of the late british publishing magnate robert maxwell she offered roberts an opportunity to become a massage therapist working for epstein    in a sworn court affidavit and in a recent interview with the herald roberts described how epstein and maxwell began grooming her  not just to perform massages but to sexually pleasure them and others    it started with one and it trickled into two and so on roberts told the herald and before you know it im being lent out to politicians and academics and royalty
haha qfags seen jumping from buildings
  his extraordinary treatment while in custody  private prisons you pay a lot of money you get treated well how weak trying to pin this on trump
  it wasnt even a private prison though he was actually supposed to go to state prison but they just let him go to county jail and spend most of the time at his office even though in florida sex offenders are not eligible for the work release program this whole thing was just so fucking scummy if you get rich and powerful enough there are literally no consequences
  were blaming trump for hiring the guy that set it up you dumb asshole
  yeah trump is all over this story first off he is longtime friends with epstein and has flown on the lolita express second his maralago resort was being used as a location to recruit new girls third he just made the guy who let epstein off with a slap on the wrist when he was caught running a child prostitution ring with hundreds of victims the fucking secretary for labor     conservatives are massive hypocrites they lost their mind over pizzagate but trump is neck deep in his own pedo connections and no one gives a shit they dont even care that he rewarded the bastards who let this guy walk they dont care about the victims they only care when they can use it as a political tool to smear democrats its frankly disgusting
  first off he is longtime friends with epstein and has flown on the lolita express  you mean bill clinton      second his maralago resort was being used as a location to recruit new girls   lol no  democrats are massive hypocrites they lost their mind over trying to deunk pizzagate but the clintons are neck deep in pedo connections and they dont give a shit they dont even care that their guy mueller used epstein as an informant and in exchange granted him immunity from charges involving sexual abuse of minors they dont care about the victims they only care when they can use it as a political tool to smear republicans  ftfy   source on mueller claim              also epstein was heavily brought up during pizzagate which your side tried to debunk because of ties to the clintons theres no way to talk about epstein without also talking about his best buddy bill or his fbi friend mueller but im sure that topic wont be gatekept by hypocritical r/politics drones before they attempt to tank the thread in its entirety
  bill clinton is not president anymore he did not just appoint this asshole to be his fucking labor secretary    misdeeds by people on the other side does not excuse misdeeds by people on your side     holy shit its like youre fucking 3 years old this shitty whataboutism crap only works on mental midgets
   shit its like youre fucking 3 years old  youd like that wouldnt you you pedo apologist
  so trump exists in a vacuum  we cannot compare his actions to other presidents or other world leaders  even bringing up a comparison is whataboutism
the president reportedly wishes he had a rare doover on those cemetery visits    n a rare expression of a regret president donald trump has admitted that he made a mistake by not visiting arlington national cemetery on the monday after veterans day a presidential tradition    why didnt he go when he had the chance according to a transcript of his conversation with fox news sunday anchor chris wallace from an interview set to air sunday he was extremely busy on veterans day    speaking with wallace about his decision not to visit the aisnemarne american cemetery in france on saturday november 10 and arlington cemetery outside dc on monday trump admitted he wishes he had a rare doover wallace told fox news shepard smith on friday    i should have done that trump said i was extremely busy on calls for the country we did a lot of calling as you know the presidents schedule for monday november 12 was empty at least of public events    but this is veterans day wallace pushed back prompting trump to admit he could have gone    but trump said he didnt realize it would be such a big deal    as you know i just left the day before the american cemetery and i probably think  and that was one where it was raining as hard as you can imagine and i made a speech at the american cemetery the day before and i probably you know in retrospect i should have and i did last year and i will virtually every year but we had come in very late at night and i had just left literally the american cemetery in paris and i really probably assumed that was fine and i was extremely busy because of affairs of state  doing other things    
trump was widely criticized on twitter and in the media for failing to visit and lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier with many asking imagine if obama had skipped arlington trumps decision to forego the traditional visit came after he had already faced bipartisan criticism for backing out of a cemetery visit in france due to rain chief of staff john kelly went instead    there were incorrect claims floating around that trump was the first sitting president in 56 years not to visit arlington on veterans day  in fact presidents in recent years have often been overseas or at commemorations in different parts of the country including trump himself last year because he was in vietnam for a vietnam war commemoration he was however the first ever to spend it inside the white house tweeting about the vote count in florida
no one who watches so much cable news and plays so much golf can ever claim to be extremely busy maybe cut down on the tv watching and let staffers fill you in then you can say something like this  he didnt realize it would be such a big deal  thats what happens when you live your whole life in a bubble
  the first to spend it tweeting about the florida vote count  no shit not that i think what he did was right but that is just reaching and with such specific criteria we could probably define everything as a first
guess teflon don isnt waterproof
  i dont think they really mean it as some historic first since twitter hasnt been around that long just that he may not be using his time in the best way possible
  fair it just frustrates me that it seems we are so obsessed with firsts in this day and age that people are going to incredible lengths to prove how someone is the first to do something its most prevalent in sports but i have seen it bleeding into other realms more recently if you put strict enough criteria on something you can justify just about anyone being the first to do it    first middle class hispanic female from the midwest with x degree in y subject to do z
  yeah i see what youre getting at i have to laugh at some of the first in sports like a player was the first person to hit a home run on the second tuesday of october in a leap year with a waxing moon on his 26th birthday
  the secret to seo see your company is now the first result in google for indianapolis dragon dildo manufacturing in the midwest now pay a bitch
  i was the first person to respond to your post with these digits
drumpf    it was raining so they couldnt attend via helicopter and the secret service detail dissuaded him from going by car because rabid leftards had set up a protest around the cemetery but yeah keep reporting fake news
  this is a lie    marine one is perfectly capable of flying in the rain its a helicopter not a hotair balloon
  what an asshole he had zero events scheduled he just took the day off i guess mr bonespurs here thinks being commander in chief makes him a veteran and that means he should get the day off instead of thinking it makes him the one who should do the job the american people hired him to do and honor veterans on the day we set aside for doing just that fuck this asshole
  this is a lie    it was 700 feet overcast      marine one is perfectly capable of flying in the rain    so is a 1963 bellanca champ its a question of risk management whether the training and procedures exist the hospitals medical helicopters will not even fly in ifr    its a helicopter not a hotair balloon    its a cemetery not an ilsequipped runway
  the first part is true however sources say that trump just didnt want to go and given then fact the white house has zero credibility due to their constant lying theres no reason to say that the secret service said he couldnt do it    the fact trump skipped out on going to arlington national cemetery to honor the troops where weather and security were not a factor only makes it more obvious that it was trumps disregard for the troops was why he refused to honor them in france
  have a 3 hour workday  i just cant fit in an hour visit to a cemetery  jesus fuck
  white house marine one cant go because its raining  secret service yes thats what happened  checks out  white house cant go by car because reasons  secret service silence  dubious claim
1 trump has done more for the military that obama and bush  2 anything in the media that states sources means its fake  3 anything to outrage the libs and their media counterparts didnt hear the outrage when its a dem
  trump has done more for the military   such as
  trump says so so it are facts
  play rock music when hes on stage
  and such as and the iraq and the us americans such as
  yeah totes man he loves the military so much he honored them on veterans daoh wait
  veterans day is observed on monday this incident happened on sunday and trump himself did visit a veterans memorial the following day
the fact you had everyone on his staff saying he shouldnt skip honoring veterans and he not only did it he spent the time just watching cable tv in his hotel room is proof this was entirely his fault
  he doesnt listen to his staff he only listens to his gut because according to him his gut is always right
  didnt go to arlington thats whats being argued over thats what the op article is about but youre like trump  deflect  deflect  deflect
  and he was mocked by the world over it then his attempt to damage control the following day was even worse when he compared himself standing in the rain to soldiers who fought in world wars
  deflect  he did go honor veterans on veterans day monday november 12 2018 which i just pointed out to you   its you who is moving goal posts by saying he had to do it on this specific day or else even though it would have posed a significant security risk to trump and his personnel
  and i am pointing out and repointing out yet again that he did not go to arlington which is true
  try again fuckwad        if you actually look at the weather data its nowhere near unnaceptable flying conditions and even if it was the ss would have a backup plan    trump didnt want to go its blindingly obvious
  and i am pointing out and repointing out yet again that he did not go to arlington  which wasnt even what you originally stated  he loves the military so much he honored them on veterans daoh wait  nowhere within that sentence did you use the words arlington cemetery
    ovc006  nowhere near unnaceptable flying conditions    a commercial jet need a precision instrument approach to be able to land in this weather ive never heard of a helicopter doing an offfield precision approach    soldiers who fought in world wars    these soldiers cancelled their missions if weather obscured the target
  a commercial jet need a precision instrument approach to be able to land in this weather ive never heard of a helicopter doing an offfield precision approach  uh no lol read the entire article
  the author of this article is perfectly open to the notion that an aviation official decided that trump shouldnt be flying in the rain
  and yet obama got out of his motorcade on his inauguration against the advice of the secret service and walked for several blocks    what the president wants the president gets the secret service cannot override him unless its a clear and present danger to his safety which a warm drizzle is not
  im sure that donald trump could have traveled by car if he had wanted to which he didnt but the author of the article does not claim that they were nowhere near unacceptable flying conditions
  no he just fucking shows it by actually printing the military weather data from that day    commercial airliners have landed in worse i know because ive been on them
they cant safely or prudently land when there are  very lowceiling circumstances    there was a 600foot ceiling that day the 200foot minimum applies to an ils or lpv/waas gps approach        commercial airliners have landed in worse    as long as there is a large runway and a certified precision approach then it is possible for a jet to land there im surprised he didnt just take his 747
  no he just fucking shows it by actually printing the military weather data from that day  he literally says the playitsafe factor when carrying a president has to be larger than for other missions so who knows whether some aviation official really said sorry this is nogo in a followup he writes that his intention was explicitly not to secondguess military pilots or dispatchers who might have advised against trumps helicoptering to the commemoration site in the clouds and rain of that day thats their call and they are paid among other things for their judgment    you substituting your experience of having ridden on an airplane once for that of a professional pilot have decided to explicitly read into his article what he explicitly says hes not attempting to say furthermore in a followup multiple military helicopter pilots also write that there may have been many other factors that would have led the ss/mc to recommend the grounding of marine one        commercial airliners have landed in worse i know because ive been on them  i guess that makes you some sort of fucking expert who knows more than actual pilots do
  im not substituting jack shit heres what we know    trump has ultimate authority unless theres a clear and present danger obama motorcade  multiple advisors and aides told him that missing this would be a terrible idea  some aviation authority might have this is entirely speculation on the part of the author of that article told him not to go  given what we know and not what is guessed at with little evidence he was advised to go and chose not to
  given what we know and not what is guessed at with little evidence he was advised to go   i like how you cite an atlantic article and then rapidly throw both the article and the author into the trash can after realizing they dont support your retarded conspiracy theory
this isnt about trump being a disgrace on the world stage but about how trump refused to honor the troops at home where weather wasnt a factore
    hundreds of honduran migrants tried to storm the us border on sunday at the san ysidro port of entry    there are now 5000 to 6000 illegal caravan migrants in tijuana mexico waiting to seek asylum into the united states    according to estimates 500 of those migrants are criminals
  we always need some new doctors and lawyers
  i honestly do not have a problem if they go through proper channels as defined by the law even if they are only here for the gibs  fence hoppers can get fcuked though
gateway pundit  the same gateway pundit that was caught trying to create false accusations against robert mueller
mestizos are like fucking roaches
    look at all those helpless women and children
starting to look like not just nursing w on women and 3 year olds also werent they supposed to be 1000 miles away
  according to estimates 500 of those migrants are criminals  is there a source for that claim or did they just pull it out of their ass like the sexual harassment claims against mueller
  mexico says it will immediately deport nearly 500 migrants accused of trying to breach the us san ysidro border crossing near tijuana mexico    maybe those are the 500 criminals theyre talking about
  about 20 days ago when trump sent troops yeah
  the word estimate means guess eslfag
  connotatively it tends more towards an educated guess and implies some form of expertise or background in the topic maybe try to get a better grasp on the subtleties of the language before attacking others next time champ
  supposed to be 1000 miles away  im pretty sure thats what acosta was saying maybe potus should swing by the next news conference ask about that
  fake stats from the heritage foundation dont count
wonder why they are no celebrities interested what just really happened san ysidro port and caravan that going trash their hometown los angeles
  4060 of all illegal migrants to the us arrive by airplane    
  the very same they appear to have downplayed the response which involved tear gas grenades    local authorities have the situation well in hand i think
    silence cleetus
  im not even american you subhuman mongrel
  /pol/fags are more subhuman
remember when leftist said this caravan was fake   then its months away   now that its here they refuse to talk about it
  dont get so asshurt jose
  remember when leftist said this caravan was fake  i dont think ive ever seen anyone say this i dont think ive even seen a far left loony say it    then its months away   remember when they said that months ago its almost as if time advances and as time moves forward so do people
    when president trump won the white house in 2016 he did it by hijacking the republican party now after what happened in the midterm elections its clearer than ever that the presidents fortunes and his partys future are at odds    during the final weeks of the fall campaign trump put the republican party on his back ensuring that the elections would become even more of a referendum on his performance than the typical midterms in a presidents first term as a result republicans paid a hefty price with potentially longerterm implications    yes republicans added to their narrow majority in the senate but that came by reinforcing what already is the partys greatest strength trump with his rallies maximized support in solid red states especially among voters in rural areas and smalltown communities    but the trumpcentric strategy backfired spectacularly in the race for control of the house as suburban voters revolted against the president delivering a rebuke to his partys candidates in district after district democrats have gained 39 seats in the house with the possibility of hitting 40 depending on the outcome of the still uncalled election in californias 21st district    if the enthusiasm for trump in rural and smalltown america constituted the story after 2016 the revolt against him in the suburbs led by female voters has become the story of the 2018 elections the more you analyze the house results the more the gops suburban problem stands out    one way of looking at the house results is by the population density of congressional districts citylab places congressional districts on a continuum of six categories ranging from pure rural to pure urban in between are four categories of suburban districts from less dense to more dense
take the 11 most rural districts that were on the competitive lists assembled by the cook political report ahead of the election going into the election republicans held nine of the 11 when the new congress assembles in january they will still hold eight of the 11    gop losses in the next category what are called suburbanrural districts were also modest seven of 19 districts in this group changed parties five shifting to the democrats and two to the republicans republicans had 17 of these districts going into the election and will end up with either 13 or 14 in the new congress    but the damage grows exponentially in the next two categories there were 30 districts categorized as suburbansparse heading into the election republicans held every one of them as a result of the election democrats will have 16 to the gops 14    in the 15 districts described as suburbandense something similar happened republicans held all 15 before the election in january they will have control of just three in the nine districts categorized as urbansuburban republicans will go from holding seven to holding just one    democrats made big gains in 12 districts held by republicans that were won by hillary clinton in 2016 and barack obama in 2012 flipping nine of them in another 13 districts won by clinton in 2016 and by mitt romney in 2012 democrats flipped another 12    democrats also converted eight of 12 districts that trump won in 2016 but that obama had won in 2012 republicans did better in the districts won by trump in 2016 and romney in 2012 which constituted more than half of all the competitive districts but democrats still managed to convert nearly a third of them
california delivered the most significant blow to the republicans the party there has been in a long decline and trumps presidency has made things worse democrats will pick up at least six seats in california with a seventh possible the lone competitive seat that remained in gop hands was that of rep duncan d hunter who is under indictment on allegations of making personal use of campaign funds    house majority leader kevin mccarthy rcalif has closely allied himself with the president and he was among those who pushed to include an initiative on the fall ballot to repeal a state gasoline tax increase that the california legislature approved to fund repairs of roads and bridges    mccarthy hoped the repeal initiative would spur republican turnout and thereby protect some of his partys endangered seats instead by a 55 percent majority the initiative was defeated rural voters supported it urban voters opposed it that vote in microcosm was one more example of the urbanrural divide that is now one of the most defining features of current politics    republican strategist bruce mehlman produced a set of charts analyzing the 2018 election including one showing various fault lines within the electorate they include divisions based on race age gender education and geography race  whites vs nonwhites  remains the biggest divide of all but geography is by far the fastest growing and now the urbanrural divide is almost as wide as the divide between whites and nonwhites    that political division can still work to trumps advantage as he looks to his reelection campaign as an analysis of the gubernatorial results in wisconsin in 2018 and 2014 by craig gilbert of the milwaukee journal sentinel illustrates gilbert found republican gov scott walker who was narrowly defeated in his bid for a third term lost ground in the 35 most populous counties in the state but he gained ground in 16 of the 20 least populous counties
given the closeness of the results in the governors race that analysis suggests trump can still win states like wisconsin by running up his margins in rural areas it is the strategy he probably will pursue in 2020 as he seeks to hold onto the states that delivered the presidency for him    but trumps appeal  rhetoric about america first law and order closing the border and attacks on immigrants  brought a rebuke from voters in the suburbs this fall republican candidates throughout the country found themselves tethered to trump sometimes by choice sometimes when they tried to distance themselves trump became the drag that brought many of them down    the house will be up for grabs again in 2020 as about half of the roughly 80 most competitive races were won by five points or fewer split about evenly between the two parties for democrats maintaining their new majority will require replicating the energy enthusiasm and antitrump fervor that powered them to victory in november for republicans in those suburban districts in democratic hands it will mean trying to insulate themselves from that antitrump sentiment more successfully than they did this fall no small task        more evidence that the right wing doesnt want you to see that trump is crippling the republican party outside of his backwater racist base 2020 is not looking good for the right wing even with all the ways theyre already rigging the system
lmao washingtonpost
ever wondered how things would look had gone through the democrat route as a populist
  its bernie sanders which means everyone is uplifted except for the rich and racists so basically the opposite of what happened under trump
  wouldnt have happened the democrats and republicans are two sides of the same corporatism coin the only reason the republican populist broke through is because lack of organization and a unified body under the gop    none of the republicans star candidates were actually star candidates they were holding pattern candidates that the majority of gop voters hated   meanwhile the democrats had their star candidate and had aligned behind her in a cultlike fashion to the point where fucking bernie out of the election didnt even cause them to bat an eyebrow       i sometimes cant tell genuine liberal posts from ironic shitposts they are that stupid
  but its true trump is the antisanders since he just lied about what he was doing
  i sometimes cant tell genuine liberal posts from ironic shitposts they are that stupid  agreed /news/ is an /r/politics colony  i almost prefer the /pol/yps at least theyre arent suffering from such severe cases of dunningkruger
  imagine being too dumb to win an argument without the aid of a small army of dogpiling faggots and a premade infographics

a 52yearold florida man used a stolen identity to pay for 40000 worth of dental work and to buy a 10000 puppy the volusia county sheriffs office said    deputies said timothy powell told them he was recruited by thieves who encouraged him to have his teeth extracted and replaced with dental implants so he would look better for future fraudulent transactions    powell said the personal information of an 80yearold debary man with dementia was bought on the dark web investigators said    the victims caretaker said she learned of the fraudulent purchases when the victim received two bills from a south florida dental clinic in the mail    jake brenner the victims brother told channel 9 his niece notified him of the incident about a week ago    i never heard about anything like that he said its kind of different    read     finance companies that loaned powell the money said they are going after him for repayment    investigators said powell also used the victims identity to spend almost 10000 on a french bulldog puppy    they said he made large withdrawals from another victims account at various regions bank locations in volusia county    i dont know how they go about catching people like that but im glad they did brenner said    deputies said powells fingerprints were discovered on paperwork at the dentists office and they obtained photographs of him    investigators said they are searching for a possible second suspect who may have recruited powell    
  his new teeth look good gotta give him that
10000 on a french bulldog puppy  how could it possibly be this expensive
  because they need artificial insemination and cesarian section to breed truly the untermensch of hunds
  those are def some very nice teeth
worth it
definitely not the worst use of stolen money
  damn those are some good teeth  good job florida man
  not really a big deal we are somehow supposed to be surprised a desperate person took the opportunity of a lifetime to fix their teeth and buy a dog    theyll simply get a judgement against him for the amount and take it out of his paycheck and future social security payments
nationally democrats have 531 percent of all votes counted while republicans took 452 percent        not since the watergate scandal have democrats run up such a large margin of victory in midterm house races nbc news data showed    with votes continuing to be tallied more than two weeks after election day democrats hold a lead over republicans in the house popular vote by more than 86 million votes    thats the largest total victory in a midterm house election since democrats defeated republicans by more than 87 million votes in 1974 just months after president richard nixon resigned from office in disgrace    and the number is continuing to inch up    as of noon on wednesday democratic house candidates won 58990609 votes while their republican counterparts pulled in 50304975 that means that so far democrats won 531 percent of all votes counted while republicans earned 452 percent    democrats currently hold a 234 to 199 edge over republicans in the incoming house which will start in january according to nbc news nbc news has yet to call two races  georgias 7th congressional district and utahs 4th congressional district    so far democrats have a net gain of nearly 40 house seats

even with a pawn as ag  its mueller time  fascist right wing conspiracy nut and butt buddy of roger stone jerome corsi begs mueller for plead deal        a conservative writer and associate of trump confidant roger stone said friday that he is in plea talks with special counsel robert muellers team    jerome corsi told the associated press he has been negotiating a potential plea but declined to comment further he said on a youtube show earlier this month that he expected to be charged with lying to federal investigators though he said at the time that he was innocent of wrongdoing    muellers team questioned corsi as part of an investigation into stones connections with wikileaks american intelligence agencies have assessed that russia was the source of hacked material released by wikileaks during the 2016 election that damaged hillary clintons campaign muellers office is trying to determine whether stone and other associates of president donald trump had advance knowledge of wikileaks plans    the confirmation of plea talks  first reported by the washington post  comes as muellers team has just received fresh information from trump personally and as federal prosecutors in virginia recently inadvertently disclosed the existence of sealed charges against wikileaks founder julian assange    its unclear if the charges against assange are related to muellers investigation but wikileaks was singled out in an indictment last summer against a group of russian intelligence officers accused of carrying out the wideranging hack of clintons campaign and other democratic organizations    its also not known if any plea by corsi signals a new raft of charges by the special counsel or just that investigators are aggressively pursuing cases against people they believe made false statements to investigators mueller has brought such cases against four others including former national security adviser michael flynn
in a brief phone call with the ap corsi declined to elaborate on the details of any plea deal or say if a court hearing had been set    corsi the former washington bureau chief of the conspiracy theory outlet infowars has said he cooperated with the probe for about two months after he received a subpoena in august as part of that cooperation he turned over two computers and a cell phone and provided the fbi access to his email accounts and tweets    but he said earlier this month that talks with investigators recently had blown up    i fully anticipate that in the next few days i will be indicted by mueller he said    the spokesman for the special counsel peter carr declined comment on friday    shortly after his youtube show appearance corsi broke off a scheduled interview with nbc news and declined any other media interviews his comments friday were the first since then    stone has denied being a conduit for wikileaks which published thousands of emails stolen from clinton campaign chairman john podesta in the weeks before the election    stone who also has said he is prepared to be indicted said earlier this month that he had no advanced notice of the source or content or the exact timing of the release of the wikileaks disclosures    he told ap in a separate statement friday it is clear from his recent videos and his recent interviews that my friend dr corsi has been under a tremendous amount of pressure and it is beginning to affect him profoundly he has stated publicly that he is being asked over and over to say things he simply does not believe occurred
  thanks for the good news op i needed a reason to smile
this seems like a real link between trumps people and russia
its all  tumbling down
  its mueller time  this all seems to be less about justice and more about destroying this trump fellow you really hate him he must have done something terrible to you what was it
  not that anon but before he got all superfamous he actually bought a tenement i lived in in nyc then evicted everyone and bulldozed it so he could build another hotel in the midtown area so my distaste for him is indeed personal
  this is both about justice and bringing down and genuinely awful person  trump being prosecuted for his crimes is having your cake and eating it too
  read this    
so what youre saying is its over for krungald schlump
  did he commit treason like trump
  who
  the guy who conspired with the russians in their attack on america my sealion friend
you know trump is actively trying to undermine mueller and obstructing justice when a leak comes from his team
  besides how many blows has it been its a constant hes going down this time cycle in this redditinfested board and nothing happens anyways
  drip drip drip
  whens he going to jail
  depends on if trump destroys america
  can you elaborate you seem to have a lot of knowledge popodopolus was supposed to be the key to this conspiracy theory but all hes getting is 14 days in prison for fibbing to the special council trump already answered written statements and the midterms are over why isnt muller doing anything

    over the past decade attackers motivated by rightwing political ideologies have committed dozens of shootings bombings and other acts of violence far more than any other category of domestic extremist according to a washington post analysis of data on global terrorism the washposts wesley lowery kimberly kindy and andrew ba tran report    the big picture while the data show a decadeslong dropoff in violence by leftwing groups violence by white supremacists and other farright attackers has been on the rise since barack obamas presidency  and has surged since president trump took office    of 263 incidents of domestic terrorism between 2010 and the end of 2017 a third  92  were committed by rightwing attackers    why it matters unlike the turbulent 1970s when environmental antiwar and other leftwing groups were responsible for historically high rates of terrorism in the united states todays attackers are far more likely to have rightwing sympathies
  wow right wingers are finally fighting back against left wing violence somehow i dont believe this why would any hardworking man with a job and a family risk losing it all youll know when right wing violence really happens because its not going to be a pitiful and self defeating act like antifa or any of the lefts pet blacks
  take your meds or you wont get any chicken tendies today
  fuck off back to /pol/
  its almost like when its a left wing attacker its called workplace violence    san bernardino youtube shooting all done by lefties none count as terrorism even when they kidnap a disabled white guy and say fuck white people and fuck trump and this is for trump its not counted as a hate crime or terrorism
  the link you posted was about the dude getting firedyour not making a good case for your argumenti think your a gaslighter
  a third  333  that leaves 666   what accounts for the majority of terrorism
  prob cuz they are the scapegoat these days along with other factors like the stresses of 95 life and the liberals and msm who sometimes slander them
    sent the wrong link    
  other things you can still be a majority if you have a bunch of groups with smaller percentages than you that being said i doubt it is a third more likely than not the research compilers slipped a couple false flags and scaremongers into the mix also over a span of 7 years only 263 cases in a country as broad as this i am pretty sure there were more than that which have not been released to the public
  i dont believe this  right wingers are obsessed with order they wouldnt create too much chaos just to enforce it
  taken from a wapo article  that uses the clown organization the anti defamation league which describes things like people feeling as if they were discriminated against because of their jewishness as examples as antisemetic incidents  lumps in steven paddock as a rightwing terror attack despite there being absolutely no information on his motives  changes the definition of islamic terror attacks like the pulse nightclub shooting into a rightwing terror attack because people are stupid enough to not notice    this is a hilarious piece of propaganda
    shoots up congressional baseball practice
    75 of the entire catalog on /new/ is omg drumpf
  hol up  shoots protester at a milo event    hol up  shoots 17 dead in a mosque     now hol up  shoots an indian and a bystander    so you be sayin  kills a black with a sword and regrets it was only one    so what you be sayin is  shoots up a black pool party    hol up  jumps a gay guy walking his dog    what you be sayin is  stabs a black classmate    its  kills people protecting muslim women he was originally intending to kill    the  runs down native americans    left  shoots a sikh dead    thats violent  harasses and then kills a black with a machete    and shiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt    faggot
  (((washington post))) exists only for owner amazon to bully politicians who wish to make amazon pay its fair share of taxes
  shoots up congressional baseball practice      ill take things leftist democrats do for 500 alex
  make amazon pay its fair share  anyone who wants to hit amazon with taxes is specifically essentially trying to micromanage a command economy and is therefore either a socialist or a fascist
  (((washington post))) exists only for owner amazon to bully politicians who wish to make amazon pay its fair share of taxes    this
    anyone who wants to hit amazon with taxes is specifically essentially trying to micromanage a command economy and is therefore either a socialist or a fascist    oh look someone calling names to tey and shut down the argument
  literally not a single part of that post is anything other than a sober political analysis    have you never heard of the concept of a command economy in your entire life
  youll have an easy time posting an incident of leftwing inspired political violence for at least every one of those instances of rightwing political violence then npc
  although ill grant that came out slightly wrong even though you dont really care  should have said anyone who wants to hit amazon with taxes specifically is essentially instead of is specifically essentially
/pol/ in full damage control  
  i cant go back to pol
  its almost like when its a left wing attacker its called workplace violence  ttps//videofoxnewscom/v/4644067115001/spshowclips    san bernardino youtube shooting all done by lefties none count as terrorism even when they kidnap a disabled white guy and say fuck white people and fuck trump and this is for trump its not counted as a hate crime or terrorism
  its not a contest you fucking idiot are you really denying the results of this study do you even know how to fucking count
  they cant you show them 30 separate instances of right wing violence and theyll show you the same single instance of left wing violence 30 times these are the types of apes who would say bbbbbut christians commit acts of terrorism too when you show them the statistically overwhelming majority of muslim terrorist activity
  clearly theyre being conspired against /s
  every shooting in chicago is leftwing violence because all of the shooters are democrat
  yes i am because of definitional concerns in how they are defining whats terrorism and whats political violence and i provided evidence of misfiling   i am not saying but what about these two times left wingers attacked rather heres evidence of terrorism not being defined as terrorism
  lumps in steven paddock as a rightwing terror attack     pathetic    martin marty baron born october 24 1954 is an american journalist who has been editor of the washington post since december 31 2012 after having been editor of the boston globe from 2001 to 2012    baron was born to a jewish family1 his parents immigrated from israel
      itt obtuse children who pretend to not know how to classify extremist political violence because their side is the most overwhelmingly guilty of it
 needs to learn how to cull their ranks of the unstable weirdos lefties struggled with this in the 60s and 70s and managed to disown most of their radical element until fairly recently when college kids started larping as revolutionaries and punched republicans in the face to feel like theyre fighting for something    heed my words reactionaries conservatives and nationalists the surge in support and popular motivation for your ideals can take your policies far but also gives awful fuckers a cause to commit crimes for the responsibility for any criminal acts by those espousing your politics will be placed at your feet so dont indulge that guy just because he votes with you
  when the left wants to change what words mean to change their argument on a whim sure lets use title ix as an example  no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance  they said that they were really talking about gender when the statute said sex and then by defining it by sex and not by gender they were saying transgender people didnt have a right to exist according to trump
axios  splc  lol okay m8 let me know when andrew anglin flies a plane into the wailing wall
  losing current argument  goes off on an unrelated idpol tangent  fuck off back to /pol/
  he does far worse every time he recruits an edgy 15 year old /pol/kid into believing that brownskins are responsible for all their problems through cherry picked facts and purposely misleading infographics
  can you refute fbi crime statistics    in fact can you refute africa the fact that it exists for me senpai    greater or lesser shades of the truth are obvious to everyone with eyes
  my subjective classification of hate crime is better than your subjective classification of hate crime  try harder dnc shill
                fuck off back to /r/politics
  disavowing actual activists thanks to the msm at the time  how progressive were so much better off with their neutered equivalents today
  copy paste whataboutism    especially since while they were left leaning their politics werent a factor in who they targeted  meanwhing the right wing terrorists like the magabomber and the pittsburgh synagogue shooter were directly influenced by politics in their targets    apoorattemptwasmadejpeg
so whatcha doing rabbi 
    nah nothing subjective about it im not saying lefties dont commit hate crimes just that faggots on the right do at a much much much higher rate once again youre just seething that statistics are finding out just how full of reeing autistic incels your side is and youre too much of a good little npc to disavow them like a normal fucking person
  my definitions that exclude muslims and 9/11 isnt subjective  no youre a fucking shill dont even try acting impartial
  religious fundamentalists arent rightwing  im gonna piss myself laughing please keep doing my job for me though i wish i got paid to make you look retarded
  democrats import third world muslims into the country using  its rightwing terrorism   hahahahahahahhaa
  you faggots really do live in your own little fantasy worlds fuck /pol/ is amazing at being an npc brainwashing facility every single conservative principle is covered by muslim extremists race purity religious fundamentalism controlling women controlling education controlling recreation if it walks like a duck or quacks like a duck it really doesnt matter if its a white duck or a brown duck now fuck off back to /pol/ i grow bored of shitting down your gaping mouth
  this is the part where you try to convince us that the muslim running a child terror ring in new mexico with dead children buried under his house was actually a rightwing republican fundamentalist  if you feel a wetness between your legs that just because youre not housetrained like the rest of you lapdogs
  shitting down your gaping mouth duck duck race something something muslims are republicans  not him but holy shit youre retarded i thought you fuckers loved muslims and were screeching bloody murder when the trump travel bans went into effect now its fucking muslim rightwing cocksuckers   so should we ban them from our country or not
  this is gonna be a huge shocker to you but fundamentalism isnt exclusive to republicans you can be a muslim conservative or you can be a white conservative or you can be a republican conservative sometimes you can be combinations of the above because apart from a few idpol issues the overlap is painfully huge youd know that if you werent an underaged faggot slurping /pol/s diarrhea like its your mothers tit milk
  muslims are american conservatives now  holy shit just when i thought you couldnt be even more dishonest who the fucking feeds you these talking points msnbc
  i cant accept that im wrong so i deflect and move goalposts  we can talk about that in another thread when you accept that rightwing violence is massively statistically more ongoing than leftwing violence you repulsive faggot
  nah theyre muslim conservatives american conservatives are american conservatives there is a huge overlap because of the conservative part though dont worry i know you brainless subhumans cant read too good and cant comprehend much better so i dont mind repeating myself until you understand how the political spectrum works
  can i provide any examples of left wing political pundits changing the definition of words to suit their argument that you wont dismiss as absolutism or irrelevant
  accept my statistics that i heavily skew by cherrypicking muslims and dates  please clap  sorry rosenstein but being being statistically illiterate and dishonest doesnt help you here
  talking about political violence in a thread about the rate of political violent events is what aboutism  what exactly do you think is the fallacy of whataboutism  tell me what is wrong about my post
  we can talk about that in another thread when you accept that rightwing violence is massively statistically more ongoing than leftwing violence you repulsive faggot  why would i accept that when you clearly manipulated the statistics to include a group that has nothing to do with the rightwing in the usa into the group in order to smear them   you wouldnt accept me adding every anarchist attack to democrats kill count why would you accept this    so why would you group fundamentalism of two completely separate and competing ideologies as being equal to each other you know the two groups arent the same and one is actively trying to remove the other from society because they are proven more dangerous to surrounding populations   are you doing this to convince yourself or are you actually such a dullard that you think someone else will fall for it    also will you quit having conniptions about /pol/ i dont even go to that board you look nothing short of obsessed like the guy in a very popular paint comic who wont stop talking about waffles while asking everyone else why they wont stop talking about waffles
  why wouldnt you have already but first can we agree that hate crimes attributed to either side are correctly done so when theyre done for that sides primary reasons like a guy shooting black people up after joining a white supremacist group or a guy bombing oil plants after joining a radical environmentalist group does that make sense
  motivated by rightwing political ideologies  uhh  according to a washington post analysis of data on global terrorism  global  yeah alright
      lol nice try but wrong as usual
  nah thats you your turn to post lefty statistics and no being black isnt enough sorry your sides full of violent chimps and everyones catching on      this entire post is how i know youre a disenguous faggot and didnt read any of the anything yes i would accept anarchist attacks as leftwing violence as anarchists are on the far far left of the spectrum just as race supremecists are on the far far right of the spectrum    just because theyre competing doesnt mean theyre not literally the same exact fucking thing in two different flavors the only reason anyone would think they werent is if they were heavily invested in one or the other sorry is /pol/ less focuses on racial and christian absolutism since i last visited no then fuck right back off there you stupid virtue signalling faggot
  you know the political spectrum so well youre calling muslims rightwing extremists when youre importing them into the country that is some hilarious fucking shit lets also ignore the fact youre classifying neonazis as rightwing when nazis are socialists  socialists arent even rightwing you troglodyte
  yes i would accept anarchist attacks as leftwing violence  then you are a fucking idiot thanks for playing and showing the thread how retarded you are   as anarchists are on the far far left of the spectrum just as race supremecists are on the far far right of the spectrum  i mean look at this anarchists are specifically antigovernment and antiorganization your own logic makes zero sense because youve put zero thought into it    just because theyre competing doesnt mean theyre not literally the same exact fucking thing in two different flavors  yeah when you boil all the nuance and thought out of something it sure seems similar to stupid retards like you  please explain the leftwing ideology of anarchism and the rightwing ideology of race supremacy of which there have been significant examples of race supremacy in both sides of the political spectrum and that its far more closely related to authoritarianism than any side of the political spectrum    i bet youre one of the same dumb faggots who still believe that the political spectrum is a flat 1d axis
  liberals bring muslims into country  muslims kill people  liberals blame conservatives  lol you cant make this shit up
  neonazis are conservatives my man the old national socialist party fell on a wide spectrum of political ideologies despite the name thats why nazi germany was such a shitshow
  neonazis are conservatives my man  this is the part where you shout punch a nazi and get a felony assault charge for attacking someone wearing a trump hat right
  youre illiterate
  importing them specifically into the country or just letting the ones who pass our stringent laws in like every other fucking country you might just be a /pol/ppet if you think the former is happening also  neonazis are nazis  nazis are socialists because the party name has socialist in it  hitler didnt jumpstart the private sector during his reign  youre an absolute blithering faggot of the highest order and im done wasting ny time with you    im gonna be an insufferable pedantic retard thatll show him  yeah youre not gonna talk circles around me you silly shiteater the overwhelming majority of american anarchism especially american anarchist attacks during the 60s were commited by left anarchists you cant wrongly introduce the context of this country and then conveniently ignore it for a limpdick attempt at a gotcha moment similarly the overwhelming majority of american race extremists focus on rightwing values that includes malcolm x i know a favorite example of you stupid cunts as a leftist who staunchly believed in religious social and economic conservatism if it makes you feel better yes authoritarianism plays a huge role in determining terrorist activity we can say that authoritarian terrorism outweighs libertarian terrorism in terms of freqency but then we boil it down to left vs right authoritarianism and boy are you not gonna be happy with the results tldr get fucked and go back to school
  hes right wing its a given
  the federalist was debunked by their own sources      
  nazis are socialists because the party name has socialist in it  add another six gorillion to socialisms kill count
  argument is about right wing ideology fueling more terrorist attacks in america  /pol/ damage control team creates strawman about it implicated republicans when the study just talked about general ideology or blaming cnn because the owner of the federalist is the brother of someone who works at cnn  neither of those address the actual point in regards to there being a rise in right wing terrorism in the last few years  ill wait for an actual response but it looks like youre just going to resort to whataboutism next
    washington  six trump white house officials violated the hatch act by using their official government social media accounts to engage in political activity according to a ruling issued friday by an internal government watchdog agency    the staffers cited include trumps executive assistant madeleine westerhout principal white house deputy press secretary raj shah deputy communications director jessica ditto vice president mike pences press secretary alyssah farrah former white house director of media affairs helen aguirre ferré who left in august and jacob wood a deputy communications director at the office of management and budget    none of the officials will face disciplinary action for these violations the office of special counsel wrote in a letter friday this agency is different from the justice department special counsels office which is led by robert mueller instead each of the aides has been advised that if in the future they engage in prohibited political activity  we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law which could result in further action    signed into law in 1939 the hatch act bars employees of the executive branch from using their official positions to actively support or oppose any candidate for federal office this can mean making political speeches for a candidate sending letters or endorsements or publicly promoting one party over another the president and vice president however are exempt from the restrictions when the osc finds that employees have violated the hatch act the consequences are typically minimal and usually consist of a warning or sometimes a remedial briefing on the rules    fridays rulings were issued in response to formal complaints filed by the committee for responsibility and ethics in washington a nonprofit public interest watchdog group
westerhout was cited for two tweets she posted this spring both of which contained the acronym maga which is short for trumps campaign slogan make america great again    farah was also cited for a maga tweet in may that read this is what maga looks like under potus trump the unemployment rate is the lowest its been in 17 years    wood and aguirre ferré were also both cited for posting tweets that had maga in them    shahs violation consisted of a june 4 tweet in which he wrote fantastic rncresearch release winning 500 days of american greatness the osc found that shahs tweet highlighted research done by a political party and provided a link to the partys website and its research which constituted a hatch act violation    the final aide to be cited jessica ditto had committed a violation by retweeting shahs tweet with the rnc research link osc found    the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnbc on friday about the ruling    crews executive director noah bookbinder said in a statement that the group was glad to see the rulings but he cautioned that official warnings have so far not been enough to stop the steady stream of hatch act violations being committed by aides in the trump white house    in the five months since the most recent of these hatch act violations were committed bookbinder said crew has filed 11 additional complaints with the osc about apparent violations    this is hardly the first time that trump officials have been in hot water for using their official taxpayer funded platforms to advocate for partisan political candidates senior white house advisor kellyanne conway white house social media director dan scavino and outgoing ambassador to the united nations nikki haley have all received formal reprimands from osc for hatch act violations since trump took office
the violations prompted osc to issue additional guidelines earlier this year expressly prohibiting federal employees from posting messages that include maga or the phrase make america great again on their government social media accounts
speaking of the hatch act and how its only okay when republicans violate it  new rule says government workers cant even dislike trump      new guidance says federal employees cant use the word resist or mention impeachment

a groundbreaking study from oxford university has linked the pregnancy test drug primodos to malformations in babies born to mothers who used the drug 
  good disgustingly the harmed people were never compensated and this stuff was recommended and used even long after it was criticized    lawsuits against bayer who bought out the manufacturer were dismissed because of the statute of limitations
damn thats pretty fucked
just looks like the average amerimutt to me
  primodos was a uk centric drug based on what ive read
no matter how clear something is it helps to hear it from the horses mouth the president of the united states who once said on national television he was considering the russia thing when he fired fbi director james comey was happy to oblige in a typically freewheeling interview with the daily caller as first flagged by journalist brian beutler trump seized on a softball question to spill the beans on whitakers appointment    the daily caller sure could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position i know youre happy with matthew whitaker do you have any names chris christie   potus matthew whitaker is a very respected man hes  and hes very importantly hes respected within doj i heard he got a very good decision i havent seen it kellyanne did i hear that  white house adviser kellyanne conway 20 pages  potus a 20 page  the daily caller it just came out right before this sir  potus well i heard it was a very strong opinion uh which is good but whitaker is just somebody whos very respected  i knew him only as he pertained you know as he was with jeff sessions and um you know look as far as im concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought it should have never been had  its something that should have never been brought its an illegal investigation and you know its very interesting because when you talk about not senate confirmed well muellers not senate confirmed  the daily caller right    oh and by the way trumps claim he only knows whitaker through sessions is a blatant lie and not just because trumps chief of staff said whitaker was their eyes and ears heres trump on october 11 2018a month ago    i can tell you matt whitakers a great guy president trump said in a fox news interview i know matt whitaker    
he just cant stop    daily reminder use of your lawfully anointed power as a government official with intent to obstruct justice is illegal
  i feel it should also be mentioned before anything else that contrary to trumps claims mueller has in fact been confirmed by the senate twice unanimously
  minor caveat his first appointment was 980 unanimous because two seats were empty at the time    doesnt make it any less impressive he is the only director to be unanimously retained for the position    seriously this is one badass lawman he led the prosecution team that brought down enron pulled together the fbi in the aftermath of 9/11 and has many other career achievements besides    its because of him that i know there are still good republicans around
lolololol trump just cant seem to keep his mouth shut everytime he opens it he just keeps digging himself further and further in a hole    we dont even need an investigation since trump loves telling everyone his plans    sad
  is it
  fortunate that mueller has paid for his own work in seized assets it might be unnecessary but its free so why not
  yes that is almost the textbook definition of obstruction of justice         a person obstructs justice when they have a specific intent to obstruct or interfere with a judicial proceeding for a person to be convicted of obstructing justice they must not only have the specific intent to obstruct the proceeding but the person must know 1 that a proceeding was actually pending at the time and 2 there must be a nexus between the defendants endeavor to obstruct justice and the proceeding and the defendant must have knowledge of this nexus    obstruction of justice is a crime of intent this is a bit of a rarity in united states code
no wonder mueller doesnt care trump didnt answer questions on obstruction in his take home test trumps just confessed to obstruction of justice again
i know matt whitaker  either he was making it up then or hes lying now either way the bottom line is he always lies about every little thing and therefore you should not trust anything _anything_ he says
also only cabinet appointees need to be approved by congress mueller is not a cabinet member id say hes stupid but all this is is just more gaslighting on his part
  he had over a dozen meetings where whitaker was present since he was sessions chief of staff    trump is lying when he says he doesnt know whitaker
  using _ for emphasis  your reddit is showing anon youre not wrong though
  not him but i used to do that as a kid and i must point out that redditors drink beer you think kavanaugh goes there we shouldnt demonise every little thing they do      no matter how big a screw up he does it so often people are desensitised to it
  nah i lurk reddit its okay just warning ya so the trumptards dont getcha
    im an oldfag ive seen that done here since before reddit was even a thing
  im an ancientfag i have never see anyone use underscores for emphasis on 4chan
  its also a thing on im clients i dunno if aolim did it but skype does
  as someone who used aol until the bitter end i can confirm it wasnt used for that
i can tell you this im never using underscores on any websight ever again
oh look another shareblue orange man bad circle jerk thread
  oh look another /pol/ppet poster who gets triggered when faced with information that discredits his world view
  shareblue bad
  underscore bad
  orange man sad law man bad
esquire  fuck off this is completely unsourced as being hearsay from the daily caller something we arent allowed to link here because its a pseudoblog     well time for retards to ignore this and accuse anyone pointing out that theyre posting tabloids in /news/ as /pol/ppets because they hate that this board has rules and people expect them to follow them      reeeeeee /pol/ /pol/ lives in my head rent free stop pointing out the rules of this board
  stay mad /pol/ppet
  an actual interview trump did is not unsourced thats completely different than hearsay published by a disreputable news source     its more of an issue that trump would give an interview with the daily caller than it being posted here and hes done worse appearing on infowars
  esquire is your destination for the latest news headlines political developments celebrity interviews mens fashion advice and food  drink recipes   latest news headlines political development  were the fag that cried to get vanity fair banned
  nice job ignoring the point faggot the interview happened does it matter who he was talking to
its funny how were at the point where /pol/tards cant even begin to defend what trump did so they just call people shills or repeat the same weak memes over and over
well hell say that he wasnt senate confirmed for the witch hunt he was appointed by angry democrats who let him hire more angry democrats with tax dollars okay from people who dont agree with there even being an investigation look at that one poll okay beautiful poll i think it could be even higher but thats okay because there was no collusion not by trump everyone  even anominish  says its amazing how little collusion there was none the democrats however colluded with russia and chyna and rick rude and the server to hide the cyber from the fbi
  weve been at that point since day 1
  ignore npcs post news
so the problem that the gop has with trump now is that trump is essentially gangrene on the republican partys leg if they amputate now theyll be able to survive but they wont be able to run anytime soon if they dont amputate theyll be able to run for a little while but theyll die    theyre getting closer and closer to decision time on whether to cut trump loose if they do it theyll face an electoral collapse and disaster in 2020 but theyll be able to slowly crawl out as a party by claiming they did the right thing to upcoming conservatives in 2040 or so    if they dont its looking a lot like what happened when the whigs won the presidency with zachary taylor
  what went wrong with taylor he was in for 16 months and added new mexico and california then died from a bad cherry or something
  their newest tactic is crying about anonymous sources as if protected sources havent been a part of modern journalism since forever
  right out of the rush limbaugh shyster playbook
  trump and trumps base bought into their own hype things like his extreme stance on immigration may hype up his diehard base but its driven away independents and moderates it was the suburbs who handed trump the presidency in 2016 and now they appear to have a serious case of buyers remorse it certainly doesnt help that trumps tariff nonsense has been devastating to those perpetually downontheirluck american automakers     republicans have long believed in the idea of the silent majority but said silent majority delivered them a harsh rebuke
oh look another muh russia thread despite no evidence
  news man bad
  russia good dictator who kills political adversaries friend
  lol stormweenie confirmed
  stormweenies calling out the daily caller for fake news    hahahahaha holy shit  pass the popcorn im loving every second of this trainwreck
  trump brought it up during an interview unprompted perhaps you can contact trump directly and tell him to stop talking about the investigation so people will stop creating threads about it on 4chan
  when someone says muh you can safely ignore anything else they have to say its the brainlets way of trying to downplay their opponents argument without having to post any facts which there really are no facts one can post to downplay russia so no wonder he uses it
  this boards gotten a lot more sane since the election i like it
  trump just blurted out unprompted that he installed his pet attorney general over the russia probe    im sorry but he didnt strange you would blatantly lie in your op title anon
  nno
  but lets be honest we both know its really not that strange at all dont we
  lets be honest  you start
seriously though how does a man get to be this stupid hell never admit to it if hes asked directly but if hes not asked directly he rambles on about it like hes been administered truth serum
  strange you would blatantly lie in your op title anon  welcome to /news/ where the topics are made up and the sources are all frivolous gossip mags because the only other outlet that will publish them is a left wing propaganda site no longer considered valid per the sticky
  if you think its against the rules why dont you report it    oh right you already tried that and it didnt work because this is a credible source so now youre lashing out in the thread    funny i almost didnt hear your post over the sound of the republicans getting clobbered in the midterms
  the case for obstruction from publicly reported facts is fucking airtight i wouldnt be surprised if trump is indicted any day now
  varied criticisms of trump for all sorts of different things are always met with responses of orange man bad from the right    really makes you think about which group is full of npcs who parrot the same line in defense of their idol no matter what the criticism is
  the funny thing about this post is that no matter how hard it tries to be a satirical exaggeration it cant because trump will literally do just that the asshole mocks himself with his every move
  hes a sitting president so that would be a very interesting legal joust    hes almost certain to be indicted the millisecond he leaves office even a pardon wouldnt work because like an idiot he didnt divest himself from his businesses so all of the corruption there can be linked to him and its all state level charges because new york  in the mean time i expect something closer to a very drawn out public hanging he cant be impeached because he owns the senate so he gets to sit pretty in the white house listening to public opinion of him get worse and worse and worse
  that legal joust may be playing out at this very moment for all we know trump has had a mostly empty schedule for a while now he could have been testifying to grand juries for all that time that no one has any idea what hes up to
  the case for obstruction from publicly reported facts is fucking airtight i wouldnt be surprised if trump is indicted any day now  said the nervous man for 3000th time in trumps first term
  even before they came up with that amazingly ironic meme they had stuff like rent free and obsessed like wow how dare you think of the fucking president of the country who is in the news for some new idiotic thing he said every day being informed about things so passe    ive increasingly come to the realization that they literally cannot come up with a single argument in defense of him and thats why their only recourse is memes it takes some immense political ignorance to genuinely believe there is anything defensible about trump the most forgiving reading is that theyre only participating for the fun of it which is incredibly stupid in its own way considering there are literally peoples fucking lives at stake here
  cannot formulate a single counterargument so just reposts le funny onion headline for the millionth time
  why should he fuck off because it inconveniences the orange one
  he doesnt need defending as long as he is making liberals cry then hes doing a good job
    no because he made a sentence fragment nice projecting by the way lmao
    couldnt hear you over the sound of trump getting clobbered in the midterms
  adding 3 republican senators doesnt sound like getting clobbered
  i dont care what you think i care what he thinks and he thinks he wasnt on the ticket
    i didnt even say anything about trump get your head out of your ass you russain bot
  adding 3 republican senators  wow you really stopped paying attention after the first day huh i guess its to our benefit that trumptards are so politically ignorant
  here is what you dont understand after my time in the army serving under obama i decide that american was actually the bad guys the us fights for democracy sodomite rights and secularism obama was elected the daily antiwar antibush protests came to an end and wars were expanded into new countries no conservative christian should support democracy or this country the republic is a form of democracy    i consider myself a catholic first american by happenstance i dont regret being a soldier but i regret what i have served    i never voted until i saw trump running i saw trump as a destructive force that could end democracy or at the very least cause massive political turmoil    the schadenfreude alone has made trump worth it
  you dont know shit but you think you know everything dont quit your day job
  parasites like you arent worthy of being an americanyou should get deported or hangedalso as a fellow catholic i can tell you with certainty that what you did is a sin and that the wounds on the sowers of discord will never healkill yourself friend
  i disagree with democracy but wouldnt you say that those willing to do the violence necessary for the state to exist derserve more say in america then the leaches who beg for state violence and thievery on their behalf    catholics cannot support a prohomosexual nation bent on forcing secularism on the world bent on replacing the family with the state    if you have to choose between faith and country faith should always come first    im not perfect but i would like to know what sins you are referring to i converted and was baptized after i left the military but for the sake of arguing what was my sin
  sowing discordas a catholic faith that god can make use of the usa like god made use of the sinners in the story of johnah and the whalethe church told you to respect the human dignity of homosexualsthe secular cannot replace religionit would be like removing seasoning from cookingfamily still exists and you sound insane to think otherwisei believe your insane or have some unresolved issues in your psychebecause democracy isnt the problem and if the state wanted to replace the family theyd need to get rid of democracy firstas a soldier who states he hopes his country failsi hope you say that to your buddies or superioers in the armyi imagine theyd sort your ass out a lot better benedict
  voting to deliberately disrupt the functioning of government with no real reform goal in mind is anarchism     if you got swindled i can understand that but saying you wanted everything trump was and is and got it is just covering your ass    if you really think the country is better off now than it was two years ago reassess    then go talk to your first sergeant because you have a problem
      lol many soldiers feel the same the martial cast and i do me cast are the poorest americans i know i used to be one of them i dont want america to fail i want the us government to fail i would be completely fine with a military take over of the us i would love for dogs to turn on there masters    being gay is one thing but now the state openly supports gay marriage gay men and women raising kids i have a kid and i have seen the state sponsored pbs show commercials with two dads     america is dying regardless of what i say all democracy ends people vote more and more for the property of others yet are unwilling to do the violence necessary for taxes to exist the people are a faceless victim of policy child support laws welfare all the father replacement programs expanding war regardless of party or non existent public opinion degenerating school system that teaches kids to worship the holy constitution and the founding saints oh and they wont stop at forcing you to bake a cake at gunpoint    mean while no one gives a shit about the 50 cal going through a 5 year old girl the people fighting us are doing the right thing     its not we the people its a machine a machine that marches to one tune in the same direction trump might a misstep but the course will be corrected and the machine will keep moving forward until the debt and size of the state becomes unsustainable     trump going full ceasar would actually be less painful then what is to come
  im sorry youve lost faith i hope you find it again because the country only truly dies when everyone thinks like you do    the system only functions if everyone agrees to it if only some agree to it but not others it functions badly like a third world country i refuse to let us go any further down that path    you have to start believing in impossible things or else they will never be
  that doesnt make sense jesus was a bleeding liberal were you conservative or were you christian
  jesus totally supported abortion theft and gay marriage
  yeah actually have you read the new testament
  i refuse to let us go any further down that path      its not up to you you egotistical shit its not really up to anyone not even trump         shut the fuck up lib youre going to boil for eternity in flaming shit
  youre going to boil for eternity in flaming shit  imagine believing this
  it will be a mercy to burn you alive so at least you can get a taste of what hell is like first    its past time for christians to put the fear of god in the filthy heathens that have infested this nation
  honestly for most athiests hell would be an improvement to the oblivion that awaits us all at least that way youd still exist    there is literally nothing you can threaten including fire and brimstone thats worse than whats already waiting for everyone
shriek more democrats unless mueller is fired or starts making noises about how hes being obstructed its not obstruction
  it is up to me i vote do you vote    or do you think you have no real control over your life
  i like this post a man who welcomes hell because its better than oblivion    ill ask the obvious  why then do you not pray
  if you believe neither in heaven nor hell then it doesnt really matter whether you pray or not
  this is obviously the wrong board for this kind of discussion but consider this the odds of any of us being here are so extraordinarily low yet somehow we are here anyway what could possibly account for this god reincarnation occams razor would lead me to believe that answer is far simpler it is likely that it is simply not possible not to be conscious somewhere at some time and that as soon as you die you will be instantly reborn as someone else somewhere else you cant escape being alive even if you kill yourself
  orange man bad
  its refreshing to see one of you actually admit youre trying to destroy the country instead of save it youre scum but at least youre honest scum
  correct
  people who never served should have no say in this country begged deserve nothing but scorn
  the starship trooper movies were not meant to be taken seriously
  then you should by all means utterly despise your precious god emperor  what a hypocrite
  dive time deferred draft dodger theres a reason tammy duckworth called him cadet bone spurs
        no conservative christian should support democracy or this country the republic is a form of democracy  catholics cannot support a prohomosexual nation bent on forcing secularism on the world bent on replacing the family with the state  i would be completely fine with a military take over of the us    take this from an iraq war vet youre fucking retarded
  im an iraq war vet too 13b but we ended up being used as infantry dont regret being a soldier but i regret what i served    i pray to jesus that the faggot loving us of fucking a is kicked out of the middle east
  thank you for your service    id be thanking you too but youre using your service to shit on your country not a policy not an official but the entire country did you not swear to protect and uphold the constitution
  thank you for your service  i would actually encourage you to say something else tell a veteran never forget when you say never forget to a veteran you are implying that as an american you are in it with them  not separated by some imaginary barrier between civilians and veterans but connected together as grateful fellow americans who will never forget the sacrifices made by veterans past and present and never forget those we lost on 9/11 heroes like petes father so ill just say pete never forget
  good thought if im honest that was actually the first time ive ever used the phrase thank you for etc too even though i have multiple friends who are iraq and afghanistan vets  my usual mode of thanks is beer and cookies
  i do not hate the country i hate the united states government
  then perhaps you should fix it instead of hoping it burns down    yannow vote
  voting have you read my posts all democracy is is two wolves and a sheep deciding what is for dinner they will keep voting for the property of others government agencies will keep growing blm will own more and more land every year the dod budget will increase the government will cause problems and people will demand a program be made to solve that problem an endless cycle the whole system is not controlled by anyone responsibility is so scattered and undelineated that the system will always be about i got mine    point is fuck democracy and the constitution the country will sputter whine and ultimately cease to function just like all machines     ill keep voting for trump because he can ether end democracy and go full ceasar or the political turmoil alone will cause the government to lose legitimacy and we might stop the madness before it gets really bad
  ok skizzy
    you can go back to facebook you might be able to find someone who cares about your beliefs there
  as someone who used aol until the bitter end    dang what was that iike i remember being pissed when all my friends were switching to msn messenger and that eventually just led me to 3rd part multichats    fucking banner ads in my chat window suck it
  i dont like government messing with me  therefore i want the most intrusive unchecked government possible  the absolute state of the right
  democracy is the closest thing we have to a meritocracy where the best people are able to be elected to lead things would not improve by any stretch if we had a dictatorship theres just no logical reason in my mind to want to go backwards toward a dictatorship
    read democracy the god that failed    or liberty vs equality    we had more taxes and more rules then we ever had under king george within a very short period of time after the revolution    of course shit got worse as suffrage was expanded democracy is a fucking joke according to democracy we the people voted to invade iraq not only that it had 80 public support sounds like democracy right knowing that if you are fighting the us killing civilians is justified as you are fighting we the people    say what you want about democracy they are not as hypocritical
  you realize the country does not exist in a vacuum right the people who supported the iraq war back then do not support it now thats why trump hasnt started a war he knows it wouldnt work
  the support both on the part of the public and congress was all due to flawed intelligence and rumsfeld straight up lying  we know where they are theyre in the north south east and west
  the whole world exists in a vacuum
  the officials that lied about iraq still would have lied about iraq with a crazy dictator at the helm democracy allows for the worst officials and politicians to be replaced without the entire government collapsing
  hopefully it doesnt exist in a false vacuum
  not really related to this discussion but have you noticed how theyve started trying to demonize the word democracy because it sounds like democrat the new thing to say is were not a democracy were a republic because republic sounds like republican its pretty creepy
  based
  the argument isnt really new but after the 2016 election it became fashionable to bring it up again because of the electoral college the ironic thing is that the ec was arguably intended to prevent people like trump from being elected president the electors were supposed to be political experts who would know better than the people who should be elected it would have been perfectly legal for the electors to choose hillary instead and then democrats could use the argument were a republic not a democracy back but personally i find the ec to be a dumb solution in search of a problem having a nondemocratic institution decide democratic elections is really fucking stupid in my opinion
  orange man bad orange man bad orange man bad
  the thing is the electoral college doesnt even serve that purpose anymore its just a wonky semidemocratic system now
  youre getting desperate
  sadly any attempts to fix it will just be seen as sour grapes from the side who lost democrats would have to gain absolute control and i cant help but feel that they wouldnt be in a rush to fix it if that happened
  the ironic thing is that the ec was arguably intended to prevent people like trump from being elected president  you have it completely backwards look at the campaign hillary ran she appealed majorly to large population centers mainly on the coasts in the hopes their votes would be enough to over ride the suburban/rural voters who she wrote off     its designed specifically against the popular vote being stacked for one candidate due to population densities hillary knew this when she agreed to abide by the rules of the election     it would have been perfectly legal for the electors to choose hillary instead  this isnt the first presidential election where the popular vote didnt decide the winner the ec has never ever done that and there was no reason for them to do that especially since it would have all but certainly caused a civil war but hey if it meant maybe seeing hillary and god knows how many other politicians strung up from a light pole perhaps that would have been for the best    but personally i find the ec to be a dumb solution in search of a problem having a nondemocratic institution decide democratic elections is really fucking stupid in my opinion  well you are stupid and have stupid opinions so its no wonder you both conflate and obfuscate the purpose of institutions of the republic when they dont work in your favor but admonish them when they do
  so basically youre saying majority rule is bad but minority rule isnt  you dont see how one is obviously more conducive to society
  no he clearly doesnt all he knows is that the ec helps republicans more often than it hurts them so it must be good
  so basically youre saying majority rule is bad but minority rule isnt  no im saying that the ec was set up as a part of a system of checks and balances against tyranny of the majority this is also part of the reason why congress is split into two parts the house and senate    you dont see how one is obviously more conducive to society  how is tyranny of the majority more conducive to society      all i know is that the television says the ec hurt the democrats far more than it helped them in 2016 so it must be bad it was her turn  just admit your argumentative praxis on the ec is an intellectually bunk attempt at fabricating a faketruism designed to fit inbetween commercial breaks on tv
  im saying that the ec was set up as a part of a system of checks and balances against tyranny of the majority  which so far the check has simply been switching from majority rule to minority rule sure its a check against majority rule but having a few decide instead of the many is a step backwards  how is tyranny of the majority more conducive to society  compared to tyranny of the minority it is we can crack open quite literally any middle school textbook and see how kingdoms and oligarchies fail in various ways like restriction of power and disjoint with the lives/needs of the general populace outside of star trek i dont know off hand any instance minority rule didnt end dramatically
  ikr you can actually come here to see stormfags shot to pieces its quite comfy compared to the rest of the chans
honestly look at the options here trump is either deeply entwined with russia or literally the most incompetent president in the history of mankind to have no idea what his staff is doing behind his back takes some real fucking cognitive dissonance to deny it
  trust me all of 4chan knows /news/ if full of you faggots
  le personal army  yikes
republican bad so democrat good    no democrat bad so republican good
  imagine thinking this is witty

the 69yearold man who identifies as 49  the late show with stephen colbert        emile ratelband can not legally lower his age by 20 years the court in arnhem ruled on monday the 69yearold positivity guru asked the court to lower his age to 49 because he believes he feels younger than he really is and faces age discrimination nunl reports    the court ruled that the law and jurisprudence give no room for adjustments to age there is also no reason to make new jurisprudence according to the court mainly because all sorts of rights and duties such as voting rights and compulsory education are linked to age while this is not the case with name and gender changes age limits would lose their significance if ratelbands request is granted the court said     ratelband argued that his request is similar to transgender people changing their gender on their passport he said that he is missing out on work because he is almost 70 years old and his age gets in the way with his online dating he is also deeply insulted because he gets state pension according to the newspaper     the positivity guru will appeal against the ruling    ratelbands court case attracted worldwide attention the bbc and cnn published articles about the dutch man and he was also mentioned on american television program the late show with stephen colbert

    displaying a thin grasp of science president donald trump questioned the reality of global warming because it was cold outside then came a federal report laying out the severe consequences of climate change and rebutting the notion that a frigid snap means it isnt happening    sizing up the usmexico border trump declared he had closed it this past week and mandated that no ones coming in actually one crossing from mexico among dozens that stayed open was partially closed before rush hour and pedestrians still had access to the us during that time    before and throughout his thanksgiving vacation in florida trump took no holiday from twisting facts across a broad front  on saudi arabia the recent election and the 2001 terrorist attacks among the topics    a look at some of his rhetoric    climate    trump this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record  tweet thursday    trump brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records  whatever happened to global warming  tweet wednesday    the facts trump is conflating weather and climate weather is like mood which changes daily climate is like personality which is long term    the climate is warming which still allows for record cold spells    on friday the white house produced the national climate assessment by scientists from 13 trump administration agencies and outside scientists it amounted to a slap in the face for those who doubt the climate is changing    climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life the economy and the natural systems that support us the report says it details how global warming from the burning of coal oil and gas is hurting each region of us and different sectors of the economy the report also projects increased deaths and disease
the white house report swept aside the idea already discredited that a particular plunge in temperatures can cast uncertainty on whether earth is warming it says more than 90 percent of current warming is caused by humans there are no credible alternative human or natural explanations supported by the observational evidence    over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity the report says over climate timescales of multiple decades however global temperature continues to steadily increase    in other words there are cold days in a warming climate    the federal climate assessment is mandated by law every few years    ___    immigration    trump two days ago we closed the border we actually just closed it were saying nobody is coming in because it was out of control  remarks to reporters thursday    the facts by no means did he seal the border    on monday the us closed northbound traffic lanes for a few hours at the san ysidro california crossing to install new barriers its the busiest of more than 40 usmexico crossings that work was completed and the lanes reopened before the morning rush of commerce and commuters who work legally in the us officials also closed one pedestrian crossing facility at san ysidro and left the other open so its not true that everyone was blocked from coming in even at that one crossing us authorities acted out of concern that migrants gathered on the mexican side might bolt for the us    trump is threatening to seal the border if mexico doesnt properly control people trying to get into the us he claimed ive already shut it down for short periods when pressed about whether he meant only that one border crossing he said no no yeah ive already shut down parts of the border    ___

  the facts trump is conflating weather and climate weather is like mood which changes daily climate is like personality which is long term  i am wondering why they didnt criticize al gores new movie for doing the exact same thing    watch the first 30 seconds and youll see what i am talking about
trump asserts without evidence that the attention he brought to the senate race prevented democrats from taking that election from scott hinting at voter fraud by suggesting votes disappeared at the very end    despite trumps repeated claims after the nov 6 election of florida races being potentially stolen the state agencies charged with investigating potential fraud have said no credible allegations exist its not uncommon for vote tallies to change in the days after election day as local officials process remaining mailed and provisional ballots in florida scott saw some of his lead dwindle after the democratic strongholds of palm beach and broward counties continued to count votes    ___    syria    trump the country of iran as an example is responsible for a bloody proxy war against saudi arabia in yemen trying to destabilize iraqs fragile attempt at democracy supporting the terror group hezbollah in lebanon propping up dictator bashar assad in syria who has killed millions of his own citizens and much more  statement tuesday    the facts hes inflating the already staggering number of syrians killed in more than seven years of civil war syrian government forces led by president bashar assad and backed by russia and iran have retaken most of the territory rebels seized during a war that has killed nearly 500000 people according to estimates by united nations and human rights groups    ___
saudi arabia    trump after my heavily negotiated trip to saudi arabia last year the kingdom agreed to spend and invest 450 billion in the united states this is a record amount of money it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs tremendous economic development and much additional wealth for the united states of the 450 billion 110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from boeing lockheed martin raytheon and many other great us defense contractors if we foolishly cancel these contracts russia and china would be the enormous beneficiaries  and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business  statement tuesday    the facts hes greatly overstating the value of expected saudi investments in the us    the arms package partly negotiated under the obama administration mixes old deals some new business and prospective purchases that have not been worked out    the pentagon said last month that saudi arabia had signed letters of offer and acceptance for only 145 billion in military purchases and confirmed tuesday that nothing further has reached that stage    those letters issued after the us government approves a proposed arms sale specify its terms much of that 145 billion involves a missile defense system a contract that appears to have advanced more than other significant investments but not been completed    moreover the state department estimated last year that if the full 110 billion in prospective arms business is fulfilled it could end up potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the united states thats a far cry from the 500000 to 600000 jobs that trump has said the arms deal is worth
details of the package have been sketchy with no public breakdown of exactly what was being offered for sale and for how much the governments congressional research service has described the package as a combination of sales that were proposed by president barack obama and discussed with congress and new sales still being developed    meanwhile there has been no verification from either country that the kingdom agreed to spend and invest 450 billion in the united states as trump put it in his statement white house spokeswoman lindsay walters did not respond to a request to explain the figure    ___    trump oil prices getting lower great like a big tax cut for america and the world enjoy 54 was just 82 thank you to saudi arabia but lets go lower  tweet wednesday    the facts merely thanking saudi arabia for lower oil prices is a gross oversimplification oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been falling on the realization that us sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that slower economic growth internationally will depress energy demand    although the us is now the worlds biggest oil producer saudi arabia remains the biggest exporter and as a socalled swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is far more complex than trump suggests canada is actually the leading source of us oil imports for example with saudi arabia second    ___    trump saudi arabia would gladly withdraw from yemen if the iranians would agree to leave they would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance  statement tuesday    the facts this seemingly benign view of saudi intentions in yemen does not square with reality on the ground a saudiled blockade is at least partly responsible for widespread starvation in a country where three quarters of the population needs lifesaving assistance
its the worlds worst humanitarian crisis the us has scaled back support for the saudiled coalition fighting iranianbacked rebels and is pressing for a ceasefire    the international aid group save the children estimated wednesday that 85000 yemeni children younger than 5 have died of hunger and disease since civil war broke out in 2015 the united nations says more than 13 million yemeni children have suffered from severe acute malnutrition since the coalition went to war against houthi rebels    ___    terrorism    trump of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars  they never told us he was living there fools  tweet monday    the facts there was nothing original or clairvoyant in the reference to bin laden in trumps 2000 book as part of his criticism of what he considered bill clintons haphazard approach to us security as president his book stated one day were told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named osama bin laden is public enemy number one and us jetfighters lay waste to his camp in afghanistan he escapes back under some rock and a few news cycles later its on to a new enemy and new crisis    trumps book did not call for further us action against bin laden or alqaida to follow up on attacks clinton ordered in 1998 in afghanistan and sudan after alqaida bombed the us embassies in kenya and tanzania the us attacks were meant to disrupt bin ladens network and destroy some of alqaidas infrastructure such as a factory in sudan associated with the production of a nerve gas ingredient they missed in the sense that bin laden was not killed in them and alqaida was able to pull off 9/11 three years later
in passages on terrorism trumps book correctly predicted that the us was at risk of a terrorist attack that would make the 1993 world trade center bombing pale by comparison that was a widespread concern at the time as trump suggested in stating no sensible analyst rejects this possibility trump did not explicitly tie that threat to alqaida and thought an attack might come through the use of a miniaturized weapon of mass destruction like a nuclear device in a suitcase or anthrax    ___    associated press writers seth borenstein robert burns and josh boak in washington jill colvin in palm beach florida and david koenig in dallas contributed to this report
  1 whataboutism    2 gore didnt conflate weather and climate which is why he talks about climate change and points out how the weather is worsening as a whole and not just cherry picking certain events to say feed his position
  trump justice roberts can say what he wants but the 9th circuit is a complete  total disaster it is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any circuit in the country 79  is used to get an almost guaranteed result  tweet thursday    trump it would be great if the 9th circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why  are so are so many opposing view on border and safety cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned please study the numbers they are shocking  tweets wednesday  that means that in raw numbers more cases are heard and reversed from the 9th year in and year out but that does not make it the most frequently overturned  i am looking at the facts discussed in this post  hes saying that a lot of cases coming out of the 9th circuit are overturned they are and because there are more cases coming out of the 9th circuit more of them are being overturned this is true  its trying to construe what he is saying in the worst possible interpretation when in fact he is talking about the number of cases being overturned by this    on monday us district judge jon tigar whod been nominated by democratic president barack obama temporarily barred the trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally that set off trumps ire any appeal is likely to go to the 9th circuit    trumps tweets took issue with an unusual rebuke from the us chief justice john roberts roberts spoke up for the independence of the judiciary after trump branded tigar an obama judge and said we do not have obama judges or trump judges bush judges or clinton judges  but you do you have judges who were appointed by obama trump bush and clinton    look at other news stories being put out they are complaining about exactly trump judges
  but he is conflating weather and climate  he was saying that the sea level rise would flood the 9/11 memorial building  and then he points to evidence of that being a hurricane which is weather hes cherry picking data the 9/11 memorial has not been flooded its been above water for 999 of the time since al gore released the movie in 2006 being flooded on one day  as for what aboutism let me know when you actually post about these other things because i am not seeing any threads posting discussing the things you dismiss as what aboutism  when a thread is talking about foreign intereference between bill clinton and china its dismissed out of hand    its always your turn to talk about your pet causes but when i bring up something you dont like its whataboutism
  but you do you have judges who were appointed by obama trump bush and clinton  thats like saying trump is racist   colloquial does not mean it is fact
  he wasnt  also more whataboutism from you  especially the latter where it was investigated by a hostile republican congress and nothing came out of it
  calling a judge appointed by obama as an obama judge is a factually accurate nickname
  he was  the 9/11 memorial was not flooded by rising ocean levels  and whataboutism is not a magic wand you can use to dismiss arguments you cannot refute
  and how much evidence of collusion has come out of the mueller probe  more or less than the clinton probe  its not whataboutism history did not begin the day trump got into office he does not exist in a vacuum you need to compare his behaviour to other world leaders and previous us presidents to get an accurate gauge of performance
  again thats completely implying that the judges are 100 beholden to the president who appointed them when that is false
  and the media imply that trump is hitler every day joe biden implied that republicans wanted to reinstitute slavery     where would we be in america without unfounded implications
    the combination of sea level rising and storm surge would flood the 9/11 memorial site  nice to see youre intellectually and morally bankrupt        wah i cant use my favorite tactic   trump tower meeting was a smoking gun of conspiring well find out just how bad of a smoking gun it is from mueller  also mueller would be getting his work done faster but trump and the republicans are doing everything they can to obstruct justice
why does global warming only happen in california
  have you seen the people republicans are running for office biden is right
  yes i have
  i saw the original documentary he brought that up after various sections talking about rising sea levels it was completely implying that the 9/11 memorial would be 100 flooded as a result of the sea level rise when that is false
  i dont understand why the head of a country has to imply he has a dangerous misunderstanding of our government and yes he should be ridiculed for it
  and thats just damage control by climate change deniers unless you want to even more brazenly lie the 9/11 memorial was flooded the fact you have to go yeah well is besides the point
  by weather  your point was confusing climate and weather thats why we started talking about this in the first place
  hes not implying he misunderstands the government  hes explaining bias because the judge was appointed by obama which he was  and again theres complaints about trump appointed judges and their bias by the media every day    and yet theres no articles from the ap about how the rollinstone ap cnn vox and msnbc are misinforming the american public
  and again theres complaints about trump appointed judges and their bias by the media every day  as opposed to the entire republican part waging political war on obama trump included  either he doesnt understand irony or hes implying he hasnt picked up a book in 70 years
  did you miss the past two years  how many democrats voted for the republican tax cuts  about the same amount as republicans that voted for obamacare
  i was there thats just yet another thing trump has no memory of
  youre missing the point  you have one standard for republicans and another for the media and democrats  the media and democrats are allowed to criticize trump judges trump is not allowed to criticize obama judges
  no i have the same standard i just find it hilarious that when the shoe is on the other foot trump cant help himself but to cry and constantly double down i thought the republicans were shit for doing it first and now i think the democrats are shit except i can find hilarity in it because of the senile old man in office     muh judges  i thought this wasnt about implications
  weather is affected by climate which is what al gore is pointing out trump confuses weather and climate big difference
  so the 9/11 memorial wouldnt have been flooded if not for greenhouse gas got any proof
  moving goalposts  al gore already proved it
  well if al gore proves it
fucking al gore says some bullshit and suddenly the entire field of climate change study all the science of the past 20 years is disregarded  hes a politician ffs is as much given to hyperbole as any other  get over it already
as the days become dark and gloomy were all looking around for reasons to be cheerful but for men there is some good news  your penis loves the winter months    research from several academics and summarised by fartherly indicates that winter is good for your sex life and your genitals    while much of the research seems to be catering to straight couples it can easily apply to men in same sex relationships too  men love winter clothes    men will be more attracted to their partners or potential partners as winter gets into full swing    the old adage of less is more apparently holds true here with men saying they prefer how their partners look in the winter months scientists think this is because men use their imaginations more when a potential mate is wrapped up nice and warm    it might also be because of boots  lowhanging fruit    if you or your partner are bothered by your baggy ballsack in the summer months then youll be thrilled that your testicles hang a little higher in the winter its all about temperature regulation    sperm are incredibly sensitive to heat and will croak if things get too hot so in the summer scientists think that your testicles descend to aid cooling however in the winter they are drawn up toward the body for warmth    its hard to imagine anyone thinking their testicles look better in any particular temperature in reality they look like they were rejected turkey parts that were deemed too ridiculous for those flightless christmas dinner candidates    your penis will be smaller in the winter though so if youre trying to impress someone new you might have to give it a little twirl first  healthy sperm happy sperm    your sperm are also more healthy during winter months scientists studied thousands of samples to determine this which was nice of them    
thanks to the lower temperatures your sperm are generally more motivated too they thrive in temperatures a little bit lower than the average body temperature so your external genitals help here and your sperm get very excitable in the winter  its that time of the year    men are also much more hormonal in the winter months testosterone peaks in november and december and people have more sex around cultural holidays because everyone is feeling happy    also theres alcohol    clean and tidy    and theres good news for the partners of men too apparently the cold makes men want to spend more time in the shower making for cleaner private parts its alarming that this is a reason to be clean come on men get your act together you dirty beasts
  are we supposed to report this i mean its not a blog or an editorial but its also not news
  science news is still news
  its not science news its science factoids the mars landing was science news not this
  your right having 100 threads about exclusively trump is obviously much better
  rules are rules    theres no shortage of actual science news articles that could be posted to /news/ and as such theres no need to cling to one that isnt
  unproven retarded irrelevant and inconsequential  the only facts here are taken for a ride on a rocketship fueled by conjectures
  not already knowing that the twig and two cherries retreat from the cold faster than any armies stupid enough to invade russia in winter that there is an outpouring of alcohol during the absolute clusterfuck of holidays and that sweaters are patrician tentraising material to a good number of guys
  the old adage of less is more apparently holds true here with men saying they prefer how their partners look in the winter months  would like to see this broken down by men with fat partners vs men with attractive partners we have an obesity problem and fat chicks look better the less skin they show
  i rather have this thread than 50 of the actual blogs on the catalog right now  i say it stays

washington  president trump told the white house counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the justice department to prosecute two of his political adversaries his 2016 challenger hillary clinton and the former fbi director james b comey according to two people familiar with the conversation    the lawyer donald f mcgahn ii rebuffed the president saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution mr mcgahn said that while he could request an investigation that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power to underscore his point mr mcgahn had white house lawyers write a memo for mr trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals he could face a range of consequences including possible impeachment    the encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how mr trump views the typically independent justice department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies it took on additional significance in recent weeks when mr mcgahn left the white house and mr trump appointed a relatively inexperienced political loyalist matthew g whitaker as the acting attorney general    it is unclear whether mr trump read mr mcgahns memo or whether he pursued the prosecutions further but the president has continued to privately discuss the matter including the possible appointment of a second special counsel to investigate both mrs clinton and mr comey according to two people who have spoken to mr trump about the issue he has also repeatedly expressed disappointment in the fbi director christopher a wray for failing to more aggressively investigate mrs clinton calling him weak one of the people said    a white house spokesman declined to comment a spokeswoman for the fbi declined to comment on the presidents criticism of mr wray whom he appointed last year after firing mr comey    
mr mcgahn will not comment on his legal advice to the president said mr mcgahns lawyer william a burck like any client the president is entitled to confidentiality mr mcgahn would point out though that the president never to his knowledge ordered that anyone prosecute hillary clinton or james comey    it is not clear which accusations mr trump wanted prosecutors to pursue he has accused mr comey without evidence of illegally having classified information shared with the new york times in a memo that mr comey wrote about his interactions with the president the document contained no classified information    mr trumps lawyers also privately asked the justice department last year to investigate mr comey for mishandling sensitive government information and for his role in the clinton email investigation law enforcement officials declined their requests mr comey is a witness against the president in the investigation by the special counsel robert s mueller iii    mr trump has grown frustrated with mr wray for what the president sees as his failure to investigate mrs clintons role in the obama administrations decision to allow the russian nuclear agency to buy a uranium mining company conservatives have long pointed to donations to the clinton family foundation by people associated with the company uranium one as proof of corruption but no evidence has emerged that those donations influenced the american approval of the deal    mr trump repeatedly pressed justice department officials about the status of clintonrelated investigations including mr whitaker when he was the chief of staff to attorney general jeff sessions according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations cnn and vox earlier reported those discussions
in his conversation with mr mcgahn the president asked what stopped him from ordering the justice department to investigate mr comey and mrs clinton the two people familiar with the conversation said he did have the authority to ask the justice department to investigate mr mcgahn said but warned that making such a request could create a series of problems    mr mcgahn promised to write a memo outlining the presidents authorities in the days that followed lawyers in the white house counsels office wrote a severalpage document in which they strongly cautioned mr trump against asking the justice department to investigate anyone    the lawyers laid out a series of consequences for starters justice department lawyers could refuse to follow mr trumps orders even before an investigation began setting off another political firestorm    if charges were brought judges could dismiss them and congress they added could investigate the presidents role in a prosecution and begin impeachment proceedings    ultimately the lawyers warned mr trump could be voted out of office if voters believed he had abused his power  sign up for on politics with lisa lerer    a spotlight on the people reshaping our politics a conversation with voters across the country and a guiding hand through the endless news cycle telling you what you really need to know    mr trumps frustrations about mr comey and mrs clinton were a recurring refrain a former white house official said why arent they going after them the president would ask of justice department officials    for decades white house aides have routinely sought to shield presidents from decisions related to criminal cases or even from talking about them publicly presidential meddling could undermine the legitimacy of prosecutions by attaching political overtones to investigations in which career law enforcement officials followed the evidence and the law
ultimately the lawyers warned mr trump could be voted out of office if voters believed he had abused his power    a spotlight on the people reshaping our politics a conversation with voters across the country and a guiding hand through the endless news cycle telling you what you really need to know    mr trumps frustrations about mr comey and mrs clinton were a recurring refrain a former white house official said why arent they going after them the president would ask of justice department officials    for decades white house aides have routinely sought to shield presidents from decisions related to criminal cases or even from talking about them publicly presidential meddling could undermine the legitimacy of prosecutions by attaching political overtones to investigations in which career law enforcement officials followed the evidence and the law    perhaps more than any president since richard m nixon mr trump has been accused of trying to exploit his authority over law enforcement witnesses have told the special counsels investigators about how mr trump tried to end an investigation into an aide install loyalists to oversee the inquiry into his campaign and fire mr mueller    in addition mr trump has attacked the integrity of justice department officials claiming they are on a witch hunt to bring him down    more significant mr mueller is investigating whether the president tried to impede his investigation into whether any trump associates conspired with russias campaign to sow discord among the american electorate during the 2016 presidential race    mr trump stoked his enmity for mrs clinton during the campaign suggesting during a presidential debate that he would prosecute her if he was elected president if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation mr trump said
its just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country mrs clinton replied    because you would be in jail mr trump shot back    during the presidential race mr whitaker a former united states attorney also said he would have indicted mrs clinton contradicting mr comeys highly unusual public announcement that he would recommend the justice department not charge her over her handling of classified information while secretary of state    when the facts and evidence show a criminal violation has been committed the individuals involved should not dictate whether the case is prosecuted mr whitaker wrote in an oped in usa today in july 2016    two weeks after his surprise victory mr trump backed off i dont want to hurt the clintons i really dont mr trump said in an interview with the times she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious    nonetheless he revisited the idea both publicly and privately after taking office some of his more vocal supporters stirred his anger including the fox news commentator jeanine pirro who has railed repeatedly on her weekly show that the president is being ill served by the justice department    ms pirro told mr trump in the oval office last november that the justice department should appoint a special counsel to investigate the uranium one deal two people briefed on the discussion have said during that meeting the white house chief of staff john f kelly told ms pirro she was inflaming an already vexed president the people said
shortly after mr sessions wrote to lawmakers partly at the urging of the presidents allies in the house to inform them that federal prosecutors in utah were examining whether to appoint a special counsel to investigate mrs clinton a spokeswoman for the united states attorney for utah declined to comment on tuesday on the status of the investigation    mr trump once called his distance from law enforcement one of the saddest parts of being president    i look at whats happening with the justice department he said in a radio interview a year ago well why arent they going after hillary clinton and her emails and with her the dossier he added i am not supposed to be doing the kind of things that i would love to be doing and i am very frustrated
  imagine if obama tried to order the doj to prosecute his political enemies honestly what the fuck is democrats why are we just taking this i know i know the mueller investigation but in the meantime he gets to run the fucking country we could be marching daily at the very least
he wanted to prosecute clinton  considering this was literally one of his campaign promises is anyone really surprised
  marching doesnt do anything the conservatives just get more voters every time libs do further cementing the fact that the people currently in power wont do anything to jeopardize the sure thing votes theyre going to get for having an r next to their name just wait until january its been 2 years wait a couple more months not a lot he can do to squeeze his way out of it at this point
  i dont know why so many people expected him to somehow grow into the position of president acting like a manchild is what the people that voted for him want he was rewarded for his behavior hes not going to change it     admittedly while im not surprised i am disappointed
yall need to watch charlie brown instead and dont worry so much bout politics who half the time the politicians are like children
  honestly i saw him as a high risk high reward wild card while it didnt work out so well it really hasnt been as bad as people are making it out to be a competent person can easily clean this up within a year or so and everything will be fine hopefully people will learn that electing a radical unknown isnt a good idea but i doubt it
  yall need to watch charlie brown instead   i remember the episode relating to trump  its treason charlie brown
  i think i recall that it was about the constitution and the bill of rights
  marching doesnt do anything the conservatives just get more voters every time libs do  house democrats would like a word
    democrats are posed to pass the record for largest margin in a midterm  the record being the post watergate election
why did he want to prosecute comey what did he even think comey was guilty of
  popular vote
  trumps butthurt that comey refused to pledge personal loyalty to him and was looking into russias attack on america during the midterms which would have inevitably lead them to trump    remember trump said he fired comey to relieve the pressure from the russia investigation so its a clear case of obstruction of justice
  also trump just said he refused to answer any questions in regards to obstruction of justice meaning its clear he obstructed justice and didnt want to either implicate himself or perjure himself
  we get it republicans have rigged the system theyd have been destroyed in a tsunami if gerrymandering didnt exist
seahag hillary belongs in jail for a shoping list of crimes from fraud charity corruption theft  murder  right next to that closet terrorists obumer jail cell
lets face it the whole world would be better off if trump had ordered hillarys prosecution hillary would be in jail and trump wouldnt be president itd be like paradise
  i love how in your fantasy world despite deposing trump for abusing his authority everyone agreed to just leave hillary in prison
  republicans happily traveling down the path of fascism with trump    keep in mind the only reason comey turned down the invitation was because he wanted it to be open to the public now republicans are going to selectively leak what comey says to smear him
so hows /pol/ going to defend this this is clear abuse of power by trump since you can ask the doj to investigate people but you cant demand they prosecute people
  i dont understand how that neglects trumps actions but continue to be delusional
trump declares rosenstein belongs in jail because he never should have picked a special counsel       hello fascism
  hillary ran an illegal ip claimed it was a charity and used it to launder money from wall street and foreign govenrments to illegally finance her campaign    and comey as well as obama had the fbi help her destroy the most incriminating emails    they broke a lot of laws they deserve to be prosecuted
  he wanted to order the justice department to prosecute two of his political adversaries his 2016 challenger hillary clinton and the former fbi director james b comey  i agree  trump yes
  he may not have the authority to order it but i agree they should be prosecuted
  citations needed on all those accusations from creditable sources
   fascist trump wanted to order justice dept to prosecute political enemies comey and clinton  i just looked through the article and this part literally isnt in it can you please make a citation of where you got this from hint your ass isnt a citation
  im gonna need a citation to prove your unsubstantiated claim that trump isnt a fascist go ahead im waiting
  dropping the charged language the idea of trump desiring to order prosecution of his political enemies is correct its the basis of the entire story    i dont approve of charged language but you cant dismiss the facts because theyre being thrown at you in the same way a monkey flings poo
  president trump told the white house counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the justice department to prosecute two of his political adversaries his 2016 challenger hillary clinton and the former fbi director james b comey according to two people familiar with the conversation  the president has the authority to order investigations of people but not to prosecute people the former is extremely amoral and corrupt if done for partisan purposes the latter is something an authoritarian government does and a clear abuse of power
  if tump is a fascist why does he support jews and made a record low for unemployment amongst black people  check mate
  because nazism uses fascism as its form of government and not fascism as a whole you dunderhead    trumps not hitler hitler volunteered for the army
i wonder if leftist fucks will ever recant i mean i suspect just as many republicans should be prosecuted as democrats for selling influence treason fraud etc the difference is that conservative leaning people would be ok with it i cannot understand how leftists assume any accusation against a repug is gospel and any accusation against a dem is a conspiracy theory there is a mountain of evidence that hrc sold influence using the cf as a conduit but no leftist seems to care smashing cell phones using the private server to hide communications multiple witnesses claiming thugs visited them threatening them and their families yada yada yada and all the fucking murders none of this ever seems to register its like youre all fucking lemmings some of the shit said on this thread is just fucking bizarre with all the denial and pretzel logic
  there is a mountain of evidence that hrc sold influence using the cf  the republicans have had two full years to draft a report on this stuff where is it
  no matter what anyone cites you will of course claim it to be spurious so i will try something else if you are selling a service or product but then you can no longer provide it usually your revenue drops right 
  i wanted to do it but didnt and i wanted to and did are very different things retard
  no matter what anyone cites you will of course claim it to be spurious  i take congressional and government reports seriously even when i am not necessarily predisposed to agree with their conclusions hpsci benghazi report etc i also take allegations seriously when they come from conservative outlets as long as those outlets have a long history of truthful reporting wsj fox nr telegraph etc    if you are selling a service or product but then you can no longer provide it usually your revenue drops right  when you become unimportant people donate less to you this is not evidence of a quid pro quo of any sort
  /pol/ here i still cant believe your girl shillary lost to a literal meme candidate you guys are really terrible lol
  when you become unimportant people donate less to you this is not evidence of a quid pro quo of any sort  i wonder what it will ever take to convince you that something nefarious was going on if you took a cell phone image or video of me committing a crime and i took the phone away from you a smashed it with a fucking hammer then do you think just maybe that a normal thinking person might think that i probably committed the crime i am curious about what you would say if someone in the trump camp started bashing phones and refusing to comply with subpoenas for documents
  i wonder what it will ever take to convince you that something nefarious was going on  evidence would help    if you took a cell phone image or video of me committing a crime  assumes facts not in evidence    a smashed it with a fucking hammer  hillarys devices being smashed upon retirement are for all practical purposes no different having their hard drives wiped which every competent organization does to hardware devices when they are no longer being used
  hillarys devices being smashed upon retirement are for all practical purposes no different having their hard drives wiped which every competent organization does to hardware devices when they are no longer being used  fascinating really so the douchebag going on a public forum looking for advice involving how to wipe a server with bleachbit is of no consequence to you see this is what i am referring to the continual assumption of innocence of one side and guilt for the other sure just regular security practices nothing to hide the server was innocent no laws were broken the strange fires at the clinton residence all of that it just well normal stuff to you do you fuckers ever think about how strange you seem to rational human beings trump bad hillary and obama good repugs cheat democrats never cheat repugs sell out the country democrats never commit crimes
  evidence would help  burning shit smashing phones wiping servers killing people one might say that this is destroying evidence if a regular person did it
  fascinating really so the douchebag going on a public forum looking for advice involving how to wipe a server with bleachbit is of no consequence to you  this conflates the routine destruction of devices with the nonroutine email server wipe one of these is worth mentioning and one of these is not    all of that it just well normal stuff to you  all of these could constitute circumstantial evidence that could merit further investigation that further investigation has to be 1 conducted and 2 yield results the republicans are were in a situation supremely wellsituated to do that investigation but they did not    trump bad hillary and obama good repugs cheat democrats never cheat repugs sell out the country democrats never commit crimes  the only person whos said these things in this thread so far is you
  burning shit smashing phones wiping servers  the accusation of destruction of evidence requires that you already know that there is evidence of a crime being destroyed destruction of devices is not legally destruction of evidence unless you know for a fact that those devices contain evidence of crimes    killing people  yeah thats murder a significantly more serious charge than destruction of evidence and one that no law enforcement entity has pursued because theres no evidence for it
  ok then just one simple question with a yes or no answer do you believe clinton sold access to the state department to foreign interests
  yeah thats murder a significantly more serious charge than destruction of evidence and one that no law enforcement entity has pursued because theres no evidence for it  just one question for you  do you believe the murder of seth rich was a random robbery yes/no
  i wont believe it until i see evidence of it so no      given the complete absence of evidence to the contrary including recent revelations that the infowars people knew that the dnc was legitimately hacked i do
  i know so why wont you give the other side the same courtesy this is what hurts your side i am for prosecuting any and all republican fuckers that commit crimes and defraud the american people essentially what you are saying is even though the whole fucking sky is obscured by smoke there is really no fire because i do not actually see the flames seth rich was a random robbery hrc used the server for convenience not because she was selling influence donna brazile never gave hrc any debate questions and her publicly stating she feared for her life was just total paranoia donations to hrc from saudi arabia are of no consequence feinstein having a chinese spy is just incompetence bidens son getting the fat chinese contracts is just regular business obamas proven faked birth certificate is no big deal and using several ss numbers isnt either its all fascinating to me this continual laserlike focus on imaginary collusion while ignoring fisa abuse anything else that doesnt fortify your delusion or you are paid to put forth ridiculous bullshit like you do
  i know so why wont you give the other side the same courtesy   i am waiting for robert mueller to finish his investigation before i conclude whether donald j trump committed any crimes and whether theyre crimes i care about to that end he must be permitted to finish his investigation    youve made a laundry list of allegations that require _evidence_ to sustain them there is no evidence that feinstein knew that she had a chinese spy in her entourage there is no evidence that obamas birth certificate was faked there is no evidence that anything improper occurred during the carter page fisa process a universe of potentially circumstantial evidence is insufficient to sustain declarations of criminal behavior unless backed up by actual investigation    so _wheres the investigation_
  see i assume that both sides are compromised there is no investigation of these wrongdoings because powerful people do not want there to be an investigation your argument is that this is proof of innocence just as the ongoing mueller investigation is proof of guilt you say you are waiting for the final report from mueller but ignore the possibility that he is covering his own ass i know all that smoke blotting out the sky is not really evidence of an actual fire look trump won because most people can easily see that hrc is the most crooked politician in recent history
  see i assume that both sides are compromised  assumes facts not in evidence    your argument is that this is proof of innocence  people in the united states are generally assumed innocent until proven guilty proof of guilt requires evidence    but ignore the possibility that he is covering his own ass  if you want to argue that mueller is suborning perjury and is fabricating evidence youll need to demonstrate evidence of that there are powerful players within the government who have a strong incentive to produce evidence that mueller is doing this the fact that they have not done this strongly suggests that such evidence does not exist    look trump won because most people can easily see that hrc is the most crooked politician in recent history  while trump is indisputably the legally elected president of the united states and the popular vote means literally nothing from a legal basis you cant argue that most people think that hrc is the most crooked politician in history when more people voted for her than donald trump
  1 pretty clear both sides are compromised and this is why nothing ever gets done  2 innocent until proven guilty  did that happen for kavanuagh   3 see number 1 people with a knife at their through usually dont cast too many stones  4 popular vote  my god now you are against the electoral college and want la and nyc to select the president and ignore the county by county map that shows a huge portion of this nation voted red we picked the least of two evils and now you want a doover that is really what this is about the foxes run the hen house and this is ok with you mueller is deeply intertwined with the clintons and would go down with them but this is of no consequence
  1 pretty clear both sides are compromised and this is why nothing ever gets done  nothing ever gets done because nobody ever agrees on what the thing to do is    2 innocent until proven guilty  did that happen for kavanuagh  yes in fact it did kavanaugh was confirmed to the supreme court a bunch of angry democrats threw a bitchfit and achieved nothing and the other eight justices including the four liberal justices get along with him just fine its precisely because kavanaugh was innocent until proven guilty that we call him justice kavanaugh today and not midlevel prisoner kavanaugh    3 see number 1 people with a knife at their through usually dont cast too many stones  there are tons of people accusing mueller of all sorts of things from highlevel republican pundits to republican congressmen to trumps campaign managers to trumps son to donald trump himself what these people havent done is present well evidence    4 popular vote  my god now you are against the electoral college and  i literally didnt say any of this i literally explicitly stated that there is no such thing as a doover i brought up the popular vote only because you brought up the term most people which indicates a percentage of the population at large try to contain your autistic sperging and wild goose chases
  try to contain your autistic sperging and wild goose chases  i know again its like the entire firmament is covered by smoke i say hey there is a fire somewhere you say i see no fire so you are autistic because you say that there is do you really imagine this is lost on anyone
  i know again its like the entire firmament is covered by smoke  its like the entire firmament is covered by clouds and therefore it must be dr wilys weather machine at work    if you want to show that something is seriously out of the ordinary for example when people point out that an unusual number of russian dissidents have died youre going to have to do statistical analysis to show that something out of the ordinary is actually happening
  its like the entire firmament is covered by clouds and therefore it must be dr wilys weather machine at work  deflection circumstantial evidence is not tangible evidence is what you mean to say but at some point when it just keeps piling up and and piling up and piling up a rational person has to eventually assume that there may be something to the premise hrc sold influence and committed many other crimes and comey mccabe and mueller covered them up because they profited from them now maybe trump is a dirty prick and he does shady real estate deals but he has only been in public office for a short time his main accusers have been in government for decades and have the most to lose ironically trump was a democrat for many decades and all was groovy until he ran for office being a dirty businessman is shitty but betraying an oath of office is many times worse this is why that asshole is in there
  but at some point when it just keeps piling up and and piling up and piling up a rational person has to eventually assume that there may be something to the premise  a rational person would call for an investigation that would uncover whether there was anything to the premise    hrc sold influence and committed many other crimes and comey mccabe and mueller covered them up because they profited from them  you have literally zero evidence that comey mccabe or mueller benefited from any influence hrc sold and for that matter you have literally zero evidence that hrc sold any influence    and trump wray nunes whitaker manafort cohen page corker mcconnell and ryan dont profit from them therefore they have an incentive to produce the evidence that hrc sold influence and committed many other crimes but they dont     the american system is generally adversarial one politicians loss is another politicians win you cannot seriously believe that there isnt a single person with any power in the republican party who would not benefit from exposing mueller is a giant fraud
why is this board a leftist echo chamber
  because people like you show up look at it and then leave    its happening right now
  again you are stating because there is no investigation there is no crime you are saying trump and crew have incentive to pursue an investigation but because they do not it is because there is no crime conversely you ignore the incentive of mueller and comey to have motive to negate the 2016 election
  no investigation  probably no crime  investigation  might be crime might not be crime lets see the evidence    conversely you ignore the incentive of mueller and comey to have motive to negate the 2016 election  can you explain the incentives that mueller and comey have to negate the 2016 election
  conflicting opinions are hard  better just copy paste more msm articles and fake actual discussion
  can you explain the incentives that mueller and comey have to negate the 2016 election  i have already they are complicit in the crimes of clinton and this is why they cover them up and pursue the person who may attempt to uncover them
  they are complicit in the crimes of clinton  do you have any evidence for this statement
  first time on /news/ in over a year  literally fake news being shared   cant even hide the bias in ops post     what the fuck happened to this website
  literally fake news being shared   do you have any evidence for this statement
  do you have any evidence that the fisa warrant was not fraudulently obtained do you have any evidence that russians actually influenced the 2016 election do you have any evidence that seth rich was not the source of the wikileaks release and paid for it with his life its clear that cf and the dnc are totally corrupt and that hillary sold influence to the highest bidder it is clear that the server was an attempt to hide this activity it is clear that the mueller witch hunt is attempt to stop these crimes from being dragged out into the light
  do you have any evidence that the fisa warrant was not fraudulently obtained  the declassified portions of the fisa warrant contain information suggesting that carter page had been in possession of information concerning the leaked emails long before the leak actually happened this would serve as evidence that justifies a fisa warrant    do you have any evidence that russians actually influenced the 2016 election  it is agreed by both republicans and democrats in both the senate and house and almost every single one of trumps personally handpicked national security appointees that russians attempted to influence the 2016 election    do you have any evidence that seth rich was not the source of the wikileaks release  the justice department has declared that russian agents successfully phished dnc employees and installed keyloggers on dnc servers    there is no more proof that seth rich was the source of the emails than i was the source of the emails maybe it was me do you have any evidence that it wasnt me
  what the fuck happened to this website  i think it became a leftist propaganda operation and most of the people posting here are actually paid to do so its hard to believe that they actually believe the things they say or that anyone can be so fucking convoluted
  its hard to believe that they actually believe the things they say  do you also believe that every single one of the sixty million people who voted for a democrat in the midterm elections was paid to vote that way
  do you also believe that every single one of the sixty million people who voted for a democrat in the midterm elections was paid to vote that way  i believe propaganda is a very effective tool do you believe the msn is not paid to slant things a certain way
  theres plenty of propaganda it all comes from the right wing though  
  this is where softleft fags hang out because theyre afraid of posting on /pol/
  conversely /pol/ is afraid of posting on /news/ because they cant post their memes 
  i really dont think im missing out on anything by not posting in /pol/ except infinitely more rightwingers conspiracy theorists and infographics
  this /pol/ really is crippled on /news/ because they cant post their facebook tier memes or cherrypicked data inforgraphs
  do you have any thoughts concerning the article itself
  i guess not then
good prosecuting criminals and those committing treason is a great thing
  well hes not doing it so i guess hes bad too
due to the low population of the board its pretty easy for 12 people to really overwhelm to front page and control the narrative 2 years ago you would have thought that this was a vegan stronghold by how 3/4 of the first page was the snake oil peddled by nutritionfactsorg and livekindly the flavor of the month autist is just harder to spot because being a /news/ board this place already talked about politics daily if people all together stopped responding to the one guy trying to force /pol/ppet and accusing others of sock puppetting id wager we would be free of the retard in a week
  meant to respond to 
  if people all together stopped responding to the one guy trying to force /pol/ppet and accusing others of sock puppetting id wager we would be free of the retard in a week  he literally talks to himself and makes posts responding to himself hed just keep doing it    the only way wed be rid of him for good is with a ban
    except this isnt fake news trump did consider ordering the justice department to go forward with politically motivated prosecutions against his perceived enemies which is extremely authoritarian and against just about every code of conduct in the justice department
  trump considered doing something according to the anonymous insiders vox and cnn talked to  rest of the article is regurgitating the same exact shit we watched happen during the campaign  op may or may not have even read the article considering the ads were left in and reposted a couple times  well im convinced imbeach
  the difference is hes the president now and has the power to do it so its not just crazed rhetoric like when he was campaigning   its the same massive problem with nuclear weapons where he had to be repetitively told that he couldnt use them on a whim after asking why we couldnt use nukes    more importantly the fact he had to be talked out of it means he wants to do it and its only a matter of time before he does try it
  hillary actually did a lot of fucked up shit if she was elected we probably would have entered a war not needed in the first place and lost she has a lot of issues
  whataboutism
  yeah she probably has autism and most likely most of her following
  shes a criminal  shes a warmongerer  its hilarious how every attack on hillary is trumptards projecting
  hillary has objectively mongered more war than donald trump    as first lady she mongered war in yugoslavia as senator she mongered war in iraq and as secretary of state she mongered war in libya and syria    donald trump has actually mongered zero wars anywhere
  little rocket man  installs neocon john bolton who clammers for invading iran  pulls out of iran nuclear deal which is the only thing standing between the middle east and nuclear proliferation  pulls out of nuclear treaty with russia
  little rocket man  installs neocon john bolton who clammers for invading iran  pulls out of iran nuclear deal which is the only thing standing between the middle east and nuclear proliferation  pulls out of nuclear treaty with russia  wow youre right calling people names is just like bombing and invading sovereign states    you got me
  boi i sure do enjoy a good strawman every now and then
  youre the one arguing that someone who has done nothing but talk a lot is more of a warmongerer than someone who voted for wars and oversaw the bombing of foreign nations
  someone who has done nothing but talk a lot  exactly a strawman only one of my points was about his remarks
hillary being a warmonger doesnt mean trump isnt one too just the former is actually competent
  in addition to talking he     appointed an advisor who talked   scrapped a provisional nonratified    talked about scrapping a treaty and then didnt    full three of these are talk the only actual action there is the scrapping of the jcpoa every single one of these pales infinitely to actually dropping bombs on foreign nations
  yeah its really absolutely wild how successful the states that hillary warmongered have become    why just look at the peaceful democratic thriving states of iraq libya and syria today
  actually youre the one using a fallacy fallacy because he correctly pointed out all the things trump has done to destabilize world peace   you could also add the times the military disobeyed his orders to  do a preemptive attack on north korea   assassinate assad in syria     also trump actions have made us much weaker than what clinton was doing  pulling out of the iran deal shows america cant be trusted to keep its word  undermining the western alliance while coddling authoritarian regimes   having no clear plan in the middle east except for bowing to the demands of israel remember bibi hated obama and clinton for not kissing his ring   also letting the saudis murder an american resident and letting them off the hook because he doesnt want to jeopardize his business deals    the only reason trump hasnt started a war is because the military has outright ignored his orders when he gave them
  competent is warmongering but she also isnt president so i guess youre complaining about trump here
  you could also add the times the military disobeyed his orders to  good thing trump listened to the good advice of his advisers instead of destroying a few nations like hillary did    pulling out of the iran deal shows america cant be trusted to keep its word  treaties arent binding until ratified by the senate obama engineered this by completely sidelining one of the branches responsible for making american foreign policy and assuming that he would be able to freely continue it through the next democratic presidency whoops also not warmongering  undermining the western alliance while coddling authoritarian regimes  not ideal probably also not warmongering  having no clear plan in the middle east except for bowing to the demands of israel remember bibi hated obama and clinton for not kissing his ring   obama and hillarys grand plan for the middle east destabilized nationstates and led to the rise of isis which russia had to clean up for us no plan is probably an improvement  also letting the saudis murder an american resident and letting them off the hook because he doesnt want to jeopardize his business deals  how exactly does this destabilize world peace    incidentally youve moved the goalposts to destabilizing world peace when the original point of contention was about warmongering specifically      but she also isnt president   one doesnt need to be the president to monger war
  one doesnt need to be the president to monger war  sure but that wasnt the issue the post i responded to brought up
  its really not clear whether you mean that hillary was both competent and a warmongerer ie that her foreign policy was any good or whether she was simply competent at warmongering ie that she was very good at starting wars whether they were good or bad
  mum hillary   its trump doing the damage the damage to americas international reputation having our allies not want to defend us if shit does hit the fan and as mentioned before he wanted to commit two acts of war already that were far worse than anything clinton did but was only stopped because the military disobeyed him    trump is worse than clinton
  the latter  if anything i was implying hillary actually would make more wars since she actually knows what shes doing in that category
youll have to remind me when hillary wanted the military to shoot unarmed civilians at the southern boarder or launch chemical weapons across the boarder into another country like trump did     but i guess thats much better than your hypothetical alternatives not
  mum hillary   maybe if you dont want people to criticize your dumb statements about hillary you shouldnt make dumb statements about hillary    trump is worse than clinton  you can believe that if you want what you dont get to believe is that people only accuse hillary of being a warmongerer because trump mongers war thats completely retarded
  this just in hypothetical use of bullets just as bad as nonhypothetically dropping bombs of foreign nations    or launch chemical weapons   tear gas is not classified as a chemical weapon by the chemical weapons convention
  i wasnt the one who made the original statement about clinton from the looks of iti just pointed out how bringing her up was a whataboutism to distract from how incompetent trumps foreign policy is and the times he has attempted to destabilize world peace but was undermined by the us military and his own officials
  tear gas is considered a chemical weapon if used in warfare and trump was clearly wanted to declare the refugees enemy combatants with his shoot to kill order so yes it was a chemical weapon attack which also including the gassing of children and babies
  tear gas is considered a chemical weapon if used in warfare  there is nobody on any side of the political spectrum no human rights lawyer no journalist no international observer no nongovernmental organization literally not a single fucking person alive except a single chucklefuck on /news/ who thinks that the use of tear gas on the border was an act of war
  a cop firing a tear gas gun at rioters on the mexican side of the border is launching chemical weapons across the boarder into another country    get fucking faggot
  fucked
  get fucking faggot  i knew /pol/ loved watching gay porn cuckold indeed
  i almost had to concede that you were right and im a retard but i see here you used the wrong form of word in your rebuttle haha tough luck pal
  implying they were police and not brown shirt goons launching chemical weapons at innocents   better luck next time guy who watches gay porn
project veritaslinked operative allegedly tried to use sierra club credentials to access democratic campaigns    he sierra club one of the nations oldest and most prominent environmental groups was infiltrated earlier this year by a rightwing activist with alleged connections to project veritas a conservative undercover video production company that has faced multiple lawsuits and criminal charges    southern california conservative activist ernie white using the alias earl white began volunteering in the office of the los angeles chapter of the sierra club in april in an attempt to undermine the organizations work according to the environmental group    by volunteering with the sierra club through an alias white was hoping to use the environmental groups name in order to gain access to federal campaigns during the midterm election cycle maggie kash communications director for the sierra club told thinkprogress    white made false claims to at least one federal campaign about his volunteer role with the sierra club the group said previously he had been identified as part of a project veritas group that infiltrated democrat kyrsten sinemas senate campaign in arizona separate from his effort to get inside the sierra club    white allegedly approached the campaign of sen jon tester dmt about doing fundraising work using his volunteer association with the sierra club he was so persistent in his requests for time with testers campaign staff that the campaign contacted the sierra clubs national office to ask about him  a short time before the sierra club received a tip about his infiltration    white was removed from his volunteer role as soon as his affiliation with project veritas was discovered in early november     
the sierra club said it has begun implementing new security practices to ensure that similar operatives intent on harming the organization staff and volunteers are not successful    the sierra club doesnt believe white obtained anything embarrassing about the organization or gained access to sensitive information or databases but kash emphasized the group is concerned he may have secretly videotaped or recorded conversations with individuals who thought they were having a private conversation thats project veritass mo she said    we are looking at legal options given that california where this occurred is a state where its illegal to secretly record someone without their consent she said    conservative activists are increasingly using surreptitious means to infiltrate progressive organizations including environmental groups with proven track records of success many nonprofit organizations that rely on volunteers for large amounts of work can be susceptible to infiltration by opponents the sierra club for instance has more than 35 million members volunteers and supporters across 63 chapters    the league of conservation voters lcv was infiltrated in 2017 by individuals allegedly associated with james okeefe the political provocateur who founded project veritas in 2010    the lcv in a complaint filed with the california attorney generals office in august 2017 said it discovered that operatives allegedly associated with project veritas and its affiliate the project veritas action fund used fake identities in order to meet with lcv staff and supporters presumably in an effort to bait them into statements that could be doctored or taken out of context to undermine the groups work    the lcv said tuesday it has not received any updates from the attorney generals office on its letter of complaint
project veritas declined to comment on whether white was working with the organization in his volunteer work for the sierra club and his alleged infiltration of the sinema and tester campaigns    we do not comment on investigations either real or imagined project veritas spokesperson marco brunco said in an email to thinkprogress    white a media personality and activist in southern california who works on the fringes of republican politics appeared regularly as a protrump commentator on rt america the russian governmentfunded television network and the rightwing one america news network but those appearances stopped about a year ago his personal youtube channel has not been updated in more than a year    in his commentary white applauded donald trumps rejection of widely accepted scientific consensus on climate change in an 2016 appearance on the dr drew show prior to trumps election as president white falsely claimed the science is not settled on climate change    on the campaign trail if trump had said he believed in manmade climate change he would lose everybody because that is still up for discussion white said    im from chicago we have four seasons its called climate change white said on the show that is what climate change is this is a common refrain from climate science deniers who fail or refuse to acknowledge that weather and climate are two different things    in his role as a project veritas operative white and others allegedly infiltrated sinemas campaign in arizona using the same alias earl white according to watchdog group project veritas exposed sinema narrowly won the seat that opened with the retirement of sen jeff flake raz    along with volunteering for the sierra club white has served on the riverside county republican party central committee as recently as 2015 according to project veritas exposed
white is reportedly the founder and president of citizens against agenda 21 agenda 21 is a voluntary united nations sustainable development plan created in 1992 conspiracy theorists such as rightwing media personality glenn beck claim agenda 21 is an attempt to create a oneworld government    in 2010 white allegedly was part of a conservative group that protested a plan to build a mosque in temecula california    white did not respond to thinkprogress requests for comment    project veritas exposed received an anonymous tip on november 3 about white using an alias to infiltrate the angeles chapter of the sierra club the watchdog group was able to confirm whites ties to project veritas through its connections to the sinema campaign    project veritas exposed is run by lauren windsor and sponsored by american family voices a washingtonbased advocacy group    windsor also is a partner at democracy partners a consulting group that filed a lawsuit against project veritas in june 2017 democracy partners is seeking more than 1 million in damages alleging that project veritas and its founder okeefe sent an intern using a false name to infiltrate democracy partners offices about two months before the 2016 general election    while the sierra club is confident white was unable to access any sensitive organizational information the group decided to reveal the infiltration in the hopes of making other progressive organizations aware of the tactics used by rightwing activists    in the past project veritas has targeted planned parenthood a democratic senator and voting rights group acorn secretly taping conversations and using undercover operatives to bait people into admitting wrongdoing or bias    during roy moores unsuccessful 2017 senate campaign in alabama project veritas attempted to bait the washington post into reporting a false story about a woman claiming shed been impregnated by moore
the operation ultimately failed after the newspapers reporters became suspicious of the womans claim and inconsistencies in her story      since its launch project veritas largest funders have included donorstrust and donors capital fund dunns foundation for the advancement of right thinking bradley impact fund and the roland family foundation the trump foundation according to its 2015 tax filing also reported making not one but two 10000 donations to project veritas in taxyear 2015    project veritas is doing various nefarious actions like this to damage organizations that do good work kash said whenever one of our organizations experience this sort of infiltration its really important to throw as much sunlight on it as possible so that we can prevent that from happening at other groups because the work were doing right now is so important in this political environment
who funds these idiots its got to be one far right billionaire guy
  well two far right billionaires      along with a bunch of other far right groups and donald trump  
  ernie white under the alias earl white  kek
  ernie white using the alias earl white  theyre not very creative over there at veritas are they
  very creative
    hiding in plain sight
why the sierra club theyre primarily a public lands and outdoor recreation group
  conservative activists are increasingly using surreptitious means to infiltrate progressive organizations including environmental groups with proven track records of success many nonprofit organizations that rely on volunteers for large amounts of work can be susceptible to infiltration by opponents the sierra club for instance has more than 35 million members volunteers and supporters across 63 chapters    you really get an idea of how dirty and underhanded project veritas is when you look at their people funnily enough the girl who was caught trying to discredit the washington post and was humiliated in front of the country was put back into circulation already  
  because they rely on volunteers theyre much less likely to preform background checks on who works for them so republicans can insert spies into the organization with the intention of using them as a spring board to gather data on other grounds in this case they wanted information of democratic campaigns and tried to use their work for the sierra club as a pretext to get it    the only question is will veritas release any doctored videos from this like they normally do
  because they have been increasingly getting more political over the years you really get an idea of how dirty and underhanded sierra club is when you look at their people
north carolinas state board of elections again declined to certify republican mark harris apparent victory over democrat dan mccready in the 9th congressional district on friday instead calling for a hearing to discuss the matter on or before dec 21    harris won the race by 905 votes but the validity of mailin absentee ballots from in and around bladen county have been called into question    on friday the associated press retracted its call of a winner in the race    the boards evidentiary hearing is due to claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities related to absentee mail ballots and to assure that the election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election said joshua malcolm vice chairman of the north carolina state board of elections and ethics enforcement    the vote was 72 to hold the hearing two of the boards four republicans voted yes    this week democratic party attorney john wallace presented the state elections board with notarized affidavits from voters that raised concerns about people improperly collecting mailin ballots and voters receiving mailin ballots they did not request the charlotte observer reported    bladen county had the highest percentage of absentee ballot requests in the state the observer reported    in bladen harris won 61 percent of the votes from mailin ballots even though registered republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the countys accepted absentee ballots an analysis by catawba college political scientist michael bitzer showed it was the only county in the district in which harris won mailin ballots    unreturned ballots    in bladen and neighboring robeson county a strikingly large share of the mailin absentee ballots requested by voters were not returned to elections officials state election data show    
a news  observer analysis of data on mailin ballots in the district found     across the 9th district which stretches from charlotte to fayetteville along north carolinas southern border 24 percent of the requested mailin ballots were unreturned in robeson county 64 percent of mailin ballots requested did not make it back to elections officials in bladen county the figure was 40 percent     the unreturned ballots are disproportionately associated with minority voters more than 40 percent of the ballots requested by african americans and more than 60 percent of those requested by american indians did not make it back to elections officials for white voters that figure was just 17 percent     in bladen county the breakdown for african americans and american indians generally reflected the districtwide figures but in robeson county 75 percent of the mailin ballots requested by african americans and 69 percent of the mailin ballots requested by american indians were listed as unreturned     in other counties hardhit by hurricane florence as bladen and robeson were the share of unreturned mailin ballots was not as high in columbus county 29 percent of the mailin ballots requested were unreturned in pender county the figure was 18 percent    the analysis excluded data on voters who requested more than one ballot    results still not final    the nine members of the elections board met for nearly three hours in closed session on friday they certified results for several elections across the state but not in the 9th    we applaud the boards bipartisan decision to delay certification and fully investigate the concerning allegations in the ninth congressional district north carolina voters deserve to know the truth and their voices deserve to be heard said wayne goodwin chairman of the north carolina democratic party in a statement
on tuesday the board refused to certify the results of the harrismccready race in a unanimous decision malcolm a robeson county democrat told the board that he was very familiar with unfortunate activities that have been happening down in my part of the state and i am not going to turn a blind eye to what took place to the best of my understanding    north carolina republicans have complained about the boards secrecy on the matter    i am extremely concerned about the severe lack of transparency by the governors board of elections the people have been given no information beyond cryptic sentences as to why a congressional race has not be certified this cannot  and will not  stand tweeted rep david lewis a harnett county republican    dallas woodhouse the executive director of the north carolina republican party said the board should certify the results with harris as winner    the certification of a race and continuing to investigate whether a person or persons did something untoward are not mutually exclusive we investigate stuff all the time and probably should do more but you have to have a standard woodhouse told the news  observer at this point we believe the law requires there be enough evidence that the race could be in doubt they have shown nothing    harris attended the houses new member orientation in washington dc last week harris was again in washington on friday as new members of the house participated in a lottery to determine the order for picking their offices  make no mistake i support any efforts to investigate allegations of irregularities and/or voter fraud as long as it is fair and focuses on all political parties but to date there is absolutely no public evidence that there are enough ballots in question to affect the outcome of this race harris said in a statement released friday
accordingly the board should act immediately to certify the race while continuing to conduct their investigation anything else is a disservice to the people of the ninth district    its still unclear what will happen next month at the elections board in october a threejudge panel ruled the board unconstitutional a stay in the ruling that allowed the board to operate asis had been set to expire monday but on friday a new stay was granted for two weeks a spokesman for senate leader phil berger said the legislature and gov roy cooper office continue to negotiate to find a solution for the elections board composition    harris called for the board to remain in place until his race is certified    harris defeated rep robert pittenger in the republican primary in may by 828 votes in that election harris won 437 absentee votes in bladen county and pittenger won 17 votes according to the state board      why allegations of voter fraud in north carolina are being treated seriously        with the final votes being counted in californias 21st congressional district and democrat tj cox poised to oust rep david valadao r we appear to be at long last ready to put the 2018 house midterm elections behind us    but not so fast    north carolinas board of elections has certified the results in 12 of the states 13 house districts save the 9th district there as we reported thursday the certification has been held in abeyance under the provisions of a state statute that allows the board to take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election
in other words the board is worried about voter fraud as it stands with all votes counted republican mark harris holds a 905vote lead a narrow 032percentagepoint margin the question at hand is whether all of those votes are legitimate    we often note that inperson voter fraud in the united states is so rare as to be nearly nonexistent when president trump asserts that thousands of people changed hats in the parking lot so they could fraudulently vote twice we dismiss it summarily so why is it that this time the allegations are treated seriously    1 the numbers look strange    first of all there are some weird aspects of the votes that are in    eight counties are entirely or partially in the 9th district seven of those voted for democrat dan mccready over harris and libertarian jeff scott who earned 18 percent of the vote the two outliers are bladen and union counties    in 2016 trump won six of the counties in every county mccready performed better than hillary clinton two years prior      bladen county was the only one where the number of votes for the republican in 2018 relative to the number of votes for trump was well above average across the eight counties while the number of votes for the democrat relative to hillary clinton was below average in union county the other county harris won votes for harris and mccready were both above the average across the eight counties  
theres another way in which bladen county is odd in every other county mailin absentee ballots favored mccready the democrat by at least 16 points in bladen harris won by 24 points he also won early voting that is inperson voting but that happened in union county too  where harris won the county but lost the mailin ballot by 20 points      as a percentage of all absentee votes early voting or mailin cast bladens mailin total was well above any other countys about 1 in 8 of those votes were mailed in      others have noted different oddities for example michael bitzer a professor of politics and history at catawba college in salisbury nc noticed that nearly as many mailin absentee ballots came from unaffiliated voters as from democrats across the district democrats were 10 percentage points more likely to cast ballots than unaffiliated voters    from our report    gerry cohen an election law expert who used to work for the state legislature said he found one precinct in bladen county in which the results seemed odd in that precinct called bladenboro 2 159 people voted by mail  18 democrats 32 republicans and 109 unaffiliated    2 there are reports of unusual activity    there can often be seeming statistical oddities that crop up in elections a number of people point to precincts in philadelphia where mitt romney received no presidential votes in 2012 as evidence of fraud trump himself referred obliquely to this during the 2016 campaign    but there wasnt any accompanying evidence of people having actually committed fraudulent acts
ryan godfrey who worked as an election integrity official for the city noted that the philadelphia inquirer went to find romney voters in those areas  without luck    in bladen theres evidence of weird activity    at least five affidavits submitted to the state board described various instances of fraud including multiple occasions when people came to voters doors to collect ballots and offered to fill them out for them our amy gardner and kirk ross reported    the charlotte observer detailed several specific examples    3 this is the sort of alleged fraud that experts actually worry about    perhaps the most important differentiator here though is that mailin voter fraud  unlike inperson fraud  is actually something that experts worry about    most voter fraud laws target voter impersonation at the polls  the idea that people show up to cast a ballot in person and must therefore confirm their identities in 2014 i wrote about the disconnect between laws targeting alleged fraud and the actual problem i exchanged emails with justin levitt a professor at loyola university law school who has done research on voter fraud for the brennan center for justice and who wrote an article documenting only 31 examples of inperson fraud in millions of votes cast    levitt made clear that absentee ballots can be a threat to the integrity of elections i wrote at the time he pointed to instances in a pennsylvania state senate race in 1994 and the miami mayors race in 1998 as examples fraud in absentee balloting is unfortunately quite real he said    thats whats alleged here    so we have numerical evidence of possible abnormalities anecdotal evidence of abnormalities and alleged abnormalities targeting a type of voting known to be subject to possible fraud    thats why this case  even if the irregularities didnt change the outcome of the election  is worth worrying about
  gaslight    obstruct    project
trump suddenly silent on voter fraud now that gop is accused of it  trump loves to spread conspiracy theories about nonexistent voter fraud  but hes shutting up about evidence of actual voter fraud in north carolina that may have helped a republican candidate    evidence is mounting that voter fraud may have benefitted a republican congressional candidate in north carolina    yet despite trumps obsession with voter fraud he is suddenly silent now that his own party  and a candidate he personally endorsed  might be in trouble for it    mark harris declared victory after vote tallies showed him leading democrat dan mccready by a narrow 905vote margin in north carolinas 9th congressional district    but the state board of elections has now twice declined to certify these results due to serious concerns about voting irregularities and the associated press has officially revoked its projection that harris had won making the race once again too close to call    the board of elections will be holding an evidentiary hearing to assure that the election is determined without taint said joshua malcolm vice chairman of the north carolina state board of elections and ethics enforcement    there is a lot to investigate  including shocking allegations that someone associated with the harris campaign coordinated an effort to either throw away or fraudulently fill in absentee ballots cast by democratic voters    this isnt the same kind of voter fraud that trump and republicans love to spread conpsiracy theories about they claim that inperson voter fraud is rampant  but in reality its so rare that its practically nonexistent    absentee ballot fraud on the other hand does happen and is a very real threat to election integrity    just two weeks before the election trump was in the state campaigning for harris and attacking his democratic opponent
trump has often fearmongered over voter fraud in a preelection message he wrote cheat at your own peril violators will be subject to maximum penalties both civil and criminal    trump also shamelessly lied by claiming that illegal voting is the only reason he got 3 million fewer votes than hillary clinton in 2016 he even set up a governmentfunded effort to try to prove this alleged fraud a crusade that collapsed in scandal and humiliation    yet now that theres a real example of voter fraud with strong evidence that it may have swayed an election trump has nothing to say    of particular concern in north carolina are the votes in bladen county where harris received 61 percent of the absentee votes even though only 19 percent of those who submitted absentee ballots were republicans 39 percent of the ballots came from unaffiliated voters    michael bitzer a political scientist at catawba college analyzed the results and told the charlotte observer that it would be pretty astonishing if every single one of those unaffiliated voters actually voted republican    if thats the case theres a very concerted effort to use that method to one candidates advantage he said but at that level theres something else beyond a concerted effort that could be at work    several voters provided notarized affidavits alleging suspicious behavior from people who claimed to be authorized to collect absentee ballots but who may have really been operatives for harris campaign    datesha montgomery said that a woman came to her house and told her she was collecting absentee ballots when montgomery told the woman she had voted for two candidates in noncongressional races the woman told her the others were not important collected montgomerys signed ballot and said she would finish it herself    emma shipman also had an encounter with a woman who presented herself as an absentee ballot collector without providing any proof of the claim
others reported that they received absentee ballots by mail that they never requested in bladen requests for absentee ballots were unusually high  75 percent of registered voters compared to just 3 percent in most north carolina counties    this is a lot of evidence that something irregular happened in north carolinas 9th congressional district    but because these irregularities benefited his fellow republican trump is ignoring them  and railing instead against the totally imaginary kinds of voter fraud    other prominent republicans like outgoing speaker of the house paul ryan have also recently chimed in to promote a trumpstyle conspiracy theory accusing democrats of stealing elections after the gop was crushed in the midterms in california and other parts of the country    ryan hasnt said anything about north carolina either
being political in nc is suffering the democrats are awful and the republicans are batshit insane
  i guess this is being pedantic but isnt this actually election fraud gop is still scummy as hell for this with all the crying over stolen elections they go on about
  but isnt this actually election fraud  yes all the evidence points to the republican not only ordering absentee ballots in voters names who didnt order them but taking peoples ballots that were already mailed to them and then filling them out to vote for the republican   the 9th congressional district the district harris won was the only one to have not only those anomalies but also the only one where the republican won absentee ballots and more importantly won it by a massive amount which is a giant red flag
      does that means we still dont have the final result of the midterm elections  i thought we had finally got all of it
whats the tldr version of this
  yet another instance of suspected voter fraud in america
  republican house candidate in north carolina is suspected of election fraud
  voter fraud happened and it was the republicans who committed it      north carolinas 9th would be one of two races not resolved the other is california 21sts where the democrat just took the lead in the count and if he wins it would be one of the biggest upsets of the midterms and would just put an exclamation point on how badly the democrats buttfucked the republicans in california     they have to get the final results in by the 7th
  does proven fraud means that elections have to be redone for that district 
fucking demoncraps crybabie snowflakes
no such thing as voter fraud sweetie grow up and stop pushing these conspiracy theories
there has never been such thing as an honest election ever voter fraud is a way of life small or large fo every country on the planet im sorry you cant see the conflict of interest inherent in expecting people who have all of their power and prospects riding on votes to report honestly on how many votes they get or the governments that those people buy out
  im sorry you cant see the conflict of interest inherent in expecting people who have all of their power and prospects riding on votes to report honestly on how many votes they get or the governments that those people buy out  oitch the edge    more seriously there are multiarty control and this is precisely why those frauds are detected
  if only we had a voter id law like any other developed first world country
  read the reports the type of voter fraud republicans committed wouldnt have been stopped by voter id more importantly the type of voter fraud that would be stopped by voter id in person voter fraud rarely if ever happens
  the type of voter fraud that would be stopped by voter id in person voter fraud rarely if ever happens  tell that to all of the developed 1st world countries with voter id laws sounds like you just want to hold back progress
  bandwagon fallacy
    sure  that means we also get unions universal healthcare mostly universal college and any far right speak will be punished  i agree lets be like other first world countries
  and the rich and corporations get heavily taxed too voter id is 100 subsidized while voting becomes compulsory so everyone votes
  that means we also get unions universal healthcare mostly universal college and any far right speak will be punished    and the rich and corporations get heavily taxed too voter id is 100 subsidized while voting becomes compulsory so everyone votes    so fascism awesome i knew supporting the resistance would pay off heil hillary
  i dont really think voter ids are fascism but ill trust your judgement on this given you seem unbiased and reasonable
  i dont really think voter ids are fascism  tell that to the us leftwing
  as i am a lefty this discussion is doing just that  would you like to try again
  would you like to try again  not really fascist
  taxation  fascism  i see were dealing with one of the few lolitarians left on /pol/
  you misspelled proven
  trumpfags on full damage control seething snowflake
  its election fraud and it was proven facts dont care about your hurt feelings little baby
  voter fraud happened and it was the republicans who committed it  yeah but what is the nature of that voter fraud 
republicans are desperate to cover up for the fact they stole the nc 9th through voter fraud in fact it looks like the candidate not only stole the general election but the primary as well of course republicans dont care because they are demanding the election be certified even with its clear election fraud happened      but look at how they forced the head of elections to resign for the audacity of having an opinion      leave it to the democrats to surrender when theyre having an election literally stolen from them again
  t doesnt know what fascism is
  i live in nc i have not heard of this   well then again i dont vote and im independent if i did vote
  this if democrats werent spineless pussies republicans wouldnt be nearly as corrupt as theyre allowed to be a fire only knows how to burn its up to firefighters to keep it in check an infection only knows how to fester its up to doctors to keep it in check this country deserves everything thats happening to it
  guess democrats should pass voter id laws
  he resigned to prevent them from trying to accuse him of bias i think its retarded but its not going to stop the investigation from happening    the real reason republicans stopped giving a fuck is because gerald ford taught them that politicians can get away with breaking the law theyve been emboldened ever since bending the rules whenever they can then newt gingrich decided to abuse the art of the wedge issue and demonizing your opponent over practicing bipartisanship
  this  this would be solved if there were id laws why wont they just let them happen
  because it wouldnt solve this type of fraud and because voter id is effectively a poll tax unless they are completely free this wasnt voter fraud it was election fraud
the guy who was hired has a history of being shady well before this election cycle    
    republicans guilty of voter fraud  hurr we shud paz thar votar supresson laws  no
  this would be solved if there were id laws  no it would not have    and in the us where it is your constitutional right to not have id trying to have voter id goes against that
quality journalism

  portland or  homelessness continues to be a fatal condition in multnomah county the annual domicile unknown report by the county found that 79 people died while homeless in 2017    they ranged in age from less than 1yearold to 81yearsold    the study was conducted with street roots    get all the latest information on whats happening in your community by signing up for patchs newsletters and breaking news alerts    every year we report on homeless deaths the tricounty health officer dr paul lewis said every year the deaths are too many the people are too young and the causes too preventable    in every case a lack of housing played a role    the report was first done in 2012 looking at the numbers from 2011 that year investigators found that at least 47 people died while homeless since then at least 391 more have died    lewis says that things are not looking any better for 2018    through oct 8 2018 at least 49 people have died while homeless    the leading causes of death for people who are homeless are drugs and alcohol which officials say are often symptoms of mental illness    the report concludes that 46 of the 79 deaths were attributed to drugs and alcohol of the drug deaths 21 people were found to have methamphetamine in their system    part of being on the street you just want to get away from the reality of the suffering when you have nowhere to live lt art nakamura of the portland polices drugs and vice division said    most of the people who died did so between october and march when the weather is cooler in january alone five people died of hypothermia    every single person weve lost is a member of our community who once had a family and a future multnomah county chairwoman deborah kafoury said we mourn them we try to learn lessons from their loss    but we honor them by doing everything we can to end this manmade crisis
  portland  it was a rainy winter evening when deborah kafoury got her wakeup call she was delivering dinner to a church homeless shelter and under the awning out of the rain children were doing their homework beneath a streetlight waiting for the shelter to open    as the chair of the board of county commissioners kafoury is chief executive officer of multnomah county which hangs like a drape along the columbia river covering portland and what she saw that night in 2015 made her angry    the moment inspired kafoury to push for a radical policy promising every homeless family shelter  the policy ended in october with a blown budget overflowing family shelters and nearly 100 families staying in motels with the county footing the bill    the story of this wellintentioned but failed effort offers lessons for the seattle area what kafoury and other county leaders learned is that if a city opens its shelters door wide it has to have an equally wide door into housing or else be more selective about who it can help    despite a push by businesses and philanthropy in king county to end family homelessness more than a thousand families who requested services reported living outdoors according to county figures as of august over 400 families were turned away from marys place king countys largest family shelter provider in the first half of this year thats more than the number of families they accepted      as portland and multnomah county deal with the fallout this year local leaders are looking to a more regional approach so the city isnt going it alone on homelessness
general reminder that the person who keeps spamming blumpf threads in /news/ from tabloids is a homeless hipster living on the streets of portland shitting on the sidewalks and sucking dick behind dumpsters for quarters this board is literally the only bright spot in his entire life
  hes clearly not homeless because hes living in your head rent free
homeless people hahahahahaha they are trash and interfere with the flow of traffic for people who actually get shit done kill them all and use them for fertilizer
i really thought this said solved and fewer spaces because theyre solving the problem jesus i need to go to bed
most of them are subhuman trash anyways almost every homeless parasite ive met has been a junkie or alcoholic
  his home is /news/ an internet board the only person who lives rentfree in anyones heads is blumpf because he spends all day talking about him  i think its just fucking annoying how hes locked down an otherwise perfectly usable news board because he has no basic responsibilities of his own
  spend literally all day every day shitting in a /news/ board about your trump derangement syndrome  someone calls you the homeless faggot you are  tee hee are you mad about me living in your head  rent free oh fuck its been ten minutes better post another drumpf thread  are you even trying to convince anyone other than yourself
i never understood why homeless people stay in places that are freezing in the winter they should migrate south like birds
  i was homeless so i can testify to some degree on your question some homeless people do migrate south chances are you might never run into them again as travel leaves you even more vulnerable than before roving gangs of hoods wild animals vigilantes and even other predatory homeless make the chances of arriving alive a bit of a crapshoot so some would rather not risk it and even have a support network they know how to work with since it can vary wildly from state to state
  also worth noting that the colder states have less homeless in general so the resources allocated per person is much higher than warmer states like california
working for a year in a job that puts me in contact with lots of homeless has left me mostly jaded from what i can tell if your county has more homeless than the shelters and budget can handle and you make more resources available all you will get once you finally reach that zen point where everybody is being taken care of is a tidal wave of more homeless
  kek
  oregon is plagued with a tide of homeless every year but the state is filled with liberals who enable their behavior many do migrate to northern california but those found in portland salem eugene etc stay there because the handouts are too good to ignore
    /pol status  triggered
yeah but they are fucking males so their privilege is more than enough think of all the oppressed white middle class womyn instead you shitlords they are far more important than anyone else
  40 of homeless are womyn anon dont appropriate their struggle
  i used to live under a tarp because ppl were usually jerks and my actual home was too far away though i was 18 at the time   then after i got death threats and more than usual ostracism/shat upon i decided to try to get in the military
  not to mention trespassing laws that can get you in the slammer or shot
mexico refused to pay for president donald trumps wall and now it appears american taxpayers may never have to either    a spending bill to keep the federal government running past sept 30 will not contain money for trumps biggest presidential campaign promise republican congressional leaders are instead postponing the fight over a wall along the southwestern border until after the november midterm elections  when democrats will have more influence and be weeks away from taking control of the house    this is the gop congress giving the president a big middle finger said stan collender a budget expert who spent years working for house and senate committees its the republican congress saying were going to make it more difficult for you to shut down the government because its not good for us even if its good for you    while most americans are not particularly interested in a border wall trumps base is and will likely see his readiness to sign yet another spending bill that lacks wall money as a broken promise    there is a strong segment of trump voters thats demoralized said william gheen the head of the hardline group americans for legal immigration because theres no wall illegal crossings are at a new peak possibly higher than obama levels and the republican house spent its time on an amnesty compromise bill rather than enforcement like we were promised by trump    
it was a fun 2 years while it lasted but the corruption is too powerful and entrenched  trump lost
  lets fight corruption by electing someone who is just as corrupt    not one of the brightest ideas republicans have ever had but what do you expect from the party who elected george w bush
   illegal crossings are at a new peak possibly higher than obama levels  the illegal immigrant population leveled off around 2009 and has been at a downward trend since then  so you should take what this guy says with a grain of salt
i still say we follow mexicos example but take it a step further  1st time 2 years behind bars  2nd time 10 years  step further 3rd time bullet  as well as mexicos policy that people helping illegal immigrants will also be considered criminals and visa violators can get a six year prison termand not the nicer prisons either those immigrants and others will work in the fields and assist the agriculture market to help pay off their debt to society housing them for their prison term
anyone who read the transcript of trumps call to the mexican president would understand that the wall was never going to get funding from mexico      note trump begging pena nieto to stop telling the press he wont let mexico pay for the wall because it personally inconveniences trump
  all he cares about is himself its funny to watch the difference how much of a cocky prick he is on twitter or his rallies versus when he actually has to talk to a world leader and gets all demure
  its less about facts and more about his bases perception but as much they swim in cognitive dissonance youd be hard pressed to find one of them that doesnt turn into a simpering victim when you ask where the wall is they either have to admit they were lied to by the people they worship or that a bunch of stupid worthless pansy libtard commie pussies managed to out44d chess the people they worship   some of them still hold out hope but it just gets easier and easier to just point at a calendar when you ask the question
  some of them insist its being built and then point out to a fence that was built ten years ago theyre morons
out of curiosity and for general polling purposes can you explain why the wall is unwanted please be honest  is it impractical too costly are you a no borders extremist or do you think wanting less illegal immigration gins up racism and does more harm than good some combination/variant of the above or what americans only please
  i grew up on the bring me your tired/poor/hungry cliche like it was actual public policy and my distant family were all europoors in the last immigration wave so i naturally think its better to help people by actually helping them rather than the circular logic of if we treat them like shit then theyll fend for themselves better   wanting less illegal immigration gins up racism and does more harm than good  is a strong second
  the cost is too high for an object that may not be all that effective    generally speaking the amount of money and technology invested in an object meant to restrict access to something is very rarely proportional to the amount of effort required to bypass it humans in particular are extremely good at finding out ways to bypass intimidating obstacles with simple solutions     a cheaper more practical method of border control would be to simply treat them as foreign invaders and shoot them but that is a bitter solution nobody is willing to accept
     of curiosity and for general polling purposes can you explain why the wall is unwanted   while i imagine for some people its about being an open border advocate for others i think its that the wall sounds expensive and impractical even at its cheapest itd still be costly due to remote construction locations and because thered be a requirement for a lot of eminient domain and unless you threw a ludicrious amount of resources to keep it manned/teched up in most places it could be bypassed by someone with a ladder its hard to justify for folks who arent actively freaked out about immigration
  its an enormous money sink for a problem that is not enough of an issue for the massive time and money investment it would cost illegal immigration from central and south america is at historic lows and is on a downward trend its also incredibly obvious that trump was using illegal immigration as a dogwhistle for the more xenophobic and racist parts of the republican base no matter how much they deny it and as a halfmexican that really annoys me    also theres not much evidence that the wall would even be particularly effective we already see massive tunnel systems used by gangs and some illegals and walls probably wont stop those and it would also likely be an engineering and logistical nightmare considering that most of the usmexico border is desert
  the fence that was built years ago costed billions of dollarsdespite arguments that it wouldnt cost much and ultimately wasnt all that effective  the wall would basically throwing good money after bad
lol mexicans only have money to pay their beans and trump wants mexicans to pay a wall  the worst meme president of the history
  i agree it will be herturn any day now    hey when are we banning huffington post articles on /news/ just like we ban breitbart articles theyre exactly the same thing
  still obsessed with hillary clinton i see i guess when trump has no other accomplishments to speak of you cling desperately to the only one you can find
  hes right breitbart articles are blogger trash huffington post is blogger trash
  go bitch to /qa/ if you dont like it ill post whatever the fuck i want and if its against the rules then the mods can sort it out but they wont do anything because youre full of shit
  since when are breitbart articles banned in /news/
  i have not heard of any change in policy but i also havent seen anyone retarded enough to link breitbart in a long time like not just here but in general its like they finally realized its like wearing a shirt that says disregard anything i have to say
    i remember about a month ago someone posted a breitbart story here and 3/4th of all the replies were people just saying  breibart
  if only if trump promise to repeal the immigration act of 1965 instead the gop was willing to do that since its the source of their demographic problems
  it wont be long until daily caller and other conservative sites get the same treatment
  lel lets just pay even more money to feed them in prison guys git rekt libtards
thank fuck taxes are already going to fuck me
  its a waste of money that future generations will look back on as a monument to our stupidity
  good have you actually read an article on the daily caller or do you just blindly trust them like an idiot
  you have no idea how fucking expensive building and maintaining this wall is the cost of keeping them in prison is nominal in comparison      thankfully future generations will only look back on the stupidity of the idea and the stupidity of the country for electing a president who was stupid enough to think this was a good idea because this wall is not fucking happening any time some retard insists it is the only evidence they can provide is those prototypes from over a year ago yeah its a lot easier to make a tiny piece of a wall than it is to install a wall across the entire 2000mile southern border of the usa    the wall is one of those ideas that some people like the sound of because it sounds like such a simple and obvious solution but it completely crumbles upon any real observation thats all trump ever offers  ideas that assume that the country is magic with infinite resources and infinite money its a gradeschoolers understanding of politics but because this incredibly stupid man had enough of daddys money to throw around he was able to brute force his way into the presidency
  because it wouldnt accomplish anywhere enough to warrant the cost only a moron would think this could be cost effective and now thanks to the tax cut we sure as fuck do not have enough spare money for it
dang guys i voted for a wall and all i got is a lousy tax cut
  all i got is a lousy tax cut  you are a corporation
  i   i am a monument to all your sins
  imagine being dumb enough to think the tax cut benefits you in any way
  trump is going to bypass harding as the most corrupt administration    this from the opposition that selected their 2016 nominee the steaming pile of excrement known as hillary clinton     you have got some nerve to be attempting to lecture on corruption
if anyone expected that mexico was going to write us a check for one wall they clearly wernt paying attention to trump when he said they would pay either directly or indirectly through trade concessions and tariffs    hes still got two or six years to get it done to be quite honest trump needs to realize he has the enormous power of the american public at his disposal if he put out the call he would get thousands of volunteers skilled and unskilled willing to work for food and lodging to build the wall     theres alot of willingness to get things done in this country if trump can realize this and figure out how to tap into it he can completely bypass congress the senate and the judicial branch and work directly with his voters     if anyone could pull off that kind of power play it would be trump
    sure if you forced it on them if you botched it and said well i fucked up everything is too hard gib money    if you handle it right handle it like a master persuader   i think you underestimate trumps base you think theyre selfish but provided that they are given the means to leave their jobs with the same kind of protection military personnel have when deploying you can leave and will get your job back when you return regardless of how long you were gone and are provided food and lodging    there will be an avalanche of free labor
  trump has no interest in doing any of this he has spent an enormous chunk of his presidency golfing sitting in his room watching tv and chugging diet coke    he liked the rallies because they stroke his ego but he does not have the motivation to lead
  paying peoples food and lodging  plus whatever subsidies needed to guarantee peoples day job  costs money which means taxes which is essentially saying gib money     your idea reminds me of the old ateam program back in the 50s or whenever the government tried hiring highschoolers over the summer to replace immigrant farm workers so they wouldnt be so dependent on uppity commie wetbacks it didnt work or like when china started asking people to make steel in their back yard   long story short its fanciful just like commies cant run an economy based toeachaccording you cant fund national building projects with patriotism
  what is this anticapitalist pussy talk people should just work for the betterment of their country and their communities whats next we should pay for their healthcare while theyre doing construction work too fucking faggot
    this post is extremely confusing to me are you suggesting that someone who worked nearly 24/7 for months straight visiting every state some multiple times to get elected is actually just a lazy slacker     this sounds more like an insult than fact    where are you getting your information        back in the fifties americans were not quite so   energetically political the issue of replacing farm workers isnt exactly exciting either    the wall though anon its the fucking wall its a political statement that serves a few purposes its a literal monument to conservatives overcoming the liberal agenda it serves as a clear and permanent message to mexico and the rest of the world that we are no longer fucking around and that we are willing to go farther than ever before to defend ourselves    once you succeed in doing it once its game on people will be willing to do it over and over again first the wall next the space force general infrastructure improvement who knows what we could accomplish        no u
glorious failure
  worked  wow he walked on stage and flipped a thumbs up every so often so much work
  isnt this the same shit those commie potheads were talking about when getting epa policies im pretty sure ive already heard that who knows what we could accomplish from liberal art college speeches  your hopes here only last as long as the current voting generation is young and outnumber the old previous generation given we dont live in an environmental rainbows and brownies paradise your ideas have shown to not last no matter the current successes
  back in the fifties americans were not quite so   energetically political the issue of replacing farm workers isnt exactly exciting either  partisanship  patriotism its not about doing things its about not doing the things the other party wants to do besides people were plenty political back then its just that the ire was pointed at dirty communists instead of dirty foreigners  ill give you the point about farm labor being a boring cause though despite you thinking berlin wall 20 is the most prestigious item on the conservative agenda   once you succeed in doing it once its game on people will be willing to do it over and over again first the wall next the space force general infrastructure improvement who knows what we could accomplish  its not the fucking moon landing speaking of weve proven ourselves time and time again thats why we call ourselves the greatest country on earth it doesnt give us major shit for free though you mention infrastructure for example a bipartisan issue that everybody agrees were overdue for thats way easier cheaper and more likeable than building fences in a desert and nothings moved since the campaign   do we need to start a colony on mars to prove we can fix bridges before they collapse or gas lines before they explode
    corruption implies doing it for some benefit trump cant be corrupt because he has lost lots of money and luxury to be president its an undeniable fact
  tariffs  how would tariffs pay for the wall that is literally physically impossible
    no        so can you or can you not see the benefit of creating a legal framework that allows mass volunteering of time and labor without sacrificing your entire life    and consider this as well even though you are working for free the money saved on labor could be used to hire the most skilled and successful members of any relevant field to manage the projects these people in turn could provide training and hands on experience that would otherwise be unavailable to people allowing them to transition from unskilled into skilled labor positions    if you were a young engineer just out of college would you go volunteer yourself for room and board to work for elon musk     if you were some young dumbass just out of highschool wouldnt you want to go work in the build that space force project and have the opportunity to learn how to do something useful be a lab tech run a high tech construction crew    this feeds directly into trumps agenda the aspect of turning unskilled low paying jobs into productive high wage positions    the wall is exactly the right issue for this not because it is super critical but because it would provide the maximum news coverage for the longest possible time and what would be advertised the wall sure but more importantly the mass volunteer program    played right it could really shake up the game        how would getting more money in taxes pay for something  aaaaaaaaaaaa how aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  anon if that kind attitude was possible communism would have worked it didnt
  no  that was a rhetorical question i was poking fun at you because its exactly the same shit humans have been saying about every cause for every political alignment for most of recorded history probably longer
    anon the difference between this and communism is scale    communism needs 80 percent of the population to have that kind of attitude    this plan requires 1 most major projects dont need tens of millions of workers do you have any idea what a thousand motivated laborers could do over the course of five years with any level of good planning
  elon musk is promising cheap space travel and futurecars that you can use as a bong and have fleshlights built in space force is space but with more guns there will always be people who want to do that    youre giving me a racism wall in the desert   oh but its in exchange for experience doing the type of work that is famous for its low skill barrier for entry and you think patriotic republicans  people who explicitly believe in the free markets solving any problem  are going to flock to that banner in droves to jumpstart a program that gives charity to the government and work unpaid for several years on a project than many people argue is unfeasible even when fully funded planned and staffed except you still have to provide funding for all the housing for these miracle workers their food facilities support staff overseers and of course the materials to actually build the wall just to list a few does that all get donated too  you are delusional
    yeah i do think all that what do you think republicans are all really these dark capitalist caricatures youve just painted them as    good lord do you think we are totally incapable of setting up a fob but for civilians    your argument basically boils down to    but that sounds hard    stop being such an intellectual pussy
  its not hard its stupid your solution to every problem is somebody will just do it for free x1000  governments have tried motivating people to work for the good of the state on the cheap before it doesnt work but itd be different because they want the wall then theyd be building it already what do you need daddys permission to do everything buy some land next to the border and start laying bricks are they just too dumb to think of it themselves then theyre too dumb to plan a border wall or maybe even build one  but no i actually give them more credit than that theyre smart enough to know they should be paid by not implementing this idea they are smarter than you
  do you have any idea what a thousand motivated laborers could do over the course of five years miserable in the desert
    well fuck the nazis pulled it off anon why cant we        its not like theyre slaves they volunteered
  i thought it was ad hominem to call conservatives nazis
    what magic wand do you have    sorry i had to we live in a world where a reality tv steak salesman defeated the most cunning cold hearted bitch in politics in a fucking presidential election shed been spending decades preparing for    i believe in anons stupid fucking plan if only because the world is that absurd
  well i mean of course they volunteered theres not much else to do when youre sitting in a gulag all day
    lol the conservatives arent nazis and neither are the liberals    their kids are
  youre supposed to learn from mistakes not repeat them    im surprised nobodys suggested having prisoners do it thats what trump should do arrest all immigrants and then make them build a wall in exchange for citizenship
  come move here to texas and youll see how retarded having a giant wall is
  most illegal immigrants enter the country legally and just overstay their visa meaning a border wall would do literally nothing to stop them its just a way for trump to waste a fuckload of money to wave his dick around while accomplishing absolutely nothing its only slightly better than him trying to erect a 200ft solid gold statue of himself outside the white house would be
  please explain to me how conservative  national socialist
  it is a uuge waste of money on an ineffective solution if he was really interested in securing the border they would just build watchtowers every few miles with day/night survelliance equipment including drones seismic sensors and a staff of two agents    border is now secure you make a massive amount of jobs that are never going away and it wont cost us over a trillion dollars combine that with total immigration reform where it does not take 615 years to have your case processed and then get told to reapply because such and such document is needed give everyone in the us a year long amnesty period to apply then make drugs legal so doctors can do research on them and rehab clinics can provide substances in small doses to wean people off like some european countries do      ta da now immigration is no longer a problem we get a big spike from immigrants paying taxes instead of hiding the cartels lose their income from selling drugs in the us and mexico is able to start picking up the pieces which causes less people fleeing into the us     but what would the two parties use as a divider if they actually fixed immigraton
its all about actions speak louder than words     do we see anyone actually getting handcuffed and thrown in jail    for some magical reason some liberal judge in hawaii can overrule a presidential executive order   congress doesnt want to do their jobs therefore fuckhead liberal judges think they have to deal with it
  for someone who objects to the legalization of weed you sure speak like youre high
  that magical reason is the judiciary judges doing their fucking job of reviewing executive orders and checking if they are lawful/constitutional and barring them if they are not    this is the us not russia you dont get to just write whatever you want because you are the president
      time for babys first civics lession time to learn how the gov actually works
    i really dont understand why dems dont run with that drain the swamp shit and flip it
  because the dem leaders want to do the same shit the reps are they cant run on anticorruption policies when it would stop them from making money when elected
  if trump is any indication theyd be fine for two years at the very least
  call me a retard but i want to hope americans wont swallow the same lies a second time back to back then again our political history points to yes
  transition from unskilled into skilled labor positions by stacking bricks  this is one of the most shilly retarded post that ive seen on this board and im very glad that what your proposing is so impossibly hard for the level of skill of the current administration that theyll never be able to implement it
  he doesnt even understand the difference between your and youre im fairly certain all this is far beyond his comprehension hell just keep insisting the president is a king and checks and balances shouldnt exist
    mark my words theres going to be a reckoning in the democratic party and its going to come from the socialists people are ready for a chance and amazingly there are enough sane democrats that they made a move last month that stripped superdelegates of their influence unlike in 2016 socialism now has a path to success and i am very excited to see it play out this time
  we should just execute them would they really travel all the way to america if they knew they had a good chance of being killed by firing squads
  i think you seriously underestimate how dangerous life in mexico is
  its easy to compare to a hypothetical situation because you never have to actually justify anything  bbut hillary
  thats a retarded idea and so are you   lets kill the downtrodden people fleeing violence instead of the people instigating that violence thus removing the reason for the downtrodden to flee  at least aim your violent urges in the right direction retard
  you mean the way he did before and caved in the last hours
  it depends on the area   the whole country isnt the border
  which is the entire reason why so many people hang around the border    durr
  the dmz has a million land mines but norks still cross that shit
  wall one section  they come through the section left unwalled  this nigga never read sun tzu
  this  democrats are acting like establishment conservative candidates prior to the teaparty wave scared and being eaten from the inside    if /pol/ had their panties in a bunch over leftists this year theyre gonna be shitting bricks by 2020
  if you really wanted to stop immigration youd kill the reason for them coming here plentiful cheap labor jobs most illegal immigrants border hop to work on farms and doing menial slave labor take ice and instead of building a wall enforce regulations on hiring practices and watch businesses and fine the everloving fuck out of them until they change their behavior
  im surprised nobodys suggested having prisoners do it thats what trump should do arrest all immigrants and then make them build a wall in exchange for citizenship    building the wall is easy we just need to start slavery up again  please help humanity and go get a lobotomy
  thats what trump should do arrest all immigrants and then make them build a wall in exchange for citizenship  you run into the same problem with immigrants currently you have to pay people to watch them jail them provide material to have them work and on top of that they have no incentive to do a good job and would be literally right next door to escape
  it aint happening mate the time needed alone to get it rolling would be long after trump is out of office and nixed by the next administration on either side as no one wants to have their name strapped to that dumb ass idea money sink some of the problems you run into would be    animal migration animals dont give a shit about boarders   native american migration lots of legals do live on the boarder and go back and forth daily  current land owners groups have already been planning to buy up land where the wall might be planted just to tie the gov up in court     trump had his chance to get the ball rolling but after november its going to be dead
  or we could put titans inside the walls
  the problem with that is many major businesses rely on that cheap labor billionaires dont want their profits cut into including trump which is why he wont pass a law requiring employers to check whether workers are legal
  wasnt trump caught using undocumented polish workers at one point
  yep and then got sued for not paying them
  s what trump should do arrest all immigrants and then make them build a wall in exchange for citizenship  why not just skip the arresting them and wall part and just make a system where public service of some kind is a path to citizenship we wouldnt have to pay to incarcerate them or build a wall and could actually have them do useful things
  wont work expensive makes us look like east germany    better to invest in the countries these people are coming from get them jobs security education so they dont want to leave    would also make them good trade partners so its winwinwin we reduce illegal immigration their lives suck less and we get good trade partners in the process    it worked with japan and europe in the 50s can work again today
  that has actually been our policy  and had been working
  so why the eff did we change it
  idk probably because of trump id wager
  because fukkin immgrints or some bullshit why help others when you can bend over for the rich hoarders who have an r next to their name  murrica
  they even turned it into a dirty word globalism as if caring for the world is somehow a bad thing
  longer more serious answer than the other guys    any spending on a foreign nation that isnt military is a handout  we deeply cut state department funding because some people view any foreign aid spending as handouts to other nations however a lot of that foreign aid is meant to protect american interests via soft power security equipment for third world airports so american planes dont get hijacked training for local police to they can better protect american citizens hell even the food handouts are targeted to reduce migration to the us and preventing foreign poor from stealing us assets somali pirates stealing us commercial shipping  soft power is slow and indirect  it takes time for foreign aid to have an effect and often its hard to correlate those results with the money you spent its much easier to see the effects of spending 10 million on navy patrols near africa than to see the effects of spending 1 million to feed somalis the latter could be more efficient at reducing piracy but its hard to prove until you stop spending the money speaking of  complacency of the status quo  if youve been spending money on aid for decades you might assume that the current situation is the natural order of things and you can safely stop spending unfortunately this means you can cut off critical spending that was keeping things balanced on a knifes edge without that aid the situation can deteriorate furthermore because of the indirect and slow nature of aid results you might not know you fucked up until years after at which point its someone elses problem    in short foreign aid gets a bad rap as handouts this isnt to say that all foreign aid is wise spending theres definitely some bleeding hearts wasting money but thats a minority that is misrepresenting the whole
  people demand instant gratification
  too expensive  would be an ecological disaster  would displace countless american homes and businesses  the length and varying terrains of the border makes construction impractical  most illegal immigrants are people who overstay their legally acquired visas  america is actually net losing illegal immigrants from mexico right now  the wall might end up trapping a bunch of illegal immigrants who would have otherwise left on their own    the wall was never meant to be a practical solution to the illegal immigration problem its just a simple symbol the republicans can use to rile up their base and further scapegoat americas problems on mexicans     people talk a lot about liberals wanting open borders but really its just a fringe minority of people who actually want that i wouldnt mind at all if we found a practical and costeffective way to make illegal entry into the us impossible but that issue is ten miles down on my list of priorities for the country
  im not sure the trump administration understands the concept of soft power    i still remember that articlei dont even remember the publication but it was someone serious because they had a wh reporter the reporter was interviewing trump staff asking them the chief foreign policy question    what is your foreign policy doctrine    in other words the guiding principle behind trumps foreign policy he kept getting different answers which was worrisome already and then someone high up said it was this    were america bitch thats the trump doctrine    thats a direct quote the reporter decided that was probably the most concise answer hed get and used that for his headline it sums up perfectly the total disregard for soft power of the trump administration  their approach to foreign policy is to pick a stance and tell everyone else to suck it    or at least thats what theyd like to think unsurprisingly this notion goes unmentioned lately because trumps administration leaks like a sieve and his staff are ever eager to use any means necessary to curb his most dangerous impulses i cannot believe i just typed that but look where we are as a result the trump administration cant even perform at their chosen role of swaggering captains of the world  they end up looking boorish and incompetent to literally everybody    i wonder how many people will say this was what they wanted when they voted for him
  i wonder how many people will say this was what they wanted when they voted for him  all of them
there are people who think that a massive wall and shifting our security forces from middle eastern nation building to protecting our horse is a bad idea   how much crack to liberals  in general smoke before posting here
  protecting our horse  less than you do apparently
  i see you made a typo   all of the bs i hear about the wall is garbage spewed by john oliver and vox that is completely nonsensical
  protecting our horse  thats my horse
  if its such a good idea why wont congress authorize it
  because congress is about partisan politics not good ideas
  congress is dominated by the gop right now by your logic it should have passed already
out of curiosity and for general polling purposes can you explain why the wall is wanted please be honest  is it practical effective cost efficient are you a border security extremist or do you think this is the only way to ensure less illegal immigration some combination/variant of the above or what americans only please
  i cant flood the thread with smug anime girls so i just wanted to let you know that your train of thought is dumb
    congress is about partisan politics  no wait it only is when it suits my own argument
  i disagree what use is congress if its members cant vote according to their own conscience you might as well do away with them entirely if you just want a blue or red run house
  i hear you i wonder if this is just a natural outcome of a majority two party system and what it would take to wrest some power from both democrats and republicans
  its a natural outcome of the countrys voting system you can only vote for one candidate at the time and in the vast majority of states i think the only exceptions are kansas and one other whoever gets a majority of the vote in a presidential gets all of the electoral votes from that state no matter how marginal their victory was this strongly encourages people to vote for the candidate they can most tolerate that also has the best chance of winning rather than voting for who they actually align with
      have trumpfag smallbusiness owning relative  tax cut passes  writes longass fb post praising trump america becoming great again congratulating her employees on all tge money theyll save  some paragraphs later near the end notes however that theyre not gonna save any money but shes sure itll help them somehow anyway praise trump god bless murrica etc    it amazes me how simultaneously functional yet retarded trumpfags/republicans/conservatives can be but i guess thats what makes them so useful intelligent enough to hold together the country and themselves not enough to question orders or see through blatant manipulation massah loves yall
  so nationalsocialist dems i would be 100 flip over to the dems if they ditched their liberal policies
  i wasnt positing an argument only stating a fact about the us congress in general the only way america actually benefits from congress is when good ideas coincide with the internal power struggle between both parties
  the nazi economic model was so weird  you cant actually place on the left or right spectrum
  generally when people call others nazis its over civil judicial or election policy not so much economic policy
  border wall nearly collapses during testing 13 prototypes breached along mexican border    this shit is going to go down as one of the greatest failures in the history of mankind
  the nazi economic model was so weird  you cant actually place on the left or right spectrum  describe it pls
  i am 2401 penitent tangent i am the monitor of installation 05
  normally i would agree with you but the way you stated it gave me the same gut feeling as when a black racist states that racism is powerprivilege thereby absolving him/her of all guilt  manipulating a definition of a word is a poor way to win an argument trump may be making less money than he would have had he not run but that does not prove that there is no corruption at all
removing entitlement means slavery and stronger dollar who benefits people with billions in dollars people with infrastructure to employ people     cant afford to live even when you are working full time work at 2 shit jobs    those born to power wont have to work ever and can live in luxury people who get in and oblige to this will have slightly better life for themselves but it doesnt have to be like this if things were like in eu life would be better right now america is influenced by the people with money to stay as a backwater
  and her name was mollie tibbetts  flee violence  perpetrate violence  its okay i was fleeing violence before
  basically its an economic model where everyone is happy jewery is illegal and everyone has high paying tech jobs
  yes the famous 100 employment of course they gamed that number like mad by making it illegal for any one they didnt like to work thus removing them from the measurement not just news but poles gypsies slavs and any one else who disagreed if you cut down on the workforce by 15 its not hard at all to get 100 employment    we are talking about the people who invented modern propaganda    of course the story falls flat when you actually learn economics and realize that in any system that doesnt involve socialiststyle topdown control of the economy 100 employment is bad it means no one is transitioning between jobs no one is coming into the work force to look for work and no one is exercising vertical economic mobility    the only countries that have 100 employment are either reporting their numbers wrong or reporting their workers wrong
  its  what do you want to bet this poster never graduated high school
  the best walls made by the best people
this fucking retard is struggling so much with this stupid immigration policy that now hes literally diverting money to pay for locking up kids heres an idea you fucking moron how about letting them go
  we cant do that theyre illegals
  we could however put titans inside the walls
  nitpicking grammar when you have no argument  absolutely reddittier
  i dont think that word means what you think it means  its literally neoliberalneoconservative ideology ie multinational corporatism and international foreign intervention
  le reddit boogeyman
  act like a redditor you get called a redditor lole
  then i guess that makes you a redditor
  no u  no u

    explain
  the right is full of boisterous weaklings rightwing military takeovers only ever happen in the form of military coups where the right has the entire military in their pocket the confederates had no longterm plans for winning their war with the union that they started when they attacked fort sumpter other than beg britain for help and were stomped when britain didnt want to germany only had any success in ww2 because the nazi leadership hadnt run the military into the ground yet and constantly had to fight with the military leadership explaining why the waffen ss did below average at best wherever they fought
  an economy based on looting other countries runaway military spending and making loans to yourself
i dont understand why people consider ted cruz to be a good debater maybe in the sense that ben shapiro is a good debater some of ted cruzs tricks that i noticed    1 my opponent will do something that hillary clinton did/wanted to do  2 notice how my opponent didnt say that he disavows nuclear armageddon his silence on that topic speaks volumes  3 he disagrees with my radical approach to this matter therefore clearly he supports the most radical possible approach in the opposite direction  4 my opponent has said that something he didnt say
  its outlandish and extreme therefore elicits extreme opinions on it since he had an r next to his name they assume it great and correct before they even hear it then try to retroactively justify those opinions then you can take your pick from arguments like tough wont take shit speaks his mind/honestly calls them out etc  actual arguments and points are just technicalities the other side has to deal with not me
  1 my opponent will do something that hillary clinton did/wanted to do  i mean just about every criticism of trump is met with obama did it or the clintons did it some people eat it up
  obama did it or the clintons did it  even though thats 99 of the time a lie or taken out of context though i guess that 1 is all people need to convince themselves everyone else is true
  case in point  
  god what an idiotic post like even if were true the argument being made is other criminals exist so ignore these criminals and let them do whatever they want how do they not realize how stupid this sounds
  your technically right it did peak in 2009 but it only decreased by 900000 compared to the 12200000 then
  youre either a shill or a pathetic moron incapable of seeing how agencies work in the world
  id say shill    do you guys work in the same building
    one minute apart  ip count didnt increase  whats with /pol/tards always projecting
must be weird to be able to look at ted cruz without feeling instant revulsion
    it is an enormous money drain and boondoggle similar if not more effective border control policies can be implemented for significantly less money if it was manned or had sensors i could potentially support it but you can man and install sensors with or without a wall to begin with     i feel its an extremely simple tangible concept that appeals to the american span that shuts off after hearing more than 7 words
what i would love to see happening would be for rosenstein to stand right in front of the resolute desk and tell trump youre going to have to fire me and if you do all hell will break loose people will know youre trying to get to bob mueller but guess what sir    we know what you did we have all the evidence we could have dreamed of i know bob knows and dozens of others know everything its too late sir fire me fire himit doesnt matter its all there you cant cover it up too many people have seen the whole picture now you cant survive the only way to try to escape the avalance thats coming is to get out of its way and the only way you can hope to do that is to resign    do you know what an avalanche is you dumb fuck its a million tonnes of rock and ice and darkness and noise coming down a mountain towards you its a force of nature its something that destroys everything in its path and its heading for your god damn house right now this very moment    so respectfully sir fire me then stand up walk outside and wait to get buried or else you and i both quit right here right now today and maybe all that mountainside falls down on pence instead its your call mr trump
  hes fat far too professional for that id hear that kinda social boxing out of mike avenatti not rosenstein or the other career fbi officials    still itd be nice
  dont quit your day job
  we all think rosenstein is resigning today   it turns out trump resigns on thursday after his meeting with rosenstein    this would be the best thing ever
    if you guys arent careful youll start to believe your own retarded fanfiction
    one little fluke and you retards forget the unskewed polls debacle of 2012 hey be sure to stick around so we can laugh at you in a few months
  the incoming recovery of the house by democrats doesnt make the retarded fanfiction you wrote in  any less retarded
  i dont believe trump would ever go out that easy but eventually everything that mueller finds will come to light and trump will be finished no matter what he does
  i didnt write that now youre the retard
  then dont defend the retarded shit that he wrote
  im all for controlling the borders but an actual physical border wall has got to be the dumbest idea ive seen pitched in a long while a wall of cameras and drones with infrared spotting would do far better than an actual wall the wall can literally be defeated by digging a tunnel right under it or making a ladder its not going to solve any problems effectively and to top it off it shits up the landscape and ruins the ecology of all areas that it cuts through and what about the people that all own land upon the usmexico border are we just supposed to force them to relinquish the land and give them a check even if theyve refused several times beforehand even after all this the wall itself will look like shit against the natural landscape and disrupt the ecology
  and what about the people that all own land upon the usmexico border are we just supposed to force them to relinquish the land and give them a check even if theyve refused several times beforehand  i wouldnt put this past trump considering he is very wellknown for using mafiastyle tactics to try and push people out of their own property so that he can build there like dropping concrete on their homes thankfully he is so incompetent that the wall has not even started and his presidency has less than two years remaining at best so it is a complete nonissue in this case
now you finally understand what people mean by waifu this is what it means not just some passing interest that you want to fuck and thats it but something deeper and genuine
    muh ecology    fucking librals always crying about nature and life and shit gods not gonna let a silly wall fuck with his creations any more than hes letting all the toxic shit people pump into the environment fuck with it    if the earth survived the flood than it can live with a wall
  im here for the anime gif
  the problem with trumptards is its incredibly hard to tell when posts like these are ironic or genuine
    inb4 not all republicans  inb4 both parties are equally bad
  this is why i support the wall america needs an actual physical monument to our stupidity
  gods not gonna let  god either doesnt exist or chooses not to get involved there is nil evidence to the contrary
the wall is already being built its part of the defense bill so either way we are going to be paying for it in new mexico its almost done
  the wall is already being built  lol no
  dc itself has that base covered
  as well as every single confederate monument in the country  hey guys remember that time half the country fought in favor of slavery and lost lets put statues of them all over the place
what a fucking idiot
  technically it is currently under construction
  i unironically and all joking aside support a permanent government shutdown   permanent as in the current government and its state ceases to exist completely  so that this way a new government that isnt as fucked up can take its place
  no not even technically
shocking no one trump caves again  
  this on top of the kavanaugh thing going poorly the un laughing at him him pussying out on firing rosenstein what a hilariously bad week this has been for trump
how many trump supporters actually expected mexico to pay for it or even expected an actual wall im pretty sure it was just a rallying cry
  a lot of them genuinely did
  are you unironically so naive to believe that if the current government just vanishes instantly no despot would fill in the power vacuum this is partially why things are so shit people would rather fuck over the system than try to fix it since they just dont care anymore
  because fixing it is a long and hard process and no human being has the patience for the amount of work it takes
  i dont care who pays for it the wall needs to be built its a matter of national security and just the fact that democrats and their corrupt treasonous comrades dont like it makes it absolutely necessary
  its funny how limply trumptards try to turn around words like treasonous on the democrats it just doesnt stick    and the wall is still never going to happen
  it needs to be built so i can feel like im in a safe space and so i can feel good about people i dont like being mad
  if you really care about undocumented migrants that much you should be asking for reforms to the visa and immigration processes not supporting a money sink that will accomplish fuck all given that most people enter the country legally the wall is just flashy propaganda because talking about policy reform isnt as exciting
the way republican troll their base is really something i enjoy knowing that the deeply conservative states have the lowest quality of life they deny themselves their own affordable care that they already paid for saving us the trouble of having to protect their funding from the super wealthy in their state its helpful
  youre giving me a racism wall in the desert   its even worse than that its bricklaying in the desert for a wall spanning the border if they get as many volunteers as they need all itll do is make bricklaying a piss poorly paid job       solving mexicos problems would be more beneficial to the us than building a wall
  is the orange in the white house rigging the markets for his friends to short not good enough for you
  solving mexicos problems would be more beneficial to the us than building a wall  its similar to the abortion debate like if you make abortion illegal it doesnt magically stop women from trying to have abortions theyll just use unsafe methods that could potentially kill both them and the baby legal abortion results in less lost lives but republican solutions always always appeal to emotion not logic and theyre always solutions that claim to be the most morally upright but fall apart on any examination
trump is getting primaried in 2020
  trump is getting reelected in 2020  ftfy
  nope
  incumbents arent statistically overwhelmingly more likely to get reelected into office  economy isnt continuing to do exceedingly well  democrats currently dont have a complete vacuum of potential leading candidates who could possibly do any better than hillary
  correct the economy is shit and democrats have plenty of good candidates
  this denial  wew
  the entire un laughs at you
  democrats have plenty of good candidates  name one
  ill name five    kamala harris  elizabeth warren  joe biden  cory booker  amy klobuchar
  not avenatti though    hes too slimy for me even if hes on the right side
  harris and warren are somewhere off the deep end and biden is an old white man whose only redeeming feature is not being trump if he could win then a potato could also win    not sure what the others have going for them
  avenatti is good at fighting trump by playing his own game but youre right that i wouldnt want him as president he would literally just be a trump for the democrats hes fine for an attorney terrible for a president
    ahahahaha
  wikipedia is made of clowns    according to wikipedia its literally not possible to be racist against white people its like the ass end of a university
  wwhite people experience racism too  sure buddy im sure life has been very hard for you and your whiteness
  and i bet youve never even been to a university but have been indoctrinated into treating them as a boogeyman
  i have a stem degree      im not even white
  no one cares what degree or race an anonymous person on the internet declares you dumb cunt the point still stands whites havent experienced shit compared to what theyve inflicted on other races throughout history source im white and have a history degree
  this is you being racist right now because everyone can experience racism and religious wise whites have experienced some of the worst just for not believing some retarded higher being so can we just agree that racism is more an economical thing than a skin color thing
  and yes im aware that im acting no different than you a new fag replying to another new fag about something that shouldnt matter to the eyes of the internet
  i dunno how you went from saying religious persecution  racism to the economic bit but whats it like to be a sperg
  kinda fun kinda annoying depending on the situation and some of the religious persecutions were apart of racism such as the kkk and the armenian genocide also about the whole economic thing depending on how much money one makes people will make fun of others who are in a different situation just becuz most cant help themselves but to make to make themselves feel better by bringing others down and tbh dont even know why im typing this down or even replying to you since i know it wont do anything or change your stance i guess im just trying to make myself feel better as well
  hey man if convincing yourself that racism is anything other than racism makes you feel better then i guess keep on keeping on
  never viewed it that way before thank you for the new insight
  butthurt faggot alert
   it wont be long until daily caller and other shit sites get the same treatment  fixed
  yeah thats a pretty apt way of describing yourself thanks for doing the work for me  inb4 nno you
i never heard so much california hate before this last election i think republicans got spooked when they saw how it singlehandedly won hillary the popular vote they know that if those people were spread across the country the rs would be completely fucked so they hear california and they spit venom how dare this state actually have power how dare someone oppose us
every father said what edward wuncler once said  in 30 years that kid will be president of the united states and hell still be a fuckin idiot
hits bong i dunno man two wieners hahaha
  republicans are still butthurt with how prop 187 just destroyed their influence in california when its something theyd try and pull today
  everybody secretly hates california anon even other californians which is why they are pulling the ripcord and moving to better states
  if thats true republicans should certainly be fucking scared about that because thats all those democrats who can now swing flyover states blue
  not to mention that theres a legitimate chance that texas flips blue within the next decade or so and when that happens the gop are well and truly fucked
    were basically a plague that spreads over the country because weve lived in a bubble for the past thirty years detached from reality and now we want your comfy sustainable red states to fix it   gosh i wonder why so many people oppose immigration must just be racists or something
    you sound awfully mad for someone from a 91 welfare state    america could lose every single one of its red states and nobody would bat an eyelash but the red states would be completely fucked if you ever lost california thats a fact deal with it
god emperor of the united states    which is funny because it either means that trump is a dessicated corpse totally unable to move or do anything whose empire has fallen prey to the worst kind of fascism by perverting his words warhammer 40k or that trump has transformed into a giant worm keeping only his human face and tiny hands and controlling his empire as a tyrant for thousands of years because hes the only source of the drug his empire craves and also suffers from frequent bouts of violence dune    some people use geotus unironically without knowing how insulting the comparison actually is
  not true texas is red      for now
  if you take the more positive interpretation of the latter it would mean that trump is trying to get america on the right path by getting someone to assassinate himwhich doesnt really work    if you take the positive notion of the former it would be the great crusade era during which the emperor ultimately doomed himself to ten thousand years on life support and the dissolution of his empireby being a shitty father and a terrible communicator    sonot really a great metaphor either way
  for about one more month and thats it
  you think betos gonna lock it in
  but in dune the godemperor was a positive force because he was trying to be such an asshole that people would never accept a tyrant again
    so thats where the zero requiem came from okouchi is a fucking hack
  if socialists get power that would spell the end for the democrats
  it would be a new beginning which is exactly what the party needs
  more like it would start a new age for america because everyone would see socialism isnt bad and theyll revolt against their corporate masters and the modern day slavery they keep america in    for the many not the few
    worked out well for venezuela didnt it
  shut up retard
  haha keeping dreaming of your socialist paradise and let people grounded in reality run the country
  mass death ensues in continental north america due to immediate civil warm and the inevitable economic effects of expropriating the means of production from those who can actually run them
  expropriating  how do you correctly spell this word nobody has ever heard of while also writing civil warm
  phones have autocorrect now
  and only retards have autocorrect turned on
  i dont understand why trump doesnt just build a thirtyfoot segment of a wall somewhere in the california desert take a picture of it and then post the pic on his twitter page saying surprise its all built then pay alex jones to report that its done the trumptards would believe trump and jones over objective reality his problem is solved
  how retarded people like you are is unfathomably impressive
  a priest a rabbi and you walk into a bar  the baretender points to you and says no one under 18 allowed   you leave  no body under 18 is allowed here eitger
  because i used to live in berlin back when it was still divided the berlin wall was a monument to fear hatred of others and a brutal indifference to human suffering the berlin wall existed to crush the people of east berlin under the will of the soviet union nevermind being completely deaf to the yearnings of the people the soviet rulers worked to actively thwart the people and many died trying to reach freedom    walls exist when there is no understanding no curiosity no compassion the world does not exist because of laws it exists because of people if the people desire something they will struggle to attain it rather than cooperation between people to make everyones lives better a wall exists to say fuck you suffer    i cannot be a part of that i will never support that if we have 20 billion to spend on brutal indifference then we have 20 billion to spend actually fixing the problem and make peoples lives better
  this  nobody seriously is talking about this human beings are the smartest most highly motivated creatures on the planet trying to thwart people is fucking stupid you will lose the way to get someone to stop doing something is to change their motivation not just drop another obstacle in their path    i have a suspicion that the idea for a border wall comes not from a clear assessment of the situation but from a desire to attack and punish people conservatives see illegal immigration as invaders they have to fight the wall is a weapon rather than see them as people with pretty basic and admirable motivations or as resources to be harnessed they are just rule breakers in the conservatives mind you cannot do anything with a rule breaker but punish them
  soo tariffs dont work like that first of all there are almost no tariffs on stuff from mexico the reason is that most of what comes from there is actually factor goods stuff that american companies use to build stuff in america taxing that stuff doesnt hurt mexican suppliers it hurts americans     secondly no company is going to just swallow a tax like a tariff they will bundle it in with their other costs and use it to figure out the price of the good tariffs are passed on to the fool buying the good yes the feds get the tax money but americans are paying the tax and since most goods are bought by middle class and poor because most people are middle class or poor that kind of tax is regressive and punishes the people with the least money driving poverty and killing economic growth     this is why republicans wont support trumps tariffs if they do it will ruin their constituents trump voters are stupid but they arent so stupid as to not notice when the prices in walmart start climbing
  not a presidential watcher but joe biden is way too old harris and booker look pretty solid though warren is too liberal and looks too much like a frail grandma     i will have to look up amy klobuchar i have not heard of her no love for michael bloomberg
what i find funny is that people dont seem to realize that if by some herculean work of idiocy the wall actually started to get built there are many people living in this very country who would happily go and knock it right down    thats why any time someone insists the wall is being built all they can do is point to some dumb prototypes that arent actually in place at the border or worse the fucking fence its hilarious watching some of them backpedal and say a fence is still a wall well a fence is literally what the immigrants already have no trouble getting around you idiot not that a wall would stop them either considering they can you know go under it i swear everything about this wall idea is made to appeal to some of the dumbest people of all time and the next time i meet someone who openly supports trump i am just gonna laugh in their fucking face
  there are like ten walls in the fucking world that work you idiot    you can just tunnel under it mexicans are not molemen one and two thats why you have super cheap off the shelf fucking flir sensors around the wall along with manned patrols    just because you build the wall doesnt mean you abandon every other single method you have dummy there are walls at this exact moment in     mexico  central europe  israel    they all work
  hallelujah finally the truth
  mexico is the wall and the mexican federales are paying for it     caravan stopped at the mexican guatemalan border
    the absolute state of trumptard wit
  super cheap off the shelf fucking flir sensors around the wall along with manned patrols    i find it funny that you literally defeated your own argument for the wall with this part given the terrain of most of the usmexico border just getting more guys on patrol would be just as efficient walls merely slow people down thus are only efficient in urban areas were illegals can quickly disappear into the urban sprawl which is where we already have walls on the other hand the long stretches of rural open areas means you can accomplish the same ends with simple drone patrols since you have all the time in the world to arrest them before they can blend with regular traffic wed get the same result but for 20 billion dollars less    mexicans are not molemen    smugglers are extremely adept tunnelers and have been using extremely elaborate tunnels with electric power and transport carts to defeat current us border protections for years the entrances and exits are typically hidden in buildings on either side of the border so simple flir patrols wont find it these tunnels require significant investigative work to find which means that again wed be better off investing in more manpower for border patrol than burning money on a wall    every billion spent on the wall is another billion not being spent to actually stop illegal immigration
foreign affairs is like sexif you loudly announce that you will always come first youre going to have trouble finding partners    john oliver
    swa the interesting factoid that the usa spends more on illegal childbirth services than it does on trumps wall    in the future there will be no usa
  also note that if the tunnel is belowi wanna say 20 feet for a wall that size the excavation of the walls foundation wont find it and the wall will do literally nothing to stop it
  of course it hasnt spends less money on trumps wall because there is no wall you fucking retard
  youre seeing that because leftists have taken over this board
  its another conservatard thinks he was here first episode
    they get garbage treatment because theyre garbage sites notice nobody has a problem when someone shares something from fox wsj national review or the economist if you lay off the looney tunes news sites people would take you more seriously
you can fool some people all of the time and all people some of the time but you cant fool all people all of the time  this board has taught me how to smell bullshit and taught me well godspeed you glorious bastards
would be cheaper to build a wall out of spics that sneak in tbh    fear would work as a great deterrent for these mestizo subhumans
  heck yeah just like in that great kickass movie 300 am i right
total bullshit  this is only the begining president trump will build the wall promises made  promises will be keep god bless president trump god bless america
  i dont really like action films sorry to say
  holy shit this board has a serious bot problem if posts like this are getting through
  eww a shitpost
  is the trumpy bear trying direct mind control again
  you faggots just do not understand how dc funding works    1 president tells congress to fund his project  2 congress cant get bipartisan enough to fund a box of raisins  3 wait for migrant refugees    this is where we are now btw    4 mobilize troops  5 some asshole in crowd gets pissed off or frustrated  6 fires on troops  7 wall now becomes military defense project  8 unlimited funding through dod  9   10 profit     thats how you go around congress boys and girls
  yeah this is way too complicated for a retard like trump this will never happen    hes literally trying to pass off the soldiers as a wall of people and theyre just sitting there for two months while the caravan isnt even close    the only positive to trumps stupidity is hes inadvertently keeping all these troops from dying in the middle east in bushs pointless idiotic wars that somehow still are not over
trump will build the wall if not i will be infinitely furious
  get ready to be furious then then again youre a republican your kind is always mad about something even when you supposedly won
  wierd isnt it they won the house l the senate the judiciary the presidency and yet theyre still triggered    i wonder whats enough
  nuking their own cities so that the most successful parts of the country are no longer liberal because they gouged them out
    theyll pay for obamas wall that he enlarged from 50 to 700 miles though
  9/15/18    something needs to be done autosage after 48 hours is a little extreme but at least implement it after a week or something sage and stop bumping this you faggots
  fuck yes i do
  and by that i do mean i think he will make a great president in 2020 in the meantime the democrats won the house so thats pretty awesome
  that somehow still are not over  the american economy relies on military manufacturing contracts theyre making more tanks than they actually have crews for by a large margin but they cant stop without causing another detroit
    this is the absolute truth and partisan faggots refuse to accept it because its easier for plebs to think my party good other party bad durrrr
  well one party is running actual openly racist candidates like king and desantis so that both sides are the same rhetoric completely falls apart here
  he lost
  and the wall is never being built fair trade
    m8 the dems also run open bigotry the difference is its sjw style replace straight white with jews in their rhetoric if you are having a hard time noticing     identity politics is the elites favorite tool for keeping the plebs trapped in serfdom
  show me one example of a democrat politican saying the words straight white just one    ill wait
  you have to be suffering from some form of severe mental retardation to not have noticed this kind of thing regularly coming out of progressive activism    huffpost / vox / salon are all financially backed with dnc donors and all have setup a straight white male boogeyman also any dem politician that supports modern feminism has also stated this rhetoric in some form as 3rd wave feminism is heavily based on blaming all their woes on straight white male patriarchy  which is pretty much all of them     but since you asked for a specific example bernie sanders specifically stated the evil straight white boogeyman doesnt know what its like to be poor because somehow those things magically prevent you from having no money learn to fucking google if you need more examples no one is going to spoonfeed you
  learn to fucking google if you need  anyone who cites google it as a source is a complete fucking joke
  gets one example as requested  waaahhh now give me more examples saying to google it is bad because i say so    you got your example faggot    shift the goalpost harder
      look heres a another find literally took me 15 seconds    
      your move are you going to backpeddle or own up to it
  your a literal retard if you cant use google to find a source you will find acceptable
  if you demand someone to google something instead of just pulling up the source yourself it almost always means that youre pulling it out of your ass so you resort to telling them to google it so you can say its their fault when they inevitably dont find anything and never ever have to back up your own claims with facts
  really is that a scientific fact or are you just making something up because you are irate
  some literally who candidate from idaho        she wasnt even elected her career literally ended right after that comment she tried again in florida and they kicked her out after a few months
  sorry that was meant for 
pretty funny how this thread has been around since september and theres still not been a single word of progress on the wall that the cultists still delusionally insist is being built
  it will always remain as being built  the moment they actually fix this problem they lose chunks of their voters same reason they dont do shit about abortion or vets or whatever it is they spew at the meetings always the journey never the destination
  there was something like this in a terry pratchett book    the grand trunk company sort of like a telegraph company was competing with the post office and had this innovative new technology thing they would show off a model for    but that was it a model the actual project had zero research or development it was literally nothing but pr
  the grand trunk was actually running i think youre talking about the new trunk that the smoking gnu was involved along with dearhearts brother the one with specially bred imps and glowing liquids that change color when you flip them but occasionally explode when dropped
  hello big pimp people
  which reminds me im really fucking pissed at the media because nevada gets a genuine blue wave this election and instead of praising us for being the best state in the country they make fun of us as a state because the retarded hicks in nye county voted for a dead pimp
every time trump holds a press conference its absolutely ruinous the mans penchant for failure is astounding
yea its a bunch of codswallop  like if they can get in via a boat or plane maybe whats the point in a wall  gotta respect the national guard though for all those wholl complain about them recall orders are orders
  what exactly are you suggesting we respect
  pretty sure hes not asking you to respect anything hes suggesting the national guard will secure the border regardless of complaints from the left
  yeah good job sending the military to texas when theyre entering through california retard    all this shit is is a stunt that you fell for
  the closest border crossing for the migrants isnt in california retard
the tea bagger wing thinks the reason why republicans lost was because they werent racist enough on immigration or cruel enough with healthcare    see if pedophile defender jim jordon becomes the house minority speaker just for the laughs  
  yeah because they will totally just go to the closest one where all the guards are instead of walking around them    and by the way theyre still two months out what the fuck is the point of defending the border this early
  pffft    oh man let this happen delusional retards think the nation agrees with their bigoted dumbshit views im gonna love the day reality crashes down on them
  youd think getting their asses kicked in the midterms would have been that day but it looks like even that is not enough
  did the democrats learn anything the day lost sixty seats in obamas midterm election
  yeah because they regained the seats two years later and got obama reelected    not seeing that introspection with the repugnicans who are insisting they won
  yeah because they regained the seats two years later  they lost 6  60 seats in 2010 and gained 2  8 seats in 2012 real massive regain there
  and heres a big difference which is why presenting those results in a vacuum is the dumbest rethuglican tactic yet obama lost seats in a bad economy which he spent his term fixing trump lost nearly 40 seats and didnt gain any senate seats in a good economy and im sure in 2020 it wont be a good economy considering how much hes fucking things up with his trade war this is a disaster for the right no matter how you slice it and its time for you to give up and admit it instead of ceaselessly regurgitating the same talking point thats not fooling anyone
  trumps claim that democrats want open borders is a lie  money for improving our border is racist support sanctuary cities resist    do you faggots seriously not understand how blatantly self contradictory this bullshit is
  the reason why their gains were negilatable was because the republicans gerrymandered the fuck out of everything after their wave election keep in mind if republicans didnt openly rig things with gerrymandering and voter suppression democrats would have picked up at least 10 more seats this midterms    democrats are playing a poker game against republicans who are hiding aces up their sleeves and even if the democrats win the republicans declare they got cheated and flip the table over look at how the republicans are acting in florida and arizona
  and dont forget his overt racist fearmongering destroyed republicans in the suburbs racism might carry trump in the backwater rural parts of the country but considering he lost a decent chunk of his coalition and the latest poll says 19 of republican dont want trump to run in 2020 the trump republican party no less hes in deep shit unless he overtly steals the election or does some other power play to turn us into a dictatorship
  no its not contradictory a wall is a ridiculous waste of money and sanctuary cities is bullshit right wing spin there isnt a single democrat politician calling for open borders
    yes it is contradictory    preventing a law from being enforced is functionally the same thing as legalization and thats exactly what sanctuary cities do in portland or for example the democrats overwhelming voted to prevent police from being allowed to take part in illegal immigration enforcement or any sweeps     what they are saying would be like murder should be illegal but people who commit murder shouldnt receive any punishment if you cannot comprehend how that is logically contradictory then i hate to break it to you buddy but youre a retard and i dont just mean kind of sort of retarded we are talking maximum potato
  name one racist thing trump has actually said or done since he took office    the so called racist fearmongering comes from sjw news outlets calling everything raycis despite having absolutely nothing about race
  raycis  not that poster and im sure hell provide sources when he posts but i can already tell youre a retard who will say thats not actually racist because or worse just insist that he never actually said it    please try not to match my predictions
  
  so which of these do you personally consider racist and not just trump called a black person dumb therefore hes racist
   thats not actually racist because     except those kinds of arguments are 100 valid    i swear trying to explain things to people who have been brainwashed by the msm is sometimes like trying to talk to flat earthers    hurr durr i bet you will just explain basic geometry to us typical flatfag durrr look at me i can predict what your argument will be becuz we flat earthers are so smart hurrr derp derp derp oh god oh god im a thundering faggot durr    this is literally how you sound
thats because most gop are rynos like p ryan for one but they know who they are anyhow the wall will go up we give mexico 200 million every year tax payers  considering how they fuck up stoping the caravan that money can now go to wall along with any aid honduras  el salvador gets times that  by 10 there is wall money build the wall enforce the law m a g a
  except those kinds of arguments are 100 valid  explain how i want to see how you justify your stupidity
    needs an explanation for why explaining that y is not x when solving for y is a valid point towards ratifying y        its called the third law of logic you absolute drooling double digit iq fucking retard    get the fuck out you absolute reddit tier cancer
  yes absolutely enforce the law and put donald trump in jail where he belongs
    everything on there is either   a criticizing someone who happens to be a poc not because they are a poc  funfact if you cant tell the difference the racist is you      or    b nationalism which can be kind of dickish since its antiindividualistic but doesnt fit the definition of racism
  okay so you just spewed some absolute nonsense and then screeched about reddit while reddit spacing    amazing i must admit my expectations of you were already low but you somehow managed to underwhelm me even further
  i dont understand your argument therefore it is wrong    by the power invested in me as someone who has quite literally double your iq i hereby revoke your right to have an opinion about anything
    notice how he never calls into question the intelligence of a white guy its always a black person or woman thats a pattern    also if you want to be just beaten into submission where you have to resort to fallacies i can do that too                
    look at these leftwing sources calling trump a racist  people accused him of racism therefore hes a racist    accusation / guilt its honestly pathetic that this even has to be explained    give actual incontext quotes or piss off
  notice how he never calls into question the intelligence of a white guy  i guess robert de niro and jennifer rubin arent white anymore    congratulations on selling even more retarded and fake news
  hold together the country and themselves  sauce
  accusation  not proof  whoops
  considering how grammatically incorrect that sentence was you dont have the iq or power to revoke a single thing
  yes exactly since the migrants can get by via boats  go independent
  damage control
  military personnel who have to put their life on the line because of the politicians and the presidents wishes even if they dont agree they have to do it while you and i get to sit and type about the border in relative comfort
  nno you  thats gonna be a yikes from me buddy
  silly images on the internet have resulted in my sworn fealty to our leader
  i think this would be an ideal system in the us to combat the stalemated nature of congress 
  id love to know how sitting around in texas for two months waiting for the caravan to get there is putting their lives on the line
    oh look hes withdrawing the troops from the border because it was all just an election stunt    one that didnt even work because he lost the midterms    i am going to be rubbing this one into trumptard faces for a long time to come
trump is a dipshit
they just should build the wall out of hillary since they cant get over her
  people talk a lot about liberals wanting open borders but really its just a fringe minority of people who actually want that    he posted unironically after talking why a wall shouldnt be built
  what the hell does an open border mean to you
  underrated
  to do that youd have to automate some jobs and increase the pay for others
  politics aside of all the states ive lived and worked in the quality of life has been miserable for one reason or another theres at least stuff to do in the south year round and housing is affordable nothing else is more or less expensive than say new england or california   but work is impossible to keep that supports you     ne work is easy to get and can pay fairly well but housing sucks and overpayed police rove every corner to hit you with a ticket to support their budget california is similar to both in that housing is hard to find expensive and well call you back about the resume in six to nine months
looks like trump is going to shut down the government over his wall thinking he can blame the democrats for it
  the idiot doesnt realize that shutting down the government during the lame duck period is the best possible result because republicans wont be able to pass anything one month left tick tock
  the problem is americans are retarded so theyll find a way to blame the democrats even though republicans still hold all the power    also trump is now declaring that by wasting billions on his broken promise well save money even though he has no proof

  assad is a good guy
  agreed
  trump supports israel topic allowed

one of the most striking graphics emerging from the 2018 election comes from isthmus a madison wisconsin altweekly newspaper    democrats romped through wisconsin on election day winning each of the five statewide offices on the ballot and winning the statewide popular vote in the state assembly by eight points nevertheless republicans won a 63 vote supermajority in the 99 seat wisconsin assembly    wisconsin in other words did not have a democratic election for the state assembly something resembling an election took place and voters cast their ballots in earnest but the entire state assembly race was rigged    this is not a new state of affairs for wisconsin as a federal court decision striking down wisconsins gerrymandered state assembly maps explained in 2016 in 2012 the republican party received 486 of the twoparty statewide vote share for assembly candidates and won 60 of the 99 seats in the wisconsin assembly in 2014 the republican party received 52 of the twoparty statewide vote share and won 63 assembly seats    but of course that lower court decision ultimately did very little to restore democracy to the state last june in one of retired justice anthony kennedys final acts on the supreme court the court punted this case back down to the lower court and left wisconsins rigged maps in place gill v whitford was expected to be a death blow to one of the most aggressive gerrymanders in the nation it wound up being a crushing defeat for democracy    just nine days after the courts nondecision in gill justice kennedy retired  and that retirement likely destroyed any meaningful hope that the supreme court would stop partisans from rigging legislative maps though kennedy expressed openness to striking down partisan gerrymanders his replacement brett kavanaugh appeared to threaten revenge against democrats during his confirmation hearings    
    tony evers narrowly defeated threeterm incumbent gov scott walker by 30500 votes on nov 6 in 2016 wisconsin went for donald trump by a margin of 23000 votes the state has sent a progressive and a tea partier to the us senate  backtoback twice wisconsin is a purple state yet the state assembly is a sea of red thats what voters want according to assembly speaker robin vos    theres no doubt about it that the voters across wisconsin affirmed our record the record of our party and the agenda that we have put forward over the past eight years vos rrochester told the assembly republican caucus on nov 12 some will say the only reason that we are here is because of redistricting that is a faulty premise we are the ones that were given a mandate to govern    despite democrats winning every statewide office on the ballot and receiving 200000 more total votes republicans lost just one seat in wisconsins lower house this cycle and that victory was by a razorthin 153 votes democrats netted 13 million votes for assembly 54 percent statewide even so vos will return to the capitol in 2019 with republicans holding 63 of 99 seats in the assembly a nearly twothirds majority    vos likes to frame it this way if you discount uncontested races  a third of the entire assembly  republicans won 58 percent of the vote    that seems like a mandate to me vos told his caucus what do you think    democratic minority leader gordon hintz doshkosh doesnt see it that way he says his party is competing on the most uneven playing field in the united states because republicans have disenfranchised thousands of democrats
  if you care about democracy this should piss you off and if you dont care about democracy dont dare call yourself an american
  thinkprogress  you probably shouldnt use that as an op source it just invites shitflinging heres a different source with excerpts about wisconsin specifically      in wisconsin a federal judicial panel invalidated the state assembly districts as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in 2016 but the us supreme court overturned that in june and sent the case back to the lower court to establish whether there was harm to particular voters a new trial is set for april    preliminary results from the 2018 elections show wisconsin democrats received 54 percent of the total votes cast for major party assembly candidates  a figure inflated by the fact that democrats ran unopposed in 30 districts compared to just eight for republicans    yet republicans won 63 of the 99 assembly seats just one less than their preelection majority that marks an increase in the prorepublican efficiency gap from about 10 percent in 2016 to almost 15 percent this year democrats also won or are leading in elections for all of wisconsins statewide offices showing voter support for their candidates in races that are not affected by gerrymandering    republican assembly speaker robin vos called it a faulty premise to say that republicans legislative majority is due to gerrymandering    we are the ones who have been given a mandate to govern vos said    but assembly minority leader gordon hintz said wisconsins gerrymandered maps worked exactly as republicans intended he said noncompetitive districts have made it increasingly difficult for democrats to recruit candidates and raise money
a republic isnt a democracy stop complaining about rural voters
  maybe democrats would win more seats if they had more votes besides urban criminals  all their votes are heavhly concentrated in urban centers and absolutely no body else votes for them  the rural landowners with an actual conscience vote republican
  more like if you cant appeal to the voters rig the system in your favor its the republican way
  this the fact republican in charge did some massive cherry picking to declare his side won was crazy if not out right /pol/ logic    in the districts we were able to rig we won so that means the people support us
  just wait till we recall that pedo tony evers
i guess kennedy was an illegitimate justice and all the opinions he authored should be overturned
  he was a republican hack and anyone who calls him a moderate is insane    also wisconsin wasnt the only state that republicans rigged the same thing happened in michigan pennsylvania and north carolina
  not every seat was up for grabs so voter turnout doesnt determine a flip wisconsin went red in 2016 for the first time since regan stacking the state senate and assembly with republican controlled seats that in the senate were not up for grabs in the midterms look closer at a voter map the pockets of democrat voters are highly concentrated skewing how effective a generic  of votes can really be taken but democrats are too dumb to grasp extenuating circumstances and rather bitch on a basket weaving message board
  also this was a record year for split party voting article didnt want to cover that
  pretty sure naive districting would absolutely destroy democrats considering all of their votes are concentrated in urban cores one little box and the urban ape vote would vanish what you really mean to say is you hate redistricting when it favors republicans and perform mental acrobatics when democrats do it any scheme to get rid of it likely comes with guidelines for districting that unilaterally favor democrats    and the us isnt a democracy for good reason as it turns out having the vote favor individuals who are net positive tax contributors prevents public liabilities like yourself from endlessly giving themselves free money and turning us into a oneparty shithole like venezuela
    all youve done is explain how republicans rigged the system with their undemocratic gerrymandering system by deluding democratic strong holds to make sure that even if they have a majority of votes their voice still doesnt matter because of how republicans have rigged the system    this election was a show of force for the democrats had a 75 advantage in voting that was even more massive than tea party wave but because republicans rigged the states they controlled the gains for the democrats werent at large it was predicted that if republicans didnt rig states in their favor democrats could have picked up 1015 more seats in the house and have taken control of the wisconsin pennsylvania ohio and north carolina state legislators
  i hate democratic elections if im in the minority
  you hate redistricting when it favors republicans and perform mental acrobatics when democrats do it  i calculate that republicans benefit far more from gerrymandering than democrats do so no i have no problem with getting rid of it altogether the republicans on the other hand will justify it nonstop because they know their hold on power depends on being able to gerrymander as much as possible
  i calculate that republicans benefit far more from gerrymandering than democrats do  i calculate that you like anal beads the size of tennis balls ripped out of your ass like the starting cord on a lawnmower
  not an argument
  sorry thought we were just making baseless interjections we thought were the truth
  solid evidence that republicans in wisconsin benefited from gerrymandering  lol bet ya like being started like a lawnmower  the absolute state if conservatives    everyone living in an urban area is a criminal  everyone in urban areas votes dont matter as much as my redneck ass  topic aside conservatives are pretty hypocritical when it comes to monoliths  stop calling us all facists  all urban people are criminals
  lol bet ya like being started like a lawnmower  the absolute state if conservatives  last i checked conservatives didnt like being started like a lawn mower own your sexuality anon its 2018  everyone living in an urban area is a criminal  i dont think he said that but you already know better  conservatives are pretty hypocritical when it comes to monoliths  immediately after calling person hes responding to a redneck and misrepresenting their argument  wew
   if you dont care about democracy dont dare call yourself an american  can i call myself a scotsman
  own your sexuality  i prefer they be pulled out more slowly i was saying the anon that initially said what i quoted was a good example of how so many conservatives just resort to personal attacks  i dont think he said that  maybe democrats would win more seats if they had more votes besides urban criminals  didnt say it but definitely heavily implied it  youre a hypocrite for making a monolith out of rural folk calling them rednecks  am i wrong   misrepresented their argument  where and how
  except in this case there are clear standards to follow which republicans dont
  a republic isnt a democracy  right but you can have a republican dictatorship as well our republic is supposed to be representative and the mechanism it achieves that is by democratic elections if youre drawing districts just so that you end up as close to a singleparty state as possible the government is no longer representative there are plenty of countries where in theory you have elections but in practice the system around the elections is so fucked up they may as well not happen and our country is moving in that direction largely due to republicans i dont know why any constituency would want a single party state they presumably have some party loyalty because the party represents them but when the competition disappears the party and by extension government is that much less responsive to their interests in the future
  this
  this
  true neither the ussr or the peoples republic of china were/are democracies but they were very much republics led by elected representatives
  how dare the founders write in laws that would let rural areas or states have equal representation  how dare they do on to us what we did on to them  too bad were a republic
  the founders made mistakes like only letting land owning white men vote or allowing slavery to exist    good thing we can fix the mistakes they made
  this  its like people forget that amendments to the constitution exist
  this
  if you flood a nation full of refugee and give them benefits and promise them more if they vote for you the government is no longer representative  all in all america needs to fucking collapse
do you guys ever think we spend too much time worrying about the honesty of a fundamentally dishonest system this is an ideology war  and face it you really dont want people elected who oppose your ideology do you    republicans and /pol/ppets dont care if someone won a race through shady bullshit tactics if theyre going to usher in a new white ethnostate for them and liberals dont complain about democrats gerrymandering in the few areas they have it    its all just one big complex nomic
  my team won suck it shitlib four more years
  im fairly sure your team hasnt actually won four more years
  were a republic buddy this is the way weve always done it and if you dont like it you can move to pakistan
  great system you got there buddy
  fuck off you unpatriotic fuck
  gerrymandering to the level of individual votes was not possible in 1789 the system was not designed for it and if you think its constitutional to disenfranchise voters based entirely upon where they live and who they would vote for you need to update yoyr understanding
  if the founding fathers didnt want gerrymandering they wouldnt have made the system winner takes all this is all working by design of course a pleb like you doesnt agree not that it matters you have no real say
  democracy  fuck you and fuck mob rule just because 51 of people want something doesnt make it a good thing
  the way districts are handled is left up to the states states went with a district based system because they couldnt imagine or at least implement a proportional representation system and the only alternative was atlarge representation which would be hilariously bad for any state that had more than one representative
  correct many of our institutions are designed for the pastoral america of 1800 they have been updated in some parts to function for the industrialized america of 2000 but the digitized america of 2018 is outpacing them yet again
  it turns out having the vote favor individuals who are net positive tax contributors  isnt that most blue states
  duuuuuuuuuuuude its better to listen to what less people want lmao
  the minority of people are mostly highly educated and/or highly wealthy  id rather listen to them than some middle of the road average person
  if the founding fathers wanted it they would have put it in the constitution  this absolutely we should also take away direct election of senators remove the right to vote for women reinstitute slavery but only in the southern states and there damn well be the same number of slave states as free states and only give the right to vote to landowning white males    it doesnt matter a pleb like you doesnt have a say  thats exactly the idea the founding fathers foresaw a party as grand as donald trumps grand old party who would courageously ignore the pseudoscience about so called global warming as i certain of my own existence i am certain that the forefathers wanted this so that the republicans would repeal obamacare democracy so much as it ever existed was only ever a means to an end and that end was republicanism
republicans use jerrymandering to dampen the blue votes and democrats create votes in order to overwhelm the red ones they both cheat it just seems to depend on the state to determine who is better at it
  theres absolutely no evidence anywhere that suggests anyone was creating votes what a load of bullshit     muh both sides
  support for illegal immigration is a longterm voter creation project
  the only way theyd create votes is if democrats allowed for blanket amnesty which would be a great tactic for turning the southwest solid blue if they made sure to tell everyone new citizen it was the democrats they should thank for it and make sure they vote    they should really do that it would be a death blow to republicans in texas
  good luck pushing your great policy through congress    although its really great to see that you literally support criminals over american citizens of itll get you the electoral results you want
  not waiting until the democrats take all over the senate and presidency and the pushing for full amnesty to create a voting bloc that will create generational power for the democrats
      so is /news/ the dem version of /pol/
  /news/ has people from all sides and it constantly complains about it
so whats a fair way to draw voting districts
  yes
  if you draw districts in a way that has predefined rules that do not specifically benefit any party then that would be fair         the alternative to that is to let a nonpartisan commission draw the maps rather than the state legislature
  democracy  thank god were a republic
  this exchange has already happened     wisconsin is neither an example of democracy or a republic it is an example of minority rule
  having a laugh at your expense rn
  yes yes we heard you the first hundred times orange man good
    as donald trumps west wing careens through one of the most turbulent weeks of his presidency white house officials are struggling to understand the source of the fury fueling the presidents eruptions this is a level of insanity ive never seen before one former west wing staffer told me current and former officials are debating different theories for trumps outbursts ranging from his fears over his son don jrs legal exposure to the prospect that house democrats will unleash investigations in january hes under a tremendous amount of mental stress one prominent republican close to him told me    whats surprising to some advisers about how bad the past week has been is that trump initially seemed to take the midterm losses in stride last tuesday he was in high spirits as he watched election returns come in with about a hundred friends at the white house trump told people that his barnstorming rally schedule had mobilized his base and held republican losses to historical lows while increasing republican gains in the senate he really thought he won the midterms a prominent republican who spoke with trump said    but by wednesday after hours of commentary about the suburbs distaste for him and with seat after undecided house seat slipping toward the democrats his mood slid too hitting bottom in a bizarre and combative press conference he was furious about the narrative he said look i went to all these states and now people are saying trump lost the election the republican who spoke with him recalled within hours trump forced out attorney general jeff sessions and replaced him with matt whitaker whod been a frequent cablenews critic of the robert mueller investigation
next trump directed his press office to revoke cnn reporter jim acostas press pass something hed wanted to do for months but had been talked out of by aides this is a matter of the president now being on his own without any countervailing force whatsoever a person close to trump said its just 100 percent donald trump doing what donald trump wants    trump remained in a dark mood during his weekend trip to france to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i as the washington post reported he got into an argument with british prime minister theresa may during a phone call on the flight across the atlantic on friday on saturday morning trump skipped attending a rainsoaked ceremony at the aisnemarne american cemetery to honor the battle of belleau wood when his absence became a scandal the white house said the decision had been made because marine one reportedly could not fly in the rain and secret service did not want trump traveling by motorcade one republican briefed on the internal discussions said the real reason trump did not want to go was because there would be no tent to stand under he was worried his hair was going to get messed up in the rain the source said john bolton and everyone was telling him this was a big mistake a former administration official said trump hates being outside in wet conditions what i honestly think he woke up and said its pouring rain this is a joke and im not doing this
trumps absence from the ceremony became the dominant headline from his trip perhaps as a gambit to change the subject trump fumed on the flight back to washington that he was ready to fire embattled homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen whom he has clashed with over the uptick in border crossings a move against nielsen would be in many ways a chance for trump to finally force chief of staff john kelly her closest administration ally to quit according to a source kelly told white house counselor johnny destefano that he would resign if trump fired nielsen    kellys resignation would be a big victory for trump for months trump has been reluctant to fire him partly because hed have to do it personally and partly because he doesnt want to make kelly a potent enemy on the outside kelly has decided to hang in there and get humiliated day after day a person close to trump said trump recently told a former official that he was worried kelly would campaign against him in 2020 if he fired him a person briefed on the phone call said but trump may be getting over those concerns according to two sources trump and melania had a conversation on election night last week about the chief of staff position with nick ayers jared kushner and ivanka trumps top choice to replace kelly    ayers politically gifted but conspicuously ambitious and with questionable loyalty to trump would bring his own baggage to the job half the west wing told me theyd walk out a republican close to the white house said a washington post correspondent reported that kellyanne conway told friends shed quit if ayers got the job conway told me that the suggestion was silly
as if the possible defenestration of two cabinet officials and the replacement of the chief of staff werent enough of a sign of extreme dysfunction yesterday melanias office issued an unprecedented statement attacking the deputy national security adviser mira ricardel who had reportedly clashed with the first ladys staff on her tour of africa last month a source said the president approved the first ladys statement and supports ricardels firing the president called johnny destefano today and said get the bitch out of here or youre gone a source briefed on the conversation recalled    fear of trumps rage has spread throughout the cabinet according to one republican commerce secretary wilbur ross has told people hes afraid to visit the white house because he doesnt want to be fired
  one former west wing staffer told me  one prominent republican close to him told me  a prominent republican who spoke with trump said  a person close to trump said  the republican who spoke with him recalled  the washington post reported lel  one republican briefed on the internal discussions  according to a source  a person close to trump said  a person briefed on the phone call said  a republican close to the white house said  a source briefed on the conversation recalled  according to one republican
  waaaaah anonymous sources  q was anonymous did that stop you
  urrdurr hurr this guy i disagree with agrees with u u dumb  mental patient attempts to deflect with a strawman
  whats your point are you implying they are all lying
    samefag
  only the reporters have to lie about their sources existing
  cd c//damage_control  run accuse_samefagexe  goto 1
  damage control  yes you definitely said something with enough substance to warrant damage control   oh no wait you asked a question you knew the answer to and tried to strawman that guy
  youre supposed to deliver a reply of substance when accused of being a samefag    fucking lol get off your high horse faggot all the trumptards ever do is    attack the source  because yannow every washington rumor has to have a name attached to it or its complete and utter bunk they never turn out to be true right  accuse of samefaggotry  never mind that /news/ is a small enough board that you can actually look at the unique posters count at the bottom of the screen to track post identity everyone who disagrees with me is a samefag  post memes  because you can do anything with meme magic even win elections i saw ten thousand posts of screaming on the election thread on /pol/ and california went red as an american apple oh wait it didnt in fact the gop is a third party in cali whoops    am i missing anything attack the source post memes accuse of samefaghmm
  attack the source  breitbart    post memes  blue wave drip drip etc    accuse of samefag  sock puppet    dud i miss anything
  yeah you projected like a movie theatre and assumed the left is exactly as toxic empty and hopeless as you are
  reverses partisan rehotoric to show how hypocritical the poster is  projecting  if holding up a mirror and inverting your statements is projecting who is really the projector
  calling someone a hypocrite works if theyre actually a hypocrite    breitbart is a trans source and you know it    the democrats gained more seats than any election since watergate    and again look at the fucking unique posters count
  the blue wave did happen though the fake news media was insisting it didnt less than two hours into the election because theyre retarded then the real news media reported on it and said there was one
  your entire post describes the average channer regardless of political leanings     breitbart  you can interchange breitbart with fox if it makes you feel better about that part but it doesnt change the fact that you literally attacked it as a source in your post    bluewave  whether it happened or not does not change the fact that there were dozens of memes about it before it happened there are other examples such as impeach drumpf etc     unique posters  i wasnt here to see before it went to 6 so i went speculate still i have seen my share of unsubstantiated samefag claims to never take them too seriously      see above whether it happened or not does not make it any less of a meme
  fox isnt actually that bad though unlike breitbart they have actual legal experts    like judge napolitano
    whether it happened or not does not change the fact that there were dozens of memes about it before it happened there are other examples such as impeach drumpf etc    uhhh what a meme describing a real thing is not the same as literally trying to swing california red with the power of memes    i will never forget the eight hour thread of continuous aaaaaaaaaaaaaa like they were charging the spirit bomb
  legal expert  get suspended for conspiracy theory peddling      fox news is just as bad as breitbart and inforwars
    this map makes their faggotry all the more funny keep in mind under trumps watch republicans are about to lose all of orange country the birthplace of goldwater conservatism and reagans home turf
  this on top of the fact that the northern walk has defected if a presidential election were held with that map the dems would win handily
  just because you do not know what a meme is does not make it any less of a meme
  your article is evidence against itself since breitbart and infowars would never actually suspend anyone for peddling conspiracy theories
  except he wasnt suspended for it also i have yet to find out where cnn or msnbc were able to cause an international incident like fox news and trump caused
man its like watching an alternate version of house of cards except the president isnt competent at anything expect getting the racists of america pumped up
  democrafts gained more seats any anything since watergate  win thirty seats  bill clinton lost 52  obama lost 60    gee golly gosh almost like youre full of shit die
  hes technically right because its the most seats democrats have gained since watergate  also keep in mind how rigged the system was with republicans gerrymandering
  also keep in mind how rigged the system was with republicans gerrymandering    amazing how every electoral function and body of government is either obsolete or rigged when republicans win but perfectly fineworking tools of a representative democracy when democrats win    like how basic functions of the senate are completely forgotten in favor of crying about how that because dems have more popular votes for senate races that they should control the senate
  its almost like democrats are by far the larger party or something meaning in a fair and reasonable system theyd consistently win the majority of positions    no that cant be it conservatives are the silent majority it totally isnt just a couple edgy teenagers and the last few remnants of a decrepit generation
  you could have chosen to make a valid point against him but you didnt
  this 100 i cant wait until a new party paradigm shift happens when republicans all finally fucking die and the democraps are forced to split into a new division between the corporatist centrist position that the party actually encompasses and the people who actually want leftist representation
there wasnt a blue wave republicans wont be able to pass any legislation for the next two years minimum but we still won    why are they still clinging to this there is no universe in which having complete control of congress and then losing it is a victory
  complete denial that they could lose its hilarious how trump claimed that the midterms were a victory for him right after they finished but it turns out hes actually seething its like some retarded /v/ meme
  that would be interesting im a centrist but im also proregulation i wonder who id pick
  all pol is one person    q was retarded  people who believe in lefttabloid shit like this are also retarded  the retardation doesnt magically become justified once it happens to agree with you    partisan double digit iq fags gonna partisan as always
    honestly the lack of a definition of what a blue wave actually was is the main problem flipping the house is certainly huge but the people mocking it are saying that it was supposed to flip the senate and claim a super majority in the house you may call that damage control or denying reality in the face of a loss but if that is what they believed a blue wave was supposed to be than in their minds you are the one in damage control trying to salvage a lukewarm midterm its all about perspective
  everytime i heard about a blue wave it was always some troll trying to bait replies using it negatively like it was the same as lizard people getting voted in
  same it was always those people who would ironically post on other boards with stuff like umm sweetie drumpf is finished and theres going to be a blue wave in november just their pitifully trite caricatures of totally how all liberals actually behave which for some reason even stupider people would respond to with complete seriousness
  this has nothing to do with the midterm results and everything to do with the mueller investigation the walls are closing in and hes losing it next week is going to be a very interesting week
  so getting 8 more votes in the house and 12 more in the senate is somehow not a blue wave
  well in a way it does have to do with those because if hed won the midterms he would have been able to stop the mueller investigation but he didnt so now even if he were to fire mueller the dems would be able to bring him right back in in january similarly there was speculation though nobody knows for sure that the only reason the investigation was silent was because the midterms were coming up and now theyre passed and all bets are off its all interlinked like cells    but yeah im kind of splitting hairs here like you said trump is sweating
  see  
  vanity fair is not a tabloid
  even diehard democrats admitted that flipping the senate was always a longshot considering how this was the most unfriendly senatorial map to democrats in years the fact is that the dems gained a ton of seats in the house and the republicans gained minimal seats in the senate when they already had a majority in the senate and only kept some of their seats after extremely close races betos loss to cruz in texas was heartbreaking for liberals but at the same time the fact that a liberal came within 200000 or so votes of ousting an incumbent republican senator in texas of all places should be extremely worrying to republicans the fact of the matter is that the democrats made huge gains while the republicans lost the ability to push through any legislation and did not gain anything in return
    definitely this was a big midterm for dems and i am not trying to downplay their success at all just pointing out why conservatives are saying that a blue wave did not happen    these pretty much nail what i saw about it prior to the election    
  no its a womens magazine  the articles are tabloid quality of course
    factual reporting high
  now hell accuse mbfc of bias watch
dude everything but the daily caller is biased dont you know
i think were watching the thin veneer of artifice being stripped away from this presidency i think so many while the momentum and two years of a held senate and house were intact were along for the ride but now all the bloviating and rhetoric is laid bare for what it is a man who only cares about himself who only ran for president for the worst reasons who won by dialing in on our worst tendencies stoked by fear and is simply unsuited for the job and never wanted it trump is trying to remake the presidency in his image because he never understood the office in the first place and can only operate on what he already knows the problem then is that he comes from a world that revolved around him    ive never heard the man criticize himself or accept criticism at all the ability to digest criticism is normally a trait we attribute to maturity too many mistook his misunderstanding of this as strength they are not the same even if the proper marketing can help one believe in their sameness
  are there really human beings alive who dont think mbfc is liberally biased
  so many people attack trump the man this is endemic to our society today it almost matters more who says what or how that makes others feel than what is said    when kids sit in history class 100 years from now history will reflect that trump passed a tax reform bill and was the first president in recent history of america to not start a new major military conflict thank god for this    other than that it has been pretty boring quite frankly we needed a little boring weve had too much happenings since 2001
  lol imagine being so blind that you really think nothing has happened by the way theres still two years left on his presidency little too soon to speak about whether he started a major military conflict
   strong left bias
  donald trumps presidency was famously wracked with scandal he repeatedly clashed with the investigation of russian meddling in the 2016 election while the investigation did not explicitly target the president it would plague him for the remainder of his time in office many members of his campaign would be indicted convicted or plead guilty to various corruption charges discovered over the course of the investigation    president trumps policy making was comparatively weak in their respective first terms barack obama and george bush had passed the affordable care and usapatriot acts but president trump was not able to achieve any major legislation an attempt to repeal the aca fell flat due to dissent within his own party and the budget bills he signed proved unpopular republicans running for reelection in 2018 opted to focus on immigration security instead of the thriving economy    on foreign policy matters trump was characterized by frequent missteps his attempts to soothe relations with russia and north korea were viewed by many as kowtowing to dictators while his tougher stances on trade including a fullon trade war with china did as much harm as good if not more so he frequenty criticized the european union and renegotiated nafta resulting in nafta 20 a treaty not significantly different from its predecessor    notably the election of 2018 was probably the biggest rebuke that any president had received in the previous 4 decades democrats received a popular vote margin of nearly ten percent and turned out in numbers totally unprecedented for a midterm trumps party lost their majority in the house of representatives by a greater democratic shift than any election since the years following the watergate scandal only retaining the senate thanks to a highly favorable electoral map
  he actually thought out and typed all this up
  wow bro you put effort into your posts instead of reposting the latest jew meme you got off reddit  not him but yikes something like that wouldnt even take that long to type if you werent a highschool dropout
  many words bad
    in california democrats tried to create a more balanced approach without gerrymandering and republicans got obliterated even in districts that were strongholds for them compare to wisconsin where republicans went all in to rig their elections and it gave them a super majority in the state house even though they lost the popular vote by 10
    he really typed all that out and expected instant praise  he really samefagd when he didnt get it
  multiple people bad
  hes gonna keep doing it until he gets his pat on the head from the internet  he will respond to this post thinking hes accomplishing something  he will continue to larp for free forever
  are you implying you get paid for your side of this
  im not the one who wrote an essay detailing a fictional account of what a future public school textbook might say about trump only to get mad and samefag myself when people didnt like it
  textbooks bad
  public school textbooks  bad  actually yes they are hence why us public school performance continues to drop
  public school bad
  correct
  no dumbass i did that and youve been arguing with someone else and accusing them of samefaggotry for four hours
if someone needs to write political fanfiction to prove their point you know for a fact that theyre retarded and by extension so is pretty much everyone who agrees with them
  pointing out facts like that the current administration passed no significant legislation including the aca repeal that was promised for a decade now did not obtain any concessions from nk and russia and is plagued by corruption charges  fanfiction  unless this administration suddenly becomes 50000 more competent in the next two years thats its legacy
  500  0 is still 0
  buddy it was literally one single post at most 2000 characters that isnt even an introduction can you even count to 2000
  yeah no this is like the twentieth time its been done
  if were counting outofthread examples then theres no reason to ignore similar fanfics about hillary i dont really see much reason to care about every single example ever thats not really productive
  then theres no reason to ignore similar fanfics about hillary  the only fanfiction posted about hillary on /news/ is the one where shes president
  with the way people blame her you wouldnt know it was fanfic
  what have people blamed hillary for
  immigration healthcare healthcare failure gun restrictions etc  most things democrats do they try to use hillary as the figure head like trump
  immigration healthcare healthcare failure gun restrictions etc  people mostly blame obama or pelosi for this    if you have links to people here blaming hillary for it id like to see them
  its almost as if competent honest reporters tend to lean towards the left which favors competent honest reporting
  its almost as if everyone who got a journalism degree from a leftwing indoctrination factory ends up left wing
  did i not just rebuke you in another thread for regurgitating posts you fucking retard its not clever its not funny and it doesnt even make sense  inb4 you do it again
  did i not just rebuke you in another thread for regurgitating posts  no
  no he hasnt it was you    also your novella speculation is incorrect on the foreign policy stuff its been largely beneficial for us
  well youre a moron regardless and thats the end of that discussion
  the liberal arts components of universities are in fact leftwing indoctrination factories and no amount of glib shitposting on your part will change this fact
  sounds like your tinfoil hat is on too tight kid
  hes right  youre wearing the tinfoil
  i call on you to prove that     weve made zero progress with north korea  any steps on that front have largely been taken by the south    helsinki was a dumpster fire and all putin seems to do these days is assassinate dissidents and act coy about it    the trade war succeeded in creating an unsustainable surge of panic buying which is now over as the stock markets routinely wobble by hundreds of points a day    nafta 20 has like 8090 the same provisions as its predecessor and the negotiations only really succeeded in pissing off canada which is a win in internet fights but not in foreign policy    and the eu has decided to access to trumps complaints about low military spending by developing their own army which means they wont buy guns from us anymore    and while i deliberately refrained from mentioning recent stuff we just had the debacle in france where he missed out on the 100th anniversary of armistice day    i cannot for the life of me think of a genuine foreign policy win from this administration
reminder that trump is doing nothing as president according to his own official schedule    
  any steps on that front have largely been taken by the south  who credited trump with making what theyre doing possible    i cannot for the life of me think of a genuine foreign policy win from this administration  denying hillary a chance to implement her foreign policy seems like a pretty consistent win
  who credited trump with making what theyre doing possible  citation needed  denying hillary a chance to implement her foreign policy seems like a pretty consistent win  so owning the libs is that all    you really think trump is going to go down in the history books on a positive note because he owned the libs
  hes  who do you think youre fooling take off that tinfoil buddy
  take off that tinfoil buddy  the irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife
  t npc
  case in point
  nno you  cringe
  let him stew in it he thinks hes getting somewhere
  citation needed    memory holed lololol    so owning the libs is that all  you really think trump is going to go down in the history books on a positive note because he owned the libs  owning the libs in this case meant not engaging in nuclear war with russia so yes
  owning the libs in this case meant not engaging in nuclear war with russia so yes  ppffffhhhhahahahahahahahhaa holy shit    if you actually think hillary  nuclear war ypu are really far gone she was a trash candidate but that is tinfoil tier
  desperately samefagging after getting btfo  yikes
  consider taking off your tinfoil hat
  consider taking off your tinfoil hat  the irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife
      sure it reddit terms here
  only one poster here is asserting a conspiracy against him in this very thread itself
    ive got to admire the mental fortitude of republicans if id elected trump and witnessed all his childish retardation id have offed myself in shame but they can even bear to show their faces in public
  prove that its indoctrination
  republicans live under the assumption that nothing is their fault and the concept of personal responsibility doesnt exist
  the concept of personal responsibility doesnt exist  they do believe in it just for everyone who isnt them
  nno you  yikes
hm
       go back to r/politics
    redditors confirmed crying  real america has nothing to lose with mississippi tomorrow since its expected the racists will win    but if they dont
    what are you retards on about
  like a flaming pussy
  youre going to need to explain how the literally most hotblooded go nagai literally on fire pro wrestler pokemon is a pussy    besides projecting anyway
  theres a board to talk about your cartoon pets kiddo the adults are speaking about politics now finish your vegetables and then you can go play on /vp/
  double entendres are hard
  sounds like youre bitter you lost
its a political strategy nearly as old as the thanksgiving holiday itself release the stories you want covered the least on the black friday in the hopes that no one will cover or read them    in this case the famously climatedenying trump administration decided that newsdump friday would be the best time to release a damning report about the already horrific effects of climate change worldwide    the federal government on friday released a longawaited report with an unmistakable message the effects of climate change including deadly wildfires increasingly debilitating hurricanes and heat waves are already battering the united states and the danger of more such catastrophes is worsening    the reports authors who represent numerous federal agencies say they are more certain than ever that climate change poses a severe threat to americans health and pocketbooks as well as to the countrys infrastructure and natural resources and while it avoids policy recommendations the reports sense of urgency and alarm stands in stark contrast to the lack of any apparent plan from president trump to tackle the problems which according to the government he runs are increasingly dire    the congressionally mandated document  the first of its kind issued during the trump administration  details how climatefueled disasters and other types of worrisome changes are becoming more commonplace throughout the country and how much worse they could become in the absence of efforts to combat global warming    but theres a funny thing about releasing major news on a holiday when by definition theres almost no other news the thing you wanted to be ignored tends to be the most important thing to cover and people have enough free time and boredom to actually read stories about it    
so it turns out that black friday became climate change day nearly every major newspaper led with an article about the report both cnn and msnbc covered the climate crisis more thoroughly than they have on most any other day    thats partly because the report itself is shocking and terrifying once again it bears repeating that climate change is a severe threat to most species on planet earth and to human civilization as we know it that we have very little time left to take the monumental action required to mitigate this threat and that it is already having devastating consequences climate change isnt a future problem its a current problem    the trump administration is no longer an effective communications apparatusif it ever was far be it from me to give them advice on how imperil most life on earthall to further enrich a few executivesbut trump and his allies would have been far better off unveiling the climate report on a wednesday with a number of other planned policy rollouts and distractions and perhaps an outrageous trump tweet or two    as it so happens after hours and hours of being pummeled on the severity of the climate threat coupled with trumps criminally irresponsible dismissal and neglect of the issue the administration put forward a typical distraction gambit by asking the supreme court to uphold their ban on transgender individuals serving in the military gratefully few media outlets took the bait
climate change remains far and away the top policy problem facing humanity outstripping all else when human beings and most flora and fauna cannot live on the vast majority of our planet anymore it hardly matters whose economic program was implemented or how resources were distributed we will all sink or swim together the fate of humanity depends on gathering the political will to take the actions necessary to save ourselves    thankfully the trump administration may have done us all a small inadvertent favor yesterday through its combined cowardice and incompetence
lets see the climate changer deniers spin their way out of this one unless he wants to go full retard like when he claims russia didnt attack america
  opening with that lewd image that is unrelated at a glance  i though we did the url split in order to avoid this sorta stuff from happening
  lets just skip straight to building zero dawn except without omega protocollevel bullshit
heartening to know that parts of the us government are still able to function properly and do the work they are paid to do without being censored it is certainly a terrifying report a much needed wake up call that will hopefully cut through all the partisan bullshit usually associated with the issue  its time to deal whatever your political stance otherwise  shame on the administration for attempting to bury such important information though cant wait for the inevitable spin
  why spin it when they can just continue to ignore it until people stop asking about it we wont get an administration that cares about fixing climate change until trump is out in 2020
you can release fake news on the pseudoscientific climate change any day of the year it doesnt change the fact that the sun is very weak lately and it will force us into a little ice age in a few decades
  and you are a retard
no solar activity will start to rise again soon it goes in 11year cycles no ice age coming but even more global warming coming compared to last couple of years
  of course meant for  
  weather / climate  that said extreme weather is a good indicator of a climate that is changing climate scientists predict that well have more extreme winter weather as a result of the arctic heating up  also the mini ice age so often referenced by grand solar minimum enthusiasts was actually not global and caused by volcanic activity not reduced sun activity  if we are experiencing lower solar radiation at the present its a good thing as it will counter the effects of agw that is the global increase in average temperature caused by greenhouse gasses emitted by humans since the industrial revolution  not by much though
  global warming was probably a pretty dumb term to use because it gave retards an out to say wow it is fucking cold guess global warming doesnt exist when extreme cold specifically is one of the results of global warming
  and trump actually did this over the weekend hence why you saw the shift from using global warming to climate change    but they should have created a more threatening name
  if they had called climate change barack obama the republicans would have been all over trying to prevent it
is this entire board the same eight people bumping dead topics and talking to one another
  hello /pol/ppet welcome to /news/   we hope you enjoy your stay in this little community please keep in mind that shitposting is prohibited here and you are not allowed to use strawman images like youre used to
  yeah i guess 30 odd years ago they didnt think thered be a backlash of lazy shilling and denial though likely believed that the science was enough to guarantee the subject was taken seriously
  back then it did used to be now people refuse to even agree on established facts
  feel free to offer an opinion fag
  climate scientists predict that well have more extreme winter weather    but extreme events are decreasing including hurricanes    the other part of your post has never been proved thats why its labelled a pseudoscience everything the ipcc is saying is coming from models and predictions change a little the input data and the models change the resulting predictions you can say whatever you want at that point nasa and noaa admitted theyve manipulated the climate records so    
  its a crazy time you think about the progress weve made with tech the connectedness of people worldwide via the net all the information we have at our disposal etc you think that would have made us smarter but no  all you have to do is read youtube comments for 1/2 hour to see how fucking dumb we are how were possibly fucked as a species because of it
    but the video posted is pretty much some mong claiming there were more extreme weather events recently that cold records were being broken etc  this was supposedly according to that fucking idiot down to a decrease in solar output and we were heading towards another ice age lel    and now you tell me these weather events arent even happening id debate your point but youve posted a link to a site that actually goes counter to what your claiming is actually full of dire predictions and reporting of extreme events  who the fuck are you even      and thats the problem debating with you guys  you never know who youre dealing with partly because theres no consensus youd think that since there were so fucking few of you youd be able to get it together and figure out something that worked all round but no youve all got your little corner  muh solar minimum or magnetic pole shift theory corner for some whackjobs fags on the rights are hunkering around outright denial that its happening at all and suggesting its all some kind of scam run by either elites or greedy academics and some are raking it in by skewing the data as they shill on behalf of the extract industry  its fucking hard to keep up with you guys really to know what brand of dumb cunt one is really dealing with
  there is no consensus  except there is except for the morally bankrupt scientists who are paid off by the fossil fuel lobby
  there is no consensus deal with it        
  notrickszone  site proven to publish lies          meanwhile from a non blog site that publishes lies  
    notrickszone  actually posts tricks  what did climate denying retards mean by this
  yeah great job self that was a good one  do you spend literally your whole life on this board just talking to yourself all the time you share literally 100 the exact same opinions of everyone else in this thread and then screech and scream like youve been raped when someone disagrees with you
  hello /pol/ppet welcome to /news/   we hope you enjoy your stay in this little community please keep in mind that shitposting is prohibited here and you are not allowed to use strawman images like youre used to
  iceagenowinfo  surely another bastion of credible journalism the handsome anon scoffed certain his sarcastic remark would go unappreciated by the /pol/tard
  says climate change research is pseudoscience  reads blogs by lawyers and businessmen to learn about climate change instead  lmao
  yeah and if you believe that ill take all your life savings for my 5000 stock market returns system
  what did climate denying retards mean by this  s e e t h i n g
  i fucking keked good job anon
  climate deniers are seething now everyone knows to blame them for the damage that happens
  follow the thread properly fuckface
  100 the exact same opinions   you seem flustered and a little bitter  people agreeing about things kinda burns you up a little i guess  must suck irl
  we live in a world where fucking polio has reappeared for the first time in decades because dipshit motherfuckers genuinely believe that vaccines turn frogs gay or whatever and let their kids run around like little agents of biological warfare
  do you think that may also be connected to the sudden increase in cases of acute flaccid myelitis
  probably not while they may appear similar its pretty easy to determine if someone has either polio or not polio  contracting polio is 100 preventable by vaccination
  follow your lies  no
  lel just read shit properly before you post you pillock
  except 97 of scientists agree this is real the other 3 are just paid off by dirty fuel industries
  yeah i actually made a similar assertion in the post you replied to  if you read the thread properly you would realize this
it is true that i did not hear a single thing about that transgender ban being brought up again so it seems like the media has finally stopped falling for trumps distractions    but how fucking sickening is it that this administration is so blatantly corrupt that they have to use transphobia to distract from climate change like a sane fucking individual wouldnt have to do this
  what the fuck else did you expect
  a sane individual would do exactly this dont play the angel
  url split is due to ads would be my guess
  hiro retard that he is literally posted yes when he was asked if it was so he could get more advertisers    doesnt matter to me anyway because i block all the ads ads have always been stupid even before they put in those garbage this looks like a news article but actually links to a site that will put a trojan on your computer ads i laugh out loud when i see a please whitelist our site  notice    also raijin is from a trated game theres nothing wrong with her
  if hiro was serious about getting new advertisers hed ban pepe from 4channer its a hate speech symbol and only used for shitposting
  theres a lot of things hiro could do better with this site i dont even care what they do with pepe but if he were really smart hed realize that /pol/ is singlehandedly using up 90 of the sites bandwidth and is the specific reason why people are scared to advertise on this site getting rid of it would be like removing a tumor    but moot the biggest moron on the planet specifically made a point of picking the one person who cared even less about this site than him hiro wants money but he doesnt want to do any work he will gladly ignore the site until it dies
  but moot the biggest moron on the planet  every twobit retard thinks he can create a wildly popular website but nobody actually does    hiro wants money but he doesnt want to do any work he will gladly ignore the site until it dies  and yet he does work on it anyway the same way most people dont like what they do for a living and do it anyway
  moots website only got popular because the users advertised it for him literally all he fucking did was copy 2chan thats not seriously your counterargument is it    he does work on it anyway  lol
  thats not seriously your counterargument is it  it is people with achievements to show are inherently more worthy of respect than people without any    lol  since taking over he has created a few boards /news/ itself is one of his pet projects dealt with a renegotiation with 4chans hosting provider set up a new image server talked with the feds dealt with hr issues switched out the ad provider installed a search engine and split the website into two separate domains none of this happens automatically they are all things you would expect the site owner/administrator to do
 change blah blah  whoop de shit the developed world will invent their way out of the problem while the developing world ie assorted lowiq populations will die out i personally cant wait to see multitudes of thirdworld peasants being gunned down at the border or having their shitty little boats get sunk on live tv this shit is going to be some quality entertainment
    its a political strategy nearly as old as the thanksgiving holiday itself release the stories you want covered the least on the black friday in the hopes that no one will cover or read them    the nonexistent president of the united states was posting international news releases in the 1600s a term made up in the 1960s was being used as a smoke screen in the 1800s what kind of fake news bullshit is this    the first thanksgiving was in 1621  the first official holiday thanks giving was in 1863  the first time black friday was recognized as a thing was in 1966     its ironic that david atkins last article is a diatribe about how to deal with trump era right wingers just making stuff up dude should take a step back and stop his own bullshit from spilling out all over the place
  but theres a funny thing about releasing major news on a holiday     also black friday isnt a holiday
  hahaha theres zero chance this will ever affect me  everyone else will just sit down and wait for starvation to kick in lmao  we can just shoot the few that try to get in and be done with it  the us is having a stroke just with a small caravan in normal times multiply it by a hundred and wonder if private ramirez will have the guts to shoot them the us wont suffer the devastation tropical countries will but take the current issues regarding immigration and give them amphetamines its in the interest of the us to slow down gw unless youre into social unrest because this can only get worse otherwise  watch this conference      or you could smile all smug and tell yourself that this is not your problem until it breaks down your door and you realize you should have come up with better policies 40 years ago
voters in taiwan have backed antigay marriage referendums in what lgbt activists said was a major blow to the islands reputation as a rights trailblazer    as well as voting for seats from village to city level there were 10 referendums on the ballot including pro and antigay marriage proposals    a referendum calling for marriage to only be recognised as between a man and a woman in taiwans civil code won more than 7m votes while another calling for samesex unions to be regulated under a separate law gained more than 6m    gay rights activists had proposed that the civil code should give samesex couples equal marriage rights but only garnered 3m votes    the coalition for the happiness of our next generation said the win was a victory of all people who treasure family values

former president barack obama once again disputed republicans attempts to take credit for the us economys recent strength    obama speaking at a midtermelection rally in nevada said monday that president donald trump and the gop should recognize just how long the current economy recovery has been going on and when the recovery began    so by the time i left office wages were rising the uninsured rate was falling poverty was falling and thats what i handed off to the next guy obama said so when you hear all this talk about economic miracles right now remember who started it    obama also zoomed out and pointed to historical trends in economic downturns as further evidence of democrats supposed advantage on economic issues    i do think its interesting i just hope people notice that every time theres a pattern where they run things into the ground and we have to come back and clean things up obama told a crowd in nevada    
i literally cannot believe the guy who championed obamacare is blaming republicans for anything the absolute fucking balls on this man
  you do realize obamacare would function a lot better if republicans didnt spend every waking moment trying to destroy it and have us revert to the old and much worse system right  hell one of the reasons we saw premiums rise up early on was because marco rubin sabotaged it by forcing the removal of high risk corridors look at that up    the ones who have the absolute balls are all these republicans claiming they want to protect peoples healthcare and pre existing conditions when they voted almost 40 times to appeal it and then make it so that insurance companies can jack up your rates or put you into high risk pools for thousands of dollars more
  oh yeah i personally love a system where in order to live i must purchase a product from a corpoation every single year or face penalties  i also absolutely loved how it drove my cost of insurance up nearly triple over a couple years really helps a middle class worker such as my self succeed in life
  blame the republicans for sabotaging the system then expect your premiums to get even higher now because of the republican tax cuts to the rich    or better yet be in favor of single payer so we can cut out the corporate middle men
  quick question if democrats were in favor of single payer why didnt they pass it when they had the chance could it be that all politicians dont give a shit about the common man regardless of what party they represent
  umm yeah because muh tax cutz to the rich n sheit totally have something to do with how much revenue insurance company a is collecting and how much coverage they have to provide
  yeah because bush and trump running the nation on credit cards for their corporate overlords is fucking so much better
hesrightyouknowjpg
  because republicans would filibuster everything obama needed 60 votes and single payer for all its benefits was enemy number one for the insurance industry pharmaceuticals and republicans they poured in money to conservative democrats to make sure single payer would never see the light of day  obama was an idiot negotiating though because he didnt start with single payer and then force people to settle for a public option or the idea that republicans would ever be in favor of anything when they put their party ahead of the common defense and general welfare of the country     at least now the party has evolved enough to where you will see a medicare for all push by the democrats to where if they do take power again theyre going to do that instead       the rich and corporations should all be taxed and insurance cut out of the process  republicans are against both
  is there anything the republicans are for that isnt status quo
  theyre arent the status quo though theyre much worse because now that theyve charged up the natons credit card giving away money to the rich they want to have the poor and middle class pay for it by destroying social security medicare and medicaid
  are you seriously implying that there arent a decent proportion of democrats who are also in the pocket of large corporations both sides have their fair share of shitty people who are only in it for themselves there is a reason why we have thousand page bills loaded with pork just to get them to even bother bringing it to vote
  if youre trying to make the argument theyre equally evil because youre a fucking moron if you are
  charged up the natons credit card  giving away money to the rich  the poor and middle class pay for it by destroying social security medicare and medicaid  none of that makes any sense whatsoever hows that gender studies degree working for you
  good and evil are rarely objective and the fact that you would pivot to such nebulous concepts as your go to description of something as complex as the political parties says a lot about you
  the fact that your response to the republucans in the pockets of corporations is effectively yeah so says even more about you
  charged up the nations credit card  we are in debt  giving away money to the rich  fuck it tho heres a tax cut rich folks  the poor and middle class pay for it by destroying social security medicare and medicaid  republicans would rather spend 700 billion on tanks than on the peoples medical care    lol you sound dumb get rekt libtard
  how is anon a moron for making that argument are you positively sure that democrats all democrats havent done/ are not still doing shady shit within the government
    you can tell obama is correct when an entire 4chan thread is just damage control and not refuting the point
  look to your own house first
    its standard right wing playbook     look at how bad government is when you purposely elect bad politicians
    both sides
  republicans are corrupt and greedy   so are democrats    you realize your argument is predicated on the premise of republicans being corrupt as true    its like someone walks up to you and says you sir are covered in mud and you respond by saying so are you     you have already accepted that you are covered in mud the rest is deflection and no it is not acceptable to be covered in mud
  all politicians at the national level are corrupt to some degree when you accuse one party of broad generalizations which hold true for the majority of politicians regardless of party it makes sense to call you out for being too narrow in application its like if someone covered in mud walks up to you and declares you sir are covered in mud      glass houses and all that shit m8
  are you saying the statement is wrong then are republicans corrupt or not    because i see a looooot of corrupt republicans
  im saying that the majority of politicians are greedy assholes and yes that includes both republicans and democrats dont let partisanship misdirect your righteous anger against abuse of power for personal gain
  my argument would be that current political representatives are corrupt indistinctively of their political spectrum     your analogy is quite strange and i dont really understand how it applies to your point     im not saying yeah well so are democrats since im not trying to defend nor justify the actions of republicans im saying both parties are involved in shady shit and have been doing so for a long time yet a lot of people insist on defending both parties and current political system
  i dont care about democrats theyre not in control    when you have a plane and someone is deliberately trying to crash it you dont get mad at the guy whose hand isnt on the stick
  all i see is the many sides argument trump used to defend nazis from you
  and all i hear from you is overly simplistic partisan drivel on complex issues
  its hard to argue complex points when any cogent idea gets a flurry of cuck npc gaslighting and whatever other technique you have for turning a debate into a screeching shitflinging monkey fight that day
  so you decide to bury yourself in the muck with the trolls instead of ignoring those whos sole goal is to piss you off keep giving what they want and theyll keep coming back for more
  so you admit its all your fault
  im not going to let them just dominate the airwaves and spew shit everywhere
  nor should you but surely there are better approaches than mimicking their toxic behaviour      i honestly have no idea how you came to that conclusion based on this conversation
  soon moshi
    being this mad  reminder that the choice for this election are you vote of america democrats or russia republicans
  itt obamacare would have worked if people didnt care about their right to not be forced to purchase things all these random things im talking about totally coordinated to stop this because my tinhat headcanon says so
disregard that i suck cocks
  small feminine cock only foolishly mad imposter
  disregard that    so much cock
  you do understand we are both just anons once again and you have achieved nothing i think you need an update
  hahahalol
  obama theres a pattern of the economy running into the ground several weeks before incumbent republican elections
  now this is a conspiracy theory
  yeah the system is rigged by (((tha juuuice)))  except when the economy is fine in which cause its all because of donald trumps very big abrain
  orange man bad
  thank you finally someone understands how dangerous this man is
  you think the gophers would try and time it better right    i mean theyre the ones giving out all these tax breaks and shit
  its hard for many too speak up because of the rampant fascism
  democrats had 60 seats the first 2 years of the obama administration
  i seriously wish all the fucking liberals democrats trannies fags and sjw would mass migrate to one side of the us and fuck off there and run their fucking side of the country into bedlam fuck it secession is the only way to get the fuck away from you goddamn cuck globalists
  ted kennedy had a brain tumor and lieberman is red on the inside
  move to montana
republicans are just cock suckers for 
two years since the election and not a single accomplishment by the republicans so all they can talk about is how they won the election    must be a sad life
  we did and now were the sixth largest economy in the world     california
  muh economy   muh highest homeless population  muh shit filled streets  muh rampant addicts  muh rampant fires   muh rampant failed gun control
  obamacare was originally a republican idea it came from the heritage foundation romney put it into effect when he was governor
  fifth    homeless pop is because fucking flyovers keep speculating on our real estate shit filled streets is only san fran i have no idea where youre getting the addicts thing from and im with you on gun control  seriously i tried looking up the addiction numbers and every article i could find breaking it down by state had california in the lowest quartile per capita
  obamacare would function a lot better if republicans didnt spend every waking moment trying to destroy it    sigh why are liberals always so delusional    obamacare was structured to force healthy people to subsidize the health care of unhealthy people it was denied by obama that this mandate was a new tax courts have ruled otherwise what it really was designed to do was to create a cash cow of donations from the health insurance companies to democrat coffers   democrats made health insurance a mandate  meaning govt fines if you do not comply    if obamacare was working as democrats envisioned the irs right now would be collecting millions in fines from people companies and individuals who have not purchased obamacare gop stopped that    you are welcome
  i tried looking up the addiction numbers and every article i could find breaking it down by state had california in the lowest quartile per capita    sorry i thought you were lying touting ca success so i went to the cdc center for disease control the us gov agency responsible    yup you were what shocked me the most were the percentage increases this is a national crises    open borders will not solve this problem  good border controls can help lies and sticking our heads in the sand will not    ca does not collect or report their data very well see here            
  obamacare was structured to force healthy people to subsidize the health care of unhealthy people  you realize thats what insurance is right    its true that the aca makes everyone get insurance thats to discourage free riders people that would take advantage of insurance companies being required to cover everyone to get coverage only when they need it if enough people do that then the companies go out of business and no one gets coverage obamacare has other parts too though it also forces insurance companies to provide many more services for the average person not just medical procedures but it also banned price caps on coverage so insurance companies couldnt cover you only up to a certain level and then left you to die it also banned discrimination against individual based on their medical history and preexisting conditions so insurance companies would have to actually cover people that are    aside from the parts that affect private insurance companies the aca also greatly expanded medicaid coverage many millions of people were automatically made eligible for medicaid as long as their state took the funds from the federal government this gave millions of people a second option on top the private insurance market of course many republican states immediately opted not to take the funds though but a lot of states did
  oh yeah i personally love a system where in order to live i must purchase a product from a corpoation every single year or face penalties  i also absolutely loved how it drove my cost of insurance up nearly triple over a couple years really helps a middle class worker such as my self succeed in li    then make sure you drop your car insurance
  if democrats were in favor of single payer why didnt they pass it when they had the chance  the votes for it were in the house but the dems in the senate were a lot more conservative at the time and a few of them didnt support a public option one in particular joe lieberman an independent that caucused with the democrats threatened to filibuster any proposal that included a public option
  i also absolutely loved how it drove my cost of insurance up nearly triple over a couple years  insurance premiums were expected to go up considerably no matter what and under the aca premiums slowed considerably
  wolverines
      ive been around for a long time and it just seems that the economy does better under the democrats than the republicans  t donald trump
  traitors democrats or other traitors republicans  vote third party/independent
fuck obumer  fucking closet issi goatfuckin scumbag traitor 8 years of sabotaging the usa  he should be in prison in a cell right next to hillbilly clinton  his seahag wife  his entire administration of traitors to this country should be hanged
dont be a real traitor like this guy   a vote for third party is a vote for putin
  that loops back around to whether an independent vote is worth anything or even worse if its like a vote for the opposition definitely not the case if someone wouldnt have voted at all
  excellent answer you also need to add that there were more people paying into the fines then they were legitimate cases of new insurance coverage more people lost their insurance than were covered more people lost their jobs because companies could not afford to pay the employee insurance for fulltime people most people work two or three parttime jobs or they went into the system to get because it was the only way to survive obama tried his best using the sal alinsky method to bankrupt the nation into socialism large majority of that debt we have went into private pockets
    it really depends where you live if you are in a deep blue/red state a vote for an independent to try and raise their national percentage high enough to qualify for equal representation could be a great use of a vote if you dislike the party which dominates your state however in a battleground state it is much harder to justify voting third party over picking the lesser of 2 evils
    id rather be poor in california with social benefits and warm weather than north dakota     disenfranchised people live in liberal areas because theyre most helped out by them the fact that red areas cannot and do not want to bear societies burden of low income citizens is telling that theyre failed areas supported by the notion of their subsidization from blue cities
  more people lost their insurance than were covered more people lost their jobs because companies could not afford to pay the employee insurance for fulltime people  its amazing how people can blandly repeat complete bullshit like theyre established facts and then use them to build a worldview relying completely on said complete and utter bullshit    
  history is not going to be kind to obama dont look for a person of color to occupy the oval office for at least 50 years  100 years if youre talking about a woman of color
  because theyre not interested in single payer the democrats are deeper into the pockets of the multinationals than the republicans are  by far
    says the president who spent more than the previous four presidents combined i love this logic that you can spend spend and spend like you have unlimited credit but when republicans help americans business interests they are ruining the economy
  says the president who spent more than the previous four presidents combined  not even remotely close to true
  conservatism not even once
  butthurt /pol/ppet detected   you must go back
    its telling how old some of the kids are on this board when they dont know why were drawing massive expenditures     are you fucking 16 or something were you like you six years old when the economy crashed
    cletus your mom is almost finished with your chicken tendies go upstairs have a good day in middle school tomorrow
  what complete dumbass puts the government in charge of something expecting it to become more affordable only free markets drive down prices
  lets cut the government completely out of healthcare dumbass no medicare no medicaid watch prices fall as patients negotiate directly with their doctor over services
  like obama running the nation on credit cards for george soroslel
  the bottom 50 of taxpayers only pay 3 of all taxes your opinion is invalid
  want to know who crashed the economy back in 2008 look at fannie mae and freddie mac  handing out mortgages to people who did not qualify for them google franklin raines and jaime goerelick raines actually received big fat bonuses for handing out so many mortgages so how did the federal government get into the mortgage lending business thats what crashed the economy including community organizers like acorn who would threaten to take banks to court unless they gave more mortgages to minorities
  they do but they also earn only 13 of the money which is also totally shit
  you do realize trump has massively increased the deficit during a fucking economic boom right this is just pants on head level of retardation if youre accusing democrats for deficit spending during a recession why the fuck would that suddenly become okay to do during a boom thats when you should be paying back that debt with the increased tax revenue but trump fucked that up by saying the wealthy and corporations no longer have to pay as much tax as the rest of us
  none of the pages say anything about california  i wouldnt lie about being shitty at googlefu i dont even know how you found those articles the cdc sites search function is unhelpful as hell
  i dont think history will be kind to any president after eisenhower and i think that bush obama and trump will receive as much vilification as harding coolidge and hoover
  seeing as how healthcare will literally save your life i dont expect patients to be in a good negotiating positions
  assuming all the previous figures from the last two posts are accurate it sounds like the bottom 50 should pay 15 of the taxes and the top 50 should pay 85 of the taxes which still equates to rich people paying less tax and poor people paying more
  the minority still has considerable power even when the majority is in power its designed that way to prevent the majority shitting on the minority filibustering is a favorite tool of mitch mcconnell  moreover many republicans/democrats politicians are in states that dont match their alignment so they vote for things that would help their reelection this is why the kavanaugh vote was so close despite technically having a republican majority hell my last dem senator was hugely in favor of most dem policies except gun control she was very pro 2nd
    because the dems are republicanlight nowadays and health insurance companies are big doner
  well not for much longer we finally have some new blood running for office next few elections will be vital to the democrats
  the thing is most people on here are fairly smart they already know the economy started all this growth under obama but they wont admit it because thats the nature of politics and choosing sides     i say thank god if the economy is good all trump has to do is stay the course and we will all be fine he can try and take credit but only simple minded people with short memories will believe him
  local politician sill bewildered as to why people prefer paying their bills and buying food with more money theyre able to earn and keep  doesnt understand why they cant just pay bills news stories about how well the economy is doing thanks to said politician
  this is why the kavanaugh vote was so close despite technically having a republican majority  no its because republicans have a conscience and vote according to it instead of turning a senatorial event into a nationwide media shitshow and holding party lines
  thanks i needed a laugh
  no its because republicans have a conscience  ahahahahahaha  joke of the day
   obamacare was structured to force healthy people to subsidize the health care of unhealthy people  and of course healthy people never develop cancer get into a car accident or get shot by some nutjob at a jewish temple right
  blame the republicans for sabotaging the system then    your people are the ones that forced the insurance companies on us faggot    democrat trash had their chance
  why are leftists so uninformed    your precious entitlements are the reason we have so much debt
  the rich and corporations should all be taxed    they fucking are what you mean is that we should steal even more money from them to pay for your utopian fuckery
  steal  all money is owned by the respective government
  your precious entitlements are the reason we have so much debt  everytime we have a democratic president we reduce the budget deficit and simultaneously take care of our people every time republicans have power the deficit explodes and we drastically reduce protections offered to the american worker while marginally increasing the wealth of corporations      they fucking are what you mean is that we should steal even more money from them to pay for your utopian fuckery  taxes could be set to 0 or 100 the number by itself isnt important what matters is designing policy in a way that ultimately gives equitable consideration to the freedom of all were asking those we recognize as owning the most in our society to contribute marginally more so the rest of us are allowed drastically improved freedom and social mobility it doesnt even have to add to our budget deficit our private market for health insurance is very inefficient we pay more than any other country on a per capita basis and still fail to make healthcare affordable for all
why cant you collectivist faggots simply move to europe
  the chronically injured or high risk patients soak up resources from health insurance leaving little to help low risk patients or those with acute injuries like you described
  most fiscal policies have a rollout period that tends to end some time into the next presidency so saying democrat good republican bad is a bit too simplistic given the fruits of their policies dont bear until well down the line for example there are still provisions of the aca which havent taken effect yet despite being signed 8 years ago
  muh magic wand
  id rather be poor in california with social benefits and warm weather than north dakota    so you would rather be a leech got it
  doesnt understand why they cant just pay bills news stories about how well the economy is doing thanks to said politician  yeah this sentence is complete nonsense and explains why you were stupid enough to think the previous sentence is a good argument
  the absolute state of southern californians in this post    meteor showers and tidal waves when
  well lincoln ran the southern economy to the ground so there is that at least
  bullshit these pricks are delusional  they fucking lie so much they believe their on bullshit soon q they will be in orange  obumer traitorous dogshit
  facts not bullshit all you lefties believe your on bullshit  you are full of it
  ya because thats what they told you right you fucking mushroom
        all this damage control  this is why you just lost the house the next two years are not gonna be fun for you
  i dont know if a spergout on one of the least populated boards on the website counts as damage control i hope that guy has meds he can take
  the presidents party has done badly during midterm elections every midterm for the last forty years except in 98 and 02
  yeah it has nothing to do with the gop increasing spending while also lowering taxes im not shocked magatards cant into basic math
  are you implying we had no debt prior to the tax cuts they certainly didnt help matters but to make it out like they are the cause is bonkers the problem as i see it though is that no party is really incentivized to stop spending in any meaningful way sure they all make claims to be but when push comes to shove they drag their feet cutting programs in any meaningful way to reduce spending is politically suicidal as is raising taxes to cover them as they currently stand there is just a no win situation and the budget will continue to get worse and worse until it is unsustainable
  this level of cope  six more years ahahahaha
  several republican bastions were almost turned blue you know including texas
  yes im telling that poster that he will have to deal with six more years of democrat control of the house honestly theres not actually an upper limit but i decided six was a good number    like anyone trying to downplay this loss doesnt seem to understand that congress is passing jack fucking shit from now on any chance trump had to affect this country is now gone and in two years when beto orourke runs for president since he wont have to worry about serving a senate term trump is going to get absolutely clobbered
  dont use roll for your shit shill threads you swine
  thought you were talking about 6 more years of trump sorry about that
  cant win governor   but he can win presidency guys  i didnt know this was idiotic pipe dreams the thread   and the republicans can downplay this loss all they want remember dems only lead by eight seats they were projected to get majority control of the house   eight seats isnt enough to block jack shit even if all of the democrats roll around on the floor and shit themselves for the next two years the entire base of resist progressives has been undercut and all that remains are the moderates     like it or not this is a fucking lose a big l for the democrats you may as well celebrate for getting second place at this point because at least you won the best sportsmanship trophy
  senate my bad i confused your progressive loser for another progressive loser
  wages where rising   while hours where falling resulting in a net loss of income for the working class and having the joy of being forced to shove an 8 hour workday into 5 and a half hours with no fucking benifits    uninsured rate is falling  all while prices are though the the roof and policies cover less then ever before    poverty was falling  ya by the are you paid more then 12k a year metric meanwhile over 50 of the homeless have jobs and you want to tell me poverty was falling lmao      fuck you obama you disingenuous little shit
  obama 18 growth is awesome  trump let me show you how its done 3 growth heh nothing personal kid
  uber and walmart are real sustainable jobs    neither of them grew shit
  obamacare was structured to force healthy people to subsidize the health care of unhealthy people  i dont think you understand how insurance works   what it really was designed to do was to create a cash cow of donations from the health insurance companies to democrat coffers  right liberals are the delusional ones
  i think the pay of redundant insurance company ceos probably played a bigger role in leaving little for the healthy people when they ended up being chronically sick/injured      its amazing to me that people ignore how much money insurance companies waste in redundant bureaucratic structures    in the presently commerciallyrun insurance system  how many companies are there  how many companies are runfor profit how many notforprofit  of those companies  how many employees do they have  how much do they cost those companies  how much profit is generatedforprofit only    total it up for commerciallyrun for profit and commerciallyrun notforprofit companies  then look into/think about a scenario where medicareforall citizens might be plausibly passed  what is the current cost of running medicare or medicaid in the present in terms of the number of workers the government needs to hire in order to sort through paperwork   how many more employees would the government need to hire to take on the extra burden  does this money exceed the overall money spent on employees/administration in the presently existing commercialhealthinsurance
    ha ha we lost thirty seats in the house but we still win  i just knew you trumptards were dumb enough to try and spin this into a win even getting your asses kicked isnt enough to wake you up    youre not getting a single thing done from now on accept it now and it will be easier for you later
  you sound mad you cant come up with a counterargument
  even getting your asses kicked isnt enough to wake you up  just like how almost every president for the last forty years also got their ass kicked during the midterms    remember when obama lost 60 seats in his first midterm
  iit happens all the time i swear     anything to paint a loss as a win right
  welcome to reddit the board
  likewise
    when you lose you win
  iit happens all the time i swear   it literally does happen all the time you dont have to take my word for it you can look at the numbers for yourself if you dont believe me    the numbers put up today were not remarkable and theres no compelling reason the republicans should wake up after getting their asses kicked when obama got his ass kicked over twice as hard
  because this asskicking was after the gerrymandering that republicans started in 2010 they made it nearly impossible to lose in texas and florida and they still just barely beat gillum and orourke    i know you guys are desperate to spin anything into still being a win for your side but you look incredibly stupid when you just say bbut obama without considering all the other variables that led to this by modern standards this is a great result for the dems honestly there is absolutely no metric by which you can paint losing the house as a good thing it was bad when it happened to obama and it was bad when it happened to trump the fact that he lost it by less seats changes nothing  he still fucking lost it    and thats not even factoring in the 2020 senate race where republicans are defending over 20 vulnerable seats where democrats only have to defend a mere 8 i hope someday you realize that politics does not exist in a vacuum but based on your reaction to this election i suppose its not happening any time soon
  because this asskicking was after the gerrymandering that republicans started in 2010 they made it nearly impossible to lose in texas and florida and they still just barely beat gillum and orourke  those republicans really did a neat trick gerrymandering statewide races in texas and florida its truly amazing how they managed to redraw the borders of their states without anyone noticing    i know you guys are desperate to spin anything into still being a win  not once did i say it was a win i said it was unremarkable for a midterm election    it was bad when it happened to obama and it was bad when it happened to trump the fact that he lost it by less seats changes nothing  he still fucking lost it  yes but you didnt comment that he lost which nobody disputes you tried to paint it as some sort of watershed event getting your asses kicked isnt enough to wake you up    i hope someday you realize that politics does not exist in a vacuum  the irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife
  this was the most seats lost by republicans since 1974    sit down and shut up
  this was the most seats lost by republicans since 1974  oh no the republicans lost 30 of the 70 seats they gained under obama its the end of the world    sit down and shut up  im sure it would be convenient for you if people didnt point out the monstrously stupid things you say but ill pass thanks    i also like how you completely ignored that you accused republicans of winning statewide elections through gerrymandering its like youve got nothing inbetween your ears
  the actual house numbers are mostly back to where they started at the beginning of obamas term
    obamacare  government spending and national debt nearly doubled  interest rates increasing despite high cooperate taxes  took a lot of time off and lived luxoriously off of your tax dollars  gave the middle finger to the industries that make our economy work  supported the suggested bush bailout for banks    nah youre delusional if you think that our governments rampant spending actually depends on the party to begin with theyve been drunk with a pretty big credit card in their pocket ever since the gold standard was abolished but go ahead tell everyone how your favorite team is doing less of a worse job at stagnating the economy and writing ious to other countries

one should go independent instead
  afaik its to keep deadbeats who can afford insurance who will eventually need healthcare but refuse to get it from just then getting injured and others having to cover the cost of that uninsured persons injuries    if you cant afford it youre exempt anyway
  poor people literally dont have an income worth or able to tax many poor people pay no taxes because they just make so little already anyway what youre essentially doing is taking a simpletons logic to something thats very complex    the top  of entities utilize and benefit from the larger population so a flat tax treating corporations the same as individuals quickly falls apart
  medicaid and medicare are only for eligible individuals who need protection elderly disabled and children youre saying you think the healthcare market will fix itself if the social safety net dissolves which i dont see any indication that would happen    why are republicans so sociopathic that they care more about money than the lives of their fellow humans to want to cut off the helpless from care just for the sake of profit and a hunch that prices would be lower just comes across as honestly fucking evil
  thats a really weird way of spelling pragmatism
  fun fact jesus went around healing people for free conservatives should try reading that bible they love so much maybe wed get more commies like their christ was
  google the gospel of supplyside jesus
    lincoln lost a senate race and ran for president and won
  this    also the mandate wouldnt even be an issue if we just had a medicareforall system its doable and would only lower costs for everyone of course you coyld have a private option if you absolutely must pay out the ass for insurance or feel like a supplementary plan coverage would vary depending on income obviously but no ones taxes would need to go up except corporations in that regard id just raise it to the pretrump 35 corporate gains rate and add a cut to defense spending on top of it
  completely the opposite actually the aca accelerated the rise in premium costs    in each case the increases differed among age groups with families headed by those under 30 and over 50 generally being hit the hardest by the aca premiums increases however once we remove the selfsorting into different plan types and average each age group and household type ie family or individual the results are very consistent  in the four years before the aca every age group and family type either experienced a premium decrease or an increase of 92 or less however in the first four years of the aca every age group and household type experienced an increase of between 560 and 632 for something as complex as health care thats a pretty narrow range the dollar amounts of the increase varied from 2524 for an individual between the ages of 31 and 40 to 12040 for a family headed by someone over age 60 but the percentages are remarkably consistent the aca raised premiums by about 60 percent             enrollment in individualmarket coverage is now declining despite tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies   the number of small firms offering health benefits to their workers dropped by 24 percent between 2012 and 2016   premiums for individual coverage more than doubled between 2013 and 2017 and rates rose again in 2018
i tend to be very critical of what i call lazy centrism this isnt to be confused with being a moderate or a centrist i know plenty of people who give lots of thought to political issues or are very well educated on them and come to the conclusion that the best policies they support happen to be ones that we would consider more moderate or centrist hillary clinton for example had a number of policies  that whether your agreed with them or not  were very well thought out and borne from critical thought    however you also have the lazy centrists who dont give issues any critical thought but instead see one passionate group on the right and one passionate group on the left and rationalize that if both groups are this passionate and extreme that they are wise and great arbiters who are more reasonable than either side if they embrace a solution in the middle this takes no critical thought and is a lazy way of thinking and avoiding any agency or decision making its an obvious fallacy with extreme example  republicans want to lock up all undocumented immigrant children in cages and democrats want to lock none of them in cages so the wisest answer must be to lock half of them in cages however even when less obvious its still absurd  republicans want the free market to determine health care outcomes and democrats want universal healthcare provided as a right  therefore the best solution is some hybrid wackadoodle system that makes little sense
  this is more conmonly known as the golden mean fallacy its best illustrated by one of the fables of king solomon one woman wants the baby so does another so clearly the correct solution is to split the baby    i agree what we see in the sphere of politically active citizens is generally four groups    1 people on the right in the us this would be loyalist republicans theres probably a common term for people who always vote red but i dont know it    2 people on the left this one i do know yellow dog democrats who will vote for anything that bears a d the term originates in the anticivil rights southern democratic party so its a bit of an anachronism in comparison to the party of today but ive heard modern dems use it so there ya go    3 moderates and independents no loyalty but the union itself a wideranging group with wideranging values they dont usually identify as centrist preferring other terms    4 centrists the more accurate term would be the uninformed and/or uncaring who either vote mindlessly based on the most recent political ad or as you describe use a fallacious position of compromise to out themselves on a pedestal    im honestly not sure where i am to be honest either 2 or 3  i would like to say id vote for a republican if it was a good one but ive never seen such a thing
  utopian  social services being paid for by taxes is something that happens in the eu china japan canada aus/nz its practical its pragmatic
  but go ahead tell everyone how your favorite team is doing less of a worse job at stagnating the economy and writing ious to other countries  voting for the lesser of 2 evils while trying to get better politicians elected is the only way to improve the system both sides are not the same    
mia farrow seems like a hypocrite to me
  agree liberals are inherently worse than right wingers and must be kept out of power
  remember all of the clinton scandals over those eight years resulted in one felony conviction every republican administration since nixons been well past that
  with his beard no less
the obamas have become really pathetic since theyve left office have you seen obama speak lately hes stuttering 30x more and seems drunk
  so bill clinton still raped a woman and hillary still hosted a private email server which she destroyed along with other devices    obama still doubled the national debt
  cringe
  no one can compete with trumps words hes got the best words hes got words like you wouldnt believe hugely bigly believe me nobody has words like trump and all the best people say so
    yikes
  im not going to claim all that shit was because of obama   it probably isnt   but it is true the trend started during his presidency
  supported the suggested bush bailout for banks  the fact that you list this as a negative is psychotic
  but it is true the trend started during his presidency  not even this is true it started during gwbs presidency
  so this is the epic debating powers of a republitard who cant post his precious memes
  trumps america first policies are working out and cuck sellouts for third world shitholes are buttblasted
  are working out  prove that
  prolly not working out by your standards because your standard of success is selling out the country commy socialist queers are only satisfied when theyre getting fucked in the ass
  not an argument
  if you werent buttblasted you could come up with a rebuttal
  youre obsessed with the anus
  if i was obsessed with the anus id be an obummer drone
  thinks party politics matters    big corporations love socialism too how do you think walmart and amazon get away with paying their employees minimum wage
  obummer  lol rightard wit
  just like how john olivers incisive and devastating labeling of trump as drumpf singlehandedly won hillary the election
  labeling  
  whoa man thats deadnaming you cant do that    millions of starving conservative children were banned from twitter for doing just this last week
  gets btfo  deflects with some unrelated nonsense  the absolute state of you
  gets btfo  drumpf has literally never been trumps name its a relatives name which was popularized as a meme by latenight and failed to do anything to stop trumps presidency        deflects with some unrelated nonsense  its literally deadnaming its really difficult comprehend the kind of complete fucking moron who cant see the relation
  but seriously why are you so mad    there is that stupid enough for your tiny brain to comprehend
i remember looking at the comments for an angel beats video on youtube and there was a comment by barack obama saying something like i cried like a bitch    the man has great taste
  not an argument
  trump himself admitted that his name was drumpf in his book trump think like a billionaire    funny how these socalled trump lovers havent even read his own book
  trump did literally no such thing in that book nor anywhere else    funny how these socalled trump lovers havent even read his own book  your complete bullshit claim notwithstanding have you read any of hillary clintons books in full
  feds keep interest rates flat under obama  feds raise interest rates under trump  some pattern you got there sport
      aaaaaaaaaaand you just got btfo    if you were smart youd leave but i know youre not smart so youll keep responding
  your source in literally zero fucking places ever cites trump admitting his name was drumpf    if you were smart youd leave but i know youre not smart so youll keep responding  its true that if i were smart i wouldnt be spending any time dealing with a lying sack of shit who has never once debated anything in good faith    lets look at your quote   trump himself admitted that his name was drumpf  lets look at your source   at any rate neither trump nor his father ever bore the surname drumpf    youre an absolutely fucking incredible fake news peddler who doesnt even read the sources he cites himself what a piece of shit human being you are
  citing snopes  ever
  dont be a real traitor like this guy   a vote for third party is a vote for putin    shareblue you really cant get get past the muh russia nonsense can you
  obama was the worst leader we ever had glad he is gone cant wait till we have a actual good black president he was a joke and before anyone responds list what good things he did other then fucking the us over i also want a simple list dipshit not a self centered explanation
  your ridiculous canned shitpost is not a good excuse for being a literal and complete fucking liar    you lied you then cited a source and lied about what was in it youre an absolute shitstain own it
  keep denying reality deluded cultist
  you didnt even read your own fucking source
  how does lying benefit you
  i literally quoted from the source you provided verbatim    you ignored it
  youre not even worth responding to if youre just going to keep lying
  your the snopes link that you provided states at the bottom at any rate neither trump nor his father ever bore the surname drumpf
  read it again trump admits his familys name was originally drumpf and it was changed before it reached him
  snopes  literally a website ran by an obese cat lady and her beta boyfriend  yikes
  holy shit this is fucking groundbreaking  how will drumpf ever recover
  that correct the trump ancestral family name was drumpf ive never contested this point even once what i said is that    1 its never been the name of the current occupant of the white house donald trump  2 its a dead name no longer in use  3 trump never once admitted that how name used to be drumpf    ive consistently made accurate statements in this thread and youve consistently lied
  this is literally the npc answer anytime obama gets blamed for obamacare so predictable and typical have you ever considered the republicans saved americans from an ever worse version of obamacare
  its the republicans fault that we have to pass the legislation before we can read it t democrat minority leader nancy pelosi    fuck you they knew exactly what they were doing the whole reason the legislation had built in delays was to spread out the shock to the economy and make it seem like the problems it created were someone elses fault
  something that bothered me looking at the wikipedia page for his ancestor wasnt their preimmigration surname trumpf not drumpf  
  could it be that all politicians dont give a shit about the common man regardless of what party they represent  id definitely agree with that
obama is a dumb nigger
  this dumb nigger also claimed manufacturing jobs are never coming back and gdp growth of above 2 is a thing of the past

  id resist the temptation to put all the blame solely on the commies the dpp has also fucked up hard south has no reason to love the communists china or kmt so it has even less reason to vote for the kmt    dpp had to have fucked up hard for this swing against them

  if by society you mean die in a forest fire with a dildo up your ass then yes
  its mostly republican rural or rich areas of california that burned down    faggots win again
  so what youre saying is that we should be hoping for is an earthquake strong enough to tear the san andreas fault a new one looks like that wish will be granted in the next 50 years
keep it clean

    los angeles ap  the los angeles district attorney declined to prosecute attorney michael avenatti on felony domestic abuse charges on wednesday and referred allegations that he roughed up his girlfriend to the city attorney for a possible misdemeanor case    avenatti 47 was arrested on suspicion of felony domestic violence last week after his girlfriend told police he abused her at his los angeles apartment following an argument    a restraining order against avenatti was issued after actress mareli miniutti said he dragged her by the arm across a bedroom floor    avenatti who had called the allegations completely false and a fabrication said in a statement he was thankful the district attorney had rejected the charges and was especially grateful for justice at thanksgiving    i am completely innocent i have absolute faith in the system that i will be fully exonerated avenatti told the associated press this whole thing is bogus    a spokeswoman for the district attorney would not say why prosecutors declined to take the case from los angeles police documents supporting the decision were not released because the case was referred to the city attorney and was still under investigation    the city attorneys office will review the case a spokesman said    avenatti who is mulling a presidential run is best known as the attorney for porn actress stormy daniels who has said she had an affair with president donald trump in 2006 a claim trump denies    as daniels lawyer avenatti has pursued the president and those close to him relentlessly for months taunting trump in interviews and baiting him and his lawyers in tweets
miniutti said in her request for a restraining order that she was wearing only a tshirt and underwear when avenatti grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out of the bed she said she was scratched on her side and leg court papers include photographs that appear to show bruises    the order was granted monday    attorneys for the legal aid group that represents miniutti declined to comment    avenatti said that he would be vindicated once footage from security cameras in the building was reviewed even though the violence described by miniutti would not have occurred in the buildings public areas        the people behind this hit job were jacob wohl and surefire intelligence the same people that tried to set up a smear job against robert mueller where they were trying to pay women off to claim mueller sexually harassed or assaulted them expect to see avenatti go after them once hes done with trump

  why didnt republicans believe ford then kavanaugh is clearly a rapist and yet made sure he wasnt probably investigated
  because partisan politics seem to be an excuse to ignore the law
  kavanaugh is clearly a rapist  clear as mud
  its only muddy because the republicans did everything to sabotage the search for the facts  only criminals do that
  its only muddy because the republicans did everything to sabotage the search for the facts  yeah like invite ford to testify although her lawyers failed to deliver the message and she only found out during the hearing that she had been invited weeks prior but the senate never received a response  and then that fbi investigation they ordered was downright dirty  faggots were trying to hard to get away with it
  they then crippled the fbi investigation and refuses to let the fbi interview every witness and they wanted to force the nomination like kavanaugh forces himself on women before flake threw a wrench into the plan but it was still a fake investigation to give the republicans smoke to go forward    sabotaged investigation    we should also look into all the stories of the victims of trumps sexual assaults while were at it
  they then crippled the fbi investigation and refuses to let the fbi interview every witness  the only witnesses not interviewed were kavanaugh and ford neither of which were likely to reveal anything new or interesting under fbi questioning
  the only    stopped reading there  
  not a single one of these potential sources is an actual witness
  potential sources are not witnesses and some have admitted to lying already
    back peddling  the fbi should have still questioned them to see if their information matched up they didnt because it was a clearly the investigation was never meant to find the truth
  if you were there you have important and relevant witness information that should be yielded to the fbi if you werent there youre an evidentiarily worthless parrot good only for repeating shit someone told you the fbi wouldnt have interviewed those extra witnesses in any actual criminal investigation and they didnt do so here     back peddling  the only one backpedaling here is you i stand 100 by my original statement the only witnesses not interviewed were kavanaugh and ford you on the other hand have backpedaled away from your original claim about witnesses not being interviewed and have now decided that the fbi should have interviewed a huge number of random people just because    if the report is such a sham why has not a single democrat called for it to be released and seen for what it is instead theyre just as happy as the republicans to have the report sealed away indefinitely if you want transparency you should ask to see the report maybe you can have the fbi agents who interviewed witnesses and drafted it hauled in front of the house judiciary committee on january 4 when the democrats can do that shit im all for it lets rehash the issue in front of america again and see if all those women should be believed and for the record we have at least one woman confirmed to have perjured herself and zero women confirmed to have been telling the truth
  youre just mincing words now in who can and cant be interviewed the fact remains there were sources and witnesses who should have been interviewed but werent you can keep clinging to witness but that doesnt change the fact the fact the fbi and republicans left plenty on the table          if the report is such a sham why has not a single democrat called for it to be released and seen for what it is  because republicans covered it up refused to let it be released publically and only had one copy created where you could only review it without any assistance   cant blame the democrats when it was the republicans in a full press cover up for kavanaugh
  someone gets arrested  disctrict attorney decides what charges to file and which ones not to file  republican smear campaign  faggot
  youre just mincing words now  youre literally fabricating words out of thin air the fbi interviewed all actual witnesses they didnt interview your sources and bullshit hearsay/character witnesses of zero value whatsoever    he fact remains there were sources and witnesses  all of which were secondhand sources and evidentiarily worthless    because republicans covered it up refused to let it be released publically  so did the democrats    cant blame the democrats when it was the republicans in a full press cover up for kavanaugh  i can and am blaming the democrats for not even calling for the document to be released which they do literally all the time from the minority position and to which effect theyve released countless committee minority reports the democrats literally do not want it to be released
  how many people reported to the fbi that they had information on who really killed kennedy  how many did the fbi interview
  all actual witnesses  no they didnt they didnt interview multiple witnesses and sources     all of which were secondhand sources and evidentiarily worthless  you dont know that    so did the democrats and i can blame them  actually you cant since the republicans only created one copy of the fbis findings and put it in a sealed room where democrats were only allowed to review it my themselves try and make it public that way without break senate rules and not being the one implicated this was entirely on the republicans and their cover up

a cow who stands at 6 feet 4 inches and weighs more than 3000 pounds has been saved from the slaughterhouse because of his size the 7yearold holstein friesian steer named knickers was found too big to pass through a processing facility when his owner tried to put him up for auction last month    he was always a standout steer from the others a bit bigger than the rest pearson told the bbc despite other members of knickerss herd being sent to the slaughterhouse pearson decided to let knickers stay on the feedlot as hes not hurting anyone however after a while with the steer continuing to grow pearson has now discovered knickers is just too big to sell    the biggest living steer in the world is a chianina ox named bellino who was more than 6 feet 7 inches tall when he was measured in rome italy in 2010    
  they need to start breeding
looks delicious 
  i wonder if babe the ox was based on a real giant grayblue cow
steer      whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
  educate a city mouse whats the issue here
    a steer much like yourself there city mouse has had its balls removed to render it tame and docile    which means this beautiful boy cant be used as a stud     what a waste of good genes
  not him but im guessing they castrated it before they realized it would be the cow equivalent of an nba player
  this  why hasnt anyone thought of that before
  surely they can science up some genetics shit to impregnate a cow    im sure theres many big farms that would pay for that
unit  n  i  t
  well no cause hes too huge to fit in the murder machine
  if you can supersize your fries you can supersize cow slaughter
  meanwhile we get the internets take on the giant cow    in case you dont want to click the link here are some of the better non partisan tweets      
  more than 3000 pounds  imagine how many families that could feed
  9001 ethiopians  1400 canadians  1000 chinks  3 americans    thankyou
  perhaps thats why hormonal disruption perfectly/accidentally timed to trigger abnormal growth
  a cow gives around half of its body weight in edible meat so at maximum 1500lbs of beef is around 3400 servings of a 7 ounce steak enough for 1100 american families or 1000 ethiopian families assuming they eat a 5 ounce steak instead
  why dont they breed more of these things
this cow looks like it has auroch genes that got turned on somehow if i was more of a tinfoilfag i could think of tons of implications
  nah from what i understand about cow castration and from what the article says the cow was always massive even as a calf but they probably didnt know just how big it was gonna get until it was too late
knickers is a fucking jerk what was that bullshit hitting her sister for no reason
  i grew my hair long specifically to get country boys to start fights with me in the bars   youre nothing you get eaten alive if you come to town and start shit
  do it now
  the weak should fear the strong
  lost it at this
  things that never fucking happened the post
  they could clone him if they really wanted to
  yes castration typically causes steers to bulk up but not that much usually  they tend to stay about as tall  this ones probably got cowacromegaly mutations on top
the video is a bit deceptive because the huge steer is surrounded by wagyu cattle which is among the smallest breeds
  would fug
  over 9 thousand  damn thats a huge cow
donald trump insists the gops midterm election shellacking had nothing to do with him things will be different he says when his name is actually on the ballot in 2020    while its true that most presidents who see their party suffer major losses in their first midterm election get reelected anyway trump isnt most presidents  and there are lots of blaringred warning lights in this months election results for his bid for a second term    unlike most of his predecessors hes been persistently unpopular with approval ratings mired in the 40percent range  so far hes the only president in the modern era whose job approval ratings have never been over 50 percent according to gallup    some of democrats biggest gains came in the states that powered trumps electoral college victory in 2016 michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin and while a presidents base has stayed home in previous midterm elections leading to losses the record turnout in this years races suggests 2018 was more like a 2016 rerun than trump voters standing on the sidelines    thus far even trump loyalists in the party havent seen the president expand his electoral base beyond core republicans    this is now the party of donald trump i read articles saying the republican party has merged with the trump coalition  they have no choice trump voters own the republican party thats consolidated said john mclaughlin who was part of the team of pollsters working on trumps 2016 campaign the bad part is they havent broadened his coalition they havent gotten his job approval over 50 percent like reagan we havent done that    
republicans have taken solace in the examples of recent presidents who saw their party drubbed in their first midterm only to win a resounding reelection victory two years later    barack obamas democratic party lost 63 house seats and 6 senate seats in 2010 but obama defeated former massachusetts gov mitt romney in 2012 republicans flipped both the house where they netted 52 seats and senate in 1994 but bill clinton slaughtered former sen bob dole rkan in 1996 ronald reagans gop lost 26 house seats in 1982  and picked up a seat in the senate  but reagan nearly swept the electoral college against former vice president walter mondale two years later winning a 49state landslide    reagans example has been a balm for some republicans especially given the similarities in the housesenate split decisions  republicans gained at least one senate seat this year pending the results of next weeks specialelection runoff in mississippi but in order to repeat his feat trumps approval rating would have to rise to heretoforeunseen levels reagan was in the low40s around the 1982 midterms and improved to 58 percent in the gallup poll immediately before the 1984 election    throughout the campaign even the most optimistic republican pollsters were modeling a turnout rate far higher than in previous midterm elections and thats borne out in the election results as of thursday more than 1117 million votes had been counted in house elections nationwide according to the cook political report    estimates are that the final count will be around 113 million  a lot closer to the 1298 million votes that were cast in house races in the presidential year of 2016 than 2014s paltry turnout of 79 million votes    republicans made gains in 2010 because  in large part  the coalition that elected thenpresident barack obama didnt come out to vote in his midterms turnout dropped from 1207 million in 2008 to 869 million in 2010
all the data indicated that voters were really pumped this year  that there was an excitement and energy that we didnt really see in 2010 and 2012 said neil newhouse a republican pollster who worked for romneys 2012 presidential bid what you see in this election is not only can democrats turn their votes out but trump demonstrated an extraordinary ability to turn his votes out too    trump has argued however that many voters who support him stayed home on election day    i didnt run i wasnt running my name wasnt on the ballot trump told fox news sunday in an interview recorded last week there are many people that think i dont like congress that like me a lot i get it all the time sir i will never vote unless you were on the ballot i get it all the time    people are saying sir i will never vote unless youre on the ballot i say no no go and vote he added as much as i try and convince people to go vote im not on the ballot    there were some bright spots in the wreckage for republicans who besides expanding their slim senate majority also held floridas governorship and ousted democratic sen bill nelson by the narrowest of margins they retained the governorship in ohio though democratic sen sherrod brown won reelection iowa gop gov kim reynolds also won a full term but democrats beat two of the states three republican members of congress    but the biggest advances for democrats were made in the three states that put trump over the top in the electoral college in 2016 michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin democrats won the governorships in all three  wresting away an open seat in michigan and defeating twoterm incumbent scott walker in wisconsin while holding pennsylvania democratic incumbent senators in all three won reelection without breaking much of a sweat
democrats also won six more house elections across michigan and pennsylvania than they had captured in 2016 helped in large part by a new congressional map in pennsylvania    theres simply no evidence that those states are crying out for more trump said mark mellman a democratic pollster who worked for thensen john kerrys 2004 presidential campaign    the map could expand beyond those three states too mellman added that the florida results were essentially a tie and senelect kyrsten sinemas victory in arizona  shes the first democrat to win a senate race there since 1988  is a sign that the state is likely to be a significant battleground in 2020    pollsters from both parties say trumps chances of recovering depend in part on improving his approval rating which hes thus far failed to do in the latest politico/morning consult poll 45 percent of registered voters approved of the job trump is doing as president  equal to his performance in two separate exit polls of 2018 voters and consistent with the past year when his approval rating has ranged between 40 and 47 percent    trumps approval rating has been historically very low said mellman other presidents have been as well but their approval ratings have been more malleable his is sort of stuck    lynn vavreck a professor at the university of californialos angeles and a member of the advisory board for the american national election studies said shes skeptical public opinion of trump will change markedly in the next two years    its so divided by partisanship said vavreck republicans approve of him and democrats dont and thats pretty much the floor and the ceiling theres not a lot of room for movement unless republicans turn on him or democrats learn to like him i dont see either of things happening
  this meme is so annoying  signs indicated that trump wasnt going to win in 16  how is he going to lose in 20 when hes done everything to help the rust belt  he singlehandedly brought back steel through tariffs he helped wisconsin diary farmers with the usmca he brought back coal  those 3 states michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin are not republican but they will vote for trump because trump isnt republican
  your retarded if you think steel companiescoaland dairy are industries that need savingfind other work you lazy fucksthat asshole single handly fucked over most farmers in this country to protect these dumbass industries that dont mean jackshit to our societys wealthmake goddamn cheese out of the dairy instead of dumping itthe other shit will poison the people around it so its much better if thats some other countries problem we get steel without polluting our communities
  the difference between 2016 and 2020 is he had an extremely weak opponent and was able to masterfully manipulate the media to also tow his point of view while he conspired with the russians who attacked america to help cover for his major and what would be crippling flaws for any other politicians see how wiki leaks did a major email dump mere hours after the video of trump bragging he sexually assaulted women came out     if you want something concert look at the trumps coalition racism sexism fucking over workers and treating everyone who has a different point of view as the enemy is not a recipe for expanding your base and we saw the results of that in 2018 where trumps base did turn out but its not enough to stop the democrats if they find a way to mobilize their base and get independents off their asses to vote their economic and social interests     he crippled the steel industry with his tariffs wisconsins dairy industry was and still is supplanted by california and coal is still a dead except unless you count massive give away to millionaires and raping the environment as bringing back coal  also those 3 states which he won by 20000 votes total were the reason trump is president he doesnt win those he doesnt win in 2020    id tell you to think but youre a trump drone its impossible for you to think for yourself
  signs indicated that trump wasnt going to win in 16  signs also indicated that the dems would take the house but not the senate in 18 and thats exactly what happened one fluke doesnt suddenly discredit decades of accurate prediction
  no where throughout that rambling message did i see a disagreement thank you    the difference between 2016 and 2020 is he had an extremely weak opponent  trump has masterfully brainwashed you into believing that before he won the primary it was guarenteed that she was going to win everyone talked about how strong of a candidate she won but magically after trump shes now a horrible candidate  trump destroyed his opponent once hell do it again  youre also admitting that his opponent matters whos his opponent there are no strong democrat leaders kamala harris you think she speaks for the working class    sure they were wrong about trump before but they were right about nottrump poilticians therefore theyll be right about trump this time  when will you morons wake up from your delirium
  ok so you are retarded my point flew over your headthe farmers who voted chump wont be so willing when there product rotsalso the whole pollution thing i mentionedcan you even read englishyou an immigrant or something
  ps you didnt win because of high democrat turnout the republican turnout matched it you won because trump lost suburban white women  thats why he lost the house but not the senate the suburbs dont matter in a statewide election
  dairy farmers arent going to vote for trump because their products will for some nonexistent reason rot and because of pollution    are you clintons campaign manager only he could be that out of touch with average americans
  good job proving trump is in really deep shit if republican turn out matched the democrats because look at how he badly he lost even with everything rigged in his favor obamas economy gerrymandering voter suppression the most incumbent friendly senate map in midterms history etc      i didnt know the average america is a retarded bigot who wants to willingly put on the chains of corporations if it means they get to spite people they think wronged them 2020 is for the democrats to lose unless trump commits even more overt treason
  how do you not understand that no one likes republicans  they refused to back trump they didnt repeal obamacare they dont want to fund the wall etc  i voted for trump but i didnt vote in the midterms because there is no one like trump    2020 is the dems to lose  let me fix that for you  2016 was the dems to lose    are ya gettin the picture obama lost 60 seats in the house and 9 seats in the senate but still won reelection  youre either completely new to politics or you watch cnn/msnbc so much that you are actually starting to believe them
  obama is the same person as trump so their elections are directly comparable    this is essentially what you just said
  no trump is better numbers dont lie right  is 60 greater than 40  is 9 greater than 2
  stop using kancolle images for your shitty threads you miserable piece of shit
  democrats to lose unless trump commits even more overt treason  hes already in deep shit though
  i still think trump and obama are the same person and compare their elections directly     not very bright are you
  im going to keep doing it because it pisses you off and frankly fuck you for being a kancolleloving trumptard that does not jive
  assange isnt russian wikileaks isnt russian  its a journalistic outlet that reveals leaks that make republicans and democrats look like shit  its bipartisan leaking he gets mud on the face of democrats and republicans
  would love to know the last time wikileaks did something that hurt the republicans    ive actually seen examples of wikileaks refusing to leak stuff that hurts the republicans which is then leaked by other people
  im going to keep doing it because it pisses you off  using 2d characters for political purposes is taking a fat shit on who they are go fuck the devil in hell    and frankly fuck you for being a kancolleloving trumptard that does not jive  theres an unsupported assumption in there but even if it were true you would still be cancer
  wikileaks isnt antirepublican or democrat its antiwest
  its currently prorepublican because the current crop of republicans is doing a bangup job of dismantling the westernled international system and replacing it with an isolationist mercantile greatpower system that nonwestern countries enjoy very much
  whens the last time assange or wikileaks published something that hurt putin  they arent russian but they are clearly agents of russia
  whens the last time they published anything againstxi prince solmon   clearly hes a chinese plant no wait hes a saudi plant
  assange isnt russian wikileaks isnt russian  theyre pawns of the russians whens the last time assange has done anything against putin  they refused to publish the panama papers because it revealed the finical crimes of putin thats how theyre putins cockholster like trump
  donald trump insists the gops midterm election shellacking had nothing to do with him things will be different he says when his name is actually on the ballot in 2020    shellacking  how does anyone believe this it was a better than average outcome for a midterm president it was midway between reagan and nixon for results both of whom went on to landslide victories how does anyone think thats a shellacking
  well the last time a republican was in office  back in 2007 collateral murder the manning leaks assange has been in custody since before trump got elected so he couldnt do much leaking or rather locked in an embassy with no contact with the outside world
  when wikileaks exposes pay for play massive government surveillance and exposes what things are like on the ground for a war the american people pay for and support both with their lives and money you claim hes anti west    if wikileaks is anti west martin luther king was anti west for exposing how the united states didnt live up to its virtue when it was racist against black people  any vietnam war protestor or reporter who was critical would presumably also fall under the criteria of anti west
    its cute that you like to bury the urls for your political hit opinion pieces nowadays  midterm election shellacking  he kept the house flip to under 30 seats and gained seats in the senate historically speaking this is one of the most anemic midterms for an opposition party
  he kept the house flip to under 30 seats  democrats picked up 39 seats  /pol/ppets in full damage control
  i like how you are so obsessed with repeating this idiotic talking point that you didnt even bother reading the rest of the article which is specifically dedicated to debunking the talking point nosiree repeating the same thing weve heard your side say a thousand times in the last month is more important    at this point its becoming clear that youre just trying to convince yourself
  no i read the article it just fails at every meaningful level to debunk anything at all these numbers cant be made to go away there is literally nothing to debunk unless you somehow secretly think that the dems won more seats than they actually did
  actually it is and just because you say no doesnt change anything
  right thats literally all the debunking they do basically just saying nuuh the article just saying nuuh isnt an argument and it doesnt change anything glad you see that now
  gaslighting    the article points out why trump is in trouble going into 2020 you going nu uh doesnt change that
  no it makes claims that arent backed up by the hard data the article attempts to claim that turn out suggests trump voters didnt stay home yet all of the data says that trump voters did stay home turn out was up across the board but dems had a much bigger turnout boost over midterms than republicans this is exactly what we expect to see in a mid term     but the most substantial problem with the article is that these people arent clammering for more trump    except that if you look at the people who lost vs the people who won you see that it was their support of trump that made the difference look at the house almost every republicans representative that lost lost by small margins and made clear separations between them and trump on the other hand republican reps that supported trump in toss up elections held their seats     next looking at arizona ducey ran for governor as a protrump candidate mcsally separated herself in the senate race from trump and we know that people who voted for ducey split their vote against mcsally     i can literally go through the races all day if you want the biggest indicator of win v loss in the tossups was whether a republican was protrump or not it didnt even matter if trump actually supported the candidate or not     the article is wrong and its argument literally amounts to nuuh trump will have as easy or easier a time in 2020 as obama did in 2012 and clinton in 1996
  plenty of protrump candidates such as dean heller lost youre repeating yet another talking point that i did indeed see used by conservative pundits early on but was quickly proven false as more results came in
  it doesnt matter we control the census and we finally have an ag who will do something about voter fraud given our control of the senate and likely another sc pick or 2 before the election trump can do whatever he wants and the house can cry about it trump could arrest every house dem right now and all you could do is riot
  it hasnt been proven false calling something a talking point isnt an argument anything any factual piece of information can be a talking point the data still shows that protrump candidates fared far better than those that were neutral or antitrump the data doesnt show any reason to believe trumps reelection will be any different than obamas 2012 all data suggests it will be better actually
  the reason why some protrump candidates fared better was because those candidates are in blood red states and districts where trumps overt racism campaign worked at the expense of district where real americans life and punished trump by voting for the democrat     remember trump managed to lose orange county which should have been impossible
  under 30 seats  sorry 40 seats
  donald trump insists the gops midterm election shellacking had nothing to do with him  why does he always double down what the fuck
  the margin of popular vote looks to break past what was the largest which was post water gate the only reason why democrats didnt have larger gains in the house was because of how republicans rigged the system with voter suppression and gerrymandering
  republicans rigged the system with voter suppression and gerrymandering  riiiiight
  because hes a whiny little bitch who cant take personal responsibility its hilarious his drones still say hes an alpha when he bends over for anyone who praises him or gives him money    as for elections theres an extremely good chance trump will not leave office willingly if he loses the 2020 election remember he claimed the 2016 election was rigged and he wouldnt accept the results if he lost and he threw a bitch fit over making sure every vote was counted in the midterms including saying we should either hold new elections or throw out the votes of thousands of troops overseas   at this point if he loses i expect him to say the election was rigged against him and either attempt to hold a new election or just refuse to recognize he results then we get to see the military and secret service forcibly remove him from the white house because their oath is to the constitutions and not to mad king donald
  right  im glad you agree that republicans are undemocratic and unamerican in how they run elections
  voter suppression  how exactly are voters suppressed
    how retarded do you have to be to believe the drivel that you posted go back to sucking cock because thats the only thing youre good at you faggot
  /pol/ppet damage control      
  i dont get it why cant black people just carry id    arent they people like the rest of us  and i thought it was bad trump was undermining confidence in elections doesnt this build up confidence in them
  wikileaks  not russian    is that why they held off on leaking documents thatd of made powerful russian leaders look bad
  the issue is getting the documents to get valid id the innate problem you face is that people have a right to vote so long as they havent committed a crime or other such offense however many people choose not to participate in society which includes having birth certificates social security numbers and so on get past that hurdle then you have to face the problem of county offices being in out of the way places closing at shitty hours and not notifying people they arent registered to begin with     about the only way to cure this would be to create a system that automatically issues ids upon reaching legal age however neither side will go for that due to the demographics that would be empowered and cost     my question to you is why do we think people are going to go out of their way to commit mass voter fraud you got a much higher chance of being gunned down than fraud of a significant margin being committed on purpose
  however many people choose not to participate in society which includes having birth certificates social security numbers and so on  do you know of anyone like this do your friends know anyone like this  because it sounds to me like the only people who would do this are sovereign citizens or people in cult compounds
  older people sometimes dont have social security cards and numbers because the government used to not issue them to you until you were 18 birth certificates can be lost damaged beyond usage or stolen and then you need to request a new one which can cost time and money which people may not be willing to spend if the government is worried about securing the elections they should be required to issue ids to all people eligible to vote when they turn 18
  
  i dunno why did mainstream media outlets cover roy moore 12 times as much as they did menendez despite menendez being a sitting senator    probably because they were human beings with bias  if wikileaks is owned by the russians then the mainstream media is owned by the dnc
  i know old people they all have social security numbers to collect social security because theyre old people
  the only way you can win is through voter fraud because your ideas are unpopular every modern first world country requires id to vote you know this stop lying you are not smart
  do you have any proof of mass voter fraud
whats wrong with voter id   its inherently meant to discriminate against minorities the fact you think everyone can spend a day going out to get one shows your white privilege oozing out        whataboutism  leave it the right wing to bitch and moan about why theyre scrutinized more when they nominate a disgraced pedophile to be a senator of course playing the victim is what they do best
  its inherently meant to discriminate against minorities  precisely how
    you can read about the grandfather law and reconstruction era voting laws and then compare with the ones that certain states cast which just happen to coincidentally impact certain demographics    youll find your answer there then you can actually look at the public statements of the legislators pushing themits not a secret
  compare with the ones that certain states cast which just happen to coincidentally impact certain demographics  give me an example and explain why you believe it impacts certain demographics more than others
  even fucking canada requires you have an id to vote if youre an actual citizen and not retarded theyre easy as fuck to get    voter id laws only discriminate against certain races because most illegals arent white
    see    it explains how voter id discriminates and the data that backs it up
      shit literally went to the courts where they found that the law targeted african americas with surgical precision the key to the targeting was what was considered valid ids ids more likely to be possessed by whites such as drivers licenses were acceptable while ids more likely to be possessed by blacks such as government employee ids were not allowed despite both being photo ids issued by the government further damning was the fact nc state legislators specifically requested data on which ids were common among each racial group to avoid racial discrimination but then ended up doing the exact opposite      voter id laws remain on the books in multiple states because they allow a broad spectrum of governmentissued photo ids and generous hours at issuing offices to make acquiring those ids the laws that get struck down are overly selective on what is considered valid id and shut down issuing offices in specific democratleaning neighborhoods    the democrats are most certainly overplaying their hand like they always do but theyre not wrong that certain voter id laws are less about security and more about voter suppression
  see  no it doesnt i want you to explain it to me between it bring simple and you being such a genius it out to be a quick task
  spoonfed me more  no
  ids more likely to be possessed by whites such as drivers licenses  why are black people are less likely to have a drivers license on what basis is that claim made
   me more  no  youre the one trying to convince me youre gonna have to do the work
incidentally this is all moot on october 1 2020 when real id goes into effect
  youre sealioning so i cant give you information in good faith especially when youre lying to me already about not seeing the information when its all laid out
  youre sealioning  well thats a new one  all i want is for you to tell me why a minority voter is less able to get a state drivers license or nondriver id than a nonminority voter it is the basis for all other claims of voter discrimination
  generally african americans are more likely to live in urban areas with good public transportation and therefore less likely to need a car they are also more likely to be too poor to afford a car plus this wasnt guesswork and generalizations when the law was written north carolina specifically requested data from the dmv and other state agencies to confirm which racial groups had which ids    the law didnt stop at ids either based on previous voting statistics they found that blacks were more likely to make use of early voting especially in the first week and thus removed the first week of early voting blacks were also more likely to vote early on sunday so sunday voting was removed    also the only cases of voter fraud in north carolina were with mailin ballots a method more likely to be used by white voters yet that method was not curtailed as part of the election security law          actual court decision should you want to read the full reasoning
  because theyre more likely to live in areas with robust public transit and less likely to view car ownership as economically sensible
  see      and            
  african americans are more likely to live in urban areas  so the nonblack masstransit using people in urban areas with state issued photo id are wasting their time getting one
also if you think voter suppression is an issue   in low voter turn out models republicans would have kept control of the house   
  early voting  sunday voting  these changes can only be justified based on evil legislators disenfranchising blacks you dont think they budgetary issues they actually cite are valid and what they fuck is early voting and sunday voting anyway voting happens on election day  cases of voter fraud  whoa whoa i keep getting told theres no voter fraud where did this come from    opinion piece    actual court decision should you want to read the full reasoning  did you read it the opinion is mindboggling it acknowledges the facts indicate no such thing but then implies intent of the legislature based on  nothing they are apparently mind readers and because it is so bafflingly nonjudicial its on its way to the scotus
  because theyre more likely to live in areas with robust public transit and less likely to view car ownership as economically sensible  youve also described every neckbearded faggot in brooklyn who somehow still manage to have stateissued photo ids to get into their poah bars to spend 10 on pbr
  under the law that was struck down yes if they planned on using that id to vote but those ids would have been valid for other purposes such as getting into secure government buildings or buying alcohol which is one of the reasons it was so suspicious that government employee ids were not considered valid for voting    keep in mind when using statistics to suppress opposition voting youre always going to lose some number of votes that would have gone to your party in this case the number of poor urban whites who are more likely to vote republican than blacks were minor compared to the number of poor urban blacks who vote democrat 90 of the time as such you could reasonably sacrifice them to cut back on black voting and gain a net advantage plus all urban demographics are more likely to vote democrat than republican so losing urban voters was a net positive for republicans even if 1049 of them would have voted republican up until 2018 republicans relied more on suburban and rural voting in 2018 they lost the suburban vote but gained in the rural vote    its the same logic behind gerrymandering some number of people who would have voted for your party will be stuck in a few districts where their votes will be drowned out by opposition votes but thats okay for you because you have a clear majority in every other district
  you dont think they budgetary issues they actually cite are valid  they conveniently only cut for budget areas that would disproportionately affect blacks this is the same excuse they use to shut down or limit hours for dmvs and polling places in predominately democratvoting neighborhoods    and what they fuck is early voting and sunday voting anyway voting happens on election day  north carolina allows voting up to 17 days in advance of the election that period was shortened to 10 days as part of the law that was struck down    whoa whoa i keep getting told theres no voter fraud where did this come from  voter fraud has always existed its just been extremely rare since 2000 a billion votes have been cast and only 31 have ever been found to be fraudulent of those cases most dealt with mailin ballots something which voter id laws do nothing to stop    opinion piece  its a useful summary of sources that i would otherwise have to link individually    and because it is so bafflingly nonjudicial its on its way to the scotus  scotus has already declined to review the decision and thus it remains final if you disagree you can take it up with chief justice roberts        the 4th circuits logic is clear taken as individual pieces this could have been considered a simple error as the lower court did cutting back early voting days maybe its just budget reasons not allowing government employee ids perhaps it was an oversight but taken all together and combined with the statistically irrelevant chances of inperson voter fraud it starts to form a clear pattern
  implement voter id laws that allow a wider variety of government issued ids nationwide  no more racist voter suppression     problem solved
  some people cant afford id  republicans dont create or underfund program to pay for ids  get struck down as a poll tax  nice try
  what makes it worse is the racist republican who drew up the racial gerrymandering for north carolina is up for a federal judgeship that mcconnell is trying to jam down the american peoples throats
  what do you mean whataboutism i am using an example of others event being coverage as a means of demonstrating evidence that reporters and people in general are bias how is my evidence irrelevant
  why cant black people carry id  seems like when you talk to them on the street they have no problem getting id  
  see          its a whataboutism because youre crying about an irrelevant topic to voter suppression  also apples and oranges since roy moore was a pedophile in a special election ie the only election happening while medendeze was buried a full midterm election
  menendezs trial was ongoing had no coverage      that other person started it when they started talking about wikileaks because that is also irrelevant to the topic of voter supression but you only point it out with my post because mine undermines your narrative
  trial is ongoing  the trial ended with a hung jury last november after which us district judge william walls moved to dismiss three charges of bribery against the senator   youre really bad at this
  sorry borris topic is wikileaks not cnn or foxnews i could give a fuck less about them wl is in the hands of or playing favoritism to russia through what they release and dont theyve given up their dirt exposure angle to become anti west and putins best friend
  a lot of native american tribes are like this my grandparents didnt have any of their documents     these cases arent the vast majority of the population but according to studies done on voter fraud they would outweigh the intentional fraudsters and besides people in cults do not forgo their right to vote its an intrinsic right that america claims to protect as much as the right to a gun
  menendezs trial was ongoing  was  stop strawmanning me
  i thought the topic was voter supression not wikileaks    youre whataboutisming  am i doing it right
  assange had a tv show on rt for a while       people have a right to vote so long as they havent committed a crime or other such offense  there is nothing in the constitution prohibiting felons from voting only certain backward states ban the practice      menendez just won reelection so the voters didnt care anyway
    shit i didnt realize cnn was infiltrated by a russian for decades
  he was acquitted and the right wing media did attempt to create a controversy over one of the jurors attending his victory party but conveniently omitted she was excused before of personal reasons  oops
  was roy moore convicted
i dont think trump will run again he probably realized now that being president isnt very fun
  statue of limitation allowed him to get away with it
  he should have been when this was what his damage control team did  
  oh look another poll predicting trimps defeat we know what happened to that in 2016
  and dairy are industries that need saving  who are the farmers going to sell to if there is no dairy industry left  your playbook is moldy libshill      the difference between 2016 and 2020 is he had an extremely weak opponent and was able to masterfully manipulate the media to also tow his point of view while he conspired with the russians  same is going to happen in 2020
  democrats are likely not to be caught in the same trap twice also with the russian investigation and how social media has been exposed for being complicit in russias attack and the walls closing in on trump with at best his attempts to obstruct justice regarding russia and at worse conspiring with the russians    he might be able to fool his people all the time  he cant fool all the people all the time    especially after he lost the suburbs in the midterms when he made it a referendum on himself
  statue of limitations  this is the sign of a great legal scholar
   weak opponent  hilary is going to run again in 2020   midterms  were a standard midterm election   blah he crippled this and that  the only people hes crippled are libcuck npcs like yourself
  oh look another trumptard stuck on 2016 because he doesnt want to admit he got clobbered in 2018
  that is the huge point if you need voting to bring down trump then you lost then your country approved that it is just a banana republic and there is no point in mentioning that you are a democracy because you arent even if you voted him out you still defined the way democracy works with all possible options legal illegal doesnt matter us president can do whatever the hell he wants always the best people to make deals with this would be a damage of extraordinary dimension oh ps the same damage happens on another layer if the doj is taking down trump the senate is supposed to remove the president not the doj if the doj needs to do it cause the senate is not doing his job will lead to every upcoming republican trying to undermine the doj to bring down every upcoming democratic president that exist the only way to make this work out is senate impeachment or protest it is your country and your choice we are all watching
  did trump get clobbered more or less than obama got clobbered
  this reminds me of polls during 2016 clearly trump was going to lose and only a minority white kkk clansmen were going to vote for him haha as people see the flood of illiterate and dangerous migrants change the demographics of entire cities they once knew they are waking up
  obama implemented healthcare reform and bailed out the failing economy but the results werent immediately obvious and tea baggers capitalized on that with misinformation
  what im getting at is obama had a rough first couple of years because there were actual problems to address which people ended up attributing to him trump on the other hand had no actual problems to address he could have stayed the course and avoided controversy and his popularity might have risen a little bit trump is just bad at the job
  okay then what about bill clinton how did he do during his first midterms  or george bush he was also dealing with two crisis a financial crisis and 9/11 how did he do during his first midterms compared to obama
  bill clinton got beat very badly during his first midterm and never managed to make up the losses which caused him to relent on his more liberal ideas like healthcare reform but he remained popular well into his second term despite the weird controversies surrounding him     9/11 actually scared americans enough that it made george w bushs popularity shoot through the roof and it basically gave him a huge mandate to do whatever he wanted democrats kind shrunk away and just let bush do whatever he wanted at the time often voting in lockstep with their republican colleagues on national defense in the 2002 midterms and again in 2004 bush actually gained seats which people attribute to his high popularity but the popularity didnt last by the 2006 midterms his popularity had fallen dramatically and democrats picked up seats by 2008 with the financial sector looking like it was going to collapse at any minute democrats swept all three elected bodies by fairly wide margins
  id is free 90 of the time  and if you cant afford an id get a fuckin job    the unfortunate 05 of people that might get fucked by this isnt worth having no id laws pretty much giving non citizens the vote
  so when its obama dealing with a crisis its obviously going to be bad and hell obviously lose seats but when its bush dealing with a crisis it will obviously be good and he will gain seats    this just seems like a typical midterm where trump lost slightly less seats than expected
   controversies  lying under oath  weird controversy  pick one
  trump lost slightly less seats than expected    iirc trump was supposed to get slapped in the midterms blue wave and all that    the dems are in shambles right now having to deal with crazy super leftists while still trying to keep regular dems
  iirc trump was supposed to get slapped in the midterms blue wave and all that   and thats what happened    more than 300 state house seats flipped over a dozen governor seats and of course the largest blue shift in the house since watergate     gop retained the senate thanks to literally the friendliest midterm map possible  which they wont get again for at least half a decade    for the next two elections straight theyll be defending twice as many seats as the dems
  internal crisis vs external crisis bad economies and failed healthcare initiatives get internal blame the president and his party attacks by foreign groups get external blame and cause the people to rally around the president remember that w was riding high on some absurd 90 approval rating just after 9/11 plus by the midterms he was also a wartime president for only afghanistan so people considered this a just war which traditionally boosts popularity further    trump meanwhile did not face any sort of crisis he had a good economy full control of the federal government majority control of the state governments and accomplished multiple republican policy goals such as deregulation and tax cuts under these circumstances a normal republican president would have taken minimal damage in the midterms if any instead he lost the house which means he now has to actually compromise with democrats to do anything legislatively and he now faces actual investigations instead of the laughable nunesled bullshit also republican control over the state governments has eroded meaning they cant tout that as part of their popular mandate anymore    it could certainly have been worse they could have somehow lost the senate despite an ultrafriendly map but theres no way this could be defined as good for the president and republican party
that is the issue and that is all that really mattered he was clearly ignorant and incompetent or at least stupidly incoherent from day 1 the only people who supported him either ignored it liked it or dont realize it    for the first two nothing he says really matters for the latter even mentioning currency values and tariffs is the height of business and economics    go back to the 2016 debates i believe clinton focused on personality and some other abstract topics while trump kept repeating how china was a currency manipulator    i remember his points better because he brought it up 5 or 6 times in one debate as far as they know trump legitimately has deep knowledge of a complex issue if youve followed any of the trump supporter interviews that is what it came down toyes he doesnt know much about politics and diplomacy but he knows a lot about business    of course anyone familiar with the business topics places trumps economic knowledge somewhere between 4 years out of date devaluing the yuan to 120 revive coal years as well as something youd learn in the first few days of a 101 class    between the personality cult the dogmatists and the idiots i dont know how exclusive the latter is early on they probably fell into the other categories so it is too late for education but trump did hammer in with repetition and firstdaycollegeknowledge of business to people who still faithfully believe its the economy stupid
    let me convey to you how completely fucked you are    the democrats now have the votes to impeach trump    impeachment removes trumps ability to pardon    enjoy the next two years
  impeachment removes trumps ability to pardon  what really even if it doesnt pass the senate
  democrats now have the votes to impeach trump  im assuming you failed civics class or american history
  nancy pelosi conservative democrats are going to impeach trump  ahahahahahahahahahaha im fucking dying
  im assuming you failed civics class or american history  did you the house can impeach but the senate must convict the democrats can impeach the president but they cant convict him unless they flip multiple republicans while maintaining 100 party unity which is currently unlikely
  charges arising from impeachment cannot be pardoned and impeachment can be brought multiple times if necessary because its not considered a criminal process where double jeopardy would need to be taken into account
  you can impeach him one million times and none of it matters if the senate wont convict
  nancy pelosi is conservative  lmao did they really convince you of this just by repeating it a whole bunch
  they convinced you that the country is moving left when its taken a hard slide to the right for the past 30 years
  who are they you retard
  huh thats true    of course  is also true and impeachment proceedings have a tendency to circle the wagons so i dont think the democrats should try just keep reporting and conducting oversight as is their responsibility let him drown in his own shit
  the russian bot /pol/ people who have the    audacity    to not agree with him
  still believing russia is a lie when cohen literally just pled guilty to russiarelated crimes    how deluded are you try and keep up so youre not blindsided when trump is hauled off to jail
  donald trump insists the gops midterm election shellacking  i dont understand this rhetoric from extremely biased and stupid people  every president in the past 41 midterms have lost the house including obama including bush including clinton     if you want to use metrics to determine if hes going to win the midterms how about using metrics that would also apply to the last three sitting presidents who served two terms
  bush didnt lose the house in his first midterm    and thats not the basis the article is using  in addition to losing the house the gop lost over 300 state seats and over a dozen governorships    the popular vote margin in favor of dems was 92 which is enormous and the turnout for a midterm was a high of nearly a century     the gop kept the senate but thats mostly because of geography  they had to defend only half of the number of seats they were trying to take    in 2020 that situation will be reversed
    notice how the framing has shifted to democrats not gaining the house due to fake polls to it was just normal for them to kick gop ass anyway
  i think the point stands that the anticipated blue wave turned out to just be another normal midterm election  if anythign it was less than anticipated due to the extremely poor democrat performance in the senate elections
  the only reason democrats did not take more seats in this election comes down to a combination of gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics and also the very favorable map in the senate    35 seats up for grabs democrats won 21 plus 2 independents that caucus with democrats also won not scientific by any means but if those results could be applied nationally democrats might have 60 seats in the senate
  its not a normal midterm election by any metric this should have been a bigger win than bushs first midterm yet it wasnt because trump is that incompetent    the damage control from the trumptards is ridiculous its like you guys didnt start paying attention to politics until 2016
  whatever you speculate the reason was the fact stands that it wasnt
  just because you repeat something over and over again doesnt make it fact youre not even smart enough to use an apostrophe and you talk to me about facts pitiful
  shittons of voters in georgia had their names purged from the voter roll right before the election turns out most of those voters were black democrats gee what a coincidence
  shittons of voters in georgia had their names purged from the voter roll right before the election  the law purging inactive voters from georgia voting rolls was passed by the democrats    as for right before the election id like to see a source on that one
  the problem is that even those 05 of people still have the right to vote and like  said only a grand total of 31 votes have been found to be fraudulent since 2000 meanwhile even 05 of the us population is over a million people obstructing those peoples right to vote over a mere 31 fraudulent votes sounds absolutely absurd and since most of those votes were mailins voter id laws wouldve done nothing to stop them anyway
  the statute of limitations had expired for him the allegations were from decades ago
  you have no idea what youre talking about
  perhaps right before the election is not quite right but its funny how overwhelmingly the voter roll purge in georgia favored the republicans in what turned out to be an extremely close race 
  well maybe the democrats should have thought about that before passing a law that disproportionately disenfranchises people who dont vote    its kemps job to enforce the law he is only personally responsible for the outcome if he either misapplies the law or applies it selectively against black people
  its already triggered several lawsuits  man running for governor is also the same one overseeing the election  purge of 53000 voters from the roll the month before the election were 70 black  its really not an opinion that voter suppression was committed in georgia its a fact
  its really an opinion that voter suppression was committed in georgia not a fact  remember its not rigged youre just losing
  except in this case it was literally rigged bootlicker
  cranky because its not rigged and youre just losing arent you
  so butthurt that his party got btfo in the midterms and that he has no argument that he resorts to haha u mad shitposts
rice university researchers have discovered a fundamentally different form of lightmatter interaction in their experiments with gold nanoparticles    they werent looking for it but students in the lab of rice chemist stephan link found that exciting the microscopic particles just right produced a nearperfect modulation of the light they scatter the discovery may become useful in the development of nextgeneration ultrasmall optical components for computers and antennas    a paper about the research appears in the american chemical society journal acs nano    the work springs from the complicated interactions between light and plasmonic metal particles that absorb and scatter light extremely efficiently plasmons are quasiparticles collective excitations that move in waves on the surface of some metals when excited by light    the rice researchers were studying pinwheellike plasmonic structures of cshaped gold nanoparticles to see how they responded to circularly polarized light and its rotating electric field especially when the handedness or the direction of rotation of the polarization was reversed they then decided to study individual particles    we stripped it back into the simplest possible system where we only had a single arm of the pinwheel with a single incident light direction said lauren mccarthy a graduate student in the link lab we werent expecting to see anything it was a complete surprise when i put this sample on the microscope and rotated my polarization from left to righthanded i was like are these turning on and off thats not supposed to happen      she and colead author kyle smith a recent rice alumnus had to go deep to figure out why they saw this giant modulation       
at the start they knew shining polarized light at a particular angle onto the surface of their sample of gold nanoparticles attached to a glass substrate would create an evanescent field an oscillating electromagnetic wave that rides the surface of the glass and traps the light like parallel mirrors an effect known as a total internal reflection    they also knew that circularly polarized light is composed of transverse waves transverse waves are perpendicular to the direction the light is moving and can be used to control the particles visible plasmonic output but when the light is confined longitudinal waves also occur where transverse waves move up and down and side to side longitudinal waves look something like blobs being pumped through a pipe as illustrated by shaking a slinky    they discovered the plasmonic response of the cshaped gold nanoparticles depends on the outofphase interactions between both transverse and longitudinal waves in the evanescent field    for the pinwheel the researchers found they could change the intensity of the light output by as much as 50 percent by simply changing the handedness of the circularly polarized light input thus changing the relative phase between the transverse and longitudinal waves      when they broke the experiment down to individual cshaped gold nanoparticles they found the shape was important to the effect changing the handedness of the polarized input caused the particles to almost completely turn on and off    simulations of the effect by rice physicist peter nordlander and his team confirmed the explanation for what the researchers observed    we knew we had an evanescent field and we knew it could be doing something different but we didnt know exactly what mccarthy said that didnt become clear to us until we got the simulations done telling us what the light was actually exciting in the particles and seeing that it actually matches up with what the evanescent field looks like
it led to our realization that this cant be explained by how light normally operates she said we had to adjust our understanding of how light can interact with these sorts of structures    the shape of the nanoparticle triggers the orientation of three dipoles concentrations of positive and negative charge on the particles mccarthy said      the fact that the halfring has a 100nanometer radius of curvature means the entire structure takes up half a wavelength of light she said we think thats important for exciting the dipoles in this particular orientation    the simulations showed that reversing the incidentpolarized light handedness and throwing the waves out of phase reversed the direction of the center dipole dramatically reducing the ability of the halfring to scatter light under oneincident handedness the polarization of the evanescent field then explains the almost complete turning on and off effect of the cshaped structures    interestingly we have in a way come full circle with this work link said flat metal surfaces also support surface plasmons like nanoparticles but they can only be excited with evanescent waves and do not scatter into the far field here we found that the excitation of specifically shaped nanoparticles using evanescent waves produces plasmons with scattering properties that are different from those excited with freespace light
  this is amazing news and fundamentally changes how were going to design optical circuitry in the future but its not blomrpf or muh nazis so it will get slid down to page 10 may i suggest taking this excellent breakdown to  where someone besides mouthbreathing troglodytes can appreciate it
  i reposted the thread here  
  /news/ is pure cancer nowadays  you used to find news from all over the world here now its literally 9 pages of trump
  what actually happened did r/news invade this place
  did light assume golds gender
  extreme focus on us politics while forgetting that the rest of the world still exist
  someone made a sticky during the 2016 election which caused a bunch of political hacks from /pol/ and the like to show up they never left
  but the political hacks are from both sides the trolling has gotten significantly worse since the start of the midterms season
  /pol/ isnt exclusively right wing though obviously the right is a massive majority there im pretty sure there were also left wing refugees that came over during 2016 as to why its gotten worse since the start of the midterms its because of the midterms people who were otherwise dormant because there was no major election woke up and returned to flinging shit on their favorite mongolian picture book forum now that the midterms are over most of them should return to hibernation but unfortunately there will be some stragglers who will stick with us to continue being partisan hacks    and then the cycle will begin again in 2020 and it will probably be even worse than 2016 depending on what happens in the next two years
english please
  politics news is mostly fluff  itss as bad as tmz shit i only care about politics news when it pertains to the prophecies of the scriptures     some random fuck you never knew existed muller coher bannon kanye said a thing this changes everything    no it fucking doesnt

    rising temperatures in the midwest are projected to be the largest contributing factor to declines in us agricultural productivity with extreme heat wilting crops and posing a threat to livestock according to a sweeping federal report on climate change released friday    midwest farmers will be increasingly challenged by warmer wetter and more humid conditions from climate change which also will lead to greater incidence of crop disease and more pests and will diminish the quality of stored grain during the growing season temperatures are projected to climb more in the midwest than in any other region of the us the report says    without technological advances in agriculture the onslaught of highrainfall events and higher temperatures could reduce the midwest agricultural economy to levels last seen during the economic downturn for farmers in the 1980s    overall yields from major us crops are expected to fall the reports says to adapt to the rising temperatures substantial investments will be required which will in turn will hurt farmers bottom lines    these are some of the findings of the report released by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the 1600page report  vetted by 13 government agencies and written collectively with the help of 300 scientists  is perhaps the most authoritative and comprehensive statement on the risks of climate change which has contributed to extreme weather that has cost the us nearly 400 billion since 2015 the authors found    according to the report the threat to midwestern agriculture is just one potential blow to the region    scientists say human activity is changing the planets climate faster than at any point time in modern civilization heralding costly and in some cases lifethreatening consequences in every region of the country
hough the monstrous 2017 hurricane season and wildfires in california in recent years may be some of the most visceral images of the devastation a changing climate can wreak the subtle effects from increasingly unpredictable water availability more frequent heavy rainfall and hotter weather in the midwest are just as important according to jim angel illinois state climatologist who contributed to fridays report    some of those things dont grab headlines as much but are still significant angel said we kind of got a taste of that in 2012 with the big drought that shook not only us markets but world markets those kind of things should be a big concern by midcentury    illinois a leading producer of soybeans and hogs ranks third among the states in exported agricultural commodities with 82 billion worth of goods shipped to other countries the state has become 12 degrees warmer and 10 to 15 percent wetter in the past century angel said farmers are trying to adapt by increasing drainage and planting cover crops that will protect against heavier rainfall and runoff that can cause soil erosion    the question is can they adapt fast enough angel said    meanwhile william hohenstein director of us department of agricultures climate change program said the federal government is helping farmers track drought conditions    we are working to advance the  drought forecasting hohenstein said usda is also partnering with seed companies to develop new cultivars of crops that are more resilient to drought to help improve soil health and conserve water we are providing guidance through our midwest regional climate hub on conservation practices    the reports cites other impacts climate change could have on the midwest    warmer air also can hold more moisture leading to more frequent and severe storms which would overwhelm aging stormwater systems across the region
scientists estimate the annual cost of retrofitting urban stormwater systems will exceed 500 million for the midwest by the end of the century    higher temperatures also are expected to lead to diminished air quality without policymakers taking steps to mitigate the issue hotter weather which is more conducive to smog creation could result in as many as 550 premature deaths per year by 2050 according to the report    brian urbaszewski director of the respiratory health association of metropolitan chicagos environmental health program said he fears that warming will extend the seasons in which we could see unhealthy levels of ozone people with asthma and others who struggle with respiratory diseases he said will be the most vulnerable    this reinforces the need to cut down and get rid off of pollutants that form ozone urbaszewski said the problem with global warming is that it makes it harder    climate change once a benign area of research has become a polarizing and politicized issue in recent years at times pitting scientists against politicians    fridays report the fourth national climate assessment is the latest in a line of federal research into climate change mandated by the global change research act of 1990 it seeks to assess the environmental economic and health and safety consequences of climate change it builds on a 2017 report in which federal scientists found it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid20th century for the warming over the last century there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence    the conclusions of fridays study directly contradict the views of president donald trump an outspoken skeptic of climate change who has vowed to withdraw the us from the paris agreement a global pact that aims to reduce greenhouse gases
on wednesday trump tweeted about an incoming cold snap on the east coast saying whatever happened to global warming    under trump the us environmental protection agency scrubbed references to climate change from its website    environmental advocates and journalists questioned whether the trump administrations apparent distrust of climate science influenced the decision for noaa to release the report the day after thanksgiving a day when newsrooms are thin and public interest is likely distracted by black friday deals noaa spokeswoman monica allen acknowledged the report was out earlier than expected but referred questions pertaining to the timing of its release and white house tampering to mike kuperberg executive director for the us global change research program    this report has not been altered or revised in any way to reflect with political considerations allen said    kuperberg coud not be reached for comment    perhaps more consequential than the timing was the trump administrations decision to dissolve a federal advisory panel that sought to translate these national and regional findings to the state and local levels the defunct panel chaired by richard moss an adjunct professor in the department of geographical sciences at university of maryland was revived earlier this year when it received funding from the state of new york columbia universitys earth institute and the american meteorological society to complete its project their report will be released early next year    moss a deerfield native argues that the information will be allimportant to cities and states which he said will be key to slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also needing to design their communities to become resilient to the climate changes
it shows we cant waste any more time moss said we have to be reducing emissions to avoid the worst impacts in the future and then we have to get ready for what we can no longer avoid because weve already set in motion some pretty substantial changes
trump doesnt need the midwest to win in 2020 anyway
  but climate change isnt real
  he doesnt but thats how the only reason why he won before
    los angeles ap  democrat gil cisneros captured a republicanheld us house seat in southern california capping a democratic rout in which the party picked up six congressional seats in the state    in what had been the last undecided house contest in california cisneros beat republican young kim for the states 39th district seat    the cisneros victory saturday cements a stunning political realignment that will leave a vast stretch of the los angeles metropolitan area under democratic control in the house    with kims defeat four republicanheld house districts all or partly in orange county once a nationally known gop stronghold will have shifted in one election to the democratic column the change means that the county  richard nixons birthplace and site of his presidential library  will only have democrats representing its residents in washington next year    the orange county democratic party said its the first time since 1940 that all seven house seats in the county home to 32 million people are in democratic control three seats all or partly in the northwestern end of the county are held by democrats who were easily reelected    democrats also recently picked up the last republicanheld house seat anchored in los angeles county when democrat katie hill ousted republican rep steve knight    republicans also lost a seat in the agricultural central valley    with other gains democrats will hold a 458 edge in california us house seats next year    the 39th district was one of seven targeted by democrats in california after hillary clinton carried them in the 2016 presidential election    cisneros 47 a 266 million lottery jackpot winner had been locked in a close race with kim in a district that has grown increasingly diverse its about equally divided between republicans democrats and independents as it is with asians hispanics and whites
in one of the most diverse districts in the country i learned that for all of our differences we all care about the same things said cisneros who will be the first hispanic to represent the district    most of all we want to live in a world brought together by hope not divided by hate he said in a statement    kim 55 a former state legislator worked for years for retiring republican rep ed royce who is vacating the seat and had endorsed her    in a state where president donald trump is unpopular kim sought to create distance with the white house on trade and health care her immigrant background  and gender  made her stand out in a political party whose leaders in washington are mostly older white men    im a different kind of candidate she had said    it wasnt enough democratic ads depicted her as a trump underling eager to carry out his agenda    cisneros a firsttime candidate described his interest in congress as an extension of his time in the military saying it was about public service he runs a charitable foundation with his wife    on health care he talked about his mother who went without insurance for 16 years that should just not happen in this country he had said    while the election delivered mixed results around the us it affirmed californias reputation as a democratic fortress    democrats are on track to hold every statewide office  again the party holds a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature and has a 37million advantage in voter registration    there wasnt even a republican on the ballot for us senate
  there wasnt even a republican on the ballot for us senate  im gobsmacked the republican party is genuinely no longer national this hasnt happened ini have no idea
even the cradle the crucible of ronald reagan could not survive for shame
  thats only because of californias jungle primary system if a hyperrepublican state did one they might get two republicans running against each other
  i think the last time something like this happened was when the dixiecrats split off from the dems in the 1940s1960s there were large sections of the country especially in the south with negligible numbers of voting democrats back then nowadays the tables have turned and its republicans who have been split first by the tea party and now by trumpism
    small excerpt from the article  still as national republicans fret local gop operatives scoff at the idea that democrats will manage to pick up any seats here they think were the new battleground laughs fred whitaker the chairman of the orange county republican party there are four republicanheld seats here and there will be four republicanheld seats here after the 2020 election its a hail mary play its desperation    let the democrats spend tens of millions of dollars here he added let them die on the hill in orange county
  blue wave  california  dems have been reduced to inflating their ego by circlejerking over a major victory in the state theyve been guaranteed a major victory in for decades
  i mean reagan made a whole speech warning against politicians like trump
  orange county was reagan country for decades bootlicker
  more democratic representatives means more democratic representatives it doesnt matter if they come from california
  oh sweetie were not licking the boots were wearing them youre going to be licking them when theyre stomped through your teeth though
  i think its past your bedtime anon dont you have school tomorrow
  see    let the democrats spend tens of millions of dollars here he added let them die on the hill in orange county
  kek
  let the democrats spend tens of millions of dollars here he added let them die on the hill in orange county  ahh sweet irony
  lol so now all we have to do is wait for trump to somehow try to spin this into a victory  i won the senate why wont the fake news talk about that instead of the house  t trump
  theres no need commiefornia becoming more democrat changes literally nothing on the national scale democlaps celebrating about turning their 90 hypermajority into a 95 hypermajority is a laugh california has had a negligible republican presence for the last 20 years any republicans left in that skidmark of a state are fleeing as soon as they get the cash im sure the californian virus particles will follow after the state income tax jumps to 30 and both hollywood and silicon valley relocate to washington that being said there needs to be some land designated for public defecation and used heroin needles which california has proven itself the ideal place for
  its okay to be mad republicuck
  see   all these sour grapes
    there are no sour grapes the calculus favored dems in the house and they took it the reward for that will be a government that is stalled for 2 years legislatively this likely means no wall and no additional tax cuts thats a measurable win that can be acknowledged    california republicans have been irrelevant in modern politics democrats have had full control of the state for the last 20 years and have used it to reverse their demographics and effectively turn themselves into a oneparty state consolidating a state where you already have a supermajority is absolutely meaningless theres nothing to be sour about because literally nothing has changed theres no victory its like celebrating mississippi having a 4/5ths republican majority instead of a twothirds if that is what you are celebrating it reeks of desperation
valadao  nunes    based portuguese republicans you know after the slaves were freed in the azores we sent the blacks back to africa out of fear of an uprising and believe it or not the islands are peaceful and crime free today now compare that to an island such as lets say jamaica where the black people remained of course democrats are going to win more once a population becomes more diverse but crime comes with it so if you want to make your bed by all means
 blue wave has turned into the democrats celebrating their continued control over califagfornia via their favorite minority pets  lol
  like other anons have said more representatives in the house is more representatives in the house no matter which state they come from notably orange county was wellknown as one of the last remaining republican strongholds in california and trumps rhetoric managed to lose that too not to mention that it was ultimately the republicans who essentially gave california to the democrats forever with prop 187 because it turns out that when you make extreme antiimmigrant laws in a state thats literally 50 or more immigrants or descendants of immigrants those immigrants are going to vote for the other party
    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  consolidating a state where you already have a supermajority is absolutely meaningless  apparently you arent getting it they picked up 4 seats in the united states house of representatives not the california assembly the democrats already had a sizable majority in the california assembly but they actually did pick up a few more seats anyway though
  oh yeah brah im totally upset that the democratic party solidified control over a solid blue state during a midterm election under a republican president    oh wait no im not because 2018 wasnt an example of anything other then standard midterm churn
  you seem to be confusing the california assembly with the united states house of representatives specifically seats in the house of representives which have been republican for decades
pretty sure they won it using the same methods like they didnt george in florida yeah also heard that they threw those ballot boxes in that big old fire that they had i guess they didnt figure it would be several eyewitnesses who would let the cat out of the bag
  uh you wanna try that sentence again
republicans losing orange county is like if republicans lost the wisconsin state house with how much they rigged the system with extreme gerrymandering   it shouldnt happen unless republicans massively fuck up    guess what they did and with no gerrymandering to save them republicans got slaughtered in california because shock trumps message of antiamericanism and racism doesnt fly in california
democrats are looking to have 61 million votes in their favor for the midterm  in comparison trump got 62 million votes  keep in mind thats comparing a midterm to a presidential election     do the math on how much trouble the republicans and trump are in if the democrats nominate someone with an ounce of charsma in 2020    also during the tea bagger wave republicans got 45 million votes of course they spent their time in power rigging the system to make sure democrats couldnt make similar gains if the roles were reversed
  note of course that 2020 is a census year this will give legislatures ample opportunity to undo the gerrymandering the gop put in eight years ago    before anyone asks yes this is a bad thing regardless of which party does it and in a few states maryland is an example the dems have done it too but the gop has done it far more and in far greater intensity    it needs fixing regardless of who started it
  the reward for that will be a government that is stalled for 2 years legislatively this likely means no wall and no additional tax cuts thats a measurable win that can be acknowledged    there was never going to be a wall even trumptards cant understand his maneuvers apparently the wall is just a fake chip that trump can throw into negotiations and then surrender for concessions while also appealing to the hardline isolationist in the republican party
  poortugal doesnt need black people to be an irrelevant shithole
  1 trump and the republicans are already doing everything they can to sabotage the census in their favor including breaking confidentiality laws  2 its still going to be up to state legislators to draw those lines so theyre going to be just as corrupt as they were unless they can pass a state amendment that bans gerrymandering
  3 more states did that this past election cycle theres a grassroots movement  spearheaded by ahnuld of all people  to reform redistricting so that nonpartisan commissions or mathematical algorithms determine the boundaries of districts and yes theyre doing it by amendment
why doesnt anybody talk about the dems winning lots governorships    arent governess heavily involved win how districts are drawn up every 10 years and thus now a lot of the gop gerymandering in many states will get undone    if im correct for the next 10 years the elections will be harder for republicans to win in its not as long term as the republicans picking supreme court members but its a pretty big blow to republicans    look at how much the republicans are fighting the ballot counting in florida a dem governor in a purple state who also gave voting rights back to convicted felons the republican establishment must be shitting bricks
  unless its outsourced for fairness state legislatures are the ones that draw the maps at least initially governors do have the ability to vote down maps they disagree with though if theres no agreement between the governor or legislature on how the map should be drawn then a court can have an independent commission established to draw it
  which means that by and large all the dems need is the governorship since they prefer simply getting out as much vote as possible over gerrymandering
  as someone who was stationed in lajes youre full of shit fucking hating interacting with chimp locals there
  this happened last time and the time before that too   california is a one party state
  did you forget about lousiana we have the same system
  the california republican party died on a hill named proposition 187 and the gop has been butthurt about commiefornia ever since
  this its shocking that republicans have forgotten that overt racism cost them the most populous state in the union and now theyre quintupling down on it   well see if it costs them mississippi since they got a full retard saying she wants to attend lynchings
yes so them libtrolls wont get away with it
  i wouldnt count on it theyd need to boost black turnout like crazy to make it happen whites in mississippi dont care      its starting to look like dems are going to have to deal with their own split with younger progressives rebelling against older moderates
  unless mississippi went all in on voter suppression like georgia expect to see record turn out among blacks just like in the alabama senate race   i think if thats the case and given the current data the democrat only needs 25 of whites to not be racists or traitors to win
  because republicans are doing everything in their power to cripple what the incoming democratic governors can do
    ap retracts its call on the 21st district democrats are poised to flip their 40th seat of the midterms
  you mean the bill that the people of california voted for and judges blocked it anyways that prop 187  the one that was suppose to stop the state from being flooded with more double digit iq third worlders that prop 187  just to be clear
  you had judges block 187 going against the will of the american people and you are bragging about  insane you head is so far up your own ass
    do something thats unconstitutional  it gets struck down  omfg tyranny  cry moar fag your blind racism cost you california and its why republicans are a third party there now
  no illegal immigration cost republicans california you do realize you dont even need voter id to go vote right theres nothing stopping paco ramirez voting multiple times
  citation needed of your conspiracy theory of mass voter fraud  protip isolated incidents or videos from discredited sources dont count
  children of illegal immigrants that we allowed into the country dont count  actual videos and photos of voter fraud dont count  wow youre off to a great start with a non argument
  moving the goal posts  constitutional granted rights dont count  doctored videos of fraud dont count  you are off to great start for not making an argument at all
  we made the bigots lose because we prioritize shit skins from socialist hellholes to vote for more gibsmethat that we promise  democrats  this is epic
  gets blown the fuck out  has to quote a cuckold in damage control  epic indeed
uncle jeff please calm down grandmas gonna be pissed if she realizes you got into the nog already
  california is a force to be reckoned with its funny how scared the right has gotten of it after 2016 to the extent they treat it like hillary and blame it for everything
  stop bumping old threads please thanks
  only way to stop that is to reimplement the old rule    also thanks to trumps overt racism and antiworker policies unless something crazy happens the california republican party is dead for at least a generation  
  if youre talking about the house of representatives then again that would be an example of what happens during a midterm election
  anyone with a brain should be shitting bricks about felons getting to vote not that most leftist agitators such as yourself understand the problem with that
  hes absolutely correct that illegals vote and vote in droves furthermore their anchorbaby crotchspawn are legal citizens and will also vote for the party of gibs welfare and general liberal faggotry illegal vermin cost the gop california
  no they dont stop making up lies california the leader of america rejects republicans racism and rich first government
  hes absolutely correct that illegals vote and vote in droves  citation needed
  you obviously dont live in corruptifornia  weve been voting the same people into power since the 70s  back in 2016 there was a bill that would have mapped all the power lines and made the power company responsible for clearing dead brush from around them to prevent forest fires  the bill was unanimously approved in legislature  but our governor whos basically been the same one since the 70s and is bought and paid for by the power companies vetoed it
  rich first government  you honestly think california democrats are poor you honestly think california democrats are for the poor are you really that delusional  are you californians are so fucking delusional you actually think that slogans like fight fascism and republicans are racist are actual policy initiatives that affect peoples lives
    economically theyre in good shape compare the budgets of california and a state that went all in on republican trickle down economics like kansas guess which one has a surplus and a strong economy protip not the republican state
    what a way to not address his post about corruption   california used to be a beacon of liberal democracy but now its almost a fascist state
  thats the opposite since they count every vote unlike republican controlled states like north carolina where republicans were caught not only pushing voter suppression but stealing at least one election through voter fraud by stealing peoples ballots
   theyre in good shape    huge wildfires and constant widespread droughts   rolling blackouts especially in summer  overall infrastructure grade c  private and public pensions underfunded by billions of dollars  one of the highest individual tax burdens second only to new york  population growth rate has slowed to 7 a year and dropping  33rd largest state debt in us  lowest qualify of life ranking of all 50 states  theres a reason people are leaving california     compare the budgets of california and a state that went all in on republican trickle down economics like kansas  how about utah and texas which both dont fit into your trickledown strawman rhetoric yet have higher population growth rates lower taxes and better long term economic forecasts
    yeah counting every vote sometimes even twice
  how about utah and texas which both dont fit into your trickledown  then they arent following true republican policies of giving all the money to the rich like the trump tax cut did and is about to burn out cause us to go faster into a recession
  then they arent following my incredibly specific strawman and no true scotsman about what constitutes right wing economics that i got from late night talkshows  ftfy     and is about to burn out cause us to go faster into a recession  thats some quality california public education right there
  then they arent following true republican policies of giving all the money to the rich  youre now aware california is ranked 4th worst in terms of income inequality out of all 50 states    1 is new york of the top 5 listed there only 3 louisiana is a republican state
a new us government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars  or in the worstcase scenario more than 10 of its gdp  by the end of the century  the federally mandated study was supposed to come out in december but was released by the trump administration on friday at a time when many americans are on a long holiday weekend distracted by family and shopping  david easterling director of the technical support unit at the noaa national centers for environmental information emphasized that there was no external interference in the reports development he added that the climate change the earth is experiencing is unlike any other  the global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities easterling said    coming from the us global change research program a team of 13 federal agencies the fourth national climate assessment was put together with the help of 1000 people including 300 leading scientists roughly half from outside the government    its the second of two volumes the first released in november 2017 concluded that there is no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities especially emissions of greenhouse gases    the reports findings run counter to president donald trumps consistent message that climate change is a hoax  on wednesday trump tweeted whatever happened to global warming as some americans faced the coldest thanksgiving in over a century    but the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week its demonstrated by longterm trends    
humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history even if the bestcase scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing the world is on track to warm 11 degrees fahrenheit  as of now not a single g20 country is meeting climate targets research shows  without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees fahrenheit 5 celsius or more by the end of this century compared with preindustrial temperatures the report says  the expense  the costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually according to the report the southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat  farmers will face extremely tough times the quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures drought and flooding in parts of the midwest farms will be able to produce less than 75 of the corn they produce today and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25 of its soybean yield  heat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 060 and 135 over the next 12 years  having already cost the industry 12 billion from heat stress in 2010    when it comes to shellfish there will be a 230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification which is already killing off shellfish and corals red tides or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life  like those that triggered a state of emergency in florida in august  will become more frequent    impacts on our health  higher temperatures will also kill more people the report says the midwest alone which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature will see an additional 2000 premature deaths per year by 2090
there will be more mosquito and tickborne diseases like zika dengue and chikungunya west nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures   xpect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change  no ones health is immune from climate change the report concludes people will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer children the elderly the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death    heat and flooding  wildfire seasons  already longer and more destructive than before  could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the united states burned areas in southwestern california alone could double by 2050  dependable and safe water for the hawaii the caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures  along the us coasts public infrastructure and 1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels flooding and storm surges  energy systems will be taxed meaning more blackouts and power failures and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century the report said  the number of days over 100 degrees fahrenheit will multiply chicago where these days are rare could start to resemble phoenix or las vegas with up to two months worth of these scorchinghot days  sea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900 almost half that rise has been since 1993 a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2800 years some countries are already seeing land underwater  by midcentury its likely that the arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer and that could lead to more permafrost thaw according to the report as the permafrost thaws more carbon dioxide and methane would be released amplifying humaninduced warming possibly significantly
what can be done  the report was created to inform policymakers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem however it suggests that if the united states immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country   the defense department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security but the trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the paris climate accord aimed at lowering global temperatures claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the us economy  a report from the un in october urged all governments to take rapid farreaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disaster from climate change that report predicted that the earth will reach the crucial threshold of 15 degrees celsius 27 degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by as early as 2030 it also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought wildfires floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people    time for action  reactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community  if were going to run this country like a business its time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost said robert bullard an environmental scientist at texas southern university  in houston communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from washington that climate change is the cause weve known for years that its true and its important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered but believed and acted upon    scientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings
the findings in the trump administrations nca report show how the health and daily lives of americans are becoming more and more interrupted because of climate change said beverly wright founding director of the deep south center for environmental justice and a professor at dillard university we challenge the administration to finally begin using this information to rebuild and strengthen the communities in the direct path of the atrocities wrought by the fossil fuel industry and decades of poor policies that have neglected our concerns the science is undeniable lets fix it        trump continues to be a climate change denier ignoring the facts when it suits while and puts the country at risk by feeding the dirty fuel industry and openly sabotaging plans to combat climate change
  how much of the greenhouse gasses emitted each year come from the us as of 2018
  im sure if trump gets away with his schemes itll be a lot more  
  dodging the question its 15 85 of it comes from other countries which the us has no control over
  bullshit excuse especially when other countries are moving over to green energy like china and taking over the market that america should have dominated and control the world market if it werent for republicans sabotaging it in favor of dirty fuel
oy vey holocaust
  i saw how the central government tried to solve climate change before it was awful    clash for clunkers destroyed old cars and gave out tax rebates for new cars it was a retread on the fdr plan of taking fields full of grain and razing them to the ground to prop up the grain industry    i saw the electronic vehicles that were glorified golf carts that broke down within months and cost 6500 but because the subsidies and costs lined up they were free only problem being the 6500 had to come from somewhere and it turned out to be from the tax payer    the great recession was in part as bad as it was because bureaucrats and central planners tried to fix the economy by fiat and the american people suffered the great recession only got that title and not something like the 197374 stock market crash because it had the worst recovery since the great depression because central planning does not work
  i use one example of how it didnt work perfectly that means everything is flawed  john stossel    the great recession recession was caused by republican policies it took so long to fix because of republican obstructions central planning is not effective when republicans sabotage it
  so how did the republicans sabotage the soviet union and stop it from working  its not a single time central planning doesnt work  thats the lesson of the 20th century
  first terrible example and it shows desperation on your part  strong government policy / total government control  if you need proof on green energy can be successful with government policy look at slar panels even with republicans sabotaging it        if you think leaving things to their own devices is a good idea look at how giving all the money to the rich always causes the economy to crash or governments to violently collapse french revolution
  it can be successful but withotu government policy    these things cost a few hundred a pop  meanwhile with government action    they spend billions for no result    overcost over budget spending billions on something that could be better done by private industry  thats the result of government
  15 is actually pretty bad considering we make up only 4 of the planets population and our nations wealth and technology should be reducing our carbon footprint
  and just to throw out even more numbers the only country with a greater carbon footprint is china at a whopping 25 of the total the entire eu is below 10 no single country besides the usa and china are over 7 two countries generating 40 of worlds green house emissions
  electric vehicles   the only one waging war on them private industry       private is better than public              also look at how shitty american healthcare is if you need proof that private industry is better than a public one
  also china is working to boost their green energy industry to the point solar panel production has been outsourced from america to china    trump and the republicans are once again surrendering to the chinese
  big dig  the project where the government hired private contractors aka the private sector instead of doing it themselves  thanks for proving the private sector is a giant scam
u environmentalists are embarrassing fuck reducing a carbon footprint we wernt made to be on this planet forever use up all these resources and get us the fuck out
  china  green energy    m8 youre so naive that it hurts rule no 1 china is gonna china no matter what get acquainted with this rule because it is the rule they can claim to lower emissions they can claim to eat less dog meat they can claim to make their dumplings out of actual foodstuffs it doesnt mean theyre actually going to do it their factories are staying put their dogs are ripe for the picking and their dumplings are cardboard even if they claim otherwise because they are on track to becoming number one china never tells the truth     muh rerpubilcans    heres how i know youre especially special
  classic right wing logic   this is why youre the bad guys always
  so much for agw being a chinese plot to subvert us industry
  it has america goes all in on a dying industry while china leads with the future
  warming is good cold kills more people than warmth does
a 10 contraction is like half a great depression maybe it wont be great but it will still certainly be a depression much worse than the 2008 recession get ready
everyone knows overpopulation is at the root of every environmental problem that exists the solution is to send more dumb poor people to war
  send more dumb poor people to become soylent  let them at least reimburse their carbon footprint
im starting to think that all this hubbub is really an excuse for why everyone is going to have to be poor again before the end of the century
  poor  id say dead is more likely  the current poor will die first though if it makes you feel any better
  the problem is if the poor start dying off theyre going to come after the rich to take them with them like the french revolution and just like then theres a lot of poor people to fight off and they will be fully armed thanks to the republicans fetizising the 2nd amendment
when did /news/ turn into the orange man bad subreddit this is a fucking opinion piece    the federally mandated study was supposed to come out in december but was released by the trump administration on friday at a time when many americans are on a long holiday weekend distracted by family and shopping  see this this is an opinion this is orange man bad nonsense by some hack cnn reporter     do you guys have a discord where you have made it your goal to just shit in this board until its yours
    everyone knows that trump is a retard dude his policies are horrible so all the conservatives can go die in a fire
  if you look at how slow the recovery was under obama when he tried to fix the climate change issue continuing the cure is worse than the disease
  not when you take into account deaths from vector born diseases which would be expected to increase as the earth warms
cnn  try again
  you really think youre on /r/politics huh
  were not getting off this planet bub even if we could colonise mars by the time climate change brings about its worst effects wed only have a couple of thousand ultrarich fucks living there while everyone else is stuck here on earth     better get used to the coming heatwaves bucko i like societies on the brink of collapse salted with a bit of pandemic for good measure
  im deeply apologetic if not being in your farright safe space triggers you in fact maybe you should go back there for your own peace of mind  
  when will the effects kill us oh wise one isnt it the coolest its been currently and how will democratic policies change this all if its so terrible right now
  hard to say i put the time frame at between 50 and 500 years either way you and i are going to see major climatechange related calamities in the future    democratic policies dont do enough but they will definitely ease the burden on the environment by not allowing civilisation to get away with reckless pollution honestly our only chance for longterm survival is to radically deindustrialise and move towards localised craftbased economies but thats not happening any time soon     hope you like the heat friend
  this  /news/ is not a safe space for /pol/ppets
  democratic policies dont do enough but they will definitely ease the burden on the environment by not allowing civilisation to get away with reckless pollution  how specifically
we wouldnt be having this conversation if your candidate wasnt actively trying to escalate proxy wars and exploited hurricane relief shouldnt be that hard right to understand    this wedge issue will surely have enough rhetoric to eclipse larger more immediate problems like foreign policy and immigration
trump just claimed hes to smart to trust climate change science
  i so hope i can join the military  also human beings genus homo have been in warmer spells around half a million years ago but this go around is the most severe bc of all the excess technology
trump team complains climate report has too much science in it  trumps epa chief a former coal lobbyist just wants a climate change report that makes coal look better is that too much to ask    the government just released a stunning 1600page report on the devastating effects of climate change a collaboration of hundreds of scientists across 13 federal agencies thoroughly reviewing the best scientific evidence available    but since the trump administration prefers to deny climate change the coal lobbyist currently running the epa decided to unleash a conspiracy theory blaming the obama administration for all of that inconvenient science    and i dont know this for a fact  i wouldnt be surprised if the obama administration told the reports authors to take a look at the worst case scenario for this report said acting epa administrator andrew wheeler according to politico    wheeler said he wants to take a look at the modeling thats used for the next assessment  strongly suggesting that he thinks the trump administration should meddle with the methodology of the next climate report    wheeler also whined that the report did not put enough emphasis on how great coal is    coal has not yet peaked worldwide in its usage wheeler claimed    unlike the authors of the climate report wheeler had no evidence or data to back up his claims    mr wheelers insinuation is absolutely false john holdren president obamas science adviser told politico in response to wheelers claims about obama improperly dictating the reports contents    for one thing most of the work on the report was done during the trump administration    further the report looks at a range of scenarios not simply a worstcase scenario as alleged by wheeler
assertions by high officials of the trump administration that these are worst case reports are nothing more than a flimsy attempt to discredit the careful and comprehensive work of some of the best climate scientists in the country inside and outside of government holdren added    the report that has wheeler in a tizzy is the national climate assessment a congressionally mandated report    among the more disturbing conclusions from the report include more intense wildfires in the west and catastrophic damage to coastal property due to rising sea levels    trump himself decided to just bury his head in the sand claiming that he simply doesnt believe the conclusions    in a recent washington post interview trump claimed that he has a very high level of intelligence but is not a believer in climate change in the same interview trump also asserted my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody elses brain can ever tell me    trump has no formal training in science but did manage to bankrupt a casino and once landed a small cameo appearance in the 1992 hit movie home alone 2 lost in new york    and in a nod to his former industry one of the wheelers first acts as acting epa administrator was to allow the coal industry to dump more waste into rivers
trump says hes not a racist thats not how white nationalists see it    cnn  white supremacists are saying they were winners in last weeks midterm elections    this changed history it cleared away any of the remaining fog of confusion about what exactly we are dealing with in this country daily stormer founder and publisher andrew anglin wrote this is a race war period    a commenter on the 4chan bulletin board joked trump was winking at them  earlier another poster declared trump was venerated by white supremacists what dems all leftists and pundits do not understand is that trump is patriots and western/american heritages champion  to alcindor trump repeated two more times how racist the question was but he also never flatly denounced white supremacists they were overjoyed calling the press conference glorious and beautiful on 4chan with one commenter writing i am honestly in awe of this man as a leader    on places like 4chan false talk of the migrant caravan as invaders has taken over on some of the message boards and become a popular meme topic analysts say the browning of america where whites become a minority is what the white supremacists fear most  there are threads with memes containing photos doctored to look like people breaking down walls at the us border with mexico there are jokes about how the traditional rush of black friday shoppers is nothing compared to what would happen next in another thread on 4chan commentators speculate about how many people would be shot as they come over the border the thread appeared to reference trumps comment that us troops on the border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones all of them one poster wrote of a possible casualty count not enough said another    
  i fucking hate /pol/ for bringing 4chinchangchong back into the media without party vans
/pol/ has always arbitrarily declared victory and so does trump
  /pol/ for bringing 4chinchangchong back into the media  its not /pol/s fault the media is run by vultures looking to sensationalize anything they can get their hands on for profit    /pol/ has always arbitrarily declared victory and so does trump  remember when hillary was so far ahead in the polls she doesnt even think about trump anymore
  in a functional democracy being 3 million votes ahead of your opponent would be a clear win she was simply too naive to believe americas stupid election system would work in her favor
god its just so completely transparent and yet most people will read this and readily conclude the opposition is full of nazi bigots if i recall correctly the poll i read said 60 of democrats see republicans as racist sexist bigots wew lads wew
  prove them wrong then
  prove them wrong by voting for our side  no
  i have nothing to prove im categorically opposed to nazism and white nationalism and dont read or post on /pol/ and i distance myself from all of that like most do in my party yet unfortunately this kind of propaganda effectively informs the prejudices of the majority of democrats  the actual solution is to stop consuming this garbage thats where you come in
  americas stupid election system  yeah its only been around for 242 years    campaigning in fucking california instead of swing states isnt naivety about americas electoral system its naivety about how many people actually liked her hillary lost states the democrats hadnt lost in thirty years
    i was thinking more in terms of wholeheartedly denouncing the next extremist who shows up instead of wishy washy its your fault he tried to blow you up language
  lol what
    imagine being this retarded
  true
  tiki torches instead of actual torches  it still makes me laugh surely they knew how retarded they looked right
  ahh yes that old myth
  its another /pol/ is the whole of 4chan episode  /pol/ used to be so much fun when it was all shit posting and irony now its just retards
  ahh yes that old myth  consider psychiatric help
  kek my first thoughts as well
  this protest sponsored by pier 1 imports and your local iparty
  consider that the russians actually did rig the 2016 election like everyone says
  their only noticeable impact on the election was the dnc hack which wouldnt have sunk a candidate not already an unlikable fleshrobot already in an email scandal 100 of her own making
  but her emails  what about trumps tapped cellphone  but her emails
  the russians didnt have anything to do with her emails because her emails were on her server which was owned and operated by americans and then investigated for potential breaches of law by other americans with no foreigners in the loop
  i always enjoy when the argument moves slightly forward to it happened but
  i never once said it didnt happen our retarded friend is trying to advance some sort of retarded argument that nothing hillary clinton did as a candidate like not campaigning in battleground states and not understanding the electoral college could have possibly mattered because the russians somehow made 100 of hillarys actions 100 irrelevant
  when every person with a facebook account in a battleground state is being flooded with literally made up news about hillary being arrested for the latest podesta leak or taking a fictional 9 billion from the saudis or being frogmarched out of a campaign rally in handcuffs by the fbi then yes hillarys real life actions were irrelevant
youre all faggots
  12 billion dollars of clinton campaign spending  literally zero effect  600 million dollars of republican campaign spending  literally zero effect  1 million dollars of russian campaign spending  singlehandedly awarded hillary the election literally nothing hillary did mattered
  if the gop and the russians dindu nuffin then why are trump and the gop so transparently desperate to stop the russian investigation at all costs
  if the gop and the russians dindu nuffin  when did i say or imply that the gop and the russians dindu nuffin    would it be too much for you for your replies to have any casual connection to the posts that they reply to
  consider gerrymandering has not been around for very long is not allowed in more civilized democracies and is abused by republicans wholeheartedly to give themselves wins in states where most of the voters are democrats get fucked
  kek
   thats not how white nationalists see it  they also think hilter was a good guy doesnt make it true
  they most likely thought it looked cool
  you didnt answer the other half of the question
  actual torches were illegal to the best of my knowledge the marches were doing their best to express outrage while being within the law      the us isnt a democracy its a republic it was in the constitution and the founding fathers have said why direct democracy is a terrible idea this isnt news to anyone
  its not a real question
  its not a pure republic either as with most thing on large scales pure adherence to one method doesnt work
  republic  it is primarily and solely a republic having elected officials does not make it not a republic  people are responsible for the clandestine operations of the military which is why there is whistleblower protection    a political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them  a political order whose head of state is not a monarch and in modern times is usually a president  i can smell your soy from here
  how is being held hostage by 3 states any more of an improvement than what we have now    at least the electoral reform groups seek to fix the systems so that current swing stakes lose some of their influence
  held hostage  blue states are such because of the population of major cities dependent on liberal governments to pay their bills   red states are usually those with smaller population whose citizens have higher levels of responsibility for themselves in maintaining their lives    the system isnt broken its being exploited by anyone who can figure out a way how to win votes and influence in the cities where there are more desperate people
  which is why it makes sense to mend the system than throw it out all together for example this paper  goes over one way of fixing the holes in it now after all the system has been around for over 200 years and the number of states have more than doubled than what it started with     no change would ever be perfect but walking the path of mob rule just be changing who needs to be pandered to     on the people level yea the pandering is never going away every side does it
  imagine being this retarded
  hey dumbass what youre describing is exactly what the electoral college does if we had the popular vote every single voter would have exactly the same power presidential races would not be decided at the state level it would turn the whole thing into a national race where even blue state republicans who currently have no voice in the presidential election would suddenly have a voice and the same with red state democrats
stuff like this is why i go independent elephants and donkeys throw too much mud at each other
  the us isnt a democracy  false    it is a representative democracy where officials are elected by democratic means it is also a republic but that is irrelevant
  blah blah blah both sides are the same  yeah sure vlad
  those are literally the exact same thing
  this is why every thread needs mandatory loli goru porn dumps to dissuade annoying lurkers
  frick off will ya
  get a load of this guy
  in a functional democracy being 3 million votes ahead of your opponent would be a clear win  the united states is a democracy  imagine being this fucking stupid    she was simply too naive to believe americas stupid election system would work in her favor  the united states of america consists of several smaller state governments unionized under a single larger federal government states elect the president of the union the masses do not the states decide who they are going to elect by democratically taking a vote from the people who reside in their respective jurisdiction if we elected the president via popular vote instead of electoral vote every election would be decided by the state with the largest population california texas  new york which would upset the balance of power between state  federal governments causing the union to fall in on itself civil war 2 there is a reason why we are called the united states of america and not the peoples republic of america luckily our founding fathers had enough insight to realize that democracy is flawed system of government that would instantly fall to tyranny of the majority  created the electoral college as a safeguard while the electoral college is in no way or shape perfect it is a much better system than mob rule  democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch    saying clinton should have won because she had more popular votes is fucking retarded and the equivalent of saying clinton should have beat trump at the football game because she scored more home runs she essentially won a game that no one was playing  leftist use it as an excuse for getting their asses absolutely whipped during the election  pic related    on a final note idiots like yourself who dont even have a basic understanding of civics are prime example of why democracies fail in the first place  better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt
  it is a representative democracy where officials are elected by democratic means  false ive explained it here    senators  legislators are elected democratically the president is not because states vote for the president the masses to not    i also forgot you cant post pics here so here is a link to the map that i was referencing  
  this national socialist germany and the soviet were both antidemocratic states ran by dictators but were also republics    democracy / republic    democrat rule by the people  republican rule by the law
  it still makes me laugh surely they knew how retarded they looked right  yes and no /pol/ is a little more self aware than /leftypol/ im pretty sure half was doing it unironically and the other half was doing it for shits and giggles if you watch video recorded by the people who actually marched and not by the msm trying to make them look a lot more menacing then they were a lot of them were making fun of themselves trying to make the situation as ridiculous as possible
  hey dumbass what youre describing is exactly what the electoral college does if we had the popular vote every single voter would have exactly the same power  hey dumbass what youre suggesting would give states with the largest population california texas florida new york  pennsylvania all the voting power  would completely make votes from the other 45 states completely pointless    presidential races would not be decided at the state level it would turn the whole thing into a national race where even blue state republicans who currently have no voice in the presidential election would suddenly have a voice and the same with red state democrats  we are the united states of america not the peoples republic of america presidential elections are supposed to be decided at the state level you fucking retard
    is that you sock puppet  finally came crawling back after your side got crushed in the midterms
  imagine being able to respond to posts instead of people
  woah
  everyone who disagrees with me is a sock puppet  here we go again oh well thread was nice while it lasted i guess
  mad
  cnn  into the trash
  to be fair /pol/ wouldnt do that if they werent always right
  yes circular logic is a wonderful instrument of cognitive dissonance
  orange bad
  id rather cuckservatives grow a pair and prove them right more right than they could ever imagine if they want a demon so badly they should be given one and feel actual fear for their demonizing rhetoric
  2017  daily stormer does media anaylsis on cnn articles  2018  cnn is doing media analysis on daily stormer articles    kek
  missing the joke  shut up virgin
  only been around for  longest system of government still in existence  that being said no system can last forever fascism should be americas next system of governance

  whats /pol
  r/pol is a subreddit not a part of 4channel
  consider that the russians actually did rig the 2016 election like everyone says  in what way
  why do liberals think that constantly moving goalposts constitutes a victory
  gop lost the most house seats in an election since watergate  only net gained 4 senate seats in return and considering dems gained a seat in 2078 the senate has barely moved at all between 2016 and 2018  most of the places where the democrats won the hardest were in the rust belt and the midwest places which were essential to trumps victory in 2016  democrats also won lots of governorships in places like wisconsin which were also vital to trumps victory  it was a big win for democrats no matter how much spin you put on it and the republicans gained nothing in return
  gain a small majority including bluedogs who will vote with reps on some things in the house  lose even more senate seats  this is somehow the magical blue wave  when republicans get a red wave they take both chambers with near supermajority numbers
  its going to be a massive blue wave of democrats on election  maybe the blue wave wont be that big but were going to take both chambers of congress  maybe we wont take over congress but at least we will flip fl tx and ga  well at least we won the house    one week after polls closed after much election fuckery and after 20 races flipped from red to blue on found ballets the left is claiming flawless victory im sure this is exactly what they were imagining when they were making their predictions back in march
  this without the power of democrat electoral commissioners to find ballots weeks after election day they would have got their asses kicked
  trump isnt racist but /pol/ is and you niggers dont belong here back to plebbit
        bootlickers desperate to push that damage control  implying the dems taking the senate was ever considered anything more than a longshot especially in the most incumbentfriendly senate map in modern history  implying republican incumbents just barely managing to hold on to states like texas and georgia is anything to celebrate  implying trump can afford to lose the rust belt like he did in this election  implying republicans werent confidently expecting to hold the house too  meanwhile  making unfounded claims that democrats following election law are trying to rig the votes when there are actual documented cases of extreme gerrymandering by republicans  keep those republicuck tears flowing
  get ready for clinton vs trump round 2 in 2020 after she ratfucks the other dems in the primary and blows it in the general 
  implying the dems will be stupid enough to let her anywhere near the general ever again
  we arent licking the boots were wearing them youll be licking them when we grind them on your face
  just like in these midterms right buddy
  the ones where you failed to take the senate and thus cant prevent trump from doing whatever he wants the one where you give him perfect cover for blaming the dem controlled house for any policy that stalls lol
   unfounded claims that democrats following election law    get a load of this faggot acting like none of us were paying attention when every news station on in country was reporting the shit going down in broward
  its honestly within our rights to remove these ds from their seats by force stolen elections can and should be rightfully restored to the gop by military force some might cry about the constitution but we live in extraordinary times
  implying the dems will be stupid enough to let her anywhere near the general ever again  oh they are anon they let her run again after she fucked up big time in 2008 and they will again after her 2016 fuckup
  muh ten misplaced votes  pplease ignore us purging the voter rolls of all the fucking niggers though    implying losing the house and the power to rubberstamp legislation without getting anything major done is a victory for the gop  implying stopping trump from making our country into even more of a laughingstock isnt exactly what nonrepublicans want
  he thinks that the military is on trumps side  if you werent too much of an actual pussy to do anything but whine on internet forums it would be you getting shot in the street like a dog not true americans
  implying stopping trump from making our country into even more of a laughingstock    stop sucking euro dick and you wont have to worry about what they think
  congress can technically refuse to seat new members if it really made a difference then they could do it but it wont so best not give the crybabies something else to whine about
  so your answer is to suck trumps dick
  they posted memes to facebook that tens of thousands of voters could have seen our democracy almost died that day
  turning the country into a laughing stock  imagine being such a faggot that you crave praise from massively unpopular neoliberals like merkle and macron
  nuh uh you suck dick  fuck dude at least act like youve been here before
  imagine being such a faggot that you crave praise from massively unpopular protofascists like trump
  that anon got his butt hole stretched for the first time and the only thing he can do now is cry nuh uh you are
  anyone i dont like is reddit  projecting much t_dfag
  ironic that the fag crying about projecting cant do anything except for that
all these /pol/ppet tears over the blue wave even after republicans did everything in their power to be as undemocratic and unamerican as possible to win and still lost the house and multiple states trump needs to keep to even have a chance at reelection    cant wait for the military and secret service to throw his ass out of the white house when hell inevitably refuse to recognize the results of the election after he loses and tries to declare himself president for life in 2020
  i lost so i better cry and project my anger on my opponents while insisting that i won all along  typical /pol/tard strategy
  im not projecting youre the projector  loving every laugh /pol/ppet
how is cnn so lazy that it has just decided to copypaste articles from the daily stormer
  which is it am i from reddit or pol because throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks just shows everyone how incompetent you are
  because real americans have to informed on what trumps base is thinking
  am i from reddit or pol  theyre the same thing silly /pol/ppet
  daily stormer is the rightwing equivalent of some larpy leftwing news sites like jacobin or pravda no one but crazy people take it seriously
  /pol/ buzzwords  t_d in full damage control
  lmao whats the buzzword
  hes pleading ignorance or hes really that stupid  as expected of a /pol/ppet
  whats /pol/
  lurk moar
  i dont see it in the 4channel boards  stop making shit up lol
  lurk moar
  i typed in  and nothing came up
  lurk moar
  he cant even spell words properly   nice try newfag
  lurk moar
  whats that mean friend
  lurk moar
  /pol/ is basically reddit
  i win the argument by chanting the same words over and over
  trump doesnt seem very opposed to white nationalism you support him white supremacists support him because they think hes a white supremacist you cant support trump or even generally be a republican without being a white nationalist today youre just the latest person who wants to be racist and vote racist but not get called racist
  if i recall correctly the poll i read said 60 of democrats see republicans as racist sexist bigots wew lads wew  poll  what kind though i dont know what they are called in english but if its not one of the polls where they actually call people and its just one of the polls where they ask people to come to them you need to remember that there are often way more opinionated people that take their time to do them     i dont know where you are from/where you go but i think you should consider a lot of internet the internet is in a vacuum
  any of /pol/  self aware  shiggydiggy
  hey dumbass what youre suggesting would give states with the largest population california texas florida new york  pennsylvania all the voting power  would completely make votes from the other 45 states completely pointless    no it just means the votes outside of swing states will actually count for something you can be a republican new yorker or a democrat texan and your vote will still matter and your vote wont be worth 10x more than someone elses just because you happen to be from wyoming    the 5 states you listed arent even half of the us population by the way you need to add up the top 10 states before you reach half so they would in no way be the sole deciders of an election
  nobody cares about what you care about the issue
  hey dumbass what youre suggesting would give states with the largest population california texas florida new york  pennsylvania all the voting power  would completely make votes from the other 45 states completely pointless  not true at all it would be decided by individual voters theres no deciding state the voters are the deciding factor    the popular vote is how every race in the country with the sole exception of the president is decided and no one sees any problem with that why is the president any different
  no one sees any problem with that why is the president any different  most people dont really care about any of the other elections anything about the presidential election is the only election they care about how its done  most people cant name their own senators i doubt they know or have issue with how theyre elected
  the presidential election really wouldnt be handled any differently we already count the popular vote because it affects the electoral vote if anything it would actually make elections run smoother and faster electoral votes can only be determined by counting every single vote and sometimes states have to do a recount so it can keep the electoral vote up in the air for a few days with the popular vote you can determine the winner with a high degree of certainty on election day just by looking at the remaining votes and the odds that those votes can close the gap between the candidates or if it can even close the gap at all
  seething that no one will spoonfed him  sorry no russians in /news/ to tell what to think
  you dont have the political power to get rid of the ec bitching about it is retarded just get over it
  bitching about it is the only way things can change and i will continue to do so until it happens
  its your human right to be racist  people have just as much of a right to be racist as niggers do to exist    laughter stops
  using the popular vote also just increases the legitimacy of incoming presidents since no one can complain they won but they lost the popular vote
  whats even the point in arguing about it then
   same thing that always happens in midterms happens again minus senate   u got crushed drumpf bigots11111    history is more valuable to know than editorials /leftypol/
  holy fuck looks like we found one boys    drumpf lost 34 house seats in his 1st   midterm obummer lost 64 seats in his 1st midterm     here is something more suited for your npc underdeveloped mind     fuck off shill
  bbut i was told blue wave
  states have to do a recount  and some states are florida and have to do this all the god damn time
  bitching about it is the only way things can change and i will continue to do so until it happens  hate to break it to you but aboslutely zero shits will be given on capital hill over what a pleb is bitching about  all either party cares about is getting power and staying in power and if your issue happens to align with their goals they will become champions of the cause otherwise your just wasting your breath
isnt anywhere safe from goddamned /pol/acks  worse than bronies worse than furries i swear  
  this is literally the last board that one should expect to be free from /pol/acks given that what constitutes ontopic overlaps by about 90    its really more amazing that there arent more than there are
    president donald trump on monday suggested the us should form a staterun global news network to counter what he called unfair coverage from cnn    while cnn doesnt do great in the united states based on ratings outside of the us they have very little competition trump said via twitter throughout the world cnn has a powerful voice portraying the united states in an unfair and false way    the president added something has to be done including the possibility of the united states starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are great    the us already has governmentfunded news outlets such as voice of america but its not as prominent or wellknown as privately run outlets like cnn trump apparently wants to change that though its not clear how serious he was in this regard the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment from insider    trump has long feuded with cnn which hes often described as fake news and the enemy of the people the president often tweets more positively about fox news and some seem to feel its already a de facto staterun news outlet in the us    the concept of staterun news outlet is controversial in democratic societies because of its association with authoritarian regimes and propaganda in countries like north korea and china media is strictly controlled and monitored by the government
  this is a joke   the last thing we need is a news organization that is under the control of the government
  but trump already has fox news  thats defacto state tv
  no that would be cnn and msnbc
  gas lighting
  outside of the us they have very little competition  al jizzera and bbc say hi
  yes cnn and msnbc gas light all the time what else is new chode
  they report the facts you lie   difference    notice how the times cnn or msnbc get caught in lies its always from conservative pundits a majority of the time
  but fox news already exists
  chode  this is the level of discourse on the right
  also why do you think that cnn and msnbc are state run the state is literally the state of trump    for now
  so when they say trump is forming a thousand year reich and is making concentration camps at the border thats reporting facts
  hit dog will holler the post
  sayings prove im right  also  hit dog  every dog will holler  act surprised when hit dog hollers  that holler must prove im onto something    this is the power of rightwing intellectuals
the university of minnesota agreed to pay a large sum to a former student who claims that after she was raped in cuba an academic advisor blamed her for being culturally insensitive    natalie carlson sued the university claiming that the rape happened while she studied abroad in 2014 and that was mistreated afterwards by the university chaperone and anthropology lecturer melisa riviere the university of minnesota settled for 137500 last year a settlement that came to light after a freedom of information act request from the st paul pioneer press standard media practice is to avoid naming rape victims but carlson agreed to be named publicly in the pioneer press report    carlson a political science major with a spanish minor planned to research homelessness in puerto rico and government housing in cuba for her senior thesis as part of that work she was interviewing locals about their living situations during the studyabroad trip    according to the lawsuit the studyabroad program hired a man named marcel benet to work as an interpreter for the students in cuba he and carlson walked through several neighborhoods before arriving at benets house ostensibly to interview benet himself there he allegedly trapped her in his bedroom and raped her multiple times    carlsons roommate found her crying afterwards in their hotel room and informed riviere but the lawsuit claims that rather than being supportive riviere blamed the victim  
the next day riviere told carlson she should have known better than to go with benet the complaint states riviere said carlson should have been more aware of cultural differences and that at least the interpreter was a gentleman and walked her home after the pioneer press reports    when reporting the crime to the cuban authorities carlson was made to share a cab with her alleged rapist she declined to press charges after being informed that she would have to stay in the country for the duration of legal process carlson also filed a complaint against riviere back in the united states but the university of minnesota decided not to punish her and she remained an advisor on carlsons research project
  haha she literally got raped and was told it was her fault for being culturally insensitive  how do leftists even take themselves seriously
couldnt make this shit up this kind of leftist mental retardation is like something you would see in britain sweden or canuckistan
but she was being culturally insensitive wasnt she wouldnt want to be an imperialist by imposing your cultures and values on a superior third world culture now would we
  i dont know how you vet someone to make sure they arent a rapist but they really should more careful what random people they hire as translators
  riviere didnt blame the victim because she holds leftists views that became warped you idiots she blamed the victim in a move to protect herself because she hired the translatorshe just warped thoughts on cultural sensitivity to protect herself no way she really believed that shit
a district of columbia clerk and a supervisor refused to accept a new mexico mans state drivers license as he sought a marriage license because she and her supervisor believed new mexico was a foreign country    gavin clarkson told the las cruces sunnews it happened nov 20 at the district of columbia courts marriage bureau as he tried to apply for a marriage license    after approaching the clerk for a license and showing his new mexico id clarkson said the clerk told him he needed an international passport to get the marriage license    clarkson said he protested to a supervisor who also told him that he needed a foreign passport    the clerk finally concluded new mexico was a state after clarkson objected three times the clerk granted the license to clarkson and his fiancée    she thought new mexico was a foreign country clarkson said of the clerk all the couples behind us waiting in line were laughing    clarkson who is an enrolled member of the choctaw nation said if hed had his tribal identification card he might have had an easier time than showing his new mexico drivers license    in a statement the dc courts system acknowledged the staff error to the sunnews    we understand that a clerk in our marriage bureau made a mistake regarding new mexicos 106year history as a state leah h gurowitz spokeswoman for dc courts said in an email we very much regret the error and the slight delay it caused a new mexico resident in applying for a dc marriage license    new mexico became a us state in 1912    
  new mexico was a foreign country    dumbfuck new mexico is a forign country
dc huh how much you wanna bet the clerk was some idiot sheboon
  pretty much sure money
  more like they got the one republican clerk in dc
      stop making this political
whoa slow down there buddytheres a new mexico
  stop making this political  we could question why an event occurred in the op but i guess that would be rude how was school today son
  no your just being stupid  its just as dumb as saying i bet the clerk was black  the certs race or voting preference had little to do with this the clerk was just an idiot
if you wanna make it political the problem is obviously education quality or lack of
    yes blacks are uneducated more news on /news/ at 11
another example of how fucked up stupid dc really is
its interesting because it happens the other way around too people with district of columbia drivers licenses were getting rejected at bard ans tsa airport lines because they thought it was referring to colombia the country it was bad enough that they changed the driver licenses and license plates back to washington dc
  i know its hard but think before you let your bias speak for you were talking about a government worker in dc are the chances greater it was a generic republican or sheboonya
  a district of columbia clerk and a supervisor    blacks nuff said
the government is set to relax its immigration rules to let more foreign doctors come to britain to help tackle the nhss widespread shortages of medics the guardian can reveal    ministers have agreed to significantly expand the 1500 doctors a year allowed to come and work in britain under the medical training initiative mti the move could result in the maximum number of noneu medics able to come rising to as many as 3000    the length of time young doctors from outside the eu are able to stay in britain under the scheme may also rise from two to three years according to wellplaced sources    
why dont they spend more money and resources on training more doctors at home  oh thats right they are white people and white people r bad
  wasnt the whole point of brexit to reduce foreigners
    i think the point was the difference between inviting who they wanted rather than having to accept whatever trash happened to show up
  but in the end the nhs is going to import doctors not from western countries a lowering of standards in going to be inevitable
  british people nowadays are too lazy to become doctors
  its cheaper than to train doctors basically its parasiting the education system of other countries
  no its all about the money    the country of the immigrant doctor pays for his expensive education it saves the uk govt money to hire foreign doctors    if youre a native from uk and want to be a doctor you get the short end of the stick its basically how free market  movement of people works    unless you artificially set stuff like tariffs the 1st world working class will get stiffed the stupid politicians dont think of consequences in a normal society the working class would be compensated with social programs like being retrained to be programmers or something    the bailing out of creditors in 2008 caused all this
      in addition the nhs is apparently horrible to work with as a doc a lot of uk doctors move to australia or similar countries because of this
a father of a parkland school shooting victim appeared on fox  friends over the weekend and suggested without evidence that democrats registered the accused shooter to vote from jail as part of an effort to steal floridas election    it just shows you how despicable these democrats are that theyll stoop that low to go into the prison the jail and register these criminals said andrew pollack whose daughter meadow was one of 17 people nikolas cruz allegedly shot and killed at marjory stoneman douglas high school in february its never been done in 20 years    citing a tip from deputies at the jail pollack said the plan failed because broward county  which is now involved in a recount battle that could swing floridas senate and gubernatorial elections  failed to send the inmates their ballots in time to vote    they probably shouldnt be voting anyway foxs katie pavlich remarked after listening to pollacks accusations which neither she nor her two cohosts challenged at any point although they contradicted all public evidence    there was a kernel of truth at the heart of the segment and the spiraling social media outrage that accompanied it nikolas jacob cruz really did register to vote in july listing his home address as the county jail where he awaits trial after police say he confessed to the mass shooting    he registered as a republican which fox  friends didnt mention    
there is nothing suspicious or mysterious about what cruz did from his cell in general jail inmates are constitutionally entitled to register and vote before their trials assuming no prior convictions or legal disqualifications broward county records show that in 2016 and previous elections several inmates did exactly that from the same jail where cruz now sits    its absolutely normal its his constitutional right said broward county sheriffs office spokeswoman veda colemanwright nothing different happened this year from any other year    the fox hosts were buying into a grieving fathers statements she added theyre lies    pollack who has vocally supported school security reform and republican politicians since his daughters death could not be reached for comment    since discovering cruzs voter registration on twitter on saturday the father has claimed that the broward county sheriff and elections supervisor  both democrats  planned it in an effort to steal the senate election from gov rick scott who holds a razorthin lead over democrat sen bill nelson as the state heads into a recount    we wont allow these unethical liberal democrats to steal scottforflorida us senate seat pollack wrote before his fox  friends appearance they stoop as low as registering a known mass murderer to vote how can you even trust a recount when the ballots may be compromised    its unclear how registering a single inmate  as a republican to boot  would help democrats swing the election pollack has provided no evidence that anyone was sent to the jail to assist cruz who simply had to obtain an application fill it out and mail it to the county elections office to receive a ballot and vote by mail
be a republican  have your daughter shot by another republican  blame the other side   republicans are the cancer of america
democrats registered a crazy trump supporter as a republican so hed vote democratic this makes sense to republicans somehow
    thats one of the things i hate the most about them they live in a world where they can never be wrong there is nothing that can cause them to step back and reexamine their beliefs because instead of accepting the facts they will change their perception of the facts until the facts match their beliefs i cannot see any possible way of waking them up from their delusion
  registered but was unable to vote because broward county failed to send the ballots in time  god damn that elections office really is incompetent
im going to repeat the post i made on the wapo comment section that got me banned from the site    im glad pollacks daughter is dead so she doesnt have to live through the shame of seeing what a conspiracy theorist nut her dad is where hes finding ways to use the guy who murdered her to slime his political enemies
  while i get your point they were right to ban you for that
  stupid standards of decency that everyone but republicans have to follow i say
  perhaps but i would be surprised if wapo would not also ban a republican that made a similarly vitriolic comment
  im glad a girl was murdered because her grief stricken father went off the deep end  nah m8 youre bit of a fuckhead on this one
  i dont think i could handle the daily rage of this guy still being allowed to suck down air id probably die of a heart attack
mass murderers granted right to vote in their jailcells  christ how did they get this thing passed
  jail / prison
  he hasnt been convicted yet should anyone accused of a crime have their right to vote taken away before theyre ever tried what happened to all the rhetoric on the right about innocent until proven guilty
  if youre going to take away criminals their right to vote you on top of treating them like literal animals to the point where they can and will develop ptsd and then poorly reintegrate them into society in the worst ways possible to might as well just kill them
  that is in really terrible taste
  im glad pollacks daughter is dead  wow    i present to you the empathic left ladies and gentlemen
  wow wheres the civility  the right after calling for the death of all journalists
  no empathy for clearly evil people you gotta save it for those who deserve it ie everyone else
  the right after a private business refused to serve an apologist who was defending locking children in cages while one of people who supported her boss was mailing bombs assassinate the leadership of the opposing party
  the right more like the wrong
i wonder why he went for the gop    serious question
  i think its time for republicans to step back and examine why their party is the one that attracts bigots neonazis and terrorists
  are we talking about liberals here
  exactly do you think this person could ever rehabilitate or a mass rapist and murderer or a child rapist and murderer but nope dems love their scum their murderers and their rapists and want to give them the right to vote
  he hasnt been convicted yet so innocent until proven guilty and all that and yes we all know hes guilty but the trial still needs to take place also the laws regarding voting criminal record and incarceration vary by state    what i dont get is where the story came from that the democrats went to nikolas cruz and helped him register to vote is there any shred of evidence to that or did republicans just pull it out of their ass then it turns out cruz is registered as a republican well the democrats are still guilty apparently because they were ostensibly forcing cruz to vote democrat again any evidence for that whatsoever
  is valuing tradition inherently wrong what about limiting illegal migration we have both of those in common with neonazis but that doesnt imply we value them for the same reasons it also doesnt imply we associate in any way or identify with extremists  no we actually openly disavow ours but that doesnt stop them from voting very mysterious
  no they are talking about a conservative strawman they made
  innocent until proven guilty which is why hes in jail and not prison
  its disingenuous to equate one retards comment with the rest of us just like its disingenuous to equate the right with the recent spat of random violence 
  innocent until proven  unless it is a guy accused of sexual assault apperently
  theres a fundamental difference the presumption of innocence is a legal right given to the accused during a criminal trial kavanaugh was never on trial it was an evaluation of his character to prove he was worthy of the job but it was never a legal proceeding
  i know you arent talking about kavanaugh because he quite literally got pushed through and currently is not in jail
  his statement also applies to people facing trial as well tbh any defense attorney will tell you sexual assault cases are always uphill battles and how hard they have to fight just to put together a jury that will simply do the job their supposed to do instead of immediately presuming guilt and ignoring any possibilities of doubt    the way the justice system is built simply cant efficiently or honestly handle sex offenses the vast majority of defendants take plea deals because the trials are always shitshows
funny how infringing on their rights to franchise at will is aok but infringing on the rights of a demonstrably dangerous nutcase or minor to possess a deadly weapon and kill people in the first place is communism    citing a tip from deputies at the jail pollack said the plan failed because broward county  which is now involved in a recount battle that could swing floridas senate and gubernatorial elections  failed to send the inmates their ballots in time to vote    yes that is called breaking the law    they probably shouldnt be voting anyway foxs katie pavlich remarked after listening to pollacks accusations     having laws and law enforcement and a republic with balance of powers and an independent judiciary is kind of nice even if it isnt always perfect probably better than fox news bimbo number 63527 being in charge of who gets to vote
is he afraid the violent gun toting nutcases are lining up to support democrats
  tradition  racism/bigotry  this is like saying the traitors from the confederacy were good people because mum state rights
    all these years and the best comeback you can come up with is nno you conservatards really have no wit
   your previous remark was so fraught with fallacies and assumptions that it came off as a dullards attempt at farce perhaps if you were less lazy and utilized wit in your discourse you would get responses in kind
  or you dont have a counterargument and you once again post no you    poor little baby cant dump his folder of jew images and wojaks so this is all he has left
  counter argument to a strawman  why bother wasting my time the entire post is baseless assumptions about the beliefs of others with no evidence to back them up burden of proof lies with you    you have no argument but no you  there is no reason to make a counterargument beyond calling out your obvious logical fallacies as you have yet to present an actual argument
  why bother proving my point ill just deflect and pretend i won this has worked well for me so far oh wait it didnt because my side just got clobbered in the midterms
  midterms  deflection
  nno you  you keep doing it even after being caught why
  because until you quite comtradicting yourself you arent worthy of anything more than a snide remark
  quite comtradicting  i see youre shaking so much you cant even type properly anymore
  your trying so hard how cute
  your
  y
  whataboutism
  thats not whataboutism
  to be fair youre comparing one person who is glad a republican was robbed of their offspring to the right who just committed acts of terrorism in the name of trump or his rhetoric
  the right is incapable of committing acts of terrorism as they are not a person
  are you learning impaired
  tradition is racism/bigotry what are you even implying    and no you wouldnt argue confederates were good people because they supported state rights and you wouldnt argue states rights supporters are bad people because confederates supported state rights its just guilt by association and people only use it to either override your reason and manipulate your emotional biases or because they cant be bothered to be reasonable or unprejudiced when making angry generalizations
  states right is code for government backed racism and suppression   so yes in the case of what republicans use tradition for it means racism and bigotry
  you can argue technicalities and theory of the mythical states rights but outside of actual racism none of those rights are/were infringed on so in practice as weve seen in any decent history book states rights is only an issue for actual racists
      okay the analogy you brought up is completely tangential to the very simple point im making valuing tradition isnt inherently immoral if the tradition you value isnt inherently immoral and if two people agree something is positively valued it doesnt follow that they value it for the same reason
  the way how trump and the republicans are using it clearly has racial overtones thats all that matters  its exactly the same as when reagan talked about state rights to kick off his 1980 presidential campaign in the town that saw 3 civil rights workers murdered by racists its clear what the intent is
  huuurrrrrr
  i doubt reagan himself was an actual racist   the republican party needed useful idiots at that point in time and he had to do what he had to do
  the fact that reagan intentionally courted racists multiple times is not a good thing      whataboutism  
  theyre psychopaths who will call snopes fake while citing some obscure blog nobodys heard of
  been gone for a long long time
  its gone until it endangers a republican like kavanaugh then theyre all about innocent until proven guilty again    then once they weather the storm its back to shouting lock her up
  im sure youre well aware that theres slightly more proof that nikolas cruz killed a bunch of people than that kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman
  and nikolas cruz is a great example of it this felon voted take away all his rights argh oh wait hes a republican uh innocent until proven guilty
  were in a thread about nikolas cruz
  thank you captain obvious any other stunning observations youd like to share with us
  it consists of people and those people are committing a lot of terror attacks lately
  nikolas cruz and brett kavanaugh are largely incomparable situations even though at this time neither of them have been convicted for anything
  theyre both far right nutjobs for one thing
  thats a fact no one can refute    also speaking of lock her up  ivanak been breaking the law using private emails lock her up when
  its amazing how much shit this administration is getting away with just because the sheer amount of bullshit is so large that some of it gets lost in the deluge id almost believe it was planned if not for the fact that a competent person wouldnt get caught doing this in the first place
trump is an idiot
  i cant imagine why twitter liberals are some of the most hated people on the internet with sick bantz like that
  do you spend literally all day talking to yourself in a text board repeating the same things over and over the last post in this shit thread was literally three days ago and you chipped in with this pearl of wisdom that has nothing to do with this topic    thats fucking sad if true
    some of the most hated people on the internet  your little rightard circlejerk echochamber isnt the internet
  right wing confirmed for not being able to handle the bantz
hm
trump heralded the imprisonment of yet another one of his top campaign aides with an unhinged rant against special counsel robert mueller    trump launched his latest twitter tirade about special counsel robert mueller on the same day yet another of his senior campaign aides heads to prison    trump has repeatedly attacked mueller who is investigating russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the trump campaigns involvement in that attack    on twitter trump asked if mueller will be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble to his final report and whined that the special counsel should be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other side    he also implored mueller to include statements from hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a russian during this period    he concluded of course with there was no collusion  mueller knows it    meanwhile in the real world trumps former campaign advisor george papadopoulos is headed to prison    papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser to trump in 2016 during the election    during the course of muellers investigation papadopoulos lied to the fbi and tried to hinder the probe he has pleaded guilty to the charge and has been sentenced to 14 days in prison a 9500 fine and a year of supervised probation

  nov 15 2018    college office cancels the vagina monologues because well not all women have vaginas    the womens resource center at eastern michigan university no longer will host the vagina monologues because the play lacks diversity and inclusion focuses on cisgender women and excludes transgenders mlive reported    not all women have vaginas    the centers decision came on the heels of a survey launched after conversations with current students as well as feedback from a wrc workshop titled not all women have vaginas during the 201718 academic year the outlet said    we feel that making this decision is in line with the wrc mission of recognizing and celebrating the diverse representations of women on campus along with the overall mission of the department of diversity and community involvement in which the wrc is housed of supporting and empowering minoritized students and challenging systems and structures that perpetuate inequities the wrc told mlive in an email we truly believe that it is important to center our minoritized students and this decision is in line with this mission driven value    the centers email added that many of the same people favoring the production believe it should be modified or accompanied by workshops that address the diversity and inclusion the play lacks the outlet said    but alas copyright law prohibits changing the script of eve enslers iconic feminist play mlive said which features firstperson narratives of women discussing their vaginas
fuck off back to tumblr feminist cunt  traps are more feminine than you ever will be
makes you go hmmmmmmmmmmmm
college cancels the vagina monologues because  oh i see so its like that is it i dont get it at all
you lived long enough to see vagina monologues be considered misogynistic  fucking seriously
  not all women have vaginas  triggered there are only two genders even though everyone acknowledges trans are mentally ill and transitioning is the most effective treatment we should insult them for being mentally ill crossdressing freaks
    leftism is like some stupid game made up by children    oh wait
  no not seriously this is what actual fake news is fucking republicans
  ahahaahahahah get rekt     i remember not even 10 years ago i was in college and the vagina monologues was considered some ultra liberal feminist thing glad to hear its fucking rekt
  well it did include the little coochie snorcher that could monologue which tells the story of a grown woman getting a young girl drunk and having oral sex with her and is portrayed in a positive way    ironically milo yiannopolis was fired from brietbart and slandered by the left as a pedo for talking about a similar story where he had a similar experience with an older gay man when he was a boy
what the fuck is that thing
  its the future you chose
  thy name is regret
there are plenty of other perfectly good reasons such as the part of the vagina monologues that openly and proudly endorses pedophile rape if the molester is female
  you know feminists have met their goals when theyre okay with letting transwomen tell them what to do
  feminist must be more inclusive and make way for the feminine penis monologues
  i feel like this is a subtle dig at the feminist in a way
fuck em transsexuals are the only real women
trannies are fucking mentally ill not a gender just a delusional state of mind
  ppl have no common sense these days i thought women without vaginas were considered to be intersex
feminists btfo by trannies
  what goal the total emascualtion of men and the usurping of male role models
fuck women
  no intersex people often have vaginas
  post reported for being extremely low quality
  yes thats the idea
not all women have vaginas    didnt /pol/ start that meme as a psy op
  when you realize the left literally has demons on their side whose goal is to literally destroy humanity
    actually its always been misandrist but you cant get in trouble for that yet
  oh no no no no no
  shits fucked
  lol

  i was waiting to here someone make that comparison
    tel aviv israel  israeli police are recommending bribery and fraud charges be brought against prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his wife in the third corruption scandal to engulf the israeli leader    authorities said sunday that they have evidence that netanyahu made regulatory decisions that favored bezeq telecommunications group in exchange for positive coverage on its news website walla netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing    the decision of whether to charge netanyahu rests with israels attorney general who is still deliberating on whether to indict the prime minister in two other cases    if indicted the fourterm prime minister could face one of the greatest challenges to his leadership yet    despite his dominance of israeli politics the newest police recommendation comes just after his rightwing coalitions majority in parliament was reduced to the slimmest of majorities after israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman resigned last month in protest over a ceasefire with gaza militants netanyahu was left with control with just 61 of the 120 seats in the knesset a year out from israels next election    in a joint statement with israels security authority on sunday police said they had enough evidence to charge netanyahu and his wife sarah of taking bribes fraud and breach of trust    they also recommended charging netanyahu of fraudulently accepting aggravated circumstances and sarah of disrupting investigative and judicial proceedings    the police also said they had enough evidence to charge bezeqs controlling shareholder shaul elovitch with bribery as well as other officials at the company
the first alleges that from 2007 to 2016 netanyahu and his family received cigars champagne and jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of shekels from hollywood mogul arnon milchan and other supporters    in return israeli police say netanyahu pushed for the socalled milchan law which ensures that israelis who return to live in israel from abroad are exempt from paying taxes for 10 years
wow it looks like curtains for the likud party
  good
  excellent
third corruption scandal  how is he still in power  also trump is a good goy look at how he sucks up to netanyahu
  he is literal dictator
  lovely
  third  what were the other ones didnt his wife also get charged for assualting their maids or something
dear diary   today something pretty neat in israel happened
jews cannot be trusted
  benjamin netanyahu be charged with bribery   israeli police are recommending bribery and fraud charges be brought against prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his wife in the third corruption scandal to engulf the israeli leader  what does this mean  has he been charged  what does benjamin netanyahu be charged mean
  op probably meant to be  if the police recommend charges be brought it goes to a prosecuting attorneys office who then look at the case and sees if they have enough evidence to charge them with the crime at least in the us thats how it works im know nothing about the israeli legal system
  cigars champagne and jewelry worth 6000000 neoshekels  ftfy
did anything come out of the other two times they recommended charges i wouldnt get your hopes up
    lackawaxen township pa  hunters across our area will have plenty of stories about the deer they shot or the ones that got away but a few hunters had the chance to save an eightpoint buck from a frozen lake in pike county and it was all caught on camera    you may not be able to hear it in the video from saturday at greeley lake near hawley but you can certainly see the struggle the eightpoint buck was having on the ice    photographer jeff sidle had his lens trained on the animal and shared this video    he must have made it out that far slipped and fell and couldnt get back up said rescuer josh davis    josh davis and ed schmalzle wondered what they could do about the stranded buck the deer was far out there and the ice was thin    i wouldnt want to see the deer suffer davis said i am a hunter theres a giant difference between an animal being harvested humanely and one being left out to die on the frozen ice    no one was really sure how long that buck was out on greeley lake on saturday they ran over to camp shohola grabbed a boat to start the rescue effort  an effort that took a lot of time and a lot of care    even with the boat distributing my weight the boat was still cracking the ice up davis recalled    you can see davis finally reach the deer lasso him and bring him back to shore before the animal ran off      
if it wasnt for him the deer might have been laying out there yet said rescuer ed schmalzle    theres still some rope along the lakeshore from the rescue and a sense that these hunters did what they could to help a helpless creature    if someone did happen to get him on monday thats feeding a family as opposed to him sitting out there going to waste davis added    people dont realize that just because hunters go out and kill that theyre not humane or they dont have those feelings about animals and the environment thats the way we are it captured who we are added photographer jeff sidle

    madison wis  when democrats won the governors office in wisconsin it was one of the partys most celebrated midterm successes in regaining power in the states now republicans are striking back moving to slash the power of the new governor even before he takes the oath of office    democrats reacted with fury crowding the halls of the state capitol in madison on monday and accusing the republicans of trying to undo an election they had lost it was only the latest such republican effort across the country to try to use legislative action to counter blows the party suffered at the polls for wisconsin a state that both parties will urgently vie to win in 2020 elections it was one more sign of the ferocious partisan split that has rippled through the state in recent years    its a power grab said state senator jon erpenbach a democrat before a hearing on the package of bills that includes restrictions on the incoming governors ability to shift how public benefits programs are run and on his authority to set the rules that determine how state laws are carried out they lost and theyre throwing a fit    the long list of proposals republicans want to consider also includes wide efforts to shore up their strength before tony evers the democrat who beat gov scott walker last month takes office new limits on early voting a shift in the timing of the 2020 presidential primary in wisconsin and new authority for lawmakers on state litigation the republican plan would also slash the power of the incoming attorney general who is also a democrat    in recent years single parties have come to dominate state legislatures allowing lawmakers to make significant policy changes in states even as washington wrestled with gridlock
but in states like wisconsin and michigan where democrats regained governors offices in capitals that republicans fully controlled for years republicans are making lastminute efforts to weaken their powers    it is a model pioneered in north carolina where republican lawmakers in 2016 tried to restrict the power of the governor after a democrat was narrowly elected to the post that set off a bitter court battle that continues to this day    in michigan republican lawmakers are considering proposals that would give them more authority to intervene in legal fights involving the state and would shift oversight of campaign finance  efforts that democrats say are aimed at shrinking the authority of their leaders including gretchen whitmer who won the governors race there and dana nessel a democrat who won the race for attorney general    some local areas are seeing glimpses of similar battles in arizonas maricopa county  with 43 million residents the nations fourth most populous  the republicandominated board of supervisors said last month that it was studying a takeover of some election day logistics now handled by the county recorder a newly elected democrat the supervisors have said they have a nonpartisan interest in improving the countys elections    in wisconsin on monday democrats and liberal groups called the republicans proposals for curbing mr everss authority in advance of his swearing in next month a blatant power grab and a rejection of the election outcome some said they were considering legal action against any legislation the republicans may try to push through this week    republicans who will retain their legislative majorities under the democratic governor have defended the hastily introduced package of bills as a necessary check on executive power
wisconsin law written by the legislature and signed into law by a governor should not be erased by the potential political maneuvering of the executive branch said robin vos the speaker of the state assembly and scott fitzgerald the republican leader in the state senate in a joint statement last week    but as hundreds of angry residents gathered at the capitol the republican leaders spoke bluntly of the ideological clash between their caucus and the incoming governor    i think that governorelect evers is going to bring a liberal agenda to wisconsin mr fitzgerald said theres going to be a divide between the legislative branch and the executive branch    we want to ensure that the new administration doesnt try to work around the legislature mr vos said explaining the package of bills that republicans say they hope will be taken up by the full legislature on tuesday we want both branches to have an equal seat at the table    wisconsins capital city has regularly been the scene of political upheaval over the last decade    the 2010 election flipped democratic control of the governors office and both legislative chambers and governor walker built a national reputation by swiftly moving to limit public sector unions power a push that sent thousands of union supporters and democrats to madison to protest for weeks and set off a series of recall elections against republicans and democrats    the state has long been purple it voted for barack obama for president and also for donald j trump wisconsin which democrats had carried in presidential races since 1988 played an unexpected role in helping to seal mr trumps victory but a longstanding tone of congenial relations between wisconsin democrats and republicans vanished after the republicans took over eight years ago
mr evers who has been wisconsins state schools superintendent condemned the proposals and urged wisconsin residents to speak up against them he said republicans were trying to take us back to nov 6 and change the election results    were not going backwards in time to revote this election mr evers said i won    mr evers said he hoped to persuade the legislative chambers  both of which are controlled by republicans  to vote down the bills if that fails mr evers said a plan b could include litigation    from a hearing room where the legislation was being weighed on monday afternoon protesters outside could be heard chanting respect our vote and shame hundreds gathered in protest in the cold on the steps of the capitol a place where demonstrations by democrats have been tense and frequent over the past eight years under republican dominance    among the package of measures being considered in madison democrats were especially angered about one that would allow republican leaders in the legislature to hire their own lawyers to replace the democratic attorney general on certain lawsuits including on issues such as voter identification and legislative redistricting josh kaul the incoming attorney general defeated brad schimel the republican incumbent in november    this bill is really the biggest aversion of the will of the people in this whole package said state representative chris taylor a democrat it totally guts the power of the attorney general    it is an embarrassment mr evers said wisconsin has been known for several years now as a state that cant get along    
    two of the democratic partys biggest wins last month occurred in wisconsin and michigan where their candidates won gubernatorial elections unseating a wellknown incumbent in the former and flipping the seat in the latter    but in both states republicans maintained control of both chambers of the legislature so in anticipation of having to work with a democratic governor state lawmakers are aiming to hurriedly pass legislation that would dilute the executives powers    in wisconsin govelect tony evers d is fighting to beat back republican attempts to weaken his authority calling it a repudiation of the last election    the last election changed the state in a way that apparently the legislature has decided to not accept said evers who defeated gov scott walker r in november evers told the milwaukee journal sentinel that everythings on the table in terms of attempting to block the gop plan including legal action    the republicans who have enjoyed singleparty rule in the state for close to a decade are gearing up this week to pass a suite of changes in an extraordinary session  which is where the legislature calls itself back after the session ends  that would among other things limit early voting move the wisconsin 2020 presidential primary from march when democratic turnout will be high to april an apparent effort to boost the chances of a conservative judge in that aprils state supreme court election restrict the governors ability to make certain appointments and otherwise hand more power to the state legislature
  shit like this is why we have the 2nd amendment fucking legislatures always try to get around democracy and the will of the people  both parties though it seems like republicans are way more prone to it legislatures shouldnt be able to pull shit like this gerrymandering or overriding ballot measures fucking faggots
in michigan where democrats last month won the governors mansion as well as the races for attorney general and secretary of state republican lawmakers last week introduced measures that would water down the authority of those positions on campaign finance oversight and other legal matters all three statewide winners are women as one detroit free press columnist pointed out    a spokeswoman for the incoming secretary of state jocelyn benson decried the move as shameful the free press reported    the moves in both states have drawn comparisons to republican efforts in north carolina in 2016 when lawmakers pushed through legislation limiting the authority of roy cooper the states democratic governor after he defeated incumbent gov pat mccrory r    former attorney general eric holder criticized the latest republicanled efforts in a sunday tweet     the people spoke in november republicans refuse to hear and seek to hold on to powerby any means this is not good for our democracy time for the people in michigan north carolina and wisconsin to be heardagain contact these legislators/let them know you oppose this action    eric holder ericholder december 2 2018    now that a democrat is in the governors mansion some republicans say that maybe walker had too much power and that to balance it out power should be redistributed to the representative body    wisconsin law written by the legislature and signed into law by a governor should not be erased by the potential political maneuvering of the executive branch said gop senate majority leader scott fitzgerald and assembly speaker robin vos in a statement    democrats and leftwing activists view it as a blatant power grab and decry the speed at which republicans are trying to force these measures through the gop state lawmakers unveiled their bills on friday night are holding a hearing monday and plan to vote on them tuesday
it is clearly partisan and its motivated by results of the election its a sore loser session mike brown deputy director of the liberal advocacy group one wisconsin now told the fix none of these bills were introduced before the election they didnt consider them during regular session theres no way the gop would have come back in to limit the power of the governor of their own party    because this is all happening at lightning speed grassroots activists have also had to organize fast protesters are descending on the capital and brown said the wisconsin legislatures hotline crashed because of the volume of calls
  theres still check and balances first before you immediately jump to the republican solution of political violence and terrorism        tensions are escalating in the badger state as republican lawmakers plow ahead with a brazen legislative power grab during the lame duck session    protesters descended on the capitol building in madison on monday for the lone hearing before a tuesday vote on a farreaching package of bills to curb the authority of democratic govelect tony evers    evers himself has promised to take any steps possible to block republican lawmakers and nationally prominent democratic lawyers are poised to go to court on behalf of progressive groups to fight any limit on early voting    the gop controls both the state assembly and state senate and no republican lawmaker has signaled plans to vote against them outgoing gov scott walkers history of supporting these kind of normbreaking legislative moves suggests he will sign the bills into law    republicans are trying to undo the results of the november 2018 elections by taking constitutional power away from the incoming governor and attorney general and trying to rig future elections by changing the voting rules for their own partisan advantage scot ross director of progressive group one wisconsin now said in a monday press call    the grabbag of proposals advancing to a vote this week include all of the measures republican lawmakers publicly toyed with after their party was swept at the state level on nov 6
among the bills many provisions preventing the state from dropping out of a lawsuit challenging the affordable care act moving the date of the 2020 presidential primary to boost the electoral prospects of a republican state supreme court justice limiting early voting to two weeks reducing the powers of incoming democratic attorney general josh kaul and limiting evers authority to implement state laws and make appointments to state agencies    these proposals would cost taxpayers millions of dollars according to the milwaukee journalsentinel moving the presidential primary to march 2020 in order to reduce the number of democrats who turn out to a scheduled supreme court election the next month would cost an estimated 7 million according to the newspaper taxpayers will also be on the hook for costs associated with legal challenges to efforts to restrict early voting    assembly speaker robin vos and senate majority leader scott fitzgerald have endorsed these proposals as essential to rebalancing state government with vos acknowledging that they may have made some mistakes giving too much power to gov walker    walker himself has not yet said whether he would sign off on the bill    but in anticipation that walker will do so local indivisible chapters one wisconsin and move on are convening at the capitol on monday to attend the joint finance committee hearing attendees are being urged to offer testimony expressing opposition to the proposed legislation    possible legal challenges are also being coordinated perkins coie partner marc elias publicly threatened to sue wisconsin if the state attempts to disenfranchise voters by cutting early voting during one wisconsins monday press call elias colleague bruce spiva said they would consider filing a contempt motion in a separate ongoing early voting case against the state if the legislature moves forward
perkins coie was involved in a 2016 lawsuit to strike down previous limits to early voting that ended with a federal judge determining that republican lawmakers were stifling votes for partisan gain larger cities like milwaukee and madison expanded voting hours and polling locations in response to the ruling and the case is currently pending appeal    if the legislature is again contemplating the hours and the days of early voting that would directly conflict with the injunction that judge peterson put in place spiva said on the press call according to the journalsentinel    evers has also said he is open to legal action if the legislature forces the bill package through the mildmannered former state schools superintendent had hoped to usher in a new era of bipartisan compromise but he appears to be adopting a firmer line as gop lawmakers threaten to derail his agenda before he even takes office    everythings on the table evers said saturday when asked by the journalsentinel about the prospects of lawsuits    were exploring options  all of them evers said calling the republicans proposals an embarrassment and repudiation of the last election but we hope not to take them we hope legislators will rethink their strategy    evers hands are tied by republicans control of both chambers in the legislature a heavily gerrymandered map helped republicans maintain control even as democrats won a greater percentage of the vote the gop ended up losing just one seat in the assembly and gaining a seat in the state senate    but progressives are hoping to sway some republican lawmakers who may be uneasy about voting for the blockbuster bill    in videos shared by move ons washington director ben wikler protesters paraded through the capitol monday chanting stop this coup respect our votes and protect our votes    
changes to early voting wisconsin presidential primary would cost taxpayers millions under gop plan        madison  voting changes republican lawmakers are considering passing tuesday would cost taxpayers millions of dollars  and perhaps far more than believed just a few days ago    in their lameduck session gop lawmakers hope to limit early voting to two weeks and move the 2020 presidential primary from april to march causing the state to hold three elections instead of two that spring    moving the presidential primary will cost 64 million to 68 million according to the wisconsin elections commission     but the restriction on early voting could add even more costs because the state is sure to face a legal challenge over it if it passes a similar law was struck down by us district judge james peterson who found the limit was unconstitutional because it was aimed at helping republicans by deterring minorities from voting    if the state loses on the issue taxpayers would likely have to pay the attorney fees for those bringing the case     lawmakers and voters learned of the cost of moving the presidential primary last month when the idea was floated but the proposed limits on early voting  and the associated potential legal costs  didnt become public until late friday     other aspects of the sweeping bill  which would curb the powers of govelect tony evers and attorney generalelect josh kaul  would also hit taxpayers wallets    one provision would allow lawmakers to replace the attorney general with private attorneys of their choosing at taxpayer expense private attorneys typically charge the state hundreds of dollars an hour far above the cost of an assistant attorney general
its going to be millions of dollars out the door before you even know whats going on said sen jon erpenbach a middleton democrat    the elections commission  which consists of three republicans and three democrats  unanimously concluded monday that moving the presidential primary would be extraordinarily difficult to accomplish for clerks and may not be feasible because three elections would have to be conducted in as many months    lawmakers are seeking to rush through their overall plan they will hold monday afternoon and floor votes as early as tuesday     walker on monday said he would be surprised to see the proposal to move the 2020 presidential primary date to make it to his desk with the same language but indicated hed be supportive of separating the primary and the nonpartisan spring election    the costs of the last lawsuit over early voting have not been tallied because petersons ruling is on appeal the 7th circuit court of appeals in chicago could rule any time on that lawsuit which also touches on a host of other election laws and the states requirement to show photo id at the polls     the 7th circuit heard arguments in the case more than a year and a half ago and has taken an unusually long time to decide the case    the latest proposal to restrict voting mirrors the one that has been struck down republicans have not explained why they believe it would withstand a court challenge     it would limit early voting to two weeks under petersons order local officials set their own schedules for early voting in madison that meant six weeks of early voting for last months election
  theres checks and balances  that only works when you have enough people in power that arent corrupt and complicit
democratic attorneys marc elias and bruce spiva have promised to bring a legal challenge to the early voting limit if it passes they are with the national law firm perkins coie that brought the earlier case on behalf of two liberal groups one wisconsin institute and citizen action of wisconsin education fund    on a conference call with reporters spiva said monday one way to fight the limit if it passes is with a contempt motion     if the legislature is again contemplating the hours and the days of early voting that would directly conflict with the injunction that judge peterson put in place he said    the proposal to move the 2020 presidential primary from april to march is aimed at protecting conservative supreme court justice daniel kelly    republicans fear kelly could lose his court seat because hes up for election the same day as the presidential primary which lawmakers expect will draw heavier democratic turnout than republican turnout     moving the presidential primary to march is expected to cost taxpayers about 7 million because it will require an election in addition to the february and april elections that are already scheduled    kelly wont say whether he backs the idea or has encouraged lawmakers to pass the measure    if the provision passes spiva said his clients might try to add it to their lawsuit over voting laws
bumping this because its important
remember who it is that hates people using their voice
  republicans
allow me to quote a random republican circa 2016    you lost get over it
  democrats
  mutes
  deaf people
  republicans pushing ahead they are also going to limit early voting
why does the gop always do shit like this
    kate taylor  nov 28 2018 141 pm    after years of pressure starbucks says it has found a way to prevent customers from watching porn in its stores    next year the coffee giant plans to introduce a new tool meant to prevent customers from viewing pornography or other explicit content in stores while watching pornography is banned at starbucks locations the chain does not have content blockers on its wifi service    to ensure the third place remains safe and welcoming to all we have identified a solution to prevent this content from being viewed within our stores and we will begin introducing it to our us locations in 2019 a starbucks representative told business insider in an email on wednesday    starbucks declined to give details on the solution but said the company tested multiple tools hoping to avoid accidentally blocking unoffensive sites    the rollout comes after years of pressure from the internetsafety organization enough is enough    a petition from enough is enough calling for starbucks to filter pornography was signed by more than 26000 people as of wednesday earlier this week enough is enough ceo donna rice hughes attacked starbucks for not following through on a commitment it made in 2016 to block explicit websites    by breaking its commitment starbucks is keeping the doors wide open for convicted sex offenders and others to fly under the radar from law enforcement and use free public wifi services to access illegal child porn and hardcore pornography hughes said in a statement    having unfiltered hotspots also allows children and teens to easily bypass filters and other parental control tools set up by their parents on their smart phones tablets and laptops hughes continued
fuck you i do what i want
  who the fuck is actually going to starbucks and watching porn
  starbuck employees
wow they turned on a webfilter now thats what i call newsworthy
some people just wanna watch porn while relaxing and drinking their tea/coffee  why be so puritanical about it
apparently pornhub already has a workaround for this
  hipsters and homeless  no im serious     they go for the free wifi and if you have free wifi may as well go to porntube     my local starbucks has the same unwashed white kids with dreads and shitstained backpacks sitting around using it as a cyber cafe half of the time theyre watching porn shit on their twitter page or youtube videos
  i dont want to see what fucking fetishes you have while im waiting for my breakfast   if you enjoy shiteating videos at the very least mute your phone and sit in the corner so no one else can see over your shoulder    unfortunately thats too much to ask of some of the cleftpalate hippies who sit instore for hours and reek of marijuana
  easily lets kids bypass filters set by their parents  lol do these people honestly believe that shit works
  incomming orbot and tor downloads
the absolute state of america
the interesting part about these tools is that it seems entirely inconsistent what they class as porn the o2 mobile site blocking for example blocks deviantart pixiv and imgur for pornography but allows all the chans xhamster heavyr and the like nearly any and every platform that allows a person to upload is explicit eventually because of dicks   under the radar from law enforcement   nearly every mcdonalds wifi ive been in has been banned from 4chan for cp the local center is also range banned for cp nothing is going to stop your local candydoll poster from getting his pizza to the jannies
  to be fair deviantart is mostly porn
  ok but can i order a grande venti and spend all afternoon in a lounge chair pirating torrents of mia khalifa to show im neither racists nor religionist
  shes christian
  that doesnt change what he said
  so are most porn stars
  this enrages me thats where i fap at  i order a frappuccino for while i fappaccino
  by breaking its commitment starbucks is keeping the doors wide open for convicted sex offenders and others to fly under the radar from law enforcement and use free public wifi services to access illegal child porn and hardcore pornography hughes said in a statement  now clearly the only way theyre consistently reaching cp would be through tor anyway and no filter will be able to block that so why are they using this as one of their main arguments  having said that its fucking retarded anyway to provide free wifi and not expect people to use it for pornography anyone could have told you that just make sure youre kicking out the disgusting pieces of shit actually having a wank in the store
  i dont want to see what fucking fetishes you have while im waiting for my breakfast    a couple of years ago some buddies and i were at a bar to see our buddys band play and while we were sitting there i glanced over the shoulder of a guy sitting at the bar which was in a kinda pit area lower then the surrounding tables and was shocked to see that he was scrolling thru his tablet looking at pics of toilets full of shit    i kid you not the guy who didnt look like a freak had dozens and dozens of overhead pics of toilets with shit floating in the bowl and was sitting there casually scrolling thru them while eating a burger and sipping on a beer    weirdest fucking thing i ever saw
  maybe he was a plumber
i think europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame clinton said speaking as part of a series of interviews with senior centrist political figures about the rise of populists particularly on the right in europe and the americas    i admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like angela merkel but i think it is fair to say europe has done its part and must send a very clear message  we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support  because if we dont deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic    clintons remarks are likely to prove controversial across europe which has struggled to form a unified position ever since more than 1 million migrants and refugees arrived in the eu in 2015    while some countries who have borne the brunt such as germany italy and greece have argued for the burden to be shared more evenly some particularly in central and eastern europe have rejected demands to take in refugees    migration numbers have fallen sharply since 2015 while a series of initiatives have been tabled from a 10000member european border and coastguard agency to an overhaul of eu asylum procedures    clinton was one of three heavyweights of the centreleft interviewed by the guardian to better understand why their brand of politics appears to be failing all three have seen their countries upended by political events that to some degree can be explained by the success of rightwing populism    the other two interviewees tony blair and matteo renzi agreed that the migration issue had posed significant problems for centrist politics    article continues    
    donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort held secret talks with julian assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london and visited around the time he joined trumps campaign the guardian has been told
  before anyone starts bleating like a sheep no this doesnt explicitly prove anything    at the same time i have a really hard time believing he met with assange for a totallyabovetheboard reason
  move along nothing to see here
  the guardian  anonymous sources  not a great start out of the gate     went to see assange in 2013 2015 and in spring 2016  during the period when he was made a key figure in trumps push for the white house  2013  trumps push for the white house  oh boy sounds like a guardian intern is larping as an inside source again
  george papadopoulos pleaded guilty  rick gates pleaded guilty   michael flynn pleaded guilty  paul manafort pleaded guilty  richard pinedo pleaded guilty  alex van der zwaan pleaded guilty  michael cohen pleaded guilty  sam patten pleaded guilty    big nothing burger huh
  yeah remember the last time there was an anonymous source and it turned out to be completely wrong    actually when was that there have been so many these days
  donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort held secret talks with julian assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london and visited around the time he joined trumps campaign the guardian has been told    sources have said manafort went to see assange in 2013 2015 and in spring 2016  during the period when he was made a key figure in trumps push for the white house    it is unclear why manafort would have wanted to see assange and what was discussed but the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest robert mueller the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the trump campaign and russia    a wellplaced source has told the guardian that manafort went to see assange around march 2016 months later wikileaks released a stash of democratic emails stolen by russian intelligence officers    manafort 69 denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is 100 false his lawyers declined to answer the guardians questions about the visits    in a series of tweets wikileaks said assange and manafort had not met assange described the story as a hoax  
  big nothing burger huh  nothing involving russia  nothing involving collusion  answered your own question thanks    yeah remember the last time there was an anonymous source and it turned out to be completely wrong  actually when was that there have been so many these days  how many anonymous sources have been predicting trumps or some trump family members imminent indictment  or muellers imminent definitive bombshell drop that without a doubt proves russian collusion    maybe youd be so kind to present us with a list of anonymous sources that have been validated in reg to this whole debacle
  nothing involving russia  implying i would want to link the names of 25 russians and 3 russian companies    here are the names read the indictments yourself      
  first they said there wasnt a meeting with the russians at all  then they said there was a meeting with one russian about adoption and there was no collusion   then they said there the meeting was actually with a few russians and paul manafort and donjr and that the meeting was about dirt on hillary but there was no collusion  then they tried to say there was nothing wrong or illegal about collusion   finally they went back to there being no collusion but insist that they never took the russians seriously enough to collude with them
  id be less suspicious if they stuck to one story    boy theyre bad at this
  implying i would want to link the names of 25 russians and 3 russian companies  can you at least link the evidence showing the collusion between these russians and anyone from the trump family or campaign  can you further provide any evidence that demonstrates what exactly these russians did in order to influence the election and how they were able to either influence or interfere with the election because if this is another argument about disruptive memes youre going to get laughed at
        
  yeah the guardian is a shit source here are links to all the articles i found that are examples of them selling blatant falsehoods as truth
  manafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy  thank god somebody had to stop hillary and the political party that has been resposible for keeping assange locked up there
  ooh i almost took that seriously you got me anon
be ecuadorian ambassador to great britain  cant get rid of aussie freeloader living in your house  why dont they just kick him out already the guy who said it was okay for him to stay there isnt president of ecuador anymore
drumpf is done for now
  keep posting this in every thread anon your humiliatrix has her work cut out for her
  iamwithherjpg
  definitely this time for sure    why dont they just let him go already the guy who wanted him killed isnt even president any more also the lady who wanted him drone striked isnt even secretary of state anymore
  orange man good
  the only people that wanted to kill assange were republicans after he leaked the manning infodump newt gingrich called for him to be put to death for treason on fox news in 2010 neither hillary or obama ever did we just found out in the news through leaks that he wasnt ever charged with anything until 2017 after trump was president       
            this is why /news/ is great /pol/ppets can move the goalposts as far as they can and they still get scored on every single time
manaforts lawyers are evidently shitting themselves    
  theyre shitting themselves because they were caught leaking information to trump
welp thats all i needed to know
president dindu  i dindu nufin  t president dindu nufin
  so wheres the proof
  forget this story plebeians guardian will not issue a retraction just change the language of the article so it means the reverse
in areas with martial law the holding of elections to the united territorial communities is canceled reports about it the ukrainian truth with reference to the press service of the central election commission    the central election commission explained that the elections could be held after the expiration of martial law on december 26 or earlier in case of its cancellation elections in several areas of martial law were to be held on december 23      
whats putins endgame here do the russians actually want the rest of ukraine
  lold
  what the fuck website is this    just get them into nato then well fix the elections and deal with everything in short order
  aктивyвaти чopнoбильcький плaн зapaз
  just get them into nato  therell be a russoukrainian war before this happens
  russia would never allow a nato country on its border
next shit is happening    the state border service of ukraine has prohibited foreign citizens from entering crimea this was stated by the representative of the gpu andrei demchenko reports today    it is possible to cross the administrative border with the crimea exclusively according to ukrainian documents that is only to citizens of ukraine this restriction on entry is related to the martial law declared by ukraine in accordance with the law regarding the legal regime on the interim government demchenko said    according to him restrictions on entry will be valid until the end of martial law    this means people who are not ukrainian citizenship can enter the crimea only from russian side     
washington is seeking the return of ukrainian sailors and ships captured in the kerch strait    the us authorities send a clear signal to russia through the isolation about the inadmissibility of the incident in the kerch strait during which the russian military seized the ukrainian ships with their crews    this was said during a briefing by the representative of the us state department robert palladino reports ria novosti on thursday november 29    its quite obvious what washington is trying to achieve  ed is the return of ukrainian sailors and ships the aggression we witnessed is unacceptable and a strong signal was sent through the cancellation of the meeting between trump and putin  ed palladino said     to the clarifying question of exactly how this signal was sent palladino replied that through isolation    
  washington is seeking the return of ukrainian sailors and ships captured in the kerch strait  but if russia agrees to this theyll look weak face is everything to these people trying to push them into a confrontation will just result in them escalating not backing down    the last thing the world needs is a fucking land war in europe
  but if russia agrees to this theyll look weak    if russia will agree then every fucking one will com with guns at their border and ameriga will demand to release them because it is good fo democracy
  the last thing the world needs is a fucking land war in europe    dude the jews in usa and britbong want putin bleed because he stoped their wealth pumps in russia
  but on the other hand maybe the nignogs will run back to africa
ukrainian foreign minister pavel klimkin claims that there are 35 million ukrainians in russia but he stands for ending diplomatic relations with moscow    i personally and emotionally believe that we do not need diplomatic relations with russia i even negotiated with some countries about the possibility of our presentation but they clearly said that given the full scale we can only be a formal mailbox the minister said in the live talk show the right to power on thursday    the minister added that there are 35 million ukrainians in russia they diplomats of foreign countries  if by definition will not be able to do what our diplomats are doing today the minister added klimkin noted that he favors a biometric visa regime with russia
this morning i was not allowed to cross the administrative border to crimeafrom bydlo side in spite of having the permission from ukrainian authorities mfa_ukraine how can we cover the ukrainian territory of crimea if you dont let us in      
ukrainian president petro poroshenko has announced on twitter that during the period of martial law until dec 26 russian men aged 1660 will be banned from entering ukraine in order to prevent the formation of units of private russian armies    
    that means around 2 million tourists russians not from russian federation but othe countries who came to ukraine for christmas and new year celebration are banned now
polish defense minister russian troops are already officially attacking ukraine    according to the minister in 2008 russia attacked georgia and in 2014 ukraine    and now russian troops are already officially attacking ukraine said blashchak    according to the head of the defense department of poland now there is a gradual restoration of the russian empire    it is the same imperial policy which was carried out before also carried out today that is why i as minister of national defense as well as the government of prime minister mateusz moravetsky and president of poland duda are trying to have fort trump in poland added blaszczak    
  russia can go pack sand theyre not a nato member and dont have the authority to say anything in the matter    all theyve got is threats its ukraine that should get to choose
  hows banning the moskals affect tourists from other countries
  
a winter haven man was arrested on thursday after posting on his facebook page that he was going to shoot members of congress and their families depending on which way the supreme court justice confirmation vote went    according to the affidavit the threats included the following statements     just bought 12 boxes of hollow point 50 caliber bulletshave plenty of ammo for my sniper rifle and bought a suppressor have made sure all my arrangements have been made and care for my dogs because i will not be coming home have made extra precautions and added more supplies in the tunnel under my house in case local or federal law enforcement tries to stop me note there are no tunnels under his house  getting ready if kav is not confirmedwhoever i think is to blame may god have mercy on their soul   just cleaned out the gun shop where i get guns ammo and target practice bought all their 50 cal hollow points i expect to be confronted and i will be ready to kill and ready to die  i am about to accept an offer on my house just to get more money to fund my plan to kill democrat office holders and their families it is all i think about night and day i even wake up in the middle of the night most nights thinking about it ultimately i will be killed but hopefully i will have killed many many liberal sic elected in washington   i can tell it seems i will be sacrificing my life for my country but i am ready and will know who needs to be killed after the vote to put kavanaugh on the supreme court i believe democrats need to be afraid to do what they are doing right now and weak republicans that do not vote for him need to pay with their lives   i cant do this by myself need more conservatives going into liberals homes at night killing them in their sleep        yikes
  but why would you post it on facebook
based and redpilled why did he post on fb though retard
    because hes an idiot like all republicans
oh look a /pol/ppet forgets the boundary between shitposting and reality
  because hes a plant
  or maybe your side is despicable
a suppressed 50 cal with hollow points    even as a part time /k/ resident i am calling bullshit
  your side is despicable nazi terrorists real democrats never do this    hows it like being part of a literal terrorist organization
this is damage control    you already know theres going to be riots and violence if hes confirmed and you know exactly whos going to be responsible
    whataboutism
  actually a legit response when someone accuses one side of a crime and claims the other innocent
  its a flaccid attempt to see equivalency where there is none the left is completely deranged right now theres simply no comparison
  theres simply no comparison  stephen paddock the 1 october shooter was heavily rightwing and did significantly more damage than the baseball shooter    another man met paddock three weeks before the shooting for an abortive firearms transaction in the carpark of a bass pro shop the man was selling schematic diagrams for an auto sear a device that would convert semiautomatic weapons to full automatic fire paddock asked him to make the device for him and the man refused    at this point paddock launched into a rant about antigovernment stuff  fema camps paddock said that the evacuation of people by the federal emergency management agency fema after hurricane katrina was a a dry run for law enforcement and military to start kickin down doors and  confiscating guns    somebody has to wake up the american public and get them to arm themselves paddock told him sometimes sacrifices have to be made
  yeah the radical left that advocates this type of thing  its like the bolshevik revolution all over again going to lead to political genocide and a dystopian government emplaced and legitimized by mob rule
   thats not whatabouting though nobody was legitimizing actions by citing the illegitimate actions of others they were literally citing sources as to why one side was bad and the other anon simply critical of the left  you throw that word around like its a buzz words you dont understand you should honestly stop posting
  i honestly think violence is right around the corner for this country not anything close to civil war but to think that the overwhelming majority of domestic terrorism in this country has been from the right wing i wouldnt at all be surprised if we started seeing far left groups begin to mobilize and go down that same path our political landscape is a joke and i truly feel all this bs is going to flip a switch on the left the same switch thats been flipped for the right wing ever since slavery was abolished the right wing rallies around racism and violence has always followed well the left actually has a rallying beacon now and its against an illegitimate government im not advocating violence whatsoever but the stakes are rising
  nothing about the stephen paddock shooting added up  theres more evidence that there was some sort of conspiracy involved then it was just a nut job  im phone posting but i seriously have a document on my laptop thats about a page of legitimate news sources that drama more evidence to stuff not adding up to the official story  off the top of my head one of the big ones is the official story being stephen paddock shot himself in the head but the swap captain that entered the room first stated that there was no obvious head trauma and then a forensic doctor later stated that they analyzed his brain and it was in good condition something not quite possible if its been torn apart by a bullet and then later the official story changed to he committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest
  more like it triggers you because it cuts right through your bullshit like a hot knife through butter
  reported to fbi
  youre are kind of making their point for them
  yeah i dont know who they think theyre fooling the right side is consistently more aggressive and unhinged and anyone who pays attention will see that this is why they are going to see an absolutely unprecedented stomping in the midterms next month
  well this thread is still going to be up about a month from now so there will certainly be plenty of opportunity to laugh at you dont run away when you lose mmkay come over here and accept your defeat like a man
  implying you arent     heres a tip if you want to falsefag you need to switch up your grammatical errors and speech pattern between posts
      well that was easy to disprove whats your next move rightard
  but the term was used as if the poster had no knowledge of how to use it and was just using it as a generic buzzword  it kind of just made the person who used it sound dumb
  to be quite honest thats what the russians do or at least what they have been doing lately its not about taking a republican or a democrat side its about playing both sides and arguing with everyone else just to cause chaos in the country
  that was a larp
  this is true unfortunately all they have to do when someone points this out is just say muh russians and they make it look like its not a serious thing even though there hasnt been a single thing to disprove the russian influence theyve successfully convinced some people that its just a boogeyman
  /news/ thread with new information on russia influencing the us election  /pol/ get btfo  thread gets deleted  makes you think about whos in charge here
  even though there hasnt been a single thing to prove the russian influence  ftfy    inb4  according to anonymous sources familiar with the matter
  quotes attributed to sources familiar with the thinking of a person are often quite reliable    a major newspaper is not going to suggest that a source is familiar with someones thinking without being pretty sure of it this is a fairly precise term it also puts the news organization at a clear risk as person x can obviously deny what an article has said he or she is thinking    generally these kinds of source descriptions mean that the reporter spoke either to the actual subject meaning that a source familiar with the thinking of chief justice john roberts is roberts or to a person designated by the subject to give his or her account to the reporter
  agreed but granted the whole russian poisoning the well fallacy has been thrown around so much towards likely non russians that i do understand how it had lost its overall effect  also i think its hard to deny that putin was still sour about hillary ordering the interference in the 2012 russian elections and acted to ensure trump was president i think what some people may dispute is the level of conspiratorial involvement trump may have actually had in all of this tbqh to me it seems like he was more or less a useful idiot that just wanted stuff leaked on his opponent i doubt he had ever tried to get directly involved in any conspiracy probably kept himself out of it as little as possible to try to avoid potential criminal charges  but either way russians are def playing both sides of the field right now just trying to cause chaos and from what intelligence sources tell the news chinese efforts are likely trying to displace trump and republicans right now    idk man its a total shit show any way you look at it tbqh
  quotes attributed to sources familiar with the thinking of a person are often quite reliable  said by someone familiar with the matter of anonymous sources    a major newspaper is not going to suggest that a source is familiar with someones thinking without being pretty sure of it  sure they would youd have to be a complete gullible fool to take something unverifiable like that at face value   remembers im on /news/  oh right my bad    as person x can obviously deny what an article has said he or she is thinking  and then theyre immediately accused of either lying or being unstable or both    this is literally highschool cafeteria tier gossip spreading except instead of so did you hear about becky i heard she sucked 36 dicks homecoming weekend its someone familiar with beckys thinking told me she sucked 36 dicks homecoming weekend
  the are several major differences between what the russians and chinese are doing   1 trump and the russians conspired in their attack to influence the us election  2 america is at a trade war with china and as part of the war china is targeting red states with their economic policies   3 trump is setting up the fact hes been outplayed in the trade war as a reason to say the results of the 2020 presidential election will be illegitimate because the chinese meddled in the election ignoring the fact it was entirely his fault and economic pressure is extremely different from what the russians did in 2016 and are doing for the midterms
  spinning baseless rhetoric this hard  for free
  to be fair america was in a silent war with russia at least since 2012 when hillary ordered meddling in the russian election and a lot of parallels can be drawn with the democrats fear of russian meddling with your observation of republican fear of russian meddling    even the fact that many republicans im 2016 didnt believe russians were interfering just as im sure many democrats now dont fully believe the chinese are meddling  as for trumps failed trade policies i personally have seen no evidence of this other that media scaremongering  corporations are doing well economies are doing well faith in the economy is high jobless rates are low and whether you think its due to or in spite of trump its a fact
  republican fear of russian meddling  meant republican fear of chinese meddling
  facts from a somewhat neutral viewpoint  reeeeeeee
    dont you have something better to do
  have you seen the front page of /news/ where its almost entirely right wing propaganda were being raided by /pol/ again
  well its only fair play when youre posting vice news and vox unimpaired and with any regularity at the very least we can have a fair balance of overtly biased sources
  fair play  one vice news as part of a multi link post  two vox articles  one about the 3d gun printer guy the other about the epa  what regular and unimpaired posting  what is it they say about /pol/ they cry out in pain when theyre kicking people
  people have posted cp on facebook so there really isnt a limit to peoples short shortsightedness
left wing shooter  see concrete irrefutable evidence that liberals are all a bunch of evil lunatics  right wing shooter  i dont believe it for a second those right wing police investigators must be in on the liberal conspiracy too i would know because im a better investigator than any professional that was at the scene      they do it too is literally the definition of whataboutism    heres what the factual thread of their discussion was  your side is despicable   yours is too    so anon maybe you should be the one that stops posting since you clearly do not understand the word youve taken upon yourself to try to embarrassingly educate others about
  even the fact that many republicans im 2016 didnt believe russians were interfering   republicans did know the russians were interfering they just refused to go public or threatened to undermine obama and the intelligence community if they went publicly with the information to inform the public of the attack because the russians were both helping the republicans and conspiring with trump we just found out mcconnell just did as much      the flip side is china is using their economic muscle to hurt the pocket books of swing and red states which is legal unlike the russians attack where youve seen criminal indictments brought down maybe china will up their game to what the russians did and start attacking the rnc like the russians did with the dnc or the presidential candidate for the dems will conspire with the chinese like trump did with the russians they arent currently at the same level and you know if the chinese did try anything trump would immediately politicize it     this all boils down to trump trying to rig the deck to create an excuse if he loses in 2020 just like he did if hed lost in 2016 where he said he wouldnt accept the results of the election if he lost and then went on to lie about massive voter fraud after he lost the popular vote by 3 million
  its those evil republicans who were trying to undermine obama and the intelligence community and not the intelligence community who clearly knew about the whole thing being incompetent retards     also is this really the new talking point for shareblue russia is the cause of everything and is in the rncs pocket fucking hell i thought the republicans were just really ineffective politicians who caught a lucky break with a populist candidate but i didnt know they were all secretly bond villains     whew glad im withher and wont consider if coming to this conclusion isnt a sign that i may be out of touch with reality
  you got blown out so badly in the other thread you needed to mass report it to the point it got deleted do you want me to repost all the information here
  just bought 12 boxes of hollow point 50 caliber bulletshave plenty of ammo for my sniper rifle and bought a suppressor  just cleaned out the gun shop where i get guns ammo and target practice bought all their 50 cal hollow points    this guy is clearly a deranged democrat pretending to be a conservative
  conservative does something terrible that is impossible to defend  no they must be a democrat    what must it be like to be a trumptard living in a state of constant delusion every single embarrassment is without fail blamed on the other side absolutely zero self awareness
it only goes to show that youve really got to watch what you do and say anyone who showed up to the arizona rally probably knows about those guys who were pointing their fingers at protesters like guns and saying bang bang secret service turned thosd dudes away what a bunch of pussies
republicans in 2016 after trump asked russia to hack clintons emails and they complied  well yeah hacking is illegal but the important thing is that we uncovered the real crime here hillarys emails     republicans now  the democrats have been involved in any way in the investigation all the hard evidence towards our guys committing treason count for nothing 
republicans are trying to discourage us from voting by saying that the kavanaugh confirmation has made the blue wave less likely while using this as a cover to discreetly purge democrats from the voter rolls    they cant stop us well show them a blue wave the likes of which theyve never seen
  what i find funny is that you probably think alex jones is a nut yet youll come to /news/ and leftypol and spew shit like this  no one needs to purge the voter rolls because you idiots never vote in the first place most of you will stay at home tell themselves well i could have gone for early voting but its too far to walk and get jack shit for turnout even the most charged the dems have ever been the cusp of trumps election had maybe a 40 turnout at best    nah all this has done is shown everyone what infantile children you are
  probably think alex jones is a nut  sorry for thinking the guy who is literally encouraging his followers to start a civil war and kill people who hate trump is a nut im not actually sorry by the way    even the most charged the dems have ever been the cusp of trumps election  the turnout of obamas election was significantly higher its intellectually dishonest to claim that this was the most charged the democrats have ever been    youre going to see what charged looks like in november
  after trump asked russia to hack clintons emails  literally never happened
  they cant stop us  tell me about the voter suppression that you probably believe in  which doesnt happen but i would bet that you think it does
    so do you try and sound like an idiot on purpose or is it just something that comes natural for you
  russia if youre listening  the man is so fucking incompetent he literally did it at his rallies with cameras on him
  your dumb  i posted on 4chan that russia should hack clinton  so i guess i asked russia and colluded with them as well
  you are dumber trump said on camera to ask russia to hack clinton and this happened after the trump tower conspiracy meeting this isnt s much as connect the dots as the dots being so close together they just make up the word treason
  thank you chang for your continued support of the party   one cup instant noodle has been deposited in your safe
  /pol/ is terrible at memes if they arent spoonfed them
  sometimes i see an off topic trump circlejerk thread on one of the boards i go to so since its off topic anyway i go in there and drop off some image that btfos trump and is highly embarrassing to the right    more often than not i later find that my post is the only one deleted but for whatever reason the thread is still up    they definitely have a bias and they are definitely trying to hide anything unfavorable to them
  link thread
  cant attests for the other anons story but it has happened in /news/    like when /pol/ got btfo when they tried to claim russia didnt attack the united states in the 2016 election after a new report came out that mcconnell threatened to politicize the russian attack if obama and the intel community came out to inform the public the thread got magically deleted   
  its got twitter and a shareblue mirror as its only sources
  greg miller is the source and the twitter link links to the interview where he says it
  greg miller is the source and the twitter link links  twitter is not a /news/valid source even if you think it should be
  greg miller cant be a valid news source  this guy cant be a valid news source    but an interview with him reporting it isnt a news source  you get btfo so you have to resort to technicalities to try and silence the other side we get it
  regardless i think it was deleted for poor sources rather than a conspiracy im pretty sure if you report under the editorial or blog article the janitor just looks at the source sees its some twitter/youtube link and deletes without actually opening the link this is why you need to make sure your opening post has a link to a legitimate news source even if you have to hunt for a lesser known paper or site
  so youre punished for being nice by linking the video directly so you dont have to see it through the article cited to see it  no good deed goes unpunished
  in /news/ you must link a credible news site the rules of /news/ are rules not suggests maybe if you were capable of following some very fucking simple rules you wouldnt currently be moaning and bitching about an evil mod conspiracy
  the interview was a creditable source youre just saying the mods arent corrupt theyre just incompetent  which doesnt inspire confidence
  the interview was a creditable source  it was not the complete url of a news article from a credible news site    next time follow the rules and we wont be in a situation where youre complaining that the mods are incompetent for forcing you to follow some very fucking basic instructions
  and it was properly cited unless youre going to grasp at straws to claim otherwise   at this point its pretty clear it was deleted because of partisan intent or it got mass reported by /pol/ and a janitor/mod only saw the twitter link and killed it   either isnt acceptable
  and it was properly cited unless youre going to grasp at straws to claim otherwise   can you show me the complete url of a news article from a credible news site present in the op
  it appears to come from the american independent institute which is categorized as a liberal investigative journalism group    and unless you want to go to war with wikipedia its classified as an american journalism organization       and having a political slant is not an immediate disqualifier for having an article posted on /news/ so unless you want to prove youre just politically biased which then opens another can of worms of why similar articles from breitbart which is just them linking to twitter posts is allowed to stay up    there shouldnt be a problem and the deletion was a mistake at best and politically motivated at worst
  its a shareblue mirror every single article on it is posted to shareblue
  so its still classified as an american journalism organization not an opinion site not a blog but journalism
  it was founded and is run by the shareblue guy calls on credibility are up to 4chan staff im sorry the mods decided that your clever attempt to get around the shareblue ban didnt work
  its run by someone whos associated with something i dont like so that automatically invalidates it   resorts to appeal to authority and alleges the mods are politically biased as a final line of defense   thats pretty sad    just to grind home the point that this is bias since i know you looked this up but arent mentioning it    the articles reviewed were all left biased politically used moderate loaded words but were sourced appropriately to credible sources overall we rate the american independent institute left biased and high for factual reporting based on proper sourcing   factual reporting high
  critical thinking level previously unheard of critically low levels
  media bias fact check is a website that consists of one persons opinion on the news    thats pretty sad  whats sad is the crusade against the mods youve been waging ever since they banned you for spamming
  media bias fact check is a website that consists of one persons opinion on the news  and they have no skin in the game we all know if it was labeled extremely left and factual reporting low youd be citing it    whats sad is you wanting to censor journalist sources you personally dont likeyouve failed to prove its a blog or an opinion site because its a legitimate news source so now youre just being transparent in your partisanship
  whats sad is you wanting to censor journalist sources you personally dont likeyouve failed to prove its a blog or an opinion site because its a legitimate news source so now youre just being transparent in your partisanship  its shareblues media arm which youre posting for the sole purpose of getting around the shareblue ban i support all censorship of rulebreaking shiteaters such as yourself kill yourself and try again next life
  its independent of shareblue media so calling it shareblue medias arm is dishonest also again you have failed to prove its a blog or editorial site or the notion that its an american journalism organization your entire basis for saying the aii should be banned is from your personal bias and im more confident in saying its /pol/ fueled since your clearly obsessed with shareblue which is a well known boogeyman and scapegoat for them    i support all censorship  glad to see you admit you hate free speech     kill yourself   because when your arguments have merit you resort to catchphrases like this
  its owned and run by the exact same person as shareblue it has 111 google hits total it exists for the sole purpose of having its articles reposted to shareblue its a literal propaganda outlet even if you want to call it journalism    your entire basis for saying the aii should be banned is from your personal bias  i wouldnt give a shit about shareblue if it wasnt the presence of a paranoid retared spammer attempting to post it in as many places and as many times as possible ie you    and im more confident in saying its /pol/ fueled since your clearly obsessed with shareblue which is a well known boogeyman and scapegoat for them  if you had spammed some site other than shareblue gotten banned for it and then started posting an offshoot of it id be complaining about that site instead this is a problem of your own creation
  its propaganda because i say so  youre entitled to your opinions not your facts all the facts point towards it being a legitimate ibid left learning journalist organization     but the guy who owns it  i guess that means everything rupert murdoch owns is far right wing you better tell that to the new york post who actually run anti trump covers    we get it you got a mad on for shareblue that doesnt mean you get a blank check to censor any political view that shatters your world view
  all the facts point towards it being a legitimate ibid left learning journalist organization   youre absolutely pantsonhead retarded here lets do a test let me pick a random american independent article from last week        now lets see whos linked to it or quoted it      result 1 shareblue  result 2 american independent  result 3 shareblue writers twitter  result 4 shareblue writers twitter  result 5 shareblues twitter  result 6 shareblues facebook page  result 7 shareblue  result 815 link aggregators    wow its almost like almost every last thing about this article was shareblue lets examine the author tommy christopher writer for shareblue    huh but hey nothing stops journalists from writing for multiple institutions at the same time maybe he only sometimes writes for shareblue and sometimes for the american independent institute lets look at his post announcing the publication of the article that he personally wrote         wow the author himself links to shareblue rather than american independent almost as if american independent was a mirror for shareblues news articles and not the other way around fucking fascinating    its a shareblue clone get over it
  you conveniently forgot the final part   published with permission of the american independent    that blows up your entire thesis that its from shareblue originally theyre just reprinting it all youve done is prove that shareblue is a legitimate source because the articles they reprint are from an american journalist organization not a blog or editorial site and any attempt to ban it is clearly politically motivated censorship     you overreached
  published with permission of the american independent  this is of course a lie or not really a lie as its a corporate entity owned by the same person with some sort of contract that legally slaves all shareblue writing to the american independent    that blows up your entire thesis that its from shareblue originally theyre just reprinting it all youve done is prove that shareblue is a legitimate source because the articles they reprint are from an american journalist organization not a blog or editorial site and any attempt to ban it is clearly politically motivated censorship   theyre not reprinting shit search the twitters of the people who supposedly write for the american independent institute not a single one seems to know or care that a website known as american independent or americanindependentcom exists if it does exist its a legal front for shareblue    if two companies share 100 of ownership 100 of employees and 100 of content theyre the same thing
  make wild allegations without evidence other than hearsay  claims it does not exist  reality points towards the american independent institute existing despite you claiming otherwise      the entire crux of your argument is that its not published with permission of the american independent and good luck with proving that since the article is clearly from there because you dont see a published with permission of shareblue in the american independent article     and ill say again since youre conveniently ignoring it under your logic you just legitimized shareblue as a news source since if theyre just using the american independent institutes work which again is not a blog or editorial site but again say it with me an american journalist institute that means nothing they publish is in violation of the rules of /news/s standards and practices is a journalist site
  reality points towards the american independent institute existing despite you claiming otherwise  since the american independent is supposedly a 501c3 nonprofit organization i looked them up on the irs website which shows that as an organization the organization has had zero income and zero expenditures since 2016 when they were used as a vehicle for grants meaning that in the last two years the organization has done literally fucking nothing this means that the american independent institute hires zero journalists have zero employees and pays zero dollars for articles    which makes sense of course because the entire thing is run by shareblue the entire organization known as the american independent today consists entirely of a wordpress blog that feeds out a server backend belonging to shareblue hosting writing by shareblue employees which were paid by shareblue to write articles
  if they arent reprinting you better tell the american independent institute it doesnt exist since it says right there that they are being reprinted with permission   which of course leads into that second point that its still a legitimate journalist organization until you can prove otherwise meaning any attempt to ban shareblue is without merit and politically motivated
  if they arent reprinting you better tell the american independent institute it doesnt exist since it says right there that they are being reprinted with permission   its a legal front for shareblue    which of course leads into that second point that its still a legitimate journalist organization until you can prove otherwise   do you believe that a legitimate journalist organization can be a legitimate journalist organization despite having zero journalists and in fact literally not engaging in any business activity whatosever
  a legal front   nice attempt at using a loaded term to create bias  zero journalists  you better tell all those journalists who have their articles up on american independent institute that they arent really journalists im sure thatll go over well    again all youve just proved is that shareblue is a legitimate news source and any attempt to ban it on the merits thats an opinion or blog site are wholly without merit
  you better tell all those journalists who have their articles up on american independent institute that they arent really journalists im sure thatll go over well  they are journalists theyre journalists working for shareblue as they selfdescribe on their own social media profiles    what theyre not is journalists working for the american independent institute a completely fictitious legal organization with zero employees    nice attempt at using a loaded term to create bias  please tell me what term you would use for an organization with zero existence which takes no activity other than serve as a legal container used by a second company
  so you admit theyre journalists even if their work is published for shareblue which means their work arent blogs or opinion pieces glad to see were making progress     however its extremely clear that the american independent institute still exists because the website is up and still publishing articles and all you have currently is speculation     if you want to open /news/man picayune /news/s very own newspaper and do an investigative report into how the american independent institute operates complete with asking their employees for comment feel free to do so although based on your posting style and clear personal biases youd inject a clear right wing bias into it so thats already going to look messy
  so you admit theyre journalists even if   infowars has journalists you still cant post infowars nor can you post clones of infowars    and all you have currently is speculation   i have their tax records which indicate that they had zero income and zero expenditures starting from 2017 continuing through the present day and therefore that they employed zero journalists and paid for zero articles during this time period    however its extremely clear that the american independent institute still exists because the website is up and still publishing articles  their website is a wordpress blog configured to serve from a database belonging to shareblue    if two companies share 100 of ownership 100 of employees and 100 of content theyre either the same thing or one of them doesnt exist
  infowars is banned  which appears to be a lie if you look at the archives every deleted thread with an inforwar links was because of shitposting or personal army requests in the op notice how the one time they didnt do that the article wasnt deleted      that would prove infowars is allowedunder the precedent that their links dont contain shitposting or make personal army requests which again shows bias if shareblue is banned if inforwars isnt    and it still exists as a source for articles which others then use with citation     also your assumption that they are one and the same is flawed by that logic all washington post journalists are employees of amazon you see the flaw there
  its possible and also extremely likely that the infowars thread was overlooked because nobody bumped it and it quietly went to the graveyard without anyone taking the time to notice it let alone report it youre free to test it for us if you want    by that logic all washington post journalists are employees of amazon you see the flaw there  shareblue and american independent institute share    100 of ownership   100 of content   100 of employees    washington post and amazon share    43 of ownership   0 of content   0 of employees    so no your analogy is garbage people who work for amazon get paychecks that say amazon and people who work for washington post get paychecks that say washington post neither of these companies have income and revenues totaling 0 each    q where do american independent articles come from  a shareblue    if you have a plausible answer to that question thats not shareblue id like to hear it
  i have their tax records which indicate that they had zero income and zero expenditures starting from 2017   sounds like a front organization of some sort
  whoa man you cant use that word
  with how slow the traffic is and the fact infowars is easily seen in the textline i find it hard to believe a mod didnt skim through /news/ unless you have proof its overlooked     furthermore the articles shareblue uses come from the american independent institute not the other way around hence the whole published with permission of the american independent which throws a massive wrench into your argument about shareblue being the alpha and omega     obvious were at an impasse me wanting free speech and all sources that arent blogs or opinion articles you wanting to shutdown journalist publications you disagree with ideologically  why dont we just ask them  in fact ill do that ill take everything youve posted so far the taxes the journalists twitter accounts present it to them and ask for a comment    consider this the first and probably only work of the /news/man picayune  youre welcome
  mods dont skim boards unless theyre regulars mods check the report queue    which throws a massive wrench into your argument about shareblue being the alpha and omega   likely shareblue gives articles to the american independent to make it look like theyre sourcing an independent media outlet instead of writing all of its stories inhouse  unlikely american independent hires shareblue journalists for salaries of 0 simultaneously shareblue pays these journalists to sit on their ass and do nothing    american independent has literally no existence independent of shareblue    in fact ill do that ill take everything youve posted so far the taxes the journalists twitter accounts present it to them and ask for a comment  yeah you do that tell us how it goes
  well either a mod or janitor skims the board because we have posts in this thread that were deleted and from the looks if it they were just cookie cutter shitposting which almost always flies under the radar for reports so were clearly being monitored even if you dont think it or are trying to deny it    thats a theory but thats still all it is without divisiveness evidence to prove otherwise and sadly i have to do your job for you    yeah you do that tell us how it goes  i am thank you for asking ill even post their response if im able to get one regardless of what it is but forgive me if i dont believe youre take a response in good faith it if doesnt confirm your own personal bias
  and from the looks if it they were just cookie cutter shitposting which almost always flies under the radar for reports   literally anyone can report anyone they want    and sadly i have to do your job for you  i literally have zero obligation to you whatsofuckingever if you want something done do it yourself
  you clearly dont know the mind of the average poster and how they dont report individual shitposting unless its extremely bad or in the case of /a/ is a pepe or wojack  he doesnt want to discover the truth to find out if hes theories are correct   leave to the right leaning people to be all bark and no bite unless its to suppress people they dont like     and the questions in regards to their taxes journalists and hosting have been sent again youre welcome
  you clearly dont know the mind of the average poster and how they dont report individual shitposting unless its extremely bad  the average poster doesnt matter reports are determined by the most reporthappy set of reporters    leave to the right leaning people to be all bark and no bite unless its to suppress people they dont like  you believe tons of retarded shit based on literally nothing the truth is staring you right in the fucking face with literally no alternative explanation its all the same shit you want the alternative explanation you provide it    i thought you were emailing 4chan not aie / shareblue in which case yes i actually am going to ignore what they say unless they have a fucking fantastic explanation for whats going on you might as well ask trump to his face whether he ever did anything bad and take his answer at face value
  the truth is staring you right in the fucking face with literally no alternative explanation  this is how biased you are and how badly you want your theory to be true  say it with me published with permission of the american independent    being this mad about asking aii and sb for comment on the points you brought up  outright admitting that youre just going to disregard what they say unless it fits your narrative   you see this sort of stuff is why youre the baddie and look like the enemy of free speech
  say it with me published with permission of the american independent  the theory that shareblue gives articles to ai which they then cite is consistent with that tagline the theory that ai has journalists that it doesnt pay is not you are choosing a theory inconsistent with reality to fight a theory consistent with reality because its personally convenient to you    they dont even need that permission american independent has everything under cc license    you see this sort of stuff is why youre the baddie and look like the enemy of free speech  i have facts on my side i couldnt give less of a shit how it looks to a retarded spammer scraping the bottom of the barrel for shit arguments wapo and amazon really did you think that analogy made any sense when you made it
  i missed this because you masqueraded it as a quote when it wasnt    outright admitting that youre just going to disregard what they say unless it fits your narrative   next you can email rt and ask if they work with the kremlin at all and theyll say no theyre an honest reporting outlet and definitely not a propaganda outlet
  youre just choosing the theories that fit your narrative  as for cc its still good form to give credit to where you get your material from otherwise you run afoul of plagiarism which is the cardinal sign of journalism   plus you dont have the facts you have a bunch of theories and indignant anger fueling you on your side   and the fact youre blaming me for your own problems and being upset over just getting a comment because youre so blinded by your personal biases     this is really sad and i almost feel sorry for you if you werent on a made campaign to censor sources that dont align with you politically
  youre just choosing the theories that fit your narrative  you choose to believe that an organization that literally employs zero people is the actual source for shareblue articles instead of the journalists on their own fucking payroll this is utterly implausible    my theory does not require me to believe anything completely thats fucking retarded yours does that makes mine superior    and the fact youre blaming me for your own problems and being upset over just getting a comment because youre so blinded by your personal biases   im mostly aghast the fact that you believe the insanely retarded shit that comes out of your own mouth
  again all you have a theory with zero concrete evidence to back it up just theories and im dismayed at how youre so blinded by your partisanship that you cant even consider the idea that you might be wrong     now as lovely is it is to read your pissing and moaning over the facts im going to wait for a response and well see what happens from there
  again all you have a theory with zero concrete evidence to back it up just theories   ive delved into their tax returns and analyzed their supposed journalists in depths none of which profess any affiliation whatsoever with aii what constitutes concrete evidence for you a televised interview with david brock in which he admits everything your standards for what constitutes evidence are fucking stupid    you cant even consider the idea that you might be wrong  if you can think of an alternate theory that isnt retarded im happy to consider it so far you dont have any maybe shareblue will give you one    now as lovely is it is to read your pissing and moaning over the facts  in something like fifty posts youve managed to produce a single fact within a sea of shitposting one which doesnt even contradict my theory i guess now that youre at a total loss for a plausible explanation youll have to outsource your higher mental functions to shareblue again i look forwards to it
  its the fact that the aii exists and is still publishing content which is what throws a wrench into your theory  this entire thread of posts from you is just your singular rage towards shareblue what did they ever do to you more than force you to read news articles that make you question your world view
  they exist because 100 of their articles come from shareblue writers paid by shareblue to write their articles there is no wrench in this theory    this entire thread of posts from you is just your singular rage towards shareblue  no its directed at you because youre a complete and absolute shit eater desperate to game the rules and engage in the most retarded conspiracy theories to get your way  against other users against mods against 4chan  while thinking youre some sort of savior of the board
  thats an interesting theory have you proven the money comes from share blue to back it up or do you just have circumstantial evidence   thats an interesting theory you have about me but also wrong how does it feel that you need to villianize everything that does not fall in line with your world view it cant be healthy
  there is no fucking money or else it would show up on a form 990 have you been paying literally no attention    fact 100 of articles on the aii site are authored by shareblue writers   fact 100 of of articles on the aii site are then published to shareblue  fact aii does not provide any compensation to these shareblue writers  fact 0 of shareblue writers ever mention working for aii    my conclusion aii receives articles from shareblue so they can publish them for shareblue outside attribution  your conclusion 
  fact the articles still come from the american independent institute   fact any article printed has published with permission of the american independent  you concussion grand conspiracy of a front organization of journalism to publish articles with outside attribution   my concussions connected but still separate organizations where one attributes from the other  occams razors my associate  now tell me what did shareblue do to you to make you so vitriolic
  fact the articles still come from the american independent institute   fact any article printed has published with permission of the american independent  yes after having been given the articles by shareblue    connected but still separate organizations where one attributes from the other  now explain how aii gets journalists to write articles for it    now tell me what did shareblue do to you to make you so vitriolic  be militantly spammed by a retard on /news/
  and again you have no proof of that which is where your theory over extends and falls apart   im not a writer for them so i wouldnt know but you were willing to look them up perhaps you could ask them if youre that curious     also you make it sounds like your problem is with spam not the content itself yet you still want it banned that greatly infers a political bias   which is a big problem
  im not a writer for them so i wouldnt know but you were willing to look them up perhaps you could ask them if youre that curious   i already know the answer as the journalists themselves say describe themselves as working for shareblue and therefore any of their articles that appear under the aii label were given to aii by shareblue    also you make it sounds like your problem is with spam not the content itself yet you still want it banned that greatly infers a political bias  i literally dont give a shit about the content except that 1 you want to make it a new standard in /news/ to open every op with partisan garbage and 2 youre doing it for the sole purpose of dodging a shareblue ban     if i knew for a fact that you personally never posted shareblue or ai in /news/ ever again i would not complain about it since it wouldnt be part of your plan to shit up /news/ to the maximum degree possible of course i cant know that its not you and therefore shareblue posters dont get the benefit of the doubt    not that it matters anyway since its always you
  i already know the answer  no you dont you have not prove anything of substance   also its pretty clear youve just got the victim complex and youre now trying to turn me into a villain because you cant handle opposing view points   you should calm down maybe actually take this time to research your claims to confirm them and ignore them if youre proven wrong
   you have not prove anything of substance   these supposed aii journalists nowhere in anywhere of their writings indicate that they know aii even exists even though they talk about how they work for and promote shareblue all the time there is no evidence that at this time that aii is anything more than a publishing label for shareblue journalists    if the fact that an organization has zero financial existence isnt enough to convince you that its not doing really anything i dont know what to tell you    also its pretty clear youve just got the victim complex and youre now trying to turn me into a villain because you cant handle opposing view points   i have handled opposing viewpoints for years on end without any issue you get to be the villain because youre a spammer and a retarded conspiracy theorist with a martyr complex who chooses to believe absolutely retarded things    again im 100 open to reasonable alternative explanations you havent provided one youve just shouted its a theory over and over again as if it makes the theory any less plausible or removes any of its explanatory power for observations that would be highly unusual if aii were the prime mover given a theory that fits all observed facts im going to choose to believe in it until you  or anyone else  comes with up with a better one or maybe even just one thats not utterly fucking retarded
  you could just ask them to confirm but you refuse to follow through with anything you say hence why its just its not just a theory but a conspiracy theory that you think the aii is a front organization     it seems like youre just assuming everything bad on this board is from me and in fact shareblue shouldnt be banned unless you have a personal bais against the site which from your posts it clearly looks like you do     but well see what they say about the various concerns you have when they reply and its not my fault if youre so biased that you seem intent on dismissing whatever they say before they say it
  you could just ask them to confirm  should i also email the rt to ask them if they are in fact independent of the kremlin would the answer be informative in any way    normally if a company were a real journalism outlet or a real company of any kind you would expect it to have income expenses and employees therefore if a company has no income no expenses and no employees it is not a real company ie its a front i dont need to exhaust every other explanation before coming to this conclusion    now that i think about it im going to file a complaint with the irs challenging american independents 501c3 status since 501c3 organizations are legally required to be nonpartisan which shareblues media arm is clearly not    it seems like youre just assuming everything bad on this board is from me  how many of the people posting shareblue and affiliated links on this website arent you
  again always assuming the most cynical outcome because it would go against the narrative you create you do that maybe well see where the funding comes from and it will confirm theyre separate groups once and for all     ill wait for a response and well see where they facts take us you can continue your jihad against shareblue
  how many of the people posting shareblue and affiliated links on this website arent you
i have a strong belief that the largest majority in the united states is left leaning moderates and that the shift is toward moderate leaning liberals liberalism ignoring the specific left vs right politics has been the principle governing western culture since the enlightenment and while reactionary conservatism is due to rear its grotesque head every once in a while as a response to the inadequacies of the elite caste or instability the pressure of time favors progress    the threat is for a reactionary conservative party see prefascists to come into power and warp the way elections and government appointments happen to not only favor them but favor them systemically this seems to be the weak spot for democracy the good news is that we have a lifetime appointment system on our highest court to uphold or strike down laws that threaten the republic and the elections also weve got systems in place that prevent foreign governments from influencing our elections adding further historical democracies have always survived coups attempted from within by authoritarian usurpers just look at caesar napoleon mussolini  hitler
  i would honestly say about 3/4 or so are me but that has nothing to do with their validity as a source
  can you point to some examples of links not posted by you
  holy fuck imagine being so stupid that the democratic senators are the ones you want to kill here fuck these retards for enabling the gop psychopaths
  republicans did nothing wrong
  ive seen some but i cant think of any off hand
  hey its sock puppet anon
  soon moshi
    fatalities resulting from attacks by far right wing violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years and were the same in 3 of the years since september 12 2001 of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since september 12 2001 far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 73 percent while radical islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 27 percent
    not sure that even sounds rightwing  more like just a strange anarchist wingnut of some sort   but it would be a mistake to call him rightwing for having a paranoid antigovernment stance since there are leftwing anarchists and libertarians of various sorts
  no shots fired nothing to see here  meanwhile leftist actually carry out acts of physical violence against political foes
  according to the deep state fbi still under andy mccabe and his band of saboteurs  it was a deep left state hit set up to make right wingers look crazy which we are but not leftist bat shit crazy evil
  lol  
started as a republicanregistered conservative due to family upbringing switched to independent after seeing all the shenanigans but would still vote mostly r transitioned to voting mostly 3rd party but saw how most of those votes were wasted while the republican party was becoming an increasingly brazen enemy of the people finally registered as a democrat in 2016 to be able to have a say in the primaries and im now at the point where i will never again in my life vote for someone who is willing to call themselves republican that party is beyond redemption
    some people are just cognitively challenged some things just dont click with them
  calling the left crazy after uttering the words deep left state hit is not helping your case    let me make this clear right now if a deep state existed trump would never have won the election this incompetence is all on him    inb4 but we just happened to beat them this time  yeah isnt that convenient that the people who control everything are suddenly inferior when it suits you this is quite literally one of the main tenets of fascism
trump supporters  some of the most powerful and recognisable people in the world were able to organise a paedophile ring in the basement of a pizza place in dc thats doesnt even have a basement    also trump supporters  theres no way trump would ever do something like this to help a nation that he has publicly praised and has considered an ally and that he has quite a lot of money invested in
ththe left are the violent ones    
it really amazes me what modern conservatism has become conservatism used to be about empowering the individual against big government and i get that i dont always agree but i understand its purpose to check power but modern conservatism all boils down to one thing its not my fault you were born in the wrong place dont make it my problem better luck next time that really is the foundation of all their ideologies and policies from womens rights to immigration from health care to voter registration from economic policies to geopolitical ones to judicial decisions    conservatives are the christianwing of most western political systems and i cant think of anything more unchristian
  also trump supporters  theres no way trump would ever do something like this to help a nation that he has publicly praised and has considered an ally and that he has quite a lot of money invested in    what had putin gained since trump has been in office more sanctions    leftists  we should pick a fight with a powerful nuclear armed nation because they dont believe in 72 genders
  the crippling of the western alliance and trump being his personal bitch including that intentionally televised diplomatic blow job he gave putin at helsinki isnt a great deal for him    putins managed to pay off bolton one of the biggest war hawks who was a cold warrior before he had to switch gears to hating fundamentalists to keep power
  the crippling of the western alliance    this hasnt happened except in the minds of cnn pundits we are still allies with europe and the west international economic institutions and military institutions such as nato arent going anywhere this is just a meme that youre parroting    trump being his personal bitch    assertion     including that intentionally televised diplomatic blow job he gave putin at helsinki     wow he didnt call putin literally hitler in a speech for no good reason like obama would have such controversy      isnt a great deal for him  no not really horrible return on investment if trump benefited him in some materially way via an actual policy and not just words such as militarily economically etc then maybe it would be worth putin spending piles of rubles on a crack team of 1337 russian h4xx0rs    also we should be allies with putin why would we not be because of crimea who cares how does that concern us its in russias sphere of influence and we do likewise all the time with countries in our sphere of influence you shitlibs are just mad that putin doesnt fellate your nonbinary poc muslim pets and instead does what he believes is in the interests of his own country instead
  cracks in the wall of nato free reign in the middle east a weakening of the western security commitment in eastern europe and the general withdrawal of the united states from the promotion of rights and democracy worldwide
  cracks in the wall of nato    lol plz    free reign in the middle east    as long as we protect american oil interests which we are dont care    a weakening of the western security commitment in eastern europe    probably not true and if it is i dont care    the general withdrawal of the united states from the promotion of rights and democracy worldwide    dont care not our job
  its nice and all that you dont personally give a shit if the united states retreats entirely from its presence on the world stage minus saudi arabia but the original question was what does putin get out of the deal and all of these are things that putin very much enjoys having
  yah well when trump disbands nato i guess youll have a point until then its all empty rhetoric
  janitor/mod saw the twitter link and killed it as per the rules of /news/  fixed
      im glad this thread is still here so you guys look completely idiotic now that a deranged republican is literally mailing bombs to any democrats who dare speak out against trump
  should have happened a while ago  that robert denrio must be stopped he cant keep getting away with it
        and now there was the pittsburgh synagogue shooting those posts just keep aging worse and worse    the right is absolutely fucking unhinged
man look at all the fiddles being played all over the country here
  wanna say that in english you fucking nazi sympathizing retard
    kek why cant right wingers first do something and make jew rooster sounds after the shit is done
  well one of them just did do it fucking despicable that all these innocent people are dead and there will still be so many people who dont wake up who say it doesnt matter because they were jewish or its all a false flag because that way i dont have to ever accept that i may be on the wrong side
think of all the freethinkers among sheep who have the world figured out because the earth is flat ancient egypt was ruled by aliens believe in muh chemtrails illuminati think they have superpowers etc   now reflect your views for a moment is it possible that at least some of your beliefs are based on pure bullshit do your research yes the jews do have influence over the world no theyre not doing a psy op operation against trump and his redneck followers no theyre not the ones turning you into a sexually confused/insecure mess jews love trump
  wow he didnt call putin literally hitler in a speech for no good reason like obama would have such controversy  he essentially told the whole world that he thought our intelligence agents are full of shit and he believes a ruthless dictator who kills journalists over them     for a guy that says america first he seems to put russia and putin above america a lot more in fact he often seems more friendly to dictators than fellow americans or americas allies
  yeah we got a couple fucked up retards in our little group so do you the difference is the right isnt made up of limp wristed faggots and pedophiles when we are a threat we are a threat you are just cunts kicking trash cans and attacking people with bike locks  fuck this guy and his stupid shit but keep this in mind next time you dumb motherfuckers talk about revolution
  is completely valid when the opposing side threatens to shoot people while your side actually has shot people
    terrorists murdered 3342 people on us soil from 1992 through august 12 2017 islamist terrorists are responsible for 92 of all those murders the 9/11 attacks by themselves killed about 89 of all the victims during this time during this time the chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an islamist was about 1 in 25 million per year    nationalist and right wing terrorists are the second deadliest group by ideology as they account for 66 of all terrorist murders during this time the 1995 oklahoma city bombing the second deadliest terrorist attack in us history killed 168 people and accounted for 77 of all the murders committed by nationalist and right wing terrorists the chance of being murdered in a nationalist or right wing terrorist attack was about 1 in 33 million per year    left wing terrorists killed only 23 people in terrorist attacks during this time about 07 of the total number of murders but 13 since the beginning of 2016 nationalist and right wing terrorists have only killed five since then including charlottesville regardless the annual chance of being murdered by a left wing terrorist was about 1 in 330 million per year  
  yeah thats the trouble with 9/11 it breaks the scale if you count it by number of attacks it quickly shows just how much of an outlier it was
  all sides is the same but our side is much worse and actually commits genuine violence  did you really just try to brag about this good grief
    this is getting disturbing im genuinely concerned theyre going to try something largescale when they get clobbered in a couple days
  why wasnt that old cunt madonna arrested then
  why arent you
the selfconscious unpaid curtaintwitching wretch ever vigilant to pour scorn and cynicism on anything they personally perceive as either fabricated and often just against their preference incapable of seeing that what they rail against is essentially what they have become
    sigh
democrats are the real terrorists
  deluded trump cultist
cult 45
but inside this delicious box
trump is an idiot
trump is an idiot
        are they not paying you enough for you to care any more about the quality of your post
  assuming i was being paid why would they require me to care about the quality of my post in the first place
  your right he should have been like that democrat who shot steve scalise instead amirite
  this lost its bite after nikolas cruz you cannot make democrats look worse than republicans after nikolas cruz
  i too enjoy signing up convicted murderers to vote for opposing political parties in order to make them look bad
  im sorry do you think this is a competition or something you sick faggot
  bumping old thread after old thread with a tired old meme  was it autism
  no just patriotism
    patriotism means shooting people  seek help immediately you sick faggot
  schizophrenia is a helluva drug anon
  and denial of reality is your drug
  look up the definition of schizophrenia you brainlet
defense secretary jim mattis last month objected to using military force to protect border agents on the southwest border a knowledgeable current us official and a former defense department official told the daily beast    but mattis didnt object on principle when the department of homeland security requested the socalled force protection mission from the pentagon mattis declined because he thought he lacked the authority to do so the current official said    mattis objection as of late october was the genesis of a highly controversial white house memorandum issued late tuesday explicitly authorizing the potential use of lethal force against the unarmed civilians of the migrant caravan    dhs wouldnt take no for an answer the daily beast has learned homeland security went above mattis head in order to get donald trumps chief of staff to secure for them the potentially lethal military force for which immigration hardliners in the administration had clamored    as first reported by military times on wednesday the white house has expanded the authorities permitted to the military for a border deployment widely panned as a premidterm election stunt among those authorities is a show or use of force including lethal force where necessary military times quoted the memo should customs and border patrol personnel come under serious threat from an unarmed group of men women and children    unusually military times reported the memo bore the signature not of president trump but his chief of staff john kelly a retired marine general and former secretary of homeland security kelly is not in the military chain of command the white house has yet to release kellys oneandahalf page memo but newsweek published it late wednesday    
similar new authorities include crowd control temporary detention and cursory search at the pentagon on wednesday mattis told reporters that he was not envisioning military detention lasting longer than the minutes it would take to subdue a hostile individual restrain them and then turn them over to civilian authorities to be taken into custody    there are no credible reports that members of the migrant caravan seek to harm any american civilian or military the migrants themselves have come under sporadic attack in mexicoprompting police protection rather than violent reprisal as the daily beast reported on tuesday    but the new white house authorization comes weeks after trump mused that troops would be justified in opening fire on migrants who threw rocks a potential crime though he later walked back the comment in mexico the migrants themselves have had rocks thrown at them    last month mattis approved a plan to deploy what has now become 5900 activeduty soldiers to the southern border alongside 2100 national guard forces in support of cbp a key official pushing for the military deployment was national security adviser john bolton initially sidelining mattis dhs secretary kirstjen nielsen and kelly    the daily beast reported at the time that mattis did not sign off on everything dhs at the time wanted including military aid for cbp detentions the knowledgeable us official tells the daily beast that the major thing mattis objected to was the request for troops to provide what the military calls force protection for cbp personnel in other words coming to cbps defense if theyre attacked
cbp in 2014 revised its rules on when its border agents can use force and set a high threshold they instruct agents to avoid placing themselves in positions where they have no alternative to using deadly force and they require a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury or death to the officer/agent or to another person physical injury is defined in the 2014 rules as injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious disfigurement serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ or structure or involves serious concussive impact to the head     while kellys memo authorizes a show or use of force cbps guidelines prohibit discharging a firearm as a warning or signal except in limited circumstances during air or marine enforcement operations that would not apply to the caravan    in internal discussions with dhs mattis pointed to an april 4 memorandum from trump on hardening the southern border that memo directed cooperation between mattis nielsen and thenattorney general jeff sessions on combating illegal drugs dangerous gang activity and extensive illegal immigration border crossings have declined over the past decade and are at levels historically far from extensive but the memo did not provide mattis with explicit authorities to use military force let alone lethal force in aiding cbp should agents come in danger    dhs was unwilling to leave the matter at that the former defense official said that homeland security circumvented mattis and the pentagon and instead went directly to the white house in an effort to secure explicit authority for this move from trump and the west wing    and it appears to have worked kellys memo directly included authorization for lethal military backup
the brave men and women at customs border and protection willingly put themselves in extremely dangerous situations every day to protect americans and their families the presidents authorization ensures the department of defense can step in to protect those who protect us said white house deputy press secretary hogan gidley on wednesday    the first phase of what the military called operation faithful patriota jingoistic moniker promptly abandoned after the electionemphasized logistics thousands of military forces provided fixed and rotarywing airlift temporary housing and massive amounts of concertina wire troops have the right to selfdefense but that was it mattis visiting troops deployed to texas last week admitted the longterm goal of the mission was somewhat to be determined    the next phase appears no clearer after a threestar army general told politico that the military would begin to end the mobilization on the southern border by next month the army issued a statement on tuesday walking it back we may shift some forces to other areas of the border to engineering support missions in california and other areas no specific timeline for redeployment has been determined the pentagon later estimated that the border deployment would cost 72 million through december 15          trumps election stunt wasted taxpayers 72 million dollars also cost a piece of americas soul because the white house authorized the military to shoot unarmed refugees which is a war crime
cant commit a war crime if theres no war     its more like trying to clean up a roach infestation that just wont go away
its not going to be a big jump from foreign civilians to american civilians following israel and nigerias footsteps will be the beginning of the end for us
   as much as i hate the kikes their border policy is great im jealous in that aspect they give zero fucks about what the un says     i wish we could do the same with the mestizo subhumans flooding the border
trump does a ton of shitty things you dont need to fabricate war crimes in order to make him look bad so dont
  no war  war crimes  also  the daily beast
    examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians  nice job supporting a war criminal
  fabricate  even if you think the word war crime is inappropriate here what exactly is fabricated in this story
  if theyre not war crimes calling them war crimes is fabricating war crimes
the article doesnt call them war crimes its just op being a shithead
  its not a war you dumb nigger    not that i would complain if it was i have no pity for subhumans
  justifying war crimes  any times the military intentionally targets civilians its a war crime just because you want to try and justify being a fascist so badly doesnt change the facts
  fabricating war crimes  facts really are inconvenient things arent they
  please stop pretending to be retarded
    please stop trying to defend war crimes it only brings shame to you and your family
  just because you want to try and browbeat people who disagree with you by calling them fascist so badly doesnt change the facts  ftfy youre objectively using the term war crimes incorrectly  no one is defending firing on civilians theyre just tired of your histrionic ignorance
  no one is defending firing on civilians    i am but that still isnt a war crime because there is no current state of war    if we declare war on every central american country then massacre the spics it would be a war crime
  just because there isnt a war doesnt mean its not a war crime why do you think mattis refused to authorized the use of lethal force against unarmed migrants because having the military kill them would be a war crime regardless of if they threw rocks or not
  just because there isnt a war doesnt mean its not a war crime  actually yes thats what it explicitly means you dullard war crimes are crimes specifically committed during a time of war were not at war with the caravan or the countries its people hail from  the term youre looking for would be human rights abuse or crimes against humanity   a war crime is a crime against humanity but not all crimes against humanity are war crimes   the military can commit human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that are not war crimes
  trump wants to commit both
  just admit your original argument was bunk and that you were wrong instead of hail marrying to a orange man bad side tangent like an intellectually stripped coward
  please stop trying to defend war crimes it only brings shame to you and your family  no such war crimes exist the fabrication of war crimes only serves to make you look like a retard and diminish actual war crimes that are occurring as we speak around the world today
  obama already drone striked an american civilian without a trial if your cunts bleeding now im sure you had a stroke when obama did it
  do you lock your front door  if you do why are you not wanting people you dont know who are potential criminals to break in  if you had a gun in your home to defend against burglars would that be a warcrime
  laws of war require both parties to adhere to them why should us soldiers pretend they are in a regular conflict if the persons who hypothetically would attack them are not in uniform saying the soldiers cant defend themselves against civilians is retarded sounds like what the israelis have to deal with in border regions
  laws of war require both parties to adhere to them  no they dont  i dont get where people get that from
    in situations of armed conflict ihl must be observed by all parties  when the situation of violence does not amount to an armed conflict ihl does not apply to the armed group but the individual members of the organization remain accountable under applicable national law    dont throw around war crime hypotheticals without educating yourself first
  you dont understand though orange man bad
  what trump wants to do is both a war crime and crime against humanity   the only question now is will he just be tried in american court or will he also be dragged in front of the international criminal court
you people are arguing semantics trump wants the military to kill migrants and unless youre a nazi that wants trump to kill all the wetbacks everyone with a brain knows that its fucked up to kill non combatants
  ignoring semantics is the reason war crimes is being thrown around incorrectly in this thread      what does frump want to do thats a war crime not accepting asylum requests hurr
  a knowledgeable current us official and a former defense department official    unnamed sources cite    this is grapevine horseshit someone told me that someone told them they heard mattis say xyz
war crimes sentences are only imposed on people who lose wars
  he wont be dragged in front of any court because they know he has millions of armed hardcore supporters and could start a civil war with 1 tweet
  correct
  incorrect try watching a real news source like fox or bretibart idiot
  try watching a real news source like fox or bretibart idiot  this bait is so weak that it is below the dignity of a full response
trump just doubled down on wanting to be war criminal saying troops can use lethal force
  following israel and nigerias footsteps will be the beginning of the end for us  how would ensuring the survival of the state be the end of the state or us if anything its liberty survival thats at steak     /thread    if history show us what will happen its that obama who previously drone an american israel shooting at gaza protesters and trump will get off scotfree due to being in a powerful nation
ivanka trump lied to a reporter about her father authorizing the use of lethal force against refugees she tried to clean up her statement after getting caught    ivanka trump tried to lie to a reporter about her father authorizing the use of lethal force against refugees coming to america but was forced to backtrack quickly when she got caught    at trumps direction white house chief of staff john kelly issued a memo granting troops stationed at the usmexico border the power to use lethal force where necessary    but when ivanka trump was asked about this policy in an interview with abc news her first inclination was to lie about it    reporter deborah roberts asked your father has authorized lethal force he says if necessary does that concern you    i dont believe that thats what he said ivanka lied but his primary role as commanderinchief is obviously to protect the nations borders he has to protect our countrys security but i dont  lethal force in this case would  laughs that is not something i think that anyones talking about    as she lied ivanka laughed off the claim as if it were a fantasy    the abc broadcast then showed footage of donald trump unambiguously noting if they have to theyre going to use lethal force ive given the okay    roberts noted that they showed ivanka the statement from her father abruptly she changed her tune and tried to clean up her lying    so lethal force she said under any circumstance would be the last resort but he is the commanderinchief of the armed forces of this country so he always has to be able to protect the border hes not talking about innocents
  do you have proof that ivanka hangs onto and is fully aware of every word that comes out of donald j trumps mouth like the media does
  any times the military intentionally targets civilians its a war crime      not even close to true if civilians are aiding the enemy war effort in any way shape or form they are fair game under military conventions
  she should have been aware that he father gave the order for the military to commit crimes against humanity since she is a high ranking official and went on tv for the interview the fact abc had the clip ready meant they expected her to lie which is not good    shes either guilty or incompetent
russian media recently reported the comical case of a burglar who last week broke into an office building in the city of orenburg and then fell asleep in an office chair    the botched burglary took place on november 20th when a 36yearold man fraudulently entered a private office building on sharlykskoye road in orenburg by squeezing through a small window on the third floor he then used a variety of tools like screwdrivers wire cutters a hammer a nail puller and a bunch of keys to break into several private company offices looking for valuables he had actually managed to find 140000 rubles 2100 in cash but instead of hurrying out of the building before being spotted the mad decided to get a bit of rest and sat down in a leather chair and thats where police found him sleeping several hours later    according to russian news agency ria the intruder was first spotted sleeping in one of the offices he had broken into by a security guard while checking the surveillance cameras instead of confronting the man immediately the guard contacted rosguard russia national guard which immediately dispatch an intervention team its unclear how long rosguard took to reach the office building but there was no hurry as when they reached the burglar he was still sound asleep in the leather chair next to his bag of cash    the 36yearold man was handcuffed and later placed in police custody he now faces serious jail time as a background check revealed that he had previous convictions and was on the federal wanted list    the moral of this story is if youre planning to carry out a burglary maybe get some rest beforehand as such operations seem to be exhausting    
    wait russian have working police what the fuck this is not what bbc told me
  the moral of this story is  that burglar is a retard who would get caught eventually the moral of the story doesnt apply to him
  russia national guard responding to burglary  color me surprised dont they have a police department
    depends on the place russia is huge near borders and polar areas the rng is the best you can get there its like canadian mounties on steroides and fbi academy
  several countries have law enforcement split between military and nonmilitary branches
  if they are on strike or police need someine with moreliberties they caal the rng  god i wish i lived in russia
  id go on a limb and say the rng is a lot more honorable than the horse cops in canada   t leaf
  horse cops in canada  thats just disparaging referring to the moose cadets as the horse cops
after more than a year of litigation the university of california berkeley has settled a lawsuit with the young americas foundation and the uc berkeley college republicans    campus conservatives accused the university of bias in the process of bringing highprofile speakers to campus the original lawsuit revolved around the cancellation of an event with ann coulter an amended version of the lawsuit included road blocks initiated by the university for an event with ben shapiro    the department of justice filed a statement of interest backing the campus conservatives the crux of their argument revolved around two campus policies that they claim violate students first and 14th amendment rights an unspoken highprofile speaker policy and an onthebooks  major events policy    this department of justice will not stand by idly while public universities violate students constitutional rights associate attorney general rachel brand said at the time    in the settlement uc berkeley agreed to the following terms set by yaf     pay yaf 70000   rescind the unconstitutional highprofile speaker policy   rescind the viewpointdiscriminatory security fee policy   abolish its hecklers veto  protesters will no longer be able to shut down conservative expression    under these terms uc berkeley will no longer be allowed to place a 3 pm curfew on conservative events or relegate conservative speakers to remote or inconvenient lecture halls on campus while giving leftleaning speakers access to preferred parts of campus    yaf and uc berkeley also agreed to a fee schedule that treats all students student groups and speakers equally unless students are handling money or serving alcohol at an event there will not be a need for security fees  
the policy that allowed berkeley administrators to charge conservative students 20000 for security to host ben shapiro  an amount three times greater than the fee charged to leftist students to host liberal supreme court justice sonia sotomayor  is gone says a press release from yaf    this settlement is a huge win for the berkeley college republicans and really all student groups on campus matt ronnau president of the berkeley college republicans told the washington examiner this is a huge win for the 1st amendment and i am proud of the work that the men and women of the berkeley college republicans have put in to achieve this victory    not every conservative speaker faced the steadfast opposition coulter and shapiro faced in october i successfully spoke at uc berkeley on the need for more free speech and event surprisingly went smoothly
huh actually some good news for once liberal or conservative we should all be happy for a free speech win here
i cant believe brumpfbards are able to spread their hate we must resist hate
  well they are bards
  not every conservative speaker faced the steadfast opposition coulter and shapiro faced  thats because coulter and shapiro are tabloid trash
  ah yes shapiro truly does belong right next to articles about the fbi capturing bat children from the underground world you are an enlightened individual
just in case you thought mueller lost his big fish with manafort still working for the the russians and breaking the plead bargain        former trump lawyer michael cohen has cut a deal with special counsel robert muellers team abcs george stephanopoulos reports the deal was announced in a new york federal court thursday    as part of the deal cohen will admit making false statements to congress committees investigating the russia scandal the associated press reports that the false statements relate to a trump real estate project in russia  specifically efforts to build a trump tower moscow    stephanopoulos also claims per his sources that cohen will provide dozens of hours of testimony potentially damaging to president trump    cohen had already pleaded guilty to tax fraud bank fraud and campaign finance charges as part of an investigation run by the us attorneys office for the southern district of new york but he had not previously been charged as part of the russia probe or officially agreed to cooperate with that investigation    cohens team has however been telling reporters for months that cohen had bombshell information about the trumprussia scandal but the claims about what cohen purportedly knew sometimes changed which has led to skepticism about whether he knew anything worthwhile    now cnn reports that in the plea deal cohen will admit falsely telling congress that talks about a potential deal to build a trump tower in moscow had concluded in early 2016 when in fact he continued to discuss it later    and per the guardians jon swaine cohen told the court that he lied to congress about his contact with individual1  aka donald trump  about the project
 is the first time the trump tower moscow project has been mentioned in a mueller charge    in the fall of 2015 cohen  then donald trumps lawyer and a trump organization executive  began exploring the possibility of building a trump tower in moscow he did so with the help of a longtime business associate russianborn developer felix sater    i will get putin on this program and we will get donald elected sater emailed cohen buddy our boy can become president of the usa and we can engineer it i will get all of putins sic team to buy in on this    trumps company signed a letter of intent to build the moscow tower in late 2015 the times has reported and when cohen saw a news story about putin praising trump he emailed sater now is the time  call me    in midjanuary 2016 just weeks before the iowa caucuses cohen even emailed putins spokesperson dmitry peskov asking for help with the project i am hereby requesting your assistance cohen wrote i respectfully request someone preferably you contact me so that i might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals    cohen has previously said he never got a response from peskov and claimed the company abandoned the project soon afterward however buzzfeed newss anthony cormier and jason leopold have documented that cohens efforts to make trump tower moscow happen continued through at least june 2016
  nice this felix guy deserves a medal for having us from hillary
tumbling  umbling  mbling  bling  ling  ing  ng  g      except there was no lesser evil donald trump and hilary are equally horrible people and candidates
  except there was a lesser evil  ron paul
so mueller did this because manafort is objectively a crazy shitbag and real life comic book villain makes sense
  i think the one thing i can say for hillary is that at the very least she did not have a bunch of russian stooges in her campaign staff
  memeing is against the rules on this board
  what can you expect from a campaign that ran on empty the whole way through it was never designed to be a successful campaign but the american people are just that insane even trump misunderestimated our insanity
guess mueller was keeping him as backup manafort must have known more damaging things but he will never cough them up over his dead body because if he does he literally will be a dead body poisoned with polonium or novichok
never trust a russian republicans trusted russians over their own countrymen now they will pay the price
  he warned us we could have prevented it but we didnt listen
  so are you saying its happening
  documented liar out to save his own skin tells more lies in order to save his own skin  cant wait for the inevitable mueller team states cohen lied plea deal off the table should be sentenced immediately headline in a few weeks
  annoyingly the fact that manafort lied even after getting a deal means the intel he provided is inadmissible    of course the fact that mueller knew he was lying probably means he didnt need it
  the fact that mueller knew he was lying probably  yeah thats why he offered him the plea deal    idiot
and what has this got to do with collusion
  criminal conspiracy  ftfy
  mueller gave manafort a plea deal because of something mueller knew manafort would do in the future is mueller a wizard or are you a conspiracy theorist
trump still rocks while deems suck cocks  everyday the america haters rub their hands saying this is it  well i say bullshit
  ignoring the incorrect legal term as pointed out by  the answer is a little bit     it demonstrates that cohen and through him the trump campaign had something to gain under the table by coordinating with russian agencies one of the things that you look for when assessing if someone is a security risk is financial vulnerability  in this way cohen was financially vulnerable to the russians    on its own it proves jack squat  but it isnt on its own
    read the tea leaves properly even if manafort lied the fact that mueller knows he lies means he can use it as evidence against trump this is a quintessential heads i win tails you lose situation   
  mortons fork mueller is very very good at what he does    arguably the guy who ran the fbi through two administrations having been retained by unanimous approval is the most capable lawman in the country even j edgar hoover wasnt as highly regarded
  right they will present their case to the jury using many many pieces of evidence at the end of the day this will be a subjective judgment of guilt made by the grand jury
  your snakeoilsalesmaninchief doesnt love america he only loves himself and wipes his ass with america behind the curtain youre just too gullible to see that
  but you have to admit he is a very good snake oil salesman
  he has the machinery behind the worst moneygrubbing parts of the gop behind him to furnish him with people
  tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down
i hate /pol/yps but i hate /r/politics users more your smugness and sanctimony is so infuriating you dipshits arent half as intelligent as you think you are
  i think its more that youre upset because trump is about have his ass handed to him
  you find smugness more annoying than blatant shilling gaslighting and outright lying
  hillary wouldnt have done the damage to our foundations on a domestic and global stage to the same level as trump i didnt want her to win the primaries but to say that trump and hillary are the same person shows an appalling degree of ignorance/apathy
  shed have made the problems that resulted in trump continue to fester instead of being exposed as they were by his sheer incompetence    thats not really her fault though
  i said i hated /pol/yps you fucking idiot do you really think its likely i support trump are you this mindnumbingly fucking idiotic is it that hard to believe that youre an obnoxious dipshit only a step above most of the trumptards you constantly mock and look down on that youre almost as much as a tribalist yourself    are you illiterate      yes i find the sanctimony insufferable
  bothsidessuckism is also sanctimonious you cant win    even when its true
  yes i find the sanctimony insufferable  see thats fair im just surprised you put it as worse than all the stuff i mentioned
  there are more than two sides you tribalist idiot and even if there werent im not claiming theyre equal which is what you really mean you say bothsidessuckism    also use correct grammar so you dont across as such a fucking moron you and the rest of the fucking idiots on this site who cant even capitalise a fucking sentence
  prior to this it was only suspected that you were an insufferable sanctimonious cunt but thanks for confirming it
  fucking imbecile
  assumes facts not in evidence
  do you know what a full stop is did you graduate high school
  i said i hated /pol/yps  you could be lying about that you know why should i believe it there is no reason i should believe it
  you also said  lol you are reddit  which is a dead giveaway that you are in fact a /pol/yp yourself
  knowing about something does not require me nor anyone else to actually use it      he could also be lying about hating r/politics    who knows how deep the rabbit holes
  assumes facts not in evidence
    jim webb was the real answer
  trump calls investigation that has convicted his campaign manager and personal lawyer a witch hunt  people actually buy it    i want out of this timeline
  i wouldnt object to these people being murdered if you cant acknowledge facts then youre worthless as a member of society
  most people are basically dogs with the power of speech anon
  i wouldnt object to these people being murdered  theyve got more guns than you do
  not to mention the team muellers picked are the absolute best of the best in their fields and all have sterling records in both prosecutions and convictions      in terms of investigators and prosecutors its like putting together an all star team the only thing trump has going for him is the fact he can start a constitutional crisis by fucking with mueller directly and his constant manipulation of the media by trying to discredit the investigation with his nazi propaganda tactic of the big lie by repeating witch hunt over and over      conservatives rarely think for themselves and go with things at a gut level its the reason why democrats keep losing elections even though they come out with comprehensive plans that will benefit conservative voters in the long run it doesnt connect with them on an emotional level like the whole bullshit of how theyll vote for someone they can have a beer with  hell trump supporters dont even care hes a pathological liar and will still follow him its less a political party and more of a cult at this point
  its not all bad the last time the republicans lost so many seats in the house was after watergate also donald submitted his answers to mueller before mueller revealed that he knew manafort was lying since manafort was feeding donald information the whole time it is quite possible that team donald echoed manaforts lies exposing them to perjury    meanwhile the life expectancy in america dropped again due to suicides and drug overdoses these disproportionately affect poor white americans who overwhelmingly voted for donald donald hasnt done anything to help these rural americans unless you count making american imports and exports less viable via his tariffs on top of that its becoming increasingly hard to get laid if youre a donald supporter and of course donald is clearly quite anxious and unhappy personally    so yes people are that stupid but at least their stupidity is causing them to suffer
  mueller gave manafort a plea deal because of something mueller knew manafort would do in the future  no because he knew manafort would tell the truth and provide valuable information     until he didnt whoopsee best of the best though    not to worry cohen the chronic liar whos claims have already been walked back once by his lawyer definitely isnt the backup option only now being trotted out as the bombshell because manafort fell through any day now drumphy is finished guys cohens definitely telling the truth this time
  q prppredicted this
  hell trump supporters dont even care hes a pathological liar and will still follow him  they wont care if hes a literal traitor theyd still vote for him
  know a person is double agent  feed double agent bad information  profit    know manafort is communicating with donalds lawyers still  let him tell his lies and report back to donald  donald submits answers to muellers questions based on the lies manafort told  obstruction of justice evidence plus perjury  profit    dont worry anon im sure time will tell me wrong after all if trump had perjured himself wouldnt he be having a meltdown on twitter
  thats because theyre traitors themselves  remember some of them proudly wearing tshirts that said id rather be a russian than democrat  
  would you rather be a canadian or a republican
  well at least canadians arent our enemy that literally attacked us in 2016 well i guess unless you ask trump he might have a different opinion about that
  you didnt answer the question    that literally attacked us in 2016  they didnt literally attack us in 2016 any more than we literally attacked russia in 96    the word literally has a meaning
  it is the view of the ic that russia did indeed attack us i am just repeating what they stated if you dont like it argue with them not me
  canadians have better beer
  it is the view of the ic that russia did indeed attack us  it was also the view of the ic that iraq had wmds
  it is the view of the ic that russia did indeed attack us  the word attack appears nowhere in context of a russian attack on the united states in the intelligence community assessment background to assessing russian activities and intentions in recent us elections the analytic process and cyber incident attribution
  im still not going to trust russian intelligence over ours even if they sometimes lie which they all do
  do you believe the united states literally attacked russia in 1996
  youre right it was technically not an attack per se i believe the technical term is invitation to a dinner among friends
  so are you retreating from your claim that it is the view of the ic that russia did indeed attack us i am just repeating what they stated
  indistinguishable from an /r/politics bot comment youre more dronelike than the average /pol/yp
    the bottom line is canada is our friend and ally russia blatantly obviously is not you are shrinking from that by going into the semantics of it
  youre saying nothing with your posts your is language imprecise vague and meaningless this is because youre an idiot     go back to /r/politics
  you are shrinking from that by going into the semantics of it  maybe if you dont want people to pick apart the things you say you shouldnt say false things
  one thing to remember is russian intelligence mostly utilizes psychological warfare so they lie a lot
so is anything going to happen this time or is another oh look we got him this time deal need to know if i need to stock up on ammo yet
  it depends whether you think the republicans will ever impeach trump over endorsing lies to congress and all that jazz    if you think the answer is no not ever you dont have to worry about the country imploding even if mueller finds damning evidence
      /r/politics  /pol/ppet detected you must stop projecting and go back to t_d
  yet another tribalist idiot who presumes i must be a /pol/ppet or trump supporter despite the glaring evidence to the contrary    i hate trump i hate sanctimonious american liberals more largely because their behaviour is indistinguishable from trumptards and yet the liberals have a particular smugness to them originating from their perceived intellectual superiority that makes them so much more obnoxious because its this lack of selfawareness and continuing inability to engage in honest selfcriticism that made trump president in the first place
  so youre a butthurt centrist  got it
  i have the opposite view sjws can be obnoxious because of their selfimportance and oversensitive nature but trumptards are infinitely worse with their conspiracy theories and their being uncultured dumb rubes from the sticks
relevant  
how in the fuck is this on page 3
  someone is sliding it
  is it just me or does t_d look a bit like the face of the average trumptard    half crying half desperately looking away and avoiding the topic
  its probably this guy  who thinks everyone who has views contrary to his own is just one person spamming and wants to have them all banned so he can have his hugbox
  reminder that trump would have invested zero of his own money and be paid out a large sum for the licensing of his brand it was essentially a bribe to trump
  this is what an innocent man sounds like
  we got him now this is it the smoking gun here we gooooooooo  gets totally forgotten   its a vox article sourcing buzzfeed for the parts of this bombshell revelation that actually ties it back to trump aside from the usual mastubatory retelling of the trumprussian investigation there isnt anything here unless you really do still believe buzzfeed
why does anyone pay attention to politics left or right its all designed to distract you from real issues
  as much as t_d is in full damage control and wants to sweep this under the rug this a huge piece of the puzzle mainly because it gives full motive for why trump was conspiring with the russians and why hes sucking up to putin all the time to the point he sides with him over america with the new revelations it was all about money and business deals    this is extremely bad for trump because not only did he deny ever having any interactions with putin or russia including business deals but when the fbi came to the campaigns to tell them russia was attacking the us and they should tell them if theyd have any interactions with russia trump remained silent     so to hammer the point home again cohen is giving the all important aspect of motive to why trump did what he did when he conspired with the russians and what should really make trump and t_d shit themselves is the fact that not only mueller put it in his latest report meaning he has other means to prove it outside of cohen but whitaker trumps personal stooge at the justice department signed off on it
tubl ing down  tubl ing down  tubl ing down
  do you understand how these people write laws that affect you
bumph
  wedge issues the only thing most people pay attention to whether on the left or on the right are designed to distract you from the laws that affect you you can thank newt gingrich and republicans in general for that
      the vast majority of voters are invested in normal issues rather than wedge issues unless you consider security issues to be a dog whistle boogieman
  the people who already do vote you mean gingrichs aim was to get the voters who dont normally vote on his side and throw most elections
  surely if we give mueller more time and money he will find wmds in iraq     wait  thats the old script  surely if we give mueller more time and money he will find collusion between russia and the white house    i mean between trump and the russians
  strawman and whataboutism    meanwhile in reality  cohen claims regular contact with trump legal team when crafting false statement to congress  
  /pol/smokers must be desperate
  well i mean investigations tend to take time yes look no further than those into hillary for an example only difference is mueller already came up with charges
  i wish people would stop saying this hillary wasnt good but she was nowhere near as bad as trump
  mfw 1994 was literally 25 years ago next month  i have no face and i must scream
  imagine how bad its going to be in 25 more years
  theyre going to say this in the future to cope
  this is probably going to be a turning point week since this was the week we found out about trumps motive     whats really funny though is this was entirely a self inflicted wound by trump in that if he didnt treat cohen like shit or at least paid his legal fees he wouldnt have turned on him but trump only cares about himself and thats going to be his undoing
  ha ha thats the its been twenty years since meme ha  oh fuck
  word up
  the holder justice department not bringing charges isnt a sign of virtue of obamas cabinet i mean who knew a presidents who signature policy in his second term was daca would selectively enforce the law we know situations where the law was broken but no charges were brought clapper lying under oath to congress as an example yet no charges brought
  this is probably going to be a turning point week said the nervous man for the 546th time in trumps presidency
  mueller keeps relying on documented liars to build a case  documented liars keep lying and bringing down the circus  picks another liar and starts the whole act over because this time itll be different    so once cohen falls through whos the next patsy they can manufacture a bombshell news report out of because at this point the entire purpose of the probe seems to be manufacturing optics to justify its continued existence and lack of a final report we keep hearing is due any day now
  slate makes a very good point that if cohen can be prosecuted for lying to congress house republicans royally fucked over trump inadvertently in their cover up for him because they let trumps people including his son lie with impunity under oath before them
trump wants full and complete sentence for cohen    washington ap  president donald trump is calling for a full and complete sentence for his longtime lawyer michael cohen    trump tweets monday you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term trump added that cohen makes up stories to get a great  already reduced deal for himself    cohen had pleaded guilty in august to eight criminal counts including campaignfinance violation and other charges and implicated the president in open court last week he also pleaded guilty to lying to congress his attorneys have argued that he should be spared prison for crimes he committed in an abundance of enthusiasm for his exboss    his sentencing is scheduled for dec 12      looks like cohen isnt a double agent like manafort was looking at trumps complete meltdown over twitter this morning
when is this over i need a date something
    chicago tribune made a good point if cohen can be prosecuted for lying to congress so can former director of national intelligence james clapper and former cia director john brennan  clinton aides cheryl mills and huma abedin likely lied when they told fbi investigators they had no idea that their thenboss hillary clinton was using an illegal private email server both had communicated with clinton about it
  i doubt even mueller knows considering trumps strategy seems to be bury the prosecution in evidence so they never get a chance to go after him before the statute of limitations 
  sinclair media of print  opinion  also no proof they knew about it and even if they did if it means the destruction of the republican party with trump and every party leader being charged with treason clapper and brennan and some random aids going down would be acceptable loses 
    yahoo news just reported that they could be wrapping up the collusion part and possibly farming out the obstruction part around cohens sentencing on the 12th
  probably when trump leaves office in 2024
  if trump wins reelection dont expect him to leave peacefully after his second term hell he probably wont leave peacefully if he loses reelection either
we might learn something in todays sentencing for flynn
lock them up        washington  when two republican members of congress began formally questioning last week ivanka trumps use of private email for government business it was seen by people close to the white house as a sign of things to come for the presidents family    one of the republicans was senator ron johnson of wisconsin the chairman of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee which has conducted little oversight of the trump white house until now    the other was representative trey gowdy of south carolina the chairman of the house oversight committee who previously led a twoyear investigation into events surrounding the attack on american diplomatic outposts in benghazi libya focusing relentlessly on the role of hillary clinton his most prominent investigation as chairman has scrutinized alleged antitrump political bias within the fbi during its inquiries related to the 2016 presidential campaign    that you now have republicans investigating members of the first family is an indication of the perils ahead for the trumps said tom davis the former house republican from virginia who was the chairman of the oversight committee from 2003 through 2006    mr gowdy who is retiring from congress in january will have little to do with any investigation and his role in endorsing the inquiry was seen as pro forma in his place as chairman of the committee will be representative elijah e cummings of maryland one of the newly empowered house democrats eager to take on the trump administration    the democrats are already laying out lines of inquiry that could quickly lead not just to mr trump and his white house aides but also to his immediate family and republicans returning to capitol hill next year may be forced by the changed political climate to take a harder line toward the trump family
likely democratic targets include not only the presidents personal finances and those of the trump organization but also the actions taken by his sons donald jr and eric and his soninlaw jared kushner during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath    the oversight and judiciary committees are likely to focus on any violations of the constitutions emoluments clause which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders an avenue that will lead to an examination of payments to trumpheld properties and the role of both of his sons and mr kushner and some investigators may try to question donald trump jr again about a meeting he held with a kremlinlinked lawyer promising dirt about mrs clinton    while some of the areas primed for inquiry  most notably ties between the trump campaign the trump organization and russia and possible campaign finance violations  are likely to overlap with investigations by the special counsel robert s mueller iii and federal prosecutors in new york democrats believe they have a broader mandate to question everything from foreign business dealings by ms trump and the trump organization to the administration of security clearances at the white house including the one given to mr kushner    mr trump has told aides that he believes that democrats have the potential to appear overly partisan in investigating his family and that voters may be sympathetic to efforts to rebuff them    thomas m reynolds a former congressman who was the chairman of the national republican congressional committee in 2006 agreed that the incoming house majority would be wise not to meddle excessively in the private affairs of the presidents business and two adult sons    but he said were on a thin line here because the president still owns the company
congressional inquiries are treacherous and can be hard to weather the president is said to be unprepared for the onslaught he is facing even as the white house counsels office which will be led by a new lead counsel pat cipollone is hiring a raft of lawyers    ms trump and her husband mr kushner have had a veteran washington lawyer abbe d lowell working with them for several months but mr trump is famously frugal about hiring personal lawyers and it is unclear whether he or his adult sons are prepared for how much assistance they will require    politically speaking this is the achilles heel of the administration said representative jamie raskin of maryland a democrat who sits on two of the key investigative panels referring to the trump familys business dealings they have turned the government of the united states into a moneymaking operation for the president and his family and close friends that is the exact opposite of our constitutional design    both mr kushner and ms trump were advised by white house lawyers of the risks of joining the west wing as formal advisers two years ago since it would open them up to official lines of inquiry among other issues on the other hand people close to them noted that they might be shielded by executive privilege in some instances whereas the presidents adult sons who do not serve in the administration are not    democrats have said they will not reflexively file subpoenas but they have already gotten signals from the white house that cooperation is likely to be minimal even if the mueller investigation ends in the coming months as mr trumps lawyers believe is possible the white house is facing a string of congressional subpoenas that could grind the gears of government to a halt and put a spotlight on areas that the secretive mr trump prefers to keep out of sight
the presidents tax returns documents he has steadfastly refused to release in defiance of tradition remain a central target    democrats on the ways and means committee are preparing to use a centuryold provision in the federal tax code to try to gain access to mr trumps tax returns aides working for the committees soontobe chairman representative richard e neal of massachusetts believe that trump administration officials at the treasury department could refuse the request forcing the battle into court    but if democrats are successful the returns could offer them their first comprehensive look into the heart of the trump organization and the finances of the first family    the returns could also get wrapped into the oversight and judiciary committees looks at potential violations of the emoluments clause    democrats have already brought a federal lawsuit contending that mr trumps financial interest in the trump international hotel in downtown washington is such a violation but congressional officials said they were interested more broadly in the possibility that the trump family is profiting off their time in office through among other things trademarks granted to the trump organization and ms trumps business abroad    representative adam b schiff of california who will be the chairman of the intelligence committee has said that as he weighs how to reopen the committees investigation of russian election interference he intends to zero in on possible money laundering by russians through the trump organization
that line of inquiry may overlap with the federal investigations but it would most likely involve an attempt to obtain the presidents bank and other business records    mr schiff has repeatedly criticized republicans for refusing to demand the phone records of donald trump jr who exchanged a series of phone calls in the runup to a 2016 trump tower meeting with a russian lawyer in which he was expecting to receive dirt on mrs clinton including with a blocked number that democrats believe could have belonged to his father    representative eric swalwell of california who sits on both the intelligence and judiciary committees said democrats would seek to avoid palace intrigue and voyeuristic interests in favor of potential irregularities shaping government policy like mr trumps foreign financial dealings    yeah it is pretty objectionable that the presidents soninlaw failed a number of times to properly fill out a security clearance form and it is objectionable he still has one now mr swalwell said but is it the most objectionable thing the trump administration has done not by a long shot
  of course the left wants to lock up one of the greatest presidents of all time violence is the only way they see they can push their ideology unlike the reasonable right wing that is has many people that love to debate
its hilarious to see how fast things have been tumbling down
  i cant tell if youre being serious or not
trump derangement syndrome is now an epidemic
  poes law although  appears to be serious
the dems are going to go scorched earth and no one is surprised

these speculation threads are worse than tabloid threads about batboy they clutter the front page you have zero proof any of this is remotely accurate its a collection of hearsay from new york times   this is /news/ not politics this is for actual news stories not speculation on possible news stories this isnt blue board /pol/
  this isnt speculation the democrats are going to investigation the criminal activity of not only trump but his family

  november 14 2018    migrants from caravan begin climbing border fence in tijuana    the first wave of migrants from the central american caravan began climbing border fences on tuesday after arriving at the us border    many on the mexican side of the border climbed the fence and sat or walked on top of it while others jumped and crawled through openings in the fence only to run back to the mexico side when us border patrol agents approached fox 5 san diego reported     border patrol released a statement tuesday that said they believe some of those at the fence are members who were traveling as part of the central american migrant caravan that originated in honduras    migrants who reached the border fence in that area are from honduras guatemala nicaragua and el salvador    as we have said repeatedly being a member of a caravan doesnt give you any special rights to enter the country department of homeland security spokeswoman katie waldman said in a statement to the washington examiner if they arrive at a port of entry they will have to wait in line in keeping with the lawful processes at our ports of entry if they attempt to enter illegally they will have violated us criminal law and in accordance with the presidents proclamation and the interim final rule they would be ineligible for asylum    cont
    the san diego uniontribune released video that showed the perspective of those climbing the fences from the mexican side of the border     the first part of the thousandsstrong caravan arrived at the us border with tijuana over the weekend and made up an 80person lgbtq subsection of the group according to npr    the members said they broke off from the larger group in mexico city after they were discriminated against by local residents and other travelers for weeks    whenever we arrived at a stopping point the lgbt community was the last to be taken into account in every way so our goal was to change that and say this time we are going to be first honduran migrant cesar mejia said during a news conference sunday    end
huh    the caravan was in mexico city two weeks ago you cant cover over four hundred miles on foot in that time span    google      oh they had buses holy shit washington examiner is trash why are they omitting such relevant information
  80person lgbtq subsection of the group  can someone explain this to me how do you get a group of refugees dividing themselves on sexual preference i mean when youre among strangers no one knows youre gay i could understand divisions based on dialect or origin but sexual preference is one of those things that isnt visible and doesnt come up in conversation
  well sometimes the secret gets spilled out and their branded  i mean if you think homophobia in the us is bad its much worse where these come from
  can someone explain to me how if the things in op pic were made of concrete the people would be able to climb them similarly
  would not
  homosexuality is a life imprisonment crime in uganda not all countries are as forward thinking as america    which is saying something considering how fucked up the us is right now
  its much worse where these come from  exactly unless someone who hates you from your hometown saw your face i dont get how anyone would know
  can someone explain to me why libs are so opposed to trumps wall plans when there literally is a wall in parts of the border already
  thats basically it theyre a group made of smaller groups of people who know each other  it only takes one person knowing someone is gay and the whole group knows in a few days and they had some time to chat during their trip
  the way forward is sometimes the way back  labyrinth
never forget the inquisitions mainly by spain was the primary success in history of compelling ethnic jews to stop making human sacrifices to the adversary and switch to following the creator and perhaps son hence the rift between hispanic jews and those who call themselves jews but are not
  why dont people who dont like something approve of more of the same thing
  the parts of the border that need a wall already have a wall it becomes way less cost efficient once you expand beyond that walls only slow people down preferably long enough for the authority behind the wall to respond to someone attempting to cross as such walls are very useful in urban areas where people can pass through and disappear quickly but have way less utility at rural canyons rivers mountains or open desert once youre that far out the natural barriers do most of the work the trick is just detecting illegals and getting border patrol to them    plus construction costs rise significantly the further away you get from hub cities construction difficulty and cost also rises when you have to build across natural barriers then you also have to consider imminent domain issues there are a lot of ranchers on the border who would have to give up a lot of their land and a few of them are trump supporters to boot notably they liked all his policies except the wall    in the end it becomes a very expensive proposal for little effective gain youre basically draining resources from other methods of illegal prevention and removal that would be more effective such as everify to fund a vanity project
  i see that fence is really effective at keeping them out we need more of that
  i see that fence is really effective at keeping them out  people are literally on top of it in the photograph    this is sarcasm right
    if the current fence is inadequate why not build an improved wall or is a barrier in that same exact spot suddenly a bad thing if orange man takes credit for it  aside from  according to me walls are ineffective
  im not against walls as a concept im against burning billions on walls in the middle of nowhere    its all about efficiency again walls dont stop people they slow them down so you want to have walls in key locations where slowing them down actually helps you detain those who make it across building walls at high traffic areas where targets can quickly evade border security good idea building walls in the middle of nowhere where illegals are obvious and in the open for multiple days waste of money could have just bought a drone for the same end result outside of urban areas or easy crossings you dont need walls you need more agents to catch people    seriously the problem in ops pic is that theres nobody there to catch them even if the wall was 10ft higher theyd still be crossing there because its the point of least resistance no guards and highest convenience easy to travel to en masse extending or improving the wall doesnt actually fix this problem so any money spent on that is money not being spent on more agents on the ground and drones in the air
  im just sitting here wondering why they dont just swim around that fence    do they have electric nets or a sniper there or something
  coast guards
  investing on drones and machine learning to identify humans and vehicles would create a virtual wall of surveillance
  sharks they are attracted by all the body parts the cartel keeps throwing in
  if i recall it is the homosexual group that broke away from the rest because they were bigots would you say they are knocking on our back door
  when your trying to stick your penis in other men the whole time your going to get found out as a queer pretty quick
  i would say these homosexuals have already illegally penetrated our back door multiple times and are taking delight in teasing us by popping in our back door when we least expect it
  horde that is less people then attend my kids school christmas show pay no attention to the economic inequality and spiraling debt there are brown people to worry about they eat tacos not burgers and are totally unamerican
  what part of the world illegal do you not understand
  the majority over stays are by visa over statys a wall does zero to counter this  a lot of the people who abuse the system comes from foreginers on prego trips again wall doesnt stop this  people would dig under said wall or scale it  wall would be half assed between admistrations weve seen this happen under bush and bill  fucks up the animal migration patterns  there are native americans on the boarder who freely travel between the two countries for their day to day routines like cattle hearding who would be screwed by the wall   no real plan to address any of these issues has been put forward beyond build wall    could a wall stop some trespassers yes but you get far more bang for your buck if congress was locked into a room and forced to straighten out our immigration laws on threat of starvation along with funding boarder patrol and beefing up the courts
  the part where we refuse to prosecute buisness owners that hire them throw the ceo of hilton up on rico statute for conspiracy to hire illegals and see how quick they self deport this wont happen because buisness is addicted to cheap labor both parties make great use of racial issues christ the two party system in dumb voters arent the customers my man they are the widgets bad policy favoring special interests are the product
    how do you get a group of refugees dividing themselves on sexual preference i mean when youre among strangers no one knows youre gay    being lgbtbbqia is not merely what you stick your phallus in but also a lifestyle and group identity its not seen as something to hide it is more idealistically marketable when they do not compromise their ideals for the journey    there are more important things than sex    the people in the photos are not starving the biggest sacrifice is the loss of their community and all the people theyre leaving behind the vocal fag minority is a clique its like religious freedom which is one of the reasons the us merika was created    also keep in mind theres way more than 80 ass faggots in that group many others are pretending to be straight like you suggested
cant they get by via a boat why should so much money be put in a wall
  i suppose because one point near the ocean would be easier to patrol than a 1000 mile border
  shoulda thought of that
  the ocean is a lot larger than a point
  they eat tacos not burgers and are totally unamerican    id take an authentic taco over a mcdogshit burger any day of the week hey at least theyre not niggers latinos actually want to work
  authentic tacos are made with goat meat thats been sitting in the sun covered in flies hanging off a hook in some old ladys tin shack alley kitchen made with a splash of lime and greens washed in literal sewage water
  t has never eaten anything outside of mac and cheese mashed potatoes and meat boiled to the point of total color loss  cool
  and trump did nothing to stop it
  lol if only you knew    ive been to mexico 6 times among 30 other countries i like the place but honestly its better in the us you can find authentic places that are forced to be clean and have better quality ingredients here at the end of the day i dont care that much about authenticity i care about taste and quality and not getting intestinal parasites
    if there was no wall the majority of illegals would not be from expired visa
every last illegal immigrant needs to be thrown the fuck out
  its better in the us  dont you guys have barely affordable health care and school shootings every week
  did you even read the thread were talking about food you dumb nigger    mexico has no healthcare corrupt everything narco beheadings and worldstartier brutal torture viral videos every week i think ill take school shootings
  authentic tacos are made with goat meat thats been sitting in the sun covered in flies hanging off a hook in some old ladys tin shack alley kitchen made with a splash of lime and greens washed in literal sewage water    still not niggers
   its better in the us  if you are rich    as someone who has lived in both places the us is not that great the only benefits ive found is that you can actually count on police to do their jobs and that corrupt politicians steal but just enough    but that said im middle class with a decent job and ok insurance living in a blue state the us would definitely be worse for me if i was poor or lived in a red state since im not white
  mexico has no healthcare  but they do
  heck its more affordable too
  right now there are chain link fences with barb wire across some scattered parts of the boarder its hardly stopping shit although i think maybe one town has an actual concrete barrier of sorts    the majority being prevented access is due to the natural terrain agents on the ground and smart tactics such as monitoring of popular coyote routes     again you want to fix the problem fix the root of it and punish business that encourage them to come hire more immigration judges make different classes of work visas close the birthright citizenship loop hole steam line the immigration process and the list goes on a single wall on its own isnt going to do jack shit to stop people who are as desperate as these people
  to be fair mexico has more affordable healthcare if you dont mind lack of standards    hell there is a city near the texas boarder that takes in caravans of americans for dentistry procedures 
vmads at border point at fencing  stream it with tits streamer  unzipsjpeg  busts fattest nut on screen can smell the taco niggers flesh starting to sear
fuck the wall land mines instead cheaper and merica
  then sure go to your average mexican hospital and have your internal organs operated on are you religious or a gambler     dont tell me about routine dentalwork set up in cottage industry private clinics for gringos to service old people with no insurance who do the math and can see a root canal is cheaper in tijuana than new york       punish business that encourage them to come  the economic models for entire industries are based on tacit approval of underpaid beaners in red states most of all
and so demand for stolen identities increases id theft and illegal immigration are two sides of the same coin
  i wonder who bussed them in
taking every single person in who wants asylum  theres no way this is sustainable over the long term     inb4  but but but just take in these couple hundreds or thousands this time
  wall supporters are not that bright i am not surprised
  why is it ok for libs to put walls around their neighborhoods to keep the unsavories blacks and hispanics out but the government cant put a wall to keep the rest of us who cant afford to live in mansions safe
  which is exactly what we need not a physical barrier like trump has always touted because he cant differentiate between rhetoric and reality
if youre going to post article at least try to post from a site that makes their fake articles somewhat believable
    its in the works dont worry
    because spending billions of dollar for something that mostly wont work is kinda retarded to be honest
    but youre not actually being honest if you are committed the success of the effort walls and fences work pretty well    a razor wire fence seems to be doing just fine for hungary     
  inb4 russia today ree  its also worth noting that since countries like hungary bulgaria austria started securing their borders more migrants rather risk drowning in the mediterranean than tunneling under or hopping fences through the balkan route  but physical barriers are so ineffective right libs

    the researchers found that liberal individuals were less likely to use words that would make them appear highly competent when the person they were addressing was presumed to be black rather than white no significant differences were seen in the word selection of conservatives based on the presumed race of their partner it was kind of an unpleasant surprise to see this subtle but persistent effect dupree says even if its ultimately wellintentioned it could be seen as patronizing
unsurprising but hilarious thanks
  present themselves as less competent  implying they arent just less competent in general
  liberals are fucking retarded more news at 11
everyone does not just the leftist fools    talking to a nigger is like talk talking to a teenager you have to lower yourself to their level because they are fools
  there are white niggers too and you sound like one of them
  are you one of those civic nationalist fools or just a plain old nigger    to answer your question though no only negroes can be niggers if you want an insult for whites just use cracker or cumskin
i was on a train ride with a black lady who commented on a fifty billion dollar event saying fifty trillion i corrected her gently but she stood by the figure and i didnt press it i do the same thing to right wing white trash its just better to let them think whatever typically harmless
  what type of nigger are you then
  are you one of those autistic white nationalist larpers being paid by the feds or just an idiot with no realistic political objectives
  just answer the question are you a nigger or just a moron with white guilt    or maybe some other race
  liberals dumb their vocabulary down because theyre the masters of the racism of low expectation and think black people are all disadvantaged idiots  wind up coming off as incompetent  like pottery
  why wont you answer mine
  its common courtesy to answer someone elses question first before asking your own
  since when does calling someone a fool and a nigger means you have common courtesy troglodyte
  i have common courtesy for those who deserve it but nogs dont fit that criteria just answer the question
  answer mine since i dont give a fuck about your feelings
  you first nigger
  how do you /pol/tards not read the sticky before posting
yale press release  fake news  new york times opinion piece  real news    the world as according to 
article confirms the obvious
  there are white niggers too and you sound like one of them    shut up shareblue
  talking to a bigger is like talk talking    really activates the almonds
why do leftist do this  do they think minorities are dumber than they are or something
  just because someone is black does not mean they are african
    sen jeff flake drew a dramatic new line against president donald trump and his fellow republicans on wednesday promising to vote against new federal judges unless the senate protects special counsel robert muellers investigation    flake a lameduck arizona republican could jeopardize dozens of judicial nominations senate gop leaders want to push through before the current congress ends in early january    his move comes days after trump installed matthew whitaker as acting attorney general a position that effectively places him in charge of the mueller investigation    whitakers earlier public remarks have sketched out ways to undermine muellers investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of justice afterward    on wednesday flake sought unanimous consent to pass a bill with sen chris coons ddelaware to protect the investigation but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rkentucky immediately scuttled that request     flake a member of the senate judiciary committee who leaves office in january offered a swift response of his own     because the legislation has failed today sen coons and i are prepared to raise it again and again until there is a vote on this vital bipartisan legislation on the senate floor flake said i have informed the majority leader that i will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the judiciary committee or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor until the bill is brought to the full senate for a vote
i dont know if there are even any nominations for his remaining two months in office this is a totally empty gesture    proving yet again hes a spineless piece of shit
  its going to really piss of mcconnell since the one thing he loves to do is put corporate whores and partisans on the court   flake is now just directly fucking up mcconnells scheme to pack the courts doing this even if its for 2 months and puts him in the position to justify why hes so desperate not to protect mueller when its clear trump is going after him
  mcconnell is probably the man in public office i hate more than anyone else right now    trump is disgusting but hes also an incompetent buffoon mcconnell is corrupt but worse hes good at it
this is likely flakes revenge over kavanaugh  he likely didnt want to approve his appointment but had his hands tied so this is his paypack
  why were his hands tied
  shady backdoor stuff and that even if flake voted no pence wouldve approved kavanaugh anyway
  this look at flakes face when he was confronted by the rape victims in the elevator after he said hed vote to confirm kavanaugh in the judiciary committee that was the face of a man who felt guilt over what he did because he was seeing the results of his action first hand and hes not a sociopath like a majority of republicans  he denied it played a roll in his decision to request having the fbi reopen the case but that was just to save face
  i have informed the majority leader that i will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the judiciary committee or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor until the bill is brought to the full senate for a vote  illiterate scum
  still a 2 month delay at best     ill admit it does made him a bigger pain in mcconnells ass than i thought
  would be neat if mcconnell got impatient and actually did put through a bill to protect mueller i guess it all depends on how those last couple senate elections turn out
flake mans up and shows off his balls of steel i like it a floorcrosser nowadays is a sight for sore eyes
  sadly only when theres finally nothing he could possibly lose since his senate seat wasnt even replaced by a republican still preventing the republicans from doing more shady shit during the lame duck period is nice
  mcconnell should do it since there is no way house republicans would vote in favor of it and even if they did theyd never be able to get a veto proof majority  the only reason mcconnell isnt doing it is because hes scared of trump since its clear trump is in full panic mode over mueller since he is coming after him and his kids
  it seems like mcconnell is also afraid of republicans having to be on the record voting against something like that which is why hes spent the last two years blocking a bunch of things from even coming to a vote
wish i had a job i couldnt be fired from by law no matter how bad a job i do or how long it takes    dont worry im sure it will wrap up in exactly 1 year and 11 months
  after how long clinton was investigated nobody has any right to complain about this investigation taking too long    you guys are just getting antsy because mueller is actually competent and so he never leaks
  flake a lameduck arizona republican  what
  the period between the november elections and the time the new congress takes over in january is called the lame duck period    flake is a lame duck because he retired and will not be returning in january
  you are right on he is a piece of shit 18 million taxpayer dollars on that bullshit invest i dont lno why trump dont fire them all god bless u  yours
  whats with all the posts on /news/ that look like theyre written by sociopathic christian boomers from facebook i browse a lot of other boards and i never see any other posts like this only here    is it a bot some shitposter having a giggle or some ridiculous person who actually believes this but for some reason only comes to /news/
  why are you so fucking stupid ohhh its cause cnn told you so mushroom
  they come from /pol/ theres a reason why /pol/tards sounds like your shitty uncle/aunt/grandparents
  jeeez these trumptard posts are getting really incoherent    never mind that mueller paid for his own investigation in asset forfeiture im not even sure the cost of the investigation is the subject of this post
regardless of whether or not trump colluded with russia which he did but lets set that aside for now his attempts to shut down the probe are illegal this is something certain people either dont seem to understand or are playing dumb about he committed a crime in his hamfisted attempts to prove he didnt commit one    the thing about republicans ive noticed more is that they rely heavily on the public not having any idea what the actual laws are they just bullshit something that sounds right like it wasnt illegal to obstruct the investigation because the investigation shouldnt exist and hope people believe it except thats not how the law works
  it seems the short bus from facebook and reddit let the reactionary old folks off at /pol/ and theyve spread out from there usually spotted by seemingly random capslock usage or theyre falseflaggers just trying to stir the pot either way they need more boric acid in their diet
  i do find it hard to believe any of them are actually preparing for war seems likely theyre trying to scare even dumber people into taking action by making them think theres going to be a war soon and it provokes people like all the rightwing terrorists from the last couple weeks to make the first strike which is disgusting considering how many people have died over this pointless shit i really hope the people who post things that incite others to violence and then just sit back at their computer laugh get whats coming to them certainly theyll be judged for this in the afterlife but they need to get their just deserts in this world too
hmmm
    seems it might actually happen
  i sort of assumed it was gigglers    then again 4chains is in the news again these days as a right wing shoutbox so your loudmouthed idiot boomer uncle probably checked it out to see if he could find more evidence against the joos and ended up in /news/ thinking this is where all the right wing action must be
  i sincerely hope republicans vote to protect mueller the least they can do is save whatever decency they have left
  the concern as usual is that mcconnell will prevent the vote from happening because for some reason the senate majority leader is the only person who has any say in whether something is allowed to come to a vote and apparently the country has never had a problem with this how the fuck did america last this long
  i sincerely hope republicans vote to protect mueller  why mueller is a presidential appointment trump should fire him because his witch hunt will not change the outcome of the 2016 election
  whatever decency they have left  the democrats that push for open borders and the repeal of the second amendment have decency the same democrats that say that they will nuke their own citizens
  sources for all three of those why are you faggots so bad at sourcing why do you have to rewy on your widdle fee fees so much (((
      how many rubles did you earn for that ivan when democrats gain control of both chambers of congress and the white house you are so fucking fucked
    christ why do reading these posts make it seem like this board is inhabited with children or simpletons
  the people who want reliable sources are the real dummies  bye ivan
  open borders        none of these people are republicans nigger  second amendment    mueller    read section d    fuck you shill
  why are you saying bye i literally post in /news/ all the time  you sound like someone with a hole in his head
  right wing blogs  opinion  taking what a democrat says out of context  uses the word shill unironically  oh /pol/
  getpocket is a right wing blog  the laws that democrats vote for are opinions  federal regulations are dont matter  yeah youre totally not a fucking shill get out
  you literally posted rightwing editorial links and expect to be taken seriously
  youd think getting clobbered in the midterms would make him realize hes on the wrong side but apparently not
  sigh    can we go back to faggot call me an oldfag but i really dont like the language you /pol/lacks use when arguing
its confirmed that mcconnell is blocking mueller protection bill in order to protect trump
  amazing just how long mcconnell has lasted    i wonder if trumps incompetence and peoples increased awareness of politics will finally lead to mcconnell being jailed
what is wrong with arizona they have some of the worst most corrupt politicians in the us
  you can be all of the above
  mike lee confirmed as agent of russia nixon would have loved him
  what is wrong with kentucky they have some of the worst most corrupt politicians in the us    fixed
    what the fuck he actually did it    but it seems like it didnt affect much which makes you wonder if hes only doing it because they can afford to lose him
  who are you replying to wrong thread
  who are you replying to wrong thread
  hes dug in his heels to the point it is causing the republicans pain  
  lameduck sounds silly but its the term used for an elected official who has been voted out but whose term has not actually ended yet flake is leaving his senate seat after this session of congress but the session has not ended yet so he is a lame duck senator
  its also rare to actually get anything done during the lame duck period which makes it absolutely ridiculous that the republicans are trying to push through as much bullshit as they can
  because they want to fuck over the democrats and the people who voted against them as much as possible just look at the shit theyre trying to pull in michigan  
  fucking over the people who voted you out sounds like a fantastic strategy to win them over back to your side again
  its remarkably dumb because do they not realize the democrats can just repeal those laws once they regain power what the fuck is the point of doing any of this
  the problem is republicans still hold enough power to block the democrats from repealing the bullshit theyre pushing through in the lame duck session in the states theyre doing it in gerrymandering is a hell of an undemocratic and unamerican drug  
  yes for now but you know whos doing the gerrymandering for 2020 the democrats who just took a whole bunch of governorships    its like good job republicans you delayed them for a couple years and the democrats will remember what you did so they can fuck you right back    republicans never fucking think of the long term consequences that disastrous tax plan was a great example of it    were done playing nice puerto rico is going to be made into a state in 2020
  scott to oppose farr nomination to federal bench in nc ending chances of confirmation      tim scott a black republican sunk the farr nomination based on new information about voter intimidation by the campaign of jesse helms rnc in 1984 and 1990 where farr worked as a lawyer so it looks like flakes stand has had at least some effect
    oh shit mcconnell is literally the only one stopping mueller from being protected right now
  republicans still control the a majority of the state houses they gerrymandered like wisconsin michigan and north carolina and the passed legislation in the lame duck session to weaken the power of governors in states where democrats won       theyll just renominate and slam him through in the next congress an ideological racist like farr is someone the republicans cant keep off the bench
who says the british are reserved a couple who lost an engagement ring down a times square utility grate returning home thinking it was gone forever are effusive in their praise for the new york city police officers who found it in the muck 8 feet under    i cannot thank you enough although i will try englishman john drennan said in a tweet directed at the new york police sunday a few cold beers when we come back to nyc we are completely overwhelmed and you will definitely get a mention at our wedding    the nypd had been looking for drennan and his fiancee daniella anthony since they retrieved the ring saturday morning he proposed to her in central park and she said it slipped off her finger and fell into the times square grate late friday night     i was devastated anthony told the new york times i was literally crying it was the worst moment of my life    they asked for help but police officers were initially unsuccessful at getting the ring out and the couple left for england without leaving their names or contact information drennan even bought a second ring shortly after arriving at the airport    meanwhile nypd officers continued their search and on saturday morning they finally located the ring about 8 feet 2 meters underground      
fortunately it was actually kind of sitting on top of all of that stuff so it really wasnt hard to find it was just a small object like that in the midst of all the garbage said det joseph bucchignano the officer who spotted the ring    in an effort to identify the anonymous couple the nypd put out a video message on social media showing them searching for the ring before police had arrived drennan is seen on his stomach peering through the grate      drennan told the newspaper that they had planned to keep the lost ring a secret but a friend forwarded him the police twitter message drennan then called new york police on sunday

    a new washington post analysis of domestic terrorism argues that attacks from white supremacists and other farright attackers have been on the rise since barack obamas presidency and surged since president donald trump took office its a familiar storyline meant to assure liberals that yes trumpmotivated rightwing terrorists are running wild there are however a few problems with this proposition    for one thing even if we accept the numbers the post offers the use of the word surge  meaning a sudden powerful forward or upward movement  strains credibility theres no evidence of a surge either in historical context or as a matter of ideological preference but even if were okay with replacing uptick with the word surge a cynic might note that the posts reporters seem to filibuster their own findings to push preconceived partisan notions about the state of the nation    that is to say we have good reason not to accept the numbers according to the washington post which relies on global terrorism database gtd data there were allegedly zero  not one  acts of rightwing terrorism in the entire nation in the year 2002 since then we have seen a surge to 36 in a nation of 325plus million people by 2017 among those acts there were 11 fatalities
right wing site uses dishonest math to try and claim there isnt a surge  the federalist has blood on their hands  
  facts  dishonest match  lol youre a moron
  the only one being dishonest are right wingers
  then maybe these right wingers should be more like you then a scared twat that hides behind a keyboard
  right wingers are getting more violent  but they are also loser keyboard warriors who dont do anything  pick one narrative and stick with it buddy
  leave out 9/11  include muslims in the count even though democrats are importing them into the country  yeah youre balanced and fair fuck off idiot
  the editor of the federalist is one of foxnewss biggest talking heads      the federalist is a news and opinion website that reports with a right wing bias that typically favors the right and denigrates the left there is frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this the new york times hit piece on mike pence is antichristian bigotry plain and simple in general the federalist sources all of their information to credible mainstream outlets however they sometimes use sources that we have rated mixed for factual reporting such as the daily caller    according to an article from the left leaning daily beast the federalist was openly critical on donald trump before he won the election but has since become a strong supporter of his presidency and agenda further in november 2017 the federalist came under criticism from both conservatives and liberals for publishing an opinion piece by ouachita baptist university philosopher tully borland defending roy moores dating of teenagers while he was in his 30s and arguing that such behavior was not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family    a factual search reveals that the federalist has made a mostly false claim that was not corrected in order to be classified high for factual reporting a source may fail only one fact check without correction if another fact check is failed by this source it will be labeled as mixed for factual reporting    overall we rate the federalist right biased based on story selection that favors the right and high on thin ice for factual reporting 8/8/2016 updated d van zandt 8/10/2018
  chris cuomo cnns top guy is andrew cuomos brother what the fuck are you trying to say shill that fox isnt credible but cnn msnbc are
  okay class what fallacy is this /pol/ppet is using  
  cant attack the article   attack the source instead   this is what we call desperate
  you are using an appeal to authority you cant attack the content so you are attempting to discredit the source
  fallacy fallacy      to be fair all their argument is quibbling over percentages where they forget even 1 act of terrorism is 1 to many but now theyve spiked under trump so they have to be in full damage control to say there isnt a problem with right wing terrrorism even though there clearly is one
  terrorism spiked under trump because of antifascists your term right terrorism is a shill native using your cherrypicked statistics to paint a really different picture you hacks never put 9/11 into the mix and you even have the audacity to count hispanics and muslims that you imported into the country
  the federalist came under criticism from both conservatives and liberals for publishing an opinion piece by ouachita baptist university philosopher tully borland defending roy moores dating of teenagers while he was in his 30s and arguing that such behavior was not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family  fucking lold
  antifa is to blame for all terrorism  oh the /pol/ppet thinks hes people     as for right wing terrorism it was already posted and its not cherrypicked    
  let me quote    read the actual source you dumb libtard it says most the terrorist attacks in committed in the united states are actually carried out by muslims in fact if you look at the stats from 1970 until 2016 4/5 of the deaths are attributed to 9/11 you guys are fucking shills
  good thing were talking about 20162018 and not 19702015    stop being a terrorist apologist
  fallacy fallacy fallacy  look i can do that too    okay well the article may be right but even one act is too many  stop arguing like a weasel
  this  fuck the federalist shills
  9/11 isnt domestic terrorism you dumb fuck
  terrorism spiked under trump because of antifascists  so when that dude shot up a church full of black christians he did it because of antifascists i cant wait to hear how
  still talking about domestic terror here
  9/11 isnt domestic terrorism  it happened on american soil you fucking retard it is domestic terrorism the high jackers had work visas you fucking retard
  when terrorism happens in the united states it isnt domestic  holy fucking shit these are the types of people were dealing with
  the article links a study that defines 9/11 as domestic terrorism you fucking fool how do you not read your own sources
  that would make all terrorist attacks domestic how does a terrorist attack that doesnt happen on a countrys soil affect that country    domestic terrorism is terrorism committed by domestic terrorists ie native population timothy mcveigh is a domestic terrorist 9/11 terrorists were saudis not americans so what if they had work visas what if they had tourist visas what if they were on a visa waiver program      why would america care about terrorism that doesnt happen on its soil does the us include barcelona and london attacks into its statistics      i didnt read the article i thought it was talking about us statisticswhere rightwing terrorism is on the rise
  9/11  muslims  hohoho
why are rightwingers so fucking stupid holy shit
holy shit you americans are fucking retarded  you have doomed us all
  americans no matter their virtue signaling political affiliations are killing this planet with stupidity alone
    absolute retards why is forcing a narrative so god damned important for you brainlet ameritards
  why are you so desperate to defend right wing terrorism
  9/11 terrorists were saudis not americans so what if they had work visas  inb4 the npc chooses this one specific moment to claim a work visa makes you a resident when in all other circumstances he is virulently anti immigration    because intellectual consistency is for libtards
  what right wing terrorism did you not read the article   do you need help reading anon just try really hard and go slow carefully sound everything out i know you can do it
  i read an article about goal post moving and nitpicking of the facts to defend right wing terrorism    but the facts are still there has been a rise in right wing terrorism
  yes by including omar gaybar and paddock cia plant fuck off
  a small group of extremist dont define a whole group when its islam but one sperg makes an obese lady have a heart attack and now you want to damn the party of lincoln  you need to get out into the real world autismo and start interacting with people
  so why dont you post on cnn articles that they are biased because of the cuomo connection and many of them being clinton staffers
    more strawman arguments  yawn
  more of anon acting like a faggot and not addressing anyones arguments because he is an incompetent fuckwad
  never forget paddocks cause of death was suicide by gunshot to the chest
    feel free to follow me to the thread that talks about the article if you want to keep flinging strawmen  
  feel free to follow me into this thread with a fraudulent article as the headline  how about no
  you dont even fucking read the article youre quoting because the sources in it dont even support your conclusion that was pointed out to you several fucking times moron try again
  suicide by gunshot to the chest    fucking brutal that is an impressive death probably painful though
  or the fact that he had like 50 guns in the room he was found in   nothing suspicious about that at all
  youre not very smart are ya
  antifascists    yup there it is he said the word
  it is very clear that whites are getting the worst of the violence        black on white murders alone run 2 to 3 times   higher than white on black murders if you look at overall violent crime the numbers can be as high as 81
  its just an uptick not a surge    republicans are pathetic
  here is an excellent example of how the antiwhite american activists distort the facts while at the same time accusing the other   side of the very same    this is from the southern poverty law center      the article attempts to debunk how white supremacists frequently like to manipulate crime statistics  however there are a couple of problems with their analysis     the main premise of the article is that the vast majority of most crimes are committed by a person of the same race as the victim    of importance is that this study and article is looking at all crime not just violent crime it is easy to see that since there are so many  white people in america that there will be a large amount of white on white crime there are around 6 times as many white people as blacks   there actually should be a percentage of white on black crime yet whites only contribute a paltry 11 of crime to the blacks much smaller  potential victim set   on the other hand blacks contribute a full 15 percent into the much larger 6x set of white crime victims   the evidence is clear here blacks are significantly above there expected contribution level and whites are way way below it   based on the numbers involving interacial crimes and victims     things get even worse when we look at just violent crime which is beyond the scope of this article and study
  you do a lot of strange mental gymnastics to convince yourself that your greater chance of being a victim of a crime by a white person than a black person somehow means you need to treat all black people like theyre a threat rationally you should treat whites as more of a threat when theyre you know literally more of a threat it also makes no sense to single out blacks when men are far far worse than blacks comparatively as a group if youre looking for characteristics to condemn someone for
  yeah they skew numbers a lot like that by not factoring in population size  have been doing it for a long time
  your greater chance of being a victim of a crime by a white person  this is true only because there are more white people around    youre more likely to be the victim of an unarmed white person than a white person indiscriminately firing an ar15 into a crowd there arent that many of those people around but it would still be a good idea to get into cover anyway if you see one
  rationally you should treat whites as more of a threat when theyre you know literally more of a threat  you should for the type of crimes the bcs data covers   but for violent crime like murder its the other way
  spiked  just wait until 2020 you havent seen shit yet
  i didnt know that that piebaking octogenarian study group that that one white dude shot because they were black were secret antifa
  your greater chance of being a victim of a crime by a white person than a black person  you lying sack of shit there are more whites in the country  look at per capita you double digit iq fuck
    is war on the horizon and why is the media not talking about this
    russians are right and bydlo masters cant admit it
  im not a russian tho silly boy   where are my proofs
    there is no russia vs ukraine     more likely bydlo and the west vs russian people kakels just declared state of war in most russian districts putting 40 of voters outside the right to vote demonstrate or express any political or social will the war vs russia is not declared all those districts with russian majority are declared as occupated people are literally forbidden to speak their language to pray in their churches or to enjoy their culture not to mention that they cant now have free travel or settlement in ukraine anymore   the old people there are banned from social and medical care doctors kick patients out of hospitals because they speak russian language pensions of people there are cut down to the 20 cents a day even those people paid their share into pension founds people are arrested for criticism against government on facebook or even just for fucking likes there gas and power delivery is cut off to the towns up to 100000 population people literally freeze to death government is robing the wealth from former wealthy russian areas and distributes it between own oligarchs and into west ukraine speculating that when russia will take those areas they can build own happy reich in the today west ukraine or in usa/canada     ukraine right now is literally jews and bydlo occupying russian soil and russian people on a level of ww2   all districts with russian population are controlled by punishment system and ruling caste of banderas and zidobanderaspeople from west ukraine western countries and jews who literally get absolute powers    they want someone to pay their leisure lifestyle and try whole time to provoke russia into the war with the west so they can move their wealth and families somewhere else without to fear that someone will come after them for revenge and money back
    the map is wrong
  this is interesting the media in the west never talks about any of this where could i get more information
    being this much of a brainlet  is it because putin also believes in the autistic sky wizard
  where could i get more information    are you ok
  meanwhile in ukraine nikolaev region the brainwashed kids dug out trenches for possible invasion of putin but caught a local volkswagen suv instead     
  this is interesting  kolomoisky interview putin has nothing do to with the war in ukraine    he stated this in an interview with journalist ksenia vasilenko known as sonya koshkina  what does putin have to do with it in the issue of donbass everything depends on us we fight with ourselves how to return the donbass we need to agree on something with them those who are there said kolomoisky in an interview with a journalist  he expressed confidence that we should communicate with the residents of the region and not blame the kremlins hand  all the talk about putins sitting there and commanding everybody is all ridiculous knowing the situation from the inside its no putin at all kolomoisky stressed  according to him russia only will not allow to solve the issue of donbass by military means  now the ukrainian oligarch is in israel where he moved from switzerland the media associate this with the fear of extradition to ukraine with whose leadership kolomoisky is in an uneasy relationship at the same time from 2014 to 2015 the oligarch headed the dnepropetrovsk regional state administration and spoke with harsh criticisms of russia and its leadership this is reported by rambler next 
  putin has nothing do to with the war in ukraine  lol
  theyve been at war for 4 years now dude
  not formally
  why
no country is stupid enough to partake in a fullblown war there will likely just be some lowscale threatening and throwing around of sanctions if anything else happens
  wow so its actually the evil government of ukraine plotting against the innocent psuedodictatorship of russia i cant believe those evil ukrainians would false flag a country known to have invaded other countries and asassinate political enemies on foreign soil dont worry i assure you every who just read your words will support great mother russia and her wonderful leader all praise the mother who gives us all
    the map is not even close to the real happening
  psuedodictatorship of russia    wow this level of jewfart tryng to demonize russians just wow
the union of european football associations will not hold matches in ukrainian cities where martial law has been imposed this was announced by uefa deputy secretary general giorgio marchetti reports tass    in connection with this decision on december 12 shakhtar will not be able to play in kharkov against the french lion    the uefa executive committee decided to hold matches in the problem cities of ukraine no uefa match can take place in the stadiums of cities where martial law is in force this is also connected with kharkiv so the match between shakhtar and lyon will be played in another place which we will report later said marchetti    earlier bulgaria air has suspended flights to odessa because of martial law    
  psuedodictatorship of russia  you can only wish you lived in a country that gives everyone a national holiday to get off work for the expressed purpose of having sex and procreating and then offers prizes such as suvs for those couple who give birth exactly 9 months later  yes this is a real russian holdiay  u jelly
  this is just embarrassing
  thats the most retarded holiday ive ever heard about and there is no reason why you should be proud of it
dont you guys know that ppl still fight over there  the conflict is still ongoing 
  christ when children regurgitate pure lopsided propaganda with absolutely no clue whatsoever its embarrassing i know you have that typicalk westie arrogance and believe every country wants your shit decadent culture and freedom  but actually they dont if you knew anything about russia which you dont youd know they need a strong leader as a people or they turn to chaos    its worth mentioning the us is currently constructing a state of the art military base in ukraine        now imagine is russia built a naval base in new mexico its nothing but western provocations as they try to cripple russia from cock blocking them in syria
  and another who knows fuck all about russia what a shock russias biggest issue moving forward is population demise it currently is loosing so many men to drugs alcohol and aids that it will no longer be capable of regenerating its military and work force in just a couple decades putin has improved the situation though by encouraging a return to orthodoxy and incentivising young families which is absolutely important to russias survival if yoiure a yank you should be concerned because your nation is walking head first into the same ideologies and destabilization that lead to the soviet revolution go look at portland today your collapse is coming as you fall for the subversion and discard your christian principles
  its worth mentioning the us is currently constructing a state of the art military base in ukraine    for ukraine because their previous naval base was captured by the russian navy back when they seized crimea capturing multiple ukrainian ships in the process effectively crippling the ukrainian navy to this day the us has no interest in using the base for themselves outside of joint exercises in the black sea      currently no us navy personnel are permanently stationed in ochakiv and the navy stated there are no plans to permanently station any us forces at ochakiv in the future    basically the us will stop by once a year to do some naval exercises that russia will condemn and then go home afterwards just like when the us does joint exercises with south korean which north korean condemns and goes home afterwards its the same song and dance when russia does military drills on the ukrainian border and flies tu95 bears near everyones airspace    now imagine is russia built a naval base in new mexico    i like how you counter a naval base being built in a neighboring country with a naval base being built within the us and in a landlocked state to boot it speaks to both your mentality all of ukraine belongs to russia cyka yankees and ignorance of basic geography
    banderas united with jew and took control most population is forced into literally occupation or to flee the country     its about stealing a huge amount of former soviet wealth monetize and transfer it into west accounts when creating next step toward resources and land of russians
    god you piece of lying jewshit why are you lying
  if you think the us navy is lying about permanently stationing troops take it up with them im just relaying the official position plus if you think about it a base in that location is virtually worthless for the usn as its literally right next to russias crimea assets making it extremely vulnerable as an operations base it would be much safer and cheaper to host usn black sea operations in nearby turkey on the other hand for the ukrainians this base is vitally important as it protects what few port facilities that remain under their control since crimea and odessa are under russian and rebel control respectively    or if you think im lying that new mexico is a landlocked state you should go look at a fucking map instead of hyperventilating
  if you think the us navy is lying    why are you lying
  there are so many russians in this thread that it has its own mail order bride section    that was easier than kicking everyones ass in ww2 now we do it again with one arm tied behind our back offline
  youve convinced me all hail mother russia and uncle father putin all hail mother russia and uncle father putin all hail mother russia and uncle father putin  hopefully all of your patriotic posting earns you a whole extra potato boris
      uraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa11111
  
  so what youre saying is that russians have even less intelligence and discipline than amerimutts
russian shilling is so laughably bad it makes me wonder where all the 2016 mojo went    what happened did your balls drop off
    im fairly certain they have been fighting with the ruskies ever since they annexed the crimea
  isnt it funny how all the errors in climate change turn out to be exaggerating the effect of climate change  and all the errors when it comes to trump coverage and retractions are negative things and they never make mistakes in his favor
scientific bias
the oceans are warming fast  but at the same rate as other measurements have found  climate change is still happening and still is a major threat just because the right wing wants to kill us all so they can still make money    but watch trump use his legendary cherry picking to claim its a hoax like he always does
if you wanted people to believe this you should have posted most any other source than foxnews
also trumps own people came out with a report that shows how climate change is a national security threat    terrible timing /pol/
  climate change can be a threat  it can also be overblown  it can also be out of the us hands to stop as 85 of it comes from outside of the united states and may be a problem that can only be solved by industry as opposed to throwing a wet blanket on the economy
  climate change is a threat trumps own government says so where it kill thousands and cost the us economy billions      bbbbbut the rest of the world  notice how everyone else signed the paris treaty to cut down on emissions and trump unilaterally had the us withdraw because he was butthurt
  climate grief stages    1 denial    climate change is all a hoax to tax big oil  2 anger   climate change may be happening but its not manmade   data was fabricated to give the ipcc and the un power over us  3 bargaining   climate change is happening but its mostly due to other people  4 depression   climate change may be happening but theres nothing i can do about it  5 acceptance   maybe we should consider changing our ways
  did they  china india et al are not even putting up with the charade of trying to reduce emissions their emission targets are what youd expect if their economies and energy systems continued their historical experience in other words their target is equivalent to doing nothing most hilariously pakistans indc simply stated its emissions would peak at some point
  do you not understand what the difference between can and is is  horse manure also could have been a crisis  by the late 1800s large cities all around the world were drowning in horse manure in order for these cities to function they were dependent on thousands of horses for the transport of both people and goods  this problem came to a head when in 1894 the times newspaper predicted in 50 years every street in london will be buried under nine feet of manure  this became known as the great horse manure crisis of 1894   the terrible situation was debated in 1898 at the worlds first international urban planning conference in new york but no solution could be found it seemed urban civilisation was doomed   i am sure progressives of the era suggested a manure tax or horse tax or other such things to solve the problem surprisingly none of those solutions worked
  the paris treaty should have been torn up and replaced with something that will actually be worth a damn get something in place which will actually hold countries accountable for not reigning in their emissions instead of this limp wristed piece of trash
  isnt it funny how all the errors in climate change turn out to be exaggerating the effect of climate change  there are literally thousands of papers dealing with climate change many of which have been updated and revised as research progresses some of which have updated overestimates and some of which have updated underestimates    observing that one study had one error that was corrected downward once and using that to draw conclusions about the entire field of study is poor use of a single data point
remember that time they said the polar icecaps were supposed to melt  remember when they said it again  and again    doomsday cults are the worst
  your point  is it that your whole post is actually horsehit  im not getting it
  you should read up on the arctic and agw  its pretty fucked
    if you want accountability start at home the fact that trump shows americans cant be trusted doesnt help anything
  just to clarify there was a recent study showing the oceans were retaining heat at an even faster rate than was previously estimated two weeks after publication an error in the calculation was discovered this isnt refuting that the oceans are warming due to global warming only that theyre warming at a pace thats inline with previous estimates rather than an even more accelerated rate that the recently published paper claimed
  no they have been saying this shit since the 80s literally nothing they have said has come to pass despite reiterating the same old rhetoric about the sky falling all the while raking in money through grants its like scientology at this point
  nah the ice caps have shrunk significantly since the 80s oops you were wrong and they were right
  hmmm how about no     what we do need is a ban on federal grants and loans of any kind towards schools that continue to push climate change psuedoscience
  right nobody should push the pseudoscience of climate change denialism anymore especially with all the fires floods and hurricanes going on that were accurately predicted by scientists
  there have been no accurate predictions made by scientists in regards to the severity of weather events not only should we take away the loans and grants of these universities they should be audited by the irs with a fine toothed comb
  incorrect they said that weather would be worse and it is getting worse oops you were wrong again
  weather is getting worse    citation needed    posting headlines about extreme weather is not a citation btw theres no statistical evidence that hurricane/forest fire/dought/etc severity is related to agw or is even getting worse only peer reviewed journal articles will be accepted
  statue of liberty isnt even underwater   my face isnt on fire even  fucking science theyre all cunts    believe what you want m8 realize its a belief based on political bias and muh feelings though not science or current events it isnt based on reality or evidence
  theres no statistical evidence that forest fire severity is related to agw is getting worse  nope californias worst fires ever by a large margin were this year that means they were worse than ever before    you made a statement that was not true that means youre wrong oops try again
  also what happened to your assertion that the ice caps are the same size in the 1980s as they are now
  only peer reviewed journal articles will be accepted    kinda doubt that
  im still not seeing any citations youre not very smart are you     whaa whaaa youre wrong bc i said youre wrong    lol
  youre the one not giving citations or defending yourself since you started this argument the burden of proof should be on you youre trying to disprove me remember
  more excuses not to post any      libs dont know anything about agw other than what they read in shitty news journals and i fucking love science facebook posts what was the average projected increase in temperature by agw models in the year 2005 and what is the current average temperature increase since then if you cant find the answer to this you lose
  burden of proof shifting  whaaa whaaa i should be able to assert things as true without evidence waaaa    lmaooooo youre a midwit
    what happened to the assertions that the ice caps are the same size as they were in the 80s or that 2018 was not the worst wildfire year in california ever no proof has been provided    you asserted those facts without evidence therefore i can dismiss them without evidence sorry
  he still hasnt posted any citations  i dont need to post any evidence for my claims but you do waahhhh waahhhh    lmao
  the military has considered it a major national security threat for years now     
  remember that time they said the polar icecaps were supposed to melt  anontheyve shrunken dramatically due to global warming even if you or someone else wants to claim whats happening is a natural trend the fact is the earth is warming    
  dude stop melting down and actually   post something since you started this    just google shrinking ice caps and worst wildfires in california 2018 theres my proof since you never gave any this debate ends maybe you shouldnt have whined about proof without ever providing any despite multiple chances
  a youtube video is not a citation try again melting sea ice is great btw opening up lots of oil fields and new shipping routes i hope it all melts
  just google    not a citation youre really bad at this     this debate ends    yeah you lose go run and cry now
  a youtube video is not a citation  more than the exactly 0 things youve linked to  i hope it all melts  but you said it wasnt melting you just admitted you were wrong
  rapidly moving the goalposts  how embarrassing
          nobody claimed that ice caps didnt change since the 80s
  its not a citation try again sweetie  but you just said it wasnt melting    you are arguing with more than one person schizo or is 4chan new to you are you used to facebook or reddit
  well  did he said they werent melting  you are arguing with more than one person schizo  strange they all seem to be posted apart by just over a minute
  yes youve been moving the goalposts giving any reason you can to avoid providing proof for your ridiculous claims of increasing rate of extreme weather phenomenon as being caused by agw which you dont have any proof of and you still cant seem to understand what would actually count as proof of this because youre uneducated in stem
  a youtube video is not a citation try again  one im not the person you were talking to about citations so it wasnt meant to be one two its derived from information gathered from satellite images from nasa unless youre blind you should be able to see the trend occurring    melting sea ice is great btw opening up lots of oil fields and new shipping routes  so weve gone from theyre not melting to well its a good thing theyre melting youre moving the goalposts
  yeah this website might not be a good fit for you i would suggest places you might feel more comfortable such as facebook and reddit
  you are arguing with more than one person schizo    turns out hes the one arguing with more than one person    how embarrasing
  he didnt say that they didnt change at all dingus he was referring to the erroneous predictions that the ice would have fully melted by now
  so weve gone from theyre not melting to well its a good thing theyre melting youre moving the goalposts      woosh
    what does that have to do with the ice caps melting are you even trying now
  sure but that doesnt mean we shouldnt also push for strong international policies to try and mitigate the effects of climate change if you are going to hobble your own economy and production you should make damn sure to equivalently hobble everyone else otherwise you are a fool
  you have to start by implementing good policy at home ala dumping coal oil and gas and going green once you do that pressure other countries to follow   trump has squandered any attempt to do that with how retarded his foreign policy is
  bullshit this is an international effort and should be tackled on that stage yes the us can do better but so can many other nations if your going to give some nations a pass through differential treatment and enforcement i would argue you dont really care about the issue and have ulterior motives climate change is a serious problem and needs to be addressed globally or else it wont be resolved
  shrinking is not the same as completely melting or the sea levels rising to the point of flooding all coastal cities or any number of dubious shit that has been claimed  bbut its close enough gibs pls  fuck you you shitcunts dont know dick about whats happening give me a reliable model or get the fuck out of my face
  you missed the bit about all the scientist and experts talking about how it would be a massive problem  the failure of their policies to fix the problem remind you of anything
  well given that theyre currently shrinking it would make sense that eventually they will disappear no  i dont think theyll get bigger given the rise in global temperature over the last decade
  some horsehit in the street isnt quite the same as a temperature rise that threatens the biodiversity of the planet and our ability to survive as a species though  as for progressives and their shitty solutions that dont work  well suggest something else  all i seem to get from the right in the us is outright denial and corporate shilling hardly a solution for anyone but the well insulated elites
  they are melting in fact its inspired a gold rush of sorts by russia and other countries to go dig for oil now that the sheets are looser     op proves again how science is an ever changing field and shouldnt be used to push political points
so like hypothetically god himself says climate change is human caused and we can still stop it  would that even mean anything to these people hypothetically of course
  technology obviously there is some harvard grads working on a system that takes carbon out of the air and turns it into fuel seems like that could solve the problem the horse shit problem is an example of many situations where you ask a first order question and the solution is always assumed  ask republicans about trump and they will say they support him on things ask democrats about if russians changed vote tallies something that clearly has not happened and they will answer in a similar question because they think they know the question you are actually asking im sure many people who say they dont believe in climate change if they were given more room than a yes or no question would be luke warmers saying the negative effects are blown out of proportion or that they dont agree with the policy prescriptions as you need only watch msnbc to see 98 of climate scientists agree climate change is real to follow it up with some pet redistributionist policy
      lol best read all day love the willful ignorance and blatant you have no point cause i closed my eyes
we just surpassed the level of usual coldness in canada november these last few years usually passed without snow and if it did snow it would melt within days right now not only is it cold but you have plenty of snow that didnt melt for days
  funny  youre right but im not laughing
  faux news
  seemingly as it should be though its been claimed that agw will lead to harsher winters in north america as the arctic gets warmer so
  it could be tackled if we didnt have a climate change denier party in power     the fact that shit like op is whats going to get attention and not turmps own government not only confirming what the un said but said its going to be worse shows that republicans are a threat to america
fakes news
  fuck off this is a problem at the international and while the us is a major contributor you cant deny that current global efforts have been shoddy at best if you make a legitimate international accord to deal with and enforce the regulations put in place than there will be change until then you will continue to get people like the us china etc doing as they please since there is absolutely no oversight after all it is only good business to fuck everyone else over with regulations if you yourself have no intention of following them
  you cant force the most powerful nation in the world to do anything who is going to do the forcing
  while true you can certainly at least devise international accords which are worth a damn as opposed to the limpwristed piece of shit that was the paris treaty as it stands i dont give a shit whether we are in or not as it wouldnt have changed a damn thing either way
  no you fuck off and your attempts to get us all killed we need to bankrupt the pollution lobby if we want to have a chance
  no you fuck off and your attempts to get us all killed
  if by bankrupt you mean send them to other countries where they will continue to pollute the fuck out of the world than sure this is a global problem that needs to be addressed at the global level if you actually want change
  omg you conservative cucks are such defeatists america needs to lead the charge on lowering emissions if not we give up leadership to china who will just use pollution policies to benefit themselves this is why we dont win anymore and why we cant have nice things
  the only reason we ever were the winners before is simply that we happened to get to the low hanging fruit first thats it china knows this very well thats why they will never stop stealing intellectual property its how they caught up
  china who will just use pollution policies to benefit themselves  theyre done catching up now its a race
what happened to the glaciers that formed the great lakes     why are there sea shells in north texas    the ice has been larger  the ice has been less  the seas have been higher  the seas have been lower    it takes an arrogant person to think mankind is the driving force in climate change
spot the retard  hint its 
spot the climate shill    hint its 
trump buries climate change report that proves hes going to cost america half a trillion dollars a year  crickets  climate denier thread  flooded with posts  hmmm
  why do you think it matters either wayif climate change is a problem the gov should plan ahead or lots of people will dieit doesnt matter if its man made or not the problem would still be there
climate change has become a new world doomsday religion like most religions its main purpose is to gain power and wealth through the use of guilt     pollution is where the focus should be clean the world the world will take care of the rest
    yfw arctic sea ice thickness is back on the average    
  this is normal europe will also get much colder as global warming leads to a stop of the gulf stream and other currents
  so how did obama do between 2008 and 2016 to reducing global climate emissions  seems to me like he had a lot of pet projects that were not effective and caused the slowest economic recovery since the great recession
  the second worst economic disaster in us history was followed by the second slowest economic recovery  whodve thought
  there has been many meltdowns in american history the nixon shock savings and loans crisis and so on why were they not as bad because of how we reacted to them    if you have a headache and your solution is to start digging around in your brain with an ice pick it will be the worst mental ailment you ever dealt with not because it was a headache but because you were digging around your head with an ice pick  and if your solution to an economic downturn is to blow up cars that are better than the ones people are driving on the road to prop up the auto industry you are going to have a slow recovery  
  and why did obama have to fix the economy was it somehow not due to the previous administration fucking it all up whats to stop it from happening again now that another republican congress has rolled back bank regulations theyll do the same shit all over again
  you dont know what youre talking about even a little bit
    you know bush also started his presidency with an economic bubble bursting and a crisis right  and yet somehow this is never brought up that the previous administration was fucking it all up
  bill was too busy fucking the trainees to fuck the economy
  countries are unable to influence other countries actions
  okay whats the climate change equivalent of practical electric and internal combustion motors
    glad you asked  
  how well did that work  obama pushed his foreign policy on influencing iran to become politically moderate  the day after trump repealed the iran deal i saw their government burning american flags and saying death to america presumably those officials hadnt been elected in the past 24 hours
  they used technology to overcome the horse manure problem you nonce    adding 1 to 250 to the price of a gallon of gas  practical
  yes  and how many urban planners the equivelant of climate scientists in this example came up with a solution that would solve the problem  out of all the academics and government planners that went to the conference how many proposed what would actually solve the problem  and how many instead proposed carbon tax like solutions horse manure taxes or horse taxes
  how do you motivate a business to invest in new technology anon you make the cost/benefit equation tilt in its favor  the energy industry accounts for around two thirds of the worlds emissions it should be clear that this is where we should all focus our attention electric vehicles coupled with clean/renewable energy production are the solution right technology that fixes the cause of the problem if this is the goal then how do you get there
  stop programs like this    and get out of the way of businesses like this    the government has a poor track record of picking winners and losers it props up failing industries and taxes successful ones had the government been interfering more in business at the turn of the 20th century they would be taxing cars and subsidizing horse and buggies  i understand that many businesses have unpaid negative externalities and thats what a lot of climate change legislation is meant to deal with but if we go from 15 of the global green house gas emission to 145 it would cost billions and a lot of the production would just move over seas to avoid the laws  i dont think its where we should focus our attention i think the best solution was reach the point where theres enough climate change we can access polar resources then use technology like the one i had mentioned before to take carbon out of the air turn it into something we can use so theres a profit on the other end too and reverse the changes
  and reverse the changes  the government betting that the changes can be economically reversed is picking winners and losers
  okay  but presumably reversing the changes can be unilaterally  if the us cut off climate emissions tomorrow the problem would still exist  if there is a technology that can turn co2 into gasoline or some other technology that i am not even imagining that action can be done unilaterally
  so melt the ice caps drill more oil then rely on a silver bullet that is little more than a prototype   how about instead of a policy based on  hopefully this turns out okay  we use the technology that we already have but deploy it further invest in clean renewable energy and stop subsidising and expanding coal energy production  also i feel that i really have to point out your aboutface on what the government would have been taxing in the year 1900    im sure progressives of the era suggested a manure tax or a horse tax    had the government been interfering more in business at the turn of the 20th century they would be taxing cars and subsidizing horse and buggies  cmon
  clean renewable energy  if you think rareearthshungry solar panels are anything clean just wait a few dozen years  lobbies will do what lobbies do and at one point there will be so much overmining for ressources that they will be considered the next ecological threat    you better hope thorium gets enough funds to become mainstream before that
  how about wind turbines hydroelectric dams or tidal power
  you sound like a flat earther
  the manure crisis was prior to the adoption of motor vehicles the government didnt need to tax horses and encourage automobiles it was a better product that didnt need subsidies  i dont want coal subsidies or electric subsidies solar subsidies wind none of that stuff if the trump administration was leveling the field for coal because every other form of energy was getting subsidies better to cut subsidies for all energy sources so that they can compete on individual merit  not the government spending 6500 of our taxpayer dollars on glorified golf carts and destroying better cars than the one i drive for some cash for clunkers program
  perhaps all conspiracies eventually lead into the dense black hole of flat earth faggotry  maybe its time to start seeding that shit
  developped countries are running low on good hydro sites existing dam lakes are also causing a lot of methane from the decomposed vegetation suddenly drowned in the process reducing its cleanliness by a large factor      wind is currently pitiful in terms of energy output requiring massive farms to become anywhere near useful  not a massive problem yet but if you want to replace all the coal plants with turbines theyre going to end up a huge pain in the butt    i havent researched the bleeding edge in tidal generation yet but the current power yield is also terrible and again limited  plus lack of data on the full effect on sea surface microlayer    consider humanitys energy consumption will never drop unless we hit ww3 but do we want to consider that option but only grow especially with asia going fully developped and eventually africa as well    fission has a bad rep but it will deliver until we get actual clean worldwide energy instead of pushing the issue from ressource x to y
global warming is a spook for gullible kids
  deniers are unwitting shills for corporate elites
  virtually none of what you said is true    its not even funny
  you want to leave environmental externalities where they fall i disagree
  as far as i know tidal power might be the silver bullet early studies on the effects of the turbines on aquatic ecology are promising yields are surprisingly good however there are not an unlimited number of sites where they can be installed  but honestly i agree that we should all just get over chernobyl and go nuclear its the only form of electricity generation that could possibly serve our growing needs and its significantly safer than people give it credit for
  and they never make mistakes in his favor  any mistake they make is ultimately in his favor
  nic lewis who holds a bachelors degree in math from the university of cambridge and who reads science papers for fun  autists save the day again
  the fact that trump shows americans cant be trusted  that is a hilariously weak attribution fallacy
  or that 2018 was not the worst wildfire year in california ever no proof has been provided  his question was if the wildfires were agw related you strawmanned his argument thus have lost all credibility
  strange they all seem to be posted apart by just over a minute  yeah how can that happen when 2 billion people can theoretically be on 4chan at the same time
  this is an international effort and should be tackled on that stage  i can agree and then say that that kind of international cooperation on this issue is impossible and some countries cant be trusted only dorky boyscout countries like the netherlands could be relied on
  unwitting  not so but being against heavy climate taxes that fuck over the lower incomes and whites that have 01 children really takes the joy out of life being financially bled for that and i dont even have a car
  depends on what externality and how we can price it if mining minerals for solar cells is unpriced and co2 is priced we will have a bad time  i understand we have a tariff schedule but if we decrease tariffs on solar panels entering the country to increase energy independence and use of green energy or if we increase the tarrifs to encourage development of green technology were gonna have a bad time  i dont want to have this political football being thrown around at all
  i agree i also agree that electricity was better than whale oil at providing light and that cars are better than horse drawn carriages the question is how best to provide those services and letting individual consumers decide
  heres a funny related video  
  which is why you need tough regulations and consequences put in place to ensure that countries dont cheat the system to get an advantage whether this is feasible or not is the real problem
  oh but some are for sure many of the scientists that deny or downplay agw are bankrolled by oil and extraction companies the politicians that deny climate change are in the pocket of those same corporate interests that this greed and opportunism has been repackaged and foisted on the right in general as some kind of ideologically principled position is a massive scam  as for bleeding the little guy and at the risk of sounding like some virtue signalling fag you might want to think about those poor elsewhere that will lose their livelihoods to agw before you start whining about possible concessions in your own  or perhaps consider your own place as one of risk  unless youre well insulated by a stack of cash youre also lined up to get fucked hard by climate change whether its by crop failure and famine disease societal / financial collapse or some fucked up environmental event like a flood heatwave storm or fire  you want to blame anyone for the next 20 years of your life and all that hardship blame the elites that made a fortune while they fucked over the planet blame your parents and theirs  its your problem now though
  fox news  fuck off shill
    gloom despair and agony on me   deep dark depression excessive misery   if it werent for bad luck id have no luck at all    cheer up sadsack no one makes it out alive
  its everyones responsibility and low income earners are only fucked by climate taxes in the way that they are fucked by sales tax the same way that they are fucked by just not having money on general a better solution to that problem is wealth creation schemes such as savings and investment incentives rather than just hoping everything turns out alright especially given that its the poor who will be most affected by climate change in the first place
why is it only americans that question whether human caused climate change is happening
  it costs money to think otherwise
  ah nothing personal man a bit heavy handed of me but the rhetoric here is pretty thick sometimes 
  well lets look at another international organization  opec  its got the same incentives of global warming fighting as well as even less membership  you make money for breaking the rules and can do so without other countries noticing    how do we get a climate accord to not fall prey to the same incentives that make nations violate opec rules
  i agree  and the best way for them to invest is through home ownership we should change the rules so poor people can more easily invest in real estate and building savings that can support a family  in fact the new york times columnist paul krugman has been a champion of the poor in this way and pushing for poor people to get easier mortgages  
  subprime mortgages were a shitty idea that were only possible following what turned out to be irresponsible deregulation of the banking industry
  and how do provide investment/saving incentives for the poor that dont end up like subprime 20  the government tried that with guaranteeing people access to student loans and we know how well thats worked out
  look at what australia has or new zealand they love their savings plans there
  also giving people access to loans is not the same as incentivising saving and building wealth if anything its the opposite
  unless the loan is for an education that increase their ability to earn an income like college or replaces an expense like renting to owning
  you kick the banking system in the balls  they completely perverted a system thats supposed to support the rest of industry by manipulating prices and swallowing all the interests rates    banking used to be a lowincome job helping big money movements 30 years ago  as long as it remains where it is cokeloaded faggots and using computers to micromanage virtual trillions right into their pocket you can kiss your economic health goodbye  if it ever goes back down real estate will miraculously follow suit and suddenly you wont need 6 digits to make a living
this thread should be deleted youre supposed to post links from credible news sources    fox news is anything but credible
  yeah op is a faggot as per usual but honestly fox is a step above some of the dross that gets posted here theres currently an opinion piece as the op of another thread at least this thread provided some discussion of the issues rather than devolving into smug greentext
guys even if global warming is real the outcome will only be a few bad cities on the coasts getting ripped
  no youre wrong  agw will lead to mass migration food shortages / starvation social instability economic collapse disease and competition between nations for dwindling resources as they attempt to feed their populations and protect their economies  its reasonable to assume global warming will lead to war  plants and animals will become extinct on a vast scale as they fail to adapt to the rapid change in their environments humans will also die as theyre subjected to extreme temperatures and weather events were seeing the results of the changing climate already with deadly heatwaves an increase in hurricanes and massive forest fires  the rest is coming though likely in your lifetime  if you downplay the effects of agw effects hat will only get worse you may as well deny it exists altogether
  whats the right climate
  tell that the bric countries pussyhat after showing your little list let everyone know how hard they laughed at you
  the that we built our infrastructure and livelihoods around and doesnt cost billions upon billions to adjust to the one that doesnt encourage the spread of tropical diseases etc
  we already have all of those negatives without climate change simple economic migration and crummy third world countries do it already    also several degree warming doesnt make farms fail espeically when adjusting planting times or crop choices fixes the problem

    i would wager that the lack of current criminal charges against trump could only point to one things  blumpf is getting imbeeched its over hes going to jail  just kidding this probably turned up no actionable evidence to arrest trump with otherwise it would be done already  and no they arent waiting to arrest him for the midterms they are waiting to release publicly the findings  come at me shills
quick rundown of muellers findings here  
  top fucking kek  im laughing my ass off
  heh  for real tho this is sure to be the downfall of trump  im sure mueller has a good reason for not arresting trump now maybe hes calling up his friends on the hill and along them to draft a 25 agendum
  hes doing it to not alter the outcome of the midterms which suggests something damning 
two us officials  i call bullshit mueller and his team havent spoken a single word to the press besides no comment in over a year the only thing we get out of them is public court filings    this didnt come from them
  so let me get this straight youre saying that because mueller has not released his findings yet that means he hasnt found anything you do realize mueller is a republican right he wants republicans to win in midterms which means he would wait to release if he found something not if he didnt find something
  mueller probes iv a new cope
    considering that everything else has been leakwd directly from the fbi its safe to assume any significant findings would have been leaked by the fbi    the fact that they havent means one of two things    1 nothing has been found most likely   2 mueller cracked down on the leaking still very probable    we just have to wait and see
i also call bullshit mueller said in january of this year that the probe would take until the end of 2018 if by end of the midterms they mean midjanuary when they lame duck session is over then maybe
  no its supposedly complete and he is waiting until midterms to release findings for whatever dont interfere in election stuff that got comey fired
  muellers a great guy hes gonna get trump  muellers a republican hes protecting trump and the party  kek  denial part 2 electric boogaloo
  lol this was better than my electric boogaloo comment you win
  im putting my money on option number one
  trump is a dirty child molesting hypocrite
  so how long until the benghazi investigation brings charges against hillary clinton  wait i am posting in this universe  how long until the mueller investigation brings charges against trump
  /pol/ in full damage control  first off this didnt come from mueller or anyone in his direct orbit since hes run an extremely tight ship so take it with a grain of salt  second this is only relevant to trump obstructing justice and not the russian investigation as a whole so this isnt the end yet  third if mueller finished his investigation and found trump conspired with the russians youd know hed release that information before the midterms to make sure the american people knew there was a traitor in the white house and theyd vote in people who would hold him accountable since were only at obstruction of justice mueller doesnt want to be accussed of putting his thumb on the scale even thought republicans are shoving their whole hand on it whenever they can to rig it in their favor see the republican virginia judge in the first manafort trial   forth and most important overlord is a shitty anime       mueller never said when the investigation would be finished that was the republicans also it was the republicans who made up the rule that you cant release or indite people before the midterms after labor day because you know it makes them look bad  muellers playing nice because he knows trump can and will go full saturday night massacre the moment he feels attacked and he cant run away
  he can protect the party and get trump at the same time retard
  otherwise it would be done already  so the republicans can bury can you give me one reason that would make sense as to not wait until after the democrats win the house
if mueller had anything it would already have leaked the nevertrumpers would have been singing it from the rooftops
  mueller never said when the investigation would be finished  youre right that it wasnt mueller himself but his legal team really did say it would take at least another year last december i thought it was january    
  trump the mueller probe is a witch hunt by the democrats  you the mueller probe is protecting the republicans    its incredible how two people on opposite sides of the political spectrum can have equally retarded ideas      third if mueller finished his investigation and found trump conspired with the russians youd know hed release that information before the midterms    the window for that is closed the fbis noninterference policy means he would have had to announce back in august so either hes not finished or did not reach that conclusion    see the republican virginia judge in the first manafort trial  that was actually a very smart move as it prevents any appeals on the basis of judicial bias overall the judge didnt even have that much of an effect on the outcome even the trump supporters in the jury voted to convict manafort as the evidence was too decisive for personal bias to ignore    and heres a serious fourth point  i dont think criminal charges have ever been brought against a sitting us president the closest we got was a sitting vice president spiro agnew nixons vp as such i dont think mueller would be willing to be the first to do so and would instead kick it into the political arena given that hes already implicated trump in more minor crimes campaign finance via his case against cohen but did not charge him i think theres a strong case for this assuming theres any case to be had    i personally think theres very little chance the probe will find collusion but more likely that it will find financial crimes hence trumps personal finance red line or obstruction of justice you dont have to commit a crime to obstruct justice you just need to fuck with the process for personal gain
  the fbis noninterference policy  which was made up by republicans    as a counter point its clear the republicans would let trump get away with anything he could rape and murder a 4 year old girl on national tv and republicans would still defend him tooth and nail  if mueller find something really damning like trump did conspire with the russians and trump doesnt cripple the investigtations power like its looking like hell do expect mueller to hand down an inditment of trump and then the republican supreme court headed by brett the president is above the law kavanaugh to shoot it down and create a crisis
  some commentators like bill maher keep insisting that trump isnt going to leave office even if he gets impeached even if some else wins the next election hes just going to say fake news and stay there and the gop is going to back him on it
  this comment made possible by never talking to republicans irl keep up that bubble lefty good job
  well lets assume for a moment youre republican whats your red line    i freely admit trump crossed mine years ago wasnt a line actually more of a zone  i really dont like him as a person but anyway what would it take for him to lose you
  it suggests he has more personal integrity than that fucker comey    but im on the other side of that shitshow now so i hope he releases it and its some good shit
  this comment made possible by never talking to republicans irl  also no intelligent democrats as almost nobody expects mueller to attempt to indict the president
  hes run an extremely tight ship  except the leaks
  almost all the leaks about his investigation have come from the justice department rather than from inside the mueller investigation itself
and nothing will happen  hes arrested who hes going to arrested and all the charges are unrelated
  trump doesnt cripple the investigtations power like its looking like hell do  animegirlsmirkingjpg
  how do you know that
  dont think you can arrest the president in these kinds of crimes you typically interview the suspect this is what all the sqabbling about indictments is for no one is sure if the special council can drag the president in for questions and now that drumpf has his boy in the scotus the answer is likely to be no     still we have the new york ags office and about 5000 pounds of documents from michael cohens office oh and cohen as well
  he would have to actually commit a serious crime him personally or on his orders not his dad giving him money improperly not steve bannon saying something bad and not fucking tax evasion which should be considered a patriotic pastime  further i didnt actually vote for him in 2016 because his rhetoric was awful and he seemed like he wasnt actually gonna be conservative at this point im definitely going to vote for him come 2020 because as far as policy goes hes been extremely successful in implementing my desires and the left has gone stark raving mad over his presidency they have revealed that they will attempt to completely destroy a man with zero proof over politics and lost any possibility that i will ever vote for them again
  mueller is registered as a republican but he is professionally independent he is as by the books as you can get also not everyone is a screeching tribal monkey some people actually have independent thought
  mueller does not leak anything that has come out was either publicly available or leaked by trump
  dont believe that piss anyone who believes that trump fired comey because comey helped him get elected is too stupid to even be in the discussion     trump fired comey because the fbi was investigating him that is is why the fuck would trump fire a guy who did him a favor and dont give me that horse shit about trump having integrity he doesnt even know what that word means
  maher is a little hysterical on this i dont see trump accepting impeachment either but i dont see him calling in the national guard or anything like that first of all because they wouldnt listen secondly the government is a massive bureaucracy it will just keep chugging without him and the secret service will have to drag him out of mike pences chair
  do you actually think kavanaugh will turn on the guy he tried so hard to impress to get his job do you think republicans will actually accept evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors and not just keep on gaslighting their base especially since the vast majority of republicans are fully in trumps sway and will turn on anyone who defies him
  and thats the problem because trump never takes responsibility for anything bad youll find some way to rationalize any of his crimes by saying he wasnt really at fault or was the victim of some conspiracy which is exactly how republicans in congress are rationalizing trumps misconduct look at how theyre trying to fearmonger the idea that transparency to find out who has leverage on trump and how much hes making in violation of the emlouments clause is a terrible thing for the american people   
  my standard is if he commits a crime he is innocent until proven guilty and your utter hysteria does not change that      if they have actual reason i think he should be impeached currently there is no reason to believe he is involved i think if there is reason kavanaugh will rule to impeach sc is for life trump could be gone soon
  he is a president who thinks he is above the law he is innocent until he cant deny the mountain of evidence against him
dont mind me  im just here to watch ainz ooal gown sama dab
  they have actual reason i think he should be impeached currently there is no reason to believe he is involved i think if there is reason kavanaugh will rule to impeach sc is for life trump could be gone soon  if they have an actual reason he will likely be impeached and have criminal charges filled against him unless if they dont have damning evidence of a chargeable offense only collusion in which case he will maybe be impeached unless if they dont have anything more than what they have now in which case nothing will happen except trump tweeting some neat stuff
  not sure if true or not  possibly if his next step is to interview trump then maybe your right  if the next step is pressing charges then i doubt it  quite possibly the next step is simply case closed no convictable evidence with two possible branches from there evidence of collusion congress does what it will or not really evidence of much and it was a witch hunt all along  well see what happens
this is pretty big news
  this
  weve been waiting so long for it that nobody is excited anymore    well most of us arent
  nobody is excited anymore  i guess you must not have a twitter account
  everyone on my politwitter is too busy sperging about saudi arabia and the actual midterms to worry about a report that may or may not come out after the midterms
  this article says expected and i think that means its bullshit  yall are excited for nothing
  normalfag using twitter  real channers only sperg out over/news/ articles so spouting conspiracy theories or ones with an anime op  im sure you can see why im here
  t191513
     doesnt even know what that word means    tfw this is probably actually true
  
i cant wait for him to declare there is nothing conclusive
  dont worry we will find trump russia collusion the same day we find wmds in iraq
  but orange man bad  evening funny men said mueller would impeach
if mueller doesnt find anything democrats will say that hes crooked and protecting trump republicans will bitch he drew it out so long  if mueller does find something democrats will bitch that he hid it from us for so long religious will say hes crooked  kinda feel bad for the poor guy
  true
  heres the problem with this muellers already found something    hes found thirty or so somethings
  did he find trump russia collusion  or did he find that manafort cheated on his taxes
  why does this matter are you assuming that muellers end goal is to oust trump
  the american people were sold on the mueller probe as it being about trump russia collusion  same way the people were sold on the iraq war because of the presence of wmds  both investigations will turn up empty handed on their main objective coming up with side justifications
  does that make the side justifications invalid to investigate
  well muellers goal was to investigate trump and not manaforts taxes
  of course not it just shows that the main investigation was without merit
  no but it means that the american people were sold a bill of goods like they were on wmds in iraq and babies being pulled out of incubators in the gulf war
  and babies being pulled out of incubators in the gulf war  i missed this one explain more
  indict
  indictment   jesus fucking christ
  only a few more weeks before we see the accusations be officially declared inaccurate
  huffington post did a story the other day saying prepare to be disappointed by mueller probe findings democrats are done
  and the huffington post knows what mueller knows how again exactly thats right they dont they write articles like that because they know people will click on them not because theyre doing any actual reporting
  huffington post is like the liberal version of breitbart their only purpose is to stir up outrage whether real or imagined if anything they print is accurate then its a coincidence not intentional
    a pretty safe assumption though no one has been charged with anything along the lines of collusion just personal money/tax crimes uncovered because they were looking for something else
  
    says the liberals whenever they dont like what huffpo publishes but otherwise they will defend it
  sounds about right
  im excited to see this fall flat of expectations
  nobody on the right will be surprised when he announces the results
  yall expecting him to announce anything tells me youre n9t paying attention    mueller doesnt announce jack shit his report goes to rosenstein and he recommends whether to publish/indict/whatever and rosenstein acts on it thats justice department guidelines which mueller has never once violated    nor for that matter has he or anyone on his team spoken a single word to the press so we can conclude from over a year of precedent that this announcement didnt come form him    the only people who have something to gain from the probe wrapping up at this stage are the people the probe is investigatingso consider that
  nor for that matter has he or anyone on his team spoken a single word to the press so we can conclude from over a year of precedent that this announcement didnt come form him  thats not true there has been constant leaks coming out from the mueller investigation
  like what
  maybe im misremembering but i thought there was leaks before the indictments and when mueller was interviewing people  so when he was interviewing michael flynn or whatever that was leaked
  no that was flynn himself or his own legal staff anytime we get a leak out of the investigation its from the people hes talking to    the only stuff we get out of mueller himself is legal filings hes kept a tighter lid on his team than ive ever seen
  okay i see a lot of leaks related to the investigation so i was looking at occams razor which in this case would be his investigation
  funny how the article says robert mueller is expected to make known the findings and you say mueller wont announce shit report to rosenstein  i agree that there wont be much to announce though
  10 says mueller will be accused of mishandling the investigation after findings are released
  ill see that and raise you to a slick cnote that his findings wont line up to the hysteria and we will see a shitton of opeds about mueller not being as impartial as we thought mueller was in trumps pocket mueller is a russian republican fascist etc
  now that is a good bet    but seriously we have two anonymous us officials versus mueller literally not talking to the press at all for over a year and on top of that justice dept policy says when you finish your investigation that your boss rosenstein makes the call on what to do with it    mueller releasing anything without going through proper channels is a long shot  its not just out of form for him but a violation of the rules
    no matter the outcome one side of the political spectrum will accuse him of mishandling or corrpution
  just a few weeks until democrat salt
  cant wait personally
  thats all the republicans can do at this point since all their personal attacks and attempts to sabotage him have failed so fair   but if mueller does find criminal wrong doing by trump and the republicans and the republicans attempt to bury his report   except it to magically drop off by the pallet load in front of washington post    also if you think mueller is done prosecuting people its roger stones time in the barrel hes got him with at least perjury probably more because of his connections to wikileaks
we have about 2 weeks or less until liberal tears salt the earth
  anyone else hoping for a twist ending like debbie wasserman schultz was a russian bot all along
  im just expecting a spectacular meltdown on every web platform no matter what it says i bet /pol/ will either say nothing burger muh deep state conspiracy or liberal tears are delicious based on how it all shakes out either way theyre going to chimp the fuck out expect the retards to be out in full force and spam it to every board twitter is going to melt down facebook will explode thousands of comments will pour into news sites irl riots maybe its going to be spectacular
  god what if it turns out lizardmen literally control the government and we get objective proof of it  that would make this shitshow all worth it
  pizza gate is real  go to bed assange
17million tax payers dollars that how much this russia bullshit cost all of us all bc the crybabies scub on the left fuck them president trump is our president for all  2020 four more year get use to winning not whinning
  17 million  source  also its already paid for by the deal with manafort so mueller has proven hes a better businessman than trump  
  twitter is going to melt down facebook will explode thousands of comments will pour into news sites irl riots maybe its going to be spectacular  doompauljpg
  i believe this may be the second time youve made this same argument only this time you sound slightly less retarded than the last time 
  czeckd and keked
i just want this dumb shit to be over already
  i know you must be really bored in that embassy julian but please leave me alone at least clean up after yourself your hosts are getting really sick of you and are on the verge of ejecting you have some basic decency you disgusting slob
  stop it xiao you are making some really poor attempts at insulting people here
about a week or so to go
blumpf how the fuck is blumpf
  countdown to /pol/ chimpout
this article has convinced me that mueller is likely fighting a legal battle right now to subpoena trump    
tick  tock
  this mueller is still working hard hes just keeping a low profile and doing stuff he knows trumps side wont leak seeing as every leak comes from the trump faction     hell the only time mueller publicly spoke was to cut off the republicans latest smear campaign against him which ironically is what got the media to drop everything they were doing and expose the republicans just because mueller never comments on anything so the fact he did was big news in of itself
    i legit wonder whats going to happen if the dems win big the trump guys dont belive in polls and think a red wave is coming because trump told them so    hes going to say the elections were rigged if he looses    but yeah /pol/ is gonna be hilarious im gonna need popcorn
  every leak comes from the trump faction  lofuckingl
  it probably comes from pence himself who is itching to take over the throne
  i hope democrats troll pence by not impeaching trump and just let him continue to embarrass the republican party
    uh you guys realize theres been several arrests so far right are you retarded
id say within a week this should make news
  yeah there has been several arrests for crimes that had nothing to do about russia trump collusion
    hell theres probably been hundreds of thousands of arrests since the mueller investigation began and not a single one had anything to do with trump and russia colluding with each other
soo wednesday
  trump is a buffoon but everyones pocketbook is doing pretty great because of him considering the employment rate and stock market
  ok ok
  stock market is almost entirely rich fucks also didnt it just crash as for the employment rate its largely minimum wage jobs wages are falling the economy is not doing bad but its not doing great by any means no matter what trump says
  stock market is plenty of middle class  i have about 20k in it and it grew about 30 this year crashed 20 and is up another 5  im grateful its doing well
  mueller to release publically the findings of trump probe    your own link says it may not be publicly released    if theres anything remotely criminal in there or if trump thinks there might be trump will fire sessions and rosenstein and the report will never see the light of day all well ever hear is trumps allies account of what it contains
  if trump is guilty of crimes and republicans try to bury it the report is going to leak to nyts via pallet truck dumping in front of their building
  this
  its rico mother fucker theyre moving up to the big fish
  who the fuck is rico and what does some hispanic have to do with any of this
  what the fuck is rico  laughingfederalprosecutorsgif
  
25 hours until 9am in washington dc nov 7
  rico charges are used against a criminal enterprise everyone in the organization is charged with the crimes for being complicit the smaller fish usually end up turning informant to receive lesser sentences if youre not being contacted by investigators it might mean youre the bigger fish
  the real countdown is to january 3rd when the new congress takes over if dems take over the house or senate republicans will still have two months of a lame duck session in congress they likely wont waste that session if they think they can get something through
  who the fuck is rico  lol good one anon
  who the fuck is rico  kek
have any of you even heard about the 50000 indictments currently pending on high level individuals including hollywood pedis i may not like trump but nobody is perfect i know for sure though hes working with the right people n making the right moves to finally restore our government to its former glory what makes you think it will happen january 3rd   look for it a lot sooner   qwakesamerica  letsdothis
  its comming    go away q
  either trump is about to get btfo like weve never seen before or dem salt will flow freely across the land
gibme report already
    democrats finally learning how to play the media game
  holy fuck do you guys forget to take your lithium god i gotta talk to the municipal water department again shits got you bitches acting up again
so is it happening
the truth is at hand    i wager that there will not be evidence to convict trump of a crime but there will still be the possibility of a crime and absolutely nobody will be satisfied on the left or the right
its literally nothing
    gentlemen please see the bright side some of the peons are satisfied someone gets to write an npr or am 560 reading list top 10 entry about the whole thing and tons of money got pissed away in the process
    guy is a comedian i think you both have trouble grasping which parts are serious/literal and which are not
    do people still unironically get their news/social commentary from comedians i remember reading a few years ago millennials most trusted news source was the actual daily show
  maybe because people who watch the daily show are more informed on current events than those who watch republican state tv  hell people who dont watch any news programs are better informed on current events than those who watch republican state tv      and in other studies current year mans audience is the most educated  
  lul why is this board so partisan this is the third time ive been accused of being a republican for criticizing someone fucking relax you spaz
  start quacking  im not a duck  its a mystery
if he wasnt president hed have been indicted too instead just his son and one of his closest associates stones heads will roll its the next best thing to an indictment of trump himself lets see him try to distance himself from his own son
  point out that daily show viewers are more educated than people who take right wing media  why am i being accused of being a republican  no where in my post did i say anything about you strange how youve getting defensive for no reason      theres no way this ends without trump going to jail or dead if he does attempt a coup or some other power play even if he does manage to escape impeachment the new york ag and manhattan da are going to be just waiting to drop the hammer on him its a shame new york didnt vote for that constitutional scholar for their ag who basically laid out all of trumps financial crimes and crimes against the constitution and said her primary job was to bring him to justice
  mahers been right about trump every step of the way so people are going to pay attention    look at how hes attacking the legitimacy of the elections in arizona after the senate republican fell behind and said he wants to hold a new election or saying the democrats are stealing the election in florida when its republicans blocking all votes from being counted  thats a prelude to 2020 if he does lose       if you dont think trump isnt openly obstructing justice with the ag he installed youre just intentionally being blind if you want to know how corrupt of a pick he is not only can he destroy the mueller probe he can block the findings from seeing the light of day even worse he can block investigations from state prosecutors or allowing congress to see their findings such as trumps violation of campaign finance law but wait thats not all the guy was caught in a massive fraud scheme thats still going through the courts but because hes the ag now he can order it stopped     oh and he talked about targeting trumps political enemies       if this were obama the right would be in the street with torches
  any day now you just keep hoping and wishing whatever keeps you docile and lets daddy fix this shit
  trump gets to pick his ag its legal stop being buttblasted over your own misunderstanding of the law
  actually its not since hes a principle official that needs to approved by the senate   oh and you conveniently ignore the obstruction of justice part
  i really dont think a real actual coup is possible in this country i know i know it can happen here etc    becoming a military junta isnt fixing anything you dumb stupid child
  it wouldnt be a coup but trumps supporters are fanatical and violent enough that if ordered them into the streets to riot and take over washington dc they would   the wild card is the military which at this point given how retired officers are speaking out im somewhat hopeful they turn on trump
  mueller isnt stupid thats why he planned to start wrapping things up a bit early but better something than nothing as soon as this slowmoving clusterfuck started so that at least some of the findings could see the light of day before it got really under way and everything got buried completely
  none of the military brass is on trumps side luckily this is obvious
  the problem is the enlisted i havent seen many commissioned officers who are pro trump unless they want him to start a war but the enlisted are a total crap shot
  we need a military expert i guess but as far as i know you need highranking defectors ive never heard of cannon fodder just leading themselves how would they organize their activities would they just join some faggot militias
looks like this was a big nothingburger
  any article that claims to know whats going on in the mueller investigation is full of shit he doesnt leak generally its just some retard like giuliani speculating
  tons of money got pissed away in the process  actually the seizure of manaforts assets means that the investigation turned a profit    the only reason people say this is because they dont like the investigation and want it to end
  nobody cares about the fucking money and people need to stop pretending they do
  so how much does the irs usually spend on an investigation  how much did mueller
surely mueller will deliver
this was all one big larp on muellers part
  says the /pol/ppet ever more nervously
  says the npc for the thousandth time this week
  /pol/ppet goes full damage control with his latest forced meme
  xiao tries desperately to end the trade war with his propoganda
it seems this is never gonna be over because of what giuliani said today he of all people would know if mueller wants to ask more questions and today he said that apparently he does but that they wont answer them because of executive privilege so this will go all the way to the supreme court now good thing trump pissed off roberts kek but i really really cant wait that long im gonna have to tune this out at least until it actually comes to that
  nothing is going to happen
  at this point i just want it to be over
  trump pissed off roberts  he did how
  the ride never ends
  roberts stood up for his colleagues in the 9th circuit after trump called them obama judges by reasserting the neutrality of the court system then trump kept on badgering roberts for the comments
  this shit better be fucking expedited i swear to god im not waiting another 2 years if trump isnt well on his way to being gone by february im gonna start protesting
  im gonna start protesting  have you not already been doing this
  no because ive had faith in our democratic institutions ability to bring trump to justice but its taking for fucking ever and maybe we have to admit the system is flawed when we know hes a traitor and we still allow him to run the country for 2 years
  i admitted the system was flawed back with hillary obama bush and figured it began maybe with nixon or kennedy
  9th circuit  it wasnt even the 9th circuit that struct down trumps xenophobic policies  also roberts is just doing it because now because he knows damn well if trump does what he pleases against the courts the next democratic party president is going to use was trump did as a template to ignore the courts when roberts starts pushing his conservative agenda wholesale
looks like manafort lied and is not passing go nor collecting 200 he is going directly to jail
  another political prisoner of the clinton regime
  thats what happens when you lie to the fbi
  lets say trump is impeached what do you think will happen next
  even if the mueller findings are negative on trump i still dont think it stands on grounds of impeachment   either way youre going to have alot of pissed off people on both sides regardless of the outcome of the investigation
  mike pence takes office    at that point he either pardons him to try and recoup the loyalty of the trumpists in the gop which is unlikely because at that stage the party will have necessarily turned against trump or throws him under the bus to try and spare the party the inevitable destruction of its leader which is also a hard sell because who got trump elected in the first place    either way its a bad end the absolute best case scenario right now is for the gop to limp to a painful but not lethal defeat in 2020 use that as a mandate to quietly dump trump and try to reform themselves and move past him    depending on how stuck they are to him this may not be possible by then
  lmfao
  actually the only scenario that is likely is that millions of trumps supporters would chimp so hard wed see the same thing were seeing now in france a lot of gays women and minorities would suddenly be in danger
  he doesnt leak    because there is nothing to leak       its really insane that you guys still have impeachment fantasies have you seen the makeup of the senate do you have any clue what damage your hyperpartisanship has done to you gop senate will never confirm an impeachment this is bait so you retards will turn out to elections despite the dems being totally incompetent and worthless
  because there is nothing to leak  yeah there is heaps of classified sigint intercepts ever wonder why its taking so long because mueller is dealing with classified information
  this is the lefty version of qanon larping
  if qanon worked at the highest level of the justice department and regularly got courts juries and prosecutors to go along with his statements hed be a lot more credible than he is
  mueller has info that will destroy drumpf  no i dont have any evidence because its classified  no i wont post any proof    lol    you realize trump can just pardon anyone mueller charges and that the senate will never vote to confirm his impeachment right trump could fire mueller tomorrow and you just couldnt do shit
  mueller is looking for kremlin influence so of course its going to be classified for example how did mueller indict the 12 kremlin operatives over hacking the dnc ever heard of venona its pretty obvious mueller isnt going to prosecute the trump campaign on the basis of collusion
putin is so great i love putin i bet putin has a really big dick if i could i would suck putins big dick and suck out all of his cum until he is dry yum yum im a republican by the way
  see        hahahahahahaha    we are going to steal the next election and get away with it too хyecoc
  mueller is a republican  you act like that means shit to never trumpers
  a lot of shit has been leaked by the cia to their media cutouts but mostly things related to foreign policy
  if you dont think trump isnt openly obstructing justice    the president cannot obstruct justice you fucking imbecile sov citizen/flat earther tier ignorance and insanity      ackshually its not    yes it is case dismissed with prejudice
  but mostly things related to foreign policy  but not counterintelligence theres a reason why i mentioned the venona project not even truman knew of the programs existence until his last months in office
  venona project  sigint    the nsa is run by protrump spergs though are you retarded
    to clarify there is an intel war between the cia and dod that has been going on long before trump was president the nsa is under the dod and is run by people who favor trump continuing to be prez you really dont have a clue whats going on
  the nsa is run by protrump spergs though  why does this matter back up the claim that the nsa is ran by protrump spergs     also congrats on missing the point of my post
  i really dont believe you have a single clue of whats going on either
  life is like a tom clancy novel
  it doesnt matter what you think youre nobody    mike rodgers former nsa head spoke to trump privately before he was even elected which made a ton of the right people very upset this was big news if you bothered paying attention nakasone his protoge is the current director the dod in general likes trump i dont see why this should be a surprise to you
  lol typed by a faggot who thinks life is like an episode of the west wing
  it doesnt matter what you think youre nobody  same to you
  wrong i am smarter more educated and better informed than you are which is plain to see
  no its not you are obviously dumb
  me  smart intelligent educated man  well reasoned and informative posts    you  angry low information dull  screams about how dumb everyone else is
  dod lieks drum  guz i zey soa  lower ranking servicemen may but who cares  brass do not
  you cannot prove you are intelligent using text on the internet        if you were intelligent you would know that
  dod hates drumpf  because i said so    see i can do this too its verifiable fact that nsa leadership conferred with trump before the election
  you cannot prove you are intelligent using text on the internet      this would be accurate if we were talking about you
  this reminds me of yahoo answers so much

    a team of researchers from several medical institutions in australia and the uk has discovered how long it takes for a lego head to pass through the digestive tract of a normal healthy adult human in their paper published in journal of paediatrics and child health the group explains their reasons for conducting the research and what they found    most parents know that despite their best efforts children often swallow nonfood items that later emerge in their feces children commonly swallow coinsnext on the list are small toys parents often ask doctors how long will it take for the toy to pass through     this is a reasonable question because if the child cant pass the foreign object it can cause problems the researchers therefore set up an experiment to find out just how long it takes for a small toy in this case a lego head to pass through the digestive tract of an adult children were not used for obvious reasons    in the experiments six adults three male three female working in the pediatric field were asked to swallow a lego head and then to sift through each subsequent bowel movement until they found the tiny toy each was also asked to keep a diary regarding their findings as the researchers also wanted to know about factors such as stool softness and how that might impact travel time     it was at this point that the research became a little difficult to swallow if you will each volunteer was asked to rate the softness of their stool samples on a scale known as stool hardness and transitto give themselves a shat score and that was not the end of it each of the volunteers was also given a score to describe how long it took for a toy to pass throughthey called it the found and retrieved time fart score    
in the end the researchers found that fart scores ranged from 114 to 304 days with an average of 171 days though one individual reported that despite serious effort he was never able to find the toy in his poo it is not known if he simply missed it or if the toy will remain forever lost in his bowels    the researchers acknowledge that it is unclear if the results would have been the same for toddlers they also acknowledge that they chose not to conduct their efforts as a blind study due to the difficulty the volunteers would have encountered in getting someone else to pore through their poop samples for them
  a valliant effort for the next ig prizes for science
shouldve put more money into researching why their plastics are so shit in recent years to the point where pieces crack and break from just being put on display
they called it the found and retrieved time fart score  kek
  researchers have pretty good senses of humor
  oh no three of them are women  oh god i dont wanna think of three women shitting and farting oh god oh shit oh fuck
  or like you they have shit for brains
excellent every 4 odd years i have to get a colonoscopy done i always wanted to swallow i lego head so the surgeons would find it in my bowels when theyre inspecting
  i knew a couple back in hs where the girl had her bf put nerds candy up her vagina and he would eat them out she then went to the gyno for an xray of her cervix and they thought it was riddled with tumors
  adding sweets there would cause bacterial/fungual infection not tumors  this is from something else    ib4 not a tumor
  no you misunderstand  what they thought were tumors were leftover nerds
  ah misread  must be a newish gyno they quickly get used to people jamming all sorts of weird shit in their holes same as proctos
    the golden labrador who worked as a service dog for president george hw bush has been pictured resting beside his coffin in a moving tribute
good doggo
   doggo here to provide an example of how shit humans are in comparison
    here some facts about how wrong op is    this dog is trained to sleep near his master   this dog lost the part of the clan it doesnt last tribute it just is tiered and takes a nap how it was trained  this dog is vistic of dumbfucks who think that dogs will sleep at cadavers usually they have mental break down and come back to their friend again or keep around but they do not sleep at dead people because it fucking atract bears and pumas and other hunters
  they do not sleep at dead people because it fucking atract bears and pumas and other hunters  many many examples of dogs staying with their dead owners or returning time after time to the spot where they died  bear and pumas are generally not found in dc dumbass  stop pretending you know dogs when you clearly dont
guard the war criminals carcass
secret service code name good dog thanks for your service salute
thousand pupper of terracota when
  fuck off doggo hater your not welcome here
  youre thinking of the wrong bush
  thinking bush was actually the president  you must be new to the internet its common knowledge that during that time bush was president cheney was the one running the war and foreign policy
    if there was illegal russian collusion then manafort was working alongside the russians and the trump team making him a foreign secret agent    then he began working with mueller against the russians making him a double agent    now we find out that he has been feeding trumps team of attorneys information the entire time making him a triple agent    the real question is   if he was lying to trumps attorneys the whole time for mueller to get trump in a perjury trap does this make manafort the worlds first quadruple agent
its pretty clear manafort is going to take trumps pardon which opens trumps up to obstruction of justice charges and its why he refused to answer any questions about them    the big thing is mueller is playing 4d chess and double checked everything mueller told him meaning mueller knew if manafort lied on everything    now with the latest connection to wikileaks and russia trump and manafort are one step closer to being nailed for treason hence why trump was projecting again this morning because there was a conspiracy with the russians and it was treason and trump was one of the people at he top of the conspiracy
be stupid  get caught  be stupid again  get caught again  so manafort is probably going away for a long time then
  not just that if him and trump coordinate their story then trump has been caught lying red handed too    manafort is doomed he may have dumped on the president in the process
  if him and trump coordinate their story then trump has been caught lying red handed too  only on the assumption that what they coordinated in their stories are lies and are shown to be such of course
id wager 60 chance of nothing significant acutally happening as a result of this 20 chance of trump being caught perjuring and a 20 chance of this actually causing trump to tell the truth or refuse to answer/use his 5th ammendment right on certain questions
  of course    it is not baseless assumption however mueller has terminated manaforts plea deal on the basis that he has been lying to prosecutors and you dont do that unless you can prove in court that your defendant has been lying since mueller has made zero legal errors in the entire investigation we can assume he is good at what hes doing and can therefore infer he makes this filing with good confidence    in turn this means that manafort has indeed been lying from there we can infer that he has been coordinating that lie or lies with the trump team it would not be the first time hes tried to do this  he was caught attempting to tamper with witnesses prior to his own trial last year    the real speculation is whether or not the coordinated lies he might have shared with trump were then repeated back to the special prosecutor as truth in other words whether or not the president himself was caught lying to mueller
  given the fact that mueller knows manafort lied how trump is acting and how their lawyers were coordinating the entire time were in extremely likely territory that trump lied and they were getting their stories straight   but because theyre up against mueller and the all star team of prosecutors it was sniffed out    this is why trump retweeted the treason meme to both project his own problems onto others and to try and distract people
    unless  as stated in op this is a 5d chess maneuver by mueller to get trump caught in perjury
  also i already heard a few months ago that trumps legal team was communicating with manaforts there was already a thread on it here  if this has been known about for ahwile doesnt it give some plausibility to the quadruple agent theory stated in op
  trumps a walking case of perjury all mueller needs to do is have trump site down in front of the grand jury and hell perjure himself
you cant prove anything na na na na na na  you cant prove i remember anything lol  its actually lucky that the public is the jury in this case if mueller has hard evidence to show trump knew of the trump tower meeting and of the hacked emails the public itself will be the judge of his guilt or innocence
  even alan dershowitz himself has said that the report will be politically damaging for trump probably whitaker will try to sit on it this will trigger widespread and mostly bipartisan outrage and subsequently cause it to leak/be subpoenaed and forced to be released by the courts only if this causes trump to become a political liability for republicans will the senate convict him and of course that remains to be seen i think his base is around 30 so his support can probably only fall to that level and no further
  implying whitaker isnt going to throw it in the shredder the moment he gets hold of the report
  well that would be a constitutional crisis far bigger than watergate either way trump loses
  implying it wont be simultaneously dumped out of a truck in front of wapo pentagon papersstyle
  what level of damage are we talking about whitewater papers level iraq wmds level chinese donations to clinton level irs targeting conservatives level
  boy am i glad my last name is not dershowitz
  9/11 times a thousand
  if there was illegal russian collusion  if   these threads are amazing purely for the sheer amount of unsubstantiated speculative bullshit people will generate based on absolutely nothing      even alan dershowitz himself has said that the report will be politically damaging for trump  he also stated he didnt think criminal charges were going to come out if it meaning its going to be mueller loudly and publicly wagging his finger at trump for keeping company with dubious history but also admitting there was no actual collusion as originally postulated
1alart1  mueller will release findings in memo instead of report bypassing whitaker  1end alart1
  youre right we know trump conspired with the russians the only question is to what degree and was it treason    based on trumps lies for two of the questions mueller now has an excuse to drag him in front of the grand jury  
  he also stated he didnt think criminal charges were going to come out if it  i dont think anyone is even talking about that in the first instance only impeachment
  a bunch of whataboutism although the iraq wmds was entirely on the repubicans and obama should have shown some balls and prosecuted bush and his administration or handed them over to the icc for crimes against humanity    if this pans out as we expect and trump did conspire with the russians in their attack on america this will dwarf watergate as the biggest scandal in us history the only thing that comes close was when nixon committed treason when he conspired to scuttle the vietnam peace talks but in this case trump conspired with an enemy who was attacking the us
  i cant fathom why anyone in their right mind would make excuses for this sleaze bag except that they are themselves machiavellian sleaze bags
  we know trump conspired with the russians  we dont actually  the only question is to what degree and was it treason  we know it happened we just have no evidence showing it did or to what degree  then how do you know it happened  because we know it did  alright      no criminal charges  impeachment  while impeachment doesnt require criminal charges without them not even god could summon enough votes in congress to get that to pass    you best start believing in situations where youre going to have to take the l youre in one
  mueller almost certainly already knows who the blocked number is spoiler its trump
  we do from the timeline and evidence given   russian hack clinton and dnc  russians meet with trumps family at trump tower  trump asks russia to get the email at a press conference  afterwards wikileaks which has heavy ties to russian dumps the emails  again the only question is to what degree did trump conspire with the russians
  the idea he had no idea about the trump tower meeting is ridiculous on its face yeah i know you cant prove nuthin im just saying people arent stupid you can keep saying that but no one is buying it thats all
  if  repeat x1000 for every speculative post in the thread      mueller almost certainly already knows who the blocked number is spoiler its trump  so youve seen muellers notes and the final report i take it      we do from the timeline and evidence given  we dont actually unless youre counting pure speculation as established fact    russian hack clinton and dnc  attempted but didnt successfully hack clintons server and the evidence for the dnc was second hand from an it firm called crowdstrike that was under contract by the dnc they provided server images to the fbi who was not allowed for some reasonto look at the actual server people have argued that an image is good enough nonit ignorant people have pointed out many times that a server image can easily be manipulated in order to omit pertinent data  russians meet with trumps family at trump tower  they also met with fusion gps directly before and after the tower meeting fusion gps was the company that was working with christopher steele while he was spying on trump and compiling the trump dossier  trump asks russia to get the email at a press conference  it has been repeatedly demonstrated these two events happened independently of each other  afterwards wikileaks which has heavy ties to russian  baseless propaganda nothing wikileaks has published has ever been retracted for falsehoods and wikileaks had repeatedly stated their source for the dnc emails was an internal staffer this same staffer was found dead after a botched robbery where he was shot twice in the back and had exactly none of his personal items taken including his wallet watch and phone    amazing how two years later were still hammering the same conspiracy theories about russian collusion home and weve been able to turn up exactly zero pieces of evidence showing anything happened as theorized
  attempted  someone attempted
  so youve seen muellers notes and the final report i take it  like i said in the post above the idea he had no idea about the trump tower meeting is ridiculous on its face maybe hell get away with it fine but its not possible that everyone on his campaign knew except for him dont play dumb
  like i said in the post above the idea he had no idea about the trump tower meeting is ridiculous on its face maybe hell get away with it fine but its not possible that everyone on his campaign knew except for him dont play dumb  so no you havent seen the report and since you cant admit that you have to launch into another speculative rant thanks for clearing that up
  im not adjudicating his guilt im simply saying  the idea he had no idea about the trump tower meeting is ridiculous on its face  which it is thats it
  and your damage control and lies just got blown up    mueller also specifically called out trump in the latest findings for his connections with stone no wonder trumps shitting himself more than usual
  baseless propaganda          as for whats going on right now  
    why dont you follow the news and read up on who the people were that led the russians to try to talk to dt jr     then do yourself a favor and find out whether that fucking lady russian lawyer is still alive    after youre done reading this and not doing either of the above go to the bathroom and stand on the sink bend over and look between your legs your head is still in there
  reddit spacing  irrelevant but interesting   considering manafort donald jr and jared were all conspirators at the meeting at the building trump owned and was at at the time of meeting its impossible for trump not to be informed of it both because of how trump needs to micromanage everything and how hes lied in the past remember he lied about the meeting even happening and personally crafted the lie for his son to use before that blew up
  i honestly dont understand why anybody his supporters included believes anything he says frankly i dont think they do all they want is for him to keep pushing his drunkard judges and damn everything else
  i too support the liberal war on drinking
  only if this causes trump to become a political liability for republicans will the senate convict him and of course that remains to be seen i think his base is around 30 so his support can probably only fall to that level and no further    this is the most reddit post ive ever read
  they dont care about the facts or that he lies  
  throw it in the shredder  well gee it sure is a shame that only one copy of the report exists ever    are you serious
  anything that isnt a /pol/ conspiracy theory is reddit  makes sense
  that is this entire board in reality  to the leftists anything they dont think is true is a /pol/ conspiracy and the the righties everything they dont like is shilling or reddit posting  the quality of discourse on this board is down in the gutter you will only have a reasonable conversation with someone here if you are a leftist replying to leftists or a righty replying to righties
george hw bush 41st president of the united states passed away    
    last decent president to hold the office
  why are you bringing up nixon at a time like this
    i would have thought a nixon fan would have also liked reagan
  he at least had the balls to raise taxes fuck republicans and their cult of tax cuts to the rich    who wants to bet trump isnt invited to the funeral
  he did and then he lost republicans have never forgotten it and now just stick to the cut taxes part of the mantra using muh laffer curve as a defense for blowing a hole in the budget even though it never fucking pans out
i thought i was done george hw bush faced death at 20 during wwii        last president that won a war gulf war i
i liked what he did in office the united states had an intelligent and battleready man in the white house who would honour the history of this country history would have treated him better had he been reelected if not for that punk ross perot who spoiled the 1992 election
respect    preserving history promoting public service    learn more about the man who said any definition of a successful life must include serving others    
  i thought he died years ago

george bush a life in photographs    
six months before mr bush graduated from high school the japanese bombed pearl harbor i could hardly wait to get out of school and enlist he wrote later at 18 he did enlist as a seaman second class in the navys flight training program soon he was flying combat missions in the pacific
  this  may he rest in peace
at 72 mr bush jumped from a plane at the armys yuma proving ground in arizona in 1997 he celebrated several milestone birthdays including his 90th with parachute jumps    im certainly not seen as visionary mr bush wrote but i hope im seen as steady and prudent and able
good riddance to possibly the biggest reason we had gotten involved in the middle east
  he represented a kinder and gentler strain of republicanism  the oftenquoted words he used in his inaugural address to describe his vision for the nation and the world  that has been all but buried in a seismic shift to the right in the party    
  thatd be reagan bush 2 and with some straining carter desert storm was 100 justified
  desert storm was 100 justified  why do you think so
sleep well sweet prince    george hw bush interview with diane sawyer a life of service    
    we had a treaty with kuwait so at the very least we were coming to an allys defense iraq was plainly in the wrong for invading a sovereign nation with no real pretext and an international coalition showed up put in the work and went home after the iraqi army was out of kuwait there was no regime change or anything else underhanded like that there was just a clear internationally legal mission that was accomplished bush sr did the right thing it was bush jr who got it wrong
    no that would be jfk
    go to bed literal boomer
  rip cousin you had a great life

  good riddance to this pos garbage  may all his trash kin follow suit
when america was great hw bush was president        its classroom is the first of its kind in the presidential libraries network the classroom can be used by student groups as a computer learning lab or as a traditional classroom it is the bush library and museums educational mission to inform and enrich learning for all ages about american history the role of the presidency in general with special focus on the administration of george bush
   good night david copafeel  i guess i was thinking she says hes in a wheelchair what harm could he do    then her question got answered    we all circled around him and barbara for a photo and i was right next to him she says he reached his right hand around to my behind and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group do you want to know who my favorite magician is as i felt his hand dig into my flesh he said david copafeel    grolnick says others in the room laughed politely and out of discomfort former first lady barbara bush was among those nearby she said something along the lines of hes going to get himself put into jail to which we laughed harder grolnick says
  decent  president   pick one
  kuwait were drilling into iraqi land

  burn in hell murderer
  one more to join the ranks in hell
            lol is this highschool again i feel like this is 2003 and i should be rolling my eyes at little bitches whose only contribution to society is to serve as a walking talking warning i mean fuck they were leagues better than the clintons
  i remember that my first psat had us analyzing part of his inauguration speech the passages focus was on americans helping other americans not by money but by service
i will always remember him as the man who helped to end the cold war    f
  this is true he was instrumental on sealing the deal on reagans legacy when the shit hit the fan in russia as it was collapsing he picked up his little red phone and gave no faith in the seizing of the kremlin after that everyone jumped ship to join the party the us backed it was the saltiest fucking moment for democrats in the us
  it was the saltiest fucking moment for democrats in the us  why were they salty
  because the man wasnt going to shit on reagan and he wasnt going to be critical of what he had done but then at the same time they bitched him out because he wasnt as eloquent as reagan was or charismatic ive learned very early that democrats just like to bitch period and that after a good 2030 years later thats when the praise comes in in another 10 years were going to hear about nothing but dick sucking from the msm about bush jr after spending 15 years attempting to eat him alive hell they already printed in 2016 that they missed him boomer democrats are nothing more than banner waving philistines that just care about  their team  winning the moment that a candidate no longer has the ability to compete is when they start sucking them off
  shut up you snarky faggot
  whats wrong was i on the nose i distinctly remember absolute silence from green day during the obama admin you know its funny watching you faggots with your arms flailing about how  we must be critical of the president at every waking moment  and then release a video on youtube with a bunch of celebs going  the presidents job is so hard we must be supportive  you guys are the biggest fucking retards on the face of the earth mealymouthed and meandering but the biggest sin of all is the fact you cant govern any more i mean neocons arent prize winners either but when you control 90 of the media and still cant get shit done outside of entitlements
another diddler bites the dust good riddance
  all those words and you said nothing
  straw man straw man whataboutism straw man ad hominem  you are the one still in high school  grow up
  its the idiot who thinks neocons are democrats hes not the sharpest knife in the drawer
he killed jfk
  no but people seem to forget he was the head of the cia in the years right before the mkultra shit came to light if you look into it more you can read about how his tenure at that agency was controversial at the time
      uh huh enjoying that john mccain arent ya muh war for oil muh progressive
  you democrats sure do love your fuckin conspiracy
this thread  i probably didnt need proof that /news/ was beyond saving at this point but there it is you know this is the third time ive realised that a board was dead i think im finally done
john mccain was a democrat  it shows you have fringe right wing the republicans have become
    trumps uncharacteristically not being an asshole  place your bets on when the facade drops off
  good lord kill yourself the man was a conspiring conniving drugtrafficking war criminal he shouldve been hung for treason decades ago
  he shouldve been hung for treason decades ago  youre thinking of every other republican in the past 50 years outside of hw and ford    nixon  sabotaged the vietnam peace talks during the 1968 that prolonged the war and killed hundred thousands treason    reagan  conspired with ayatollah khomeini and promised to sell him arms to sabotage attempts by the newly elected iran government to return the hostages treason    w bush  ignored warnings of 9/11 then did took part of a massive cover up to defend the saudis later let bin laden escape treason
  how is that a consoiracy you fucking retard mkultra was a massive program that went on for years and years and received tons of secret funding they admitted that much years ago
   bush  ignored warnings of 9/11 then did took part of a massive cover up to defend the saudis later let bin laden escape treason  because papa bush rumsfeld  kissinger were running the show you massive retard these people killed jfk and have held absolute power ever since
  consoyracy
  rest in peace you crazy dude rock on
  ha
is 4channel rddit lite
  shills such as shariablue are hitting the new domain hard hardly any posts on this board sound like theyre coming from seasoned posters they all sound like bots and npcs     rest in peace you crazy dude rock on    i rest my case
  4chins is mainstream now grandpa get with the times
  using /pol/s latest forced memes  you must go back  and when i say back i mean to reddit
  muh shareblue  get fucked m8  others have a different perspective to your own and this isnt your personal safe space  deal
  is 4channel reddit lite  weve been getting constantly raided by /pol/ and theyre trying to pretend that everything that doesnt tow their propaganda is from shills a great example of that is    the only bright point is because /pol/ cant post images they cant spam their memes or cherrypicked inforgraphs here and it cripples their shitposting
  this isnt about personal perspective retard ever since the new domain went live the boards have been flooded with dull proestablishment copy and pastesounding drivel that comes off as seeming like legit bots its very obvious
  ever since the new domain went live the boards have been flooded with dull proestablishment copy and pastesounding drivel that comes off as seeming like legit bots its very obvious    i agree look at all the proestablishment /pol/ spam we have to deal with and how they specifically gravitate towards threads that attack lefitsts or attempt to slide off threads that offend them                                      and that doesnt include the links to blogs that get deleted
  muh pol  missing the point this badly
  kek
  lets compare faggot  there is much more anti trump shilling here than pro trump  your literally complaining about pissing in an ocean
  this
  weve been getting constantly raided by /pol/  good this board is shit and /pol/ livens up
  this is the problem news on trump is going to be inherently negative due to how he is so people like you are going to cry that it must be leftist shills posting all the threads     of course whats that saying /pol always cries out when they strike someone
  there is plenty of positive and negative news on trump it all depends which propoganda outlet you prefer to frequent
  pol always cries out when they strike someone  you mean jews
  anyone who opposes trump is going to be thrown into camps with the refugees keep quiet if you know whats good for you boy

    scotland will now teach pupils about the history of lgbti equalities and movements    what do you think of this     are you against it or not 
pedophilia  aids  anal cancer  pants of shit  what a history eh
  that is so gay
  i couldnt care less
guys wearing skirts is nothing new to them
  right wingers will just want revenge tbh
  learning about steamy hot yuri and yaoi in the victorian times    whats not to like
all they need to do is start importing subhumans from africa and then the scots can be like the swedes
  comparing the highlanders to a bunch of thinskins
  comparing sissy skirt wearers to sissy skirt wearers  whats the problem
  anything that pisses off the english is fine by me
i think the thing is theres a difference between going this exists and its okay and fine and teaching all about the history i dont think your average fag knows the history of being a fag it should just be brushed aside not focused on
why against
      implying it wasnt burlyhypermasculine homosex
  if it were a choice between this and something useful like maths why would anyone choose this    politicians are off their heads
  is it a choice i thought they were just adding it not using it as a replacement

  there will be no exemptions or optouts to the policy which will embed lgbti inclusive education across the curriculum and across subjects  so thats a solid no the across subjects part bothers me particularly i wouldnt care if it were shoehorned into tutor time or whatever like every other subject deemed too minor to be a concern in day to day life or work    if they really cared about tackling inequality theyd stop shoving propaganda down peoples throats and make them study subjects that are actually useful i had a friend who was a phd comp sci and she wanted some researcher job she could apply for those jobs because she was a phd and studying gender studies would have effectively never got her there what can someone with such a degree do for you    suppose ops a faggot nobody is denying him anything because thats discrimination and he would find recourse in the courts if he actually had an incident to pursue that wasnt conceptual in nature and parading and demonstrating isnt going to put bread on the table for him giving him leaflets and dressing him in rainbow clothing isnt going to pay his utility bills about the only thing teaching him about it would enable him to do would be to teach others the same garbage if that pays his bills i wouldnt judge him too harshly hes got to eat right but that doesnt entitle him to a captive fucking audience what kind of world are we living in now that someone can petition the government with basically  och lad woive studied this gizzus classes or we kep making a foos    most gay people probably dont even know they dont care more gay people arent the sick fucks going on parades at the drop of a hat theyre normal people with normal lives and they hate being represented as flamboyant caricatures of human beings on television why would they care because they have lives they care about the practicality of things
  again it doesnt seem to be replacing anything just adding more to the workload  your complaints about proper inequality doesnt make sense as nonhetero people are a known victim group throughout history so learning about historic figures proper isnt propoganda unless theyre not lgbti  shit math is full of historical faggots so the fact anyone thinks thats propoganda is uneducated and needs to go back to school

  to indoctrinate and create more faggot children
  so that children wouldnt become incel poltards
  yes everybody who has an opposing viewpoint is actually a virgin
  i dont think you know how the gay works
  because men who like fucking each other in the ass deserve a separate subject and if you disagree youre a nazi
  looks like libtrolls are at it again though not in such a bad way as b4
why even bother the amount of fags and trannies in scotland is miniscule
  transgenderism being taught in school  religion does not belong in childrens education
  bingo
  back to /pol/ incel
  religion does not belong in childrens education  religion as i have seen it in my life just doesnt belong period furthermore kids should be taught selfcontrol emotional stability critical thinking problem solving and how to be truly independent from everyone should they choose to kids should be taught divine things before mundane things instead you take out the divine substitute it with empty religions and make sure kids only learn how to behave like a machine not like as a human should be
seems pointless for such a small country there arent many of these freaks here
  i demand anime shakespeare in a kilt drawings in scotland text books   i dont care if it is inaccurate    joking aside this is an interesting move sooner or later such things would have to be added to history textbooks but just like how my history classes only ever covered things up to the 1970s im not so sure if it will ever be really covered odds are itll be something skimmed over and have a single question about in an exam at best
why is scotland so leftist it has the opposite problem of a country like poland where poland is largely a rural country scotland is mostly comprised of two large cities its as simple as that
  why should anyone be forced to learn this bullshit
i think its embarrassing in this day and age for any countries curriculum to ignore such an important issue
  its not important at all these subhumans are less than 05 of the population
  because teaching children fetishism isnt academic in any way
why are you guys such homophobes i mean seriously youre on wantstobethelittlegirlorg already why dog whistle that youre some kind of generic boring normie
  being the little girl is a choice freely made that no man may impose on another    just because i want to prance around in knee socks and a skirt doesnt mean that i dont also want any school that attempts to teach children about 4channel burned to the ground
  i agree with both these points
nero is my homo idol
  but this for real tho
  i mean what at most 3 lessons out of a whole schooltimes worth of history who cares scottish history is boring anyway they need more to pad it out
  im bi and fucked up in a million different ways and from statistics let alone experience i know this is the case for the vast majority of nonbinary people  its not functional its not okay and the world cant run on freaks  it is literally madness
  keep on pandering to people who want to see themselves as special people thatll help right
  3 lessons to learn about a specific group of people whose only distinction is that they like fucking something else than everyone else
  its not functional its not okay and the world cant run on freaks  youd be hard pressed to find normal people in power anywhere who they fuck apparently doesnt matter
what a shame scotland used to be such a warrior culture and now its about the trannys
  so it hasnt changed
we need to bring the fucking high kings back
even fucking aussies dont want safe schools
theyve always worn skirts
  pls b b8
  trolling the english epic style by getting sodomized in the ass
is there a connection between the fbi raiding alderman ed burkes office in chicago and special investigation do you think its related not to mention deutsche bank got raided too finally    
    he is a democrat too ruh roh
  one of the few things that republicans and democrats can hopefully agree on is that chicago is a cesspit of corruption
  girls in flen sweden the town has welcomed so many asylumseekers in recent years that they now make up about a quarter of its population   swedish lawmakers are set to vote on a proposed crackdown on child marriage next week  a move echoing measures taken by a host of countries in the wake of europes refugee crisis  a current ban on marriages for people under 18 would be extended if the bill is approved to invalidate such unions of foreigners carried out abroad couples who wish to stay together will have to wait until 18 to remarry
  since the jannies deleted the file photo for no reason you can see it here    
just when i thought sweden couldnt get more degenerate
  can you not read it would void underage marriage for immigrants and refugees not allow it
  child marriage  why are they just getting around to joining the western world
honestly surprised they didnt make an exemption for the refugees
  white people are degenerates as well  colour me surprise
  why are they just now cracking down on this
  it already applied to swedish nationals this change would make it apply to refugees
  probably because the refugees often lie about their ages
  i meant it should have been banned ages ago sorry
  fucking racists
  wow fucking islamophobic nazis how dare they want to impose their obviously inferior and evil white morals on their superior muslim overlords i think its time someone teaches those racist swedes a lesson
  live with my 10 yo fiance for 8 years before we can marry  im cool with that 
  what a disgusting freak that is
  it already was god learn to read
  can you quote it
  sweden  white  maybe 50 years ago buddy
good    now all they need to do is make their immigrants take a hard language test like the one in denmark and the safety factor will be complete
 is this some kind of eugenics i guess history likes repeat itself
  since its for prevent aids its ok the day that crazy scientist will create the ubermensch it would need us a superhero
  the country we needed but not deserved
  how soon can we test if theyre immune
four st louis city officers are facing multiple federal felonies for beating an undercover cop who they mistook for a protester and then conspiring to cover it up     the officers dustin boone bailey colletta randy hays and christopher myers were named in a federal indictment unsealed this afternoon their actions which took place on september 17 2017 arrive two months after twelve plaintiffs filed lawsuits over mass arrests that took place three days after jury acquitted exst louis cop jason stockley on charges of murder     according to the indictment the four cops detailed to police protest instead targeted one of their own an undercover 22year veteran identified as lh who himself was mixed in with the crowd     in doing so the defendants threw lh to the ground and kicked and struck lh while he was compliant and not posing any physical threat to anyone the indictment also notes that the officers beat their victim with weapons specifically their armored boots and riot batons     remarkably the indictment includes transcripts of some officers text messages sent two days prior to the september 17 demonstration which ended with a mass arrest thats already the subject of a dozen lawsuits     these text messages the indictment states showed disdain for the stockley protesters and and excitement about using unjustified force against them and going undetected while doing so     the text messages are really something on september 15 officer myers asked an unnamed officer about a protest detail and texted lets whoop some ass     that same day boone texted someone that its gonna be a lot of fun beating the hell out of these shitheads once the sun goes down and nobody can tell us apart    
disdain for the stockley protesters and and excitement about using unjustified force against them and going undetected while doing so  and people wonder why blacks and other groups distrust the police
the undercover cop shouldnt have been mixed into a crowd like that  why was he even with them in the first place what was he going undercover for
  what was he going undercover for  probably to bust agitators and looters hilarious that he got his ass beat though its like pottery
  to find evidence of illegal activity by people in the crowd so they could be arrested and charged    he succeeded too just maybe not the way he planned to
  seems to me like he was placed in this crowd to protect them if anything   and you leftist are happy he got his shit kicked in even when he is trying to protect you
  what if he was there specifically to bust the riot cops how do you know he was trying to bust the mob
  cops usually protect other cops the explanation that it was a grand fuckup is much more likely than that a police sergeant decided to conduct a sting on his own department ive honestly not heard of that kind of thing before
  its fairly well known that police departments and federal agencies plant agent provacateurs to incite protestors to riot or otherwise incriminate themselves giving uniformed officers an excuse to crack down on the movement
  whats supposed to happen is the undercover cops go into the crowd to catch violent thugs using the crowd as a cover but it seems in a lot of cases cops just go into a crowd to cause violence and the police use that as an excuse to break up the whole crowd
  cops usually protect other cops  in your fantasies veteran cops have more conscience than youll ever have
  ive honestly not heard of that kind of thing before  ill uses my ignorance as a actual argument  only low iq thugs and antisocials can have this perception of the police
  this is irony right
  attacking the anon while making no actual argument  only x does y eh  only criminals care about privacy    low iq  qualifying ones judgement is a sign of intelligence blindly accepting emotional narratives like yours is not
  seems to me like he was placed in this crowd to protect them if anything  and how does it seems like that to you  what do you have to back it up and protecting them from what     no undercover cop goes into crow to locate the agitators and looters and arrest them that what their job is about    and you leftist are happy he got his shit kicked in even when he is trying to protect you  nope most people arent happy about it at allincluding lefitsit and most likely the person you quote is also unhappy with him getting beaten    what if he was there specifically to bust the riot cops   and what if he was doing that too  bad cops need tobe busted too   how do you know he was trying to bust the mob  because thats the primary role of an undercover cop
  its fairly well known that police departments and federal agencies plant agent provacateurs to incite protestors to riot or otherwis  1 thats fucking illegal  2 you cant make statement like that without serious evidences    cops goes undercover to usually locate and prevent rioters
  1 thats fucking illegal  like kicking and beating a compliant protestor and conspiring to cover it up
  yes
  1 thats fucking illegal  so was beating a homeless man to death but that didnt stop some cops from doing it    fucking hell do you think making things illegal stops criminals from doing it excuse me mugger but did you know taking my wallet at knifepoint is illegal  oh shit man really sorry i didnt know it was illegal i have a gun would i be able to steal it at gunpoint  no sir that is also illegal
    fucking hell do you think making things illegal stops criminals from doing it  no but it make it less likely for it to happens especially if made in public exciting crowds pertain to much risk to be done especially if you get recognised afterwards and there are recording of it    if an undercover cop is recorded exciting a protest to make it commit felony and is later recognised as a cop he can kiss his career goodbye there is no coverup when an act like this is made in front of plenty of witness and record devices
  probably for similar reasons that police distrust blacks and other groups good news both sides are shit heads
    in your fantasies veteran cops have more conscience than youll ever have  i take it you guys know this based on your extensive experiences as veteran cops          come the fuck on
  1 thats fucking illegal  oh youre right cops never break the law
  he can kiss his career goodbye  there are cops guilty of rape and murder who have no problem getting hired by another department later on

the peoples republic of china has successfully edited the genes of humans chinese ingenuity once again stuns the world        soon every chinese soldier will be a super being with the height of yao ming china is inching closer every day towards becoming the worlds greatest superpower the western man fears the dragon
 report on major scientific advances    link to an cnn post    seemslegitjpg
  ib4 they accidentally a super cancer
  look mom i posted it again
thread already exists  
  someday theyll try to find a way to unleash a virus that targets nonasians
  thanks china now we have no more excuse not to do it too
  the only thing stopping the west form geneediting was itself  muh sanctity of life
and now a new generation of asians with dicks that dwarf those of the black man
  they will probably be hyper intelligent strong fast and healthy asians arent obsessed with something as useless as penis size as westerners are      west probably has already been doing this for military purposes secretly i would wager no idea how far they would have gotten with it tho
the genes they edited are supposed to stop the transmission of hiv but how do you verify that what if the gene doesnt do exactly what they think it does and instead causes some kind of super cancer
  then the subject dies of super cancer and they try again
  why make your people into super slaves when you could be the ones having sex
  with hyper intelligence speed and strength trust me the countrys that focus on large penises will be the ones getting enslaved  penises have never won a war   ever  but go ahead and lie to yourself telling yourself otherwise westerner
  does that mean we will have anthros running around then
  your argument that large penises means you are the ones enslaving others falls apart  case in point  africa  what matters is intelligence unity and technological advancement  but yeah muh dick keep telling yourself that
  ok and that would affect only the children edited thats literally less than 36e7 of the population somehow china will survive i think the potential benefits of guided evolution outweigh the risks of a handful of people
by stirring crosstalk among skin cells that form the roots of hair researchers report they have regrown hair strands on damaged skin the findings better explain why hair does not normally grow on wounded skin and may help in the search for better drugs to restore hair growth say the studys authors    led by researchers at nyu school of medicine and published in november in the journal nature communications the study examined the effect of distinct signaling pathways in damaged skin of laboratory mice experiments focused on cells called fibroblasts that secrete collagen the structural protein most responsible for maintaining the shape and strength of skin and hair    as part of their investigation researchers activated the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway used by cells to communicate with each other the pathway is known to be very active during the early stages of human growth in the womb when hair follicles are formed but is otherwise stalled in wounded skin in healthy adults researchers say this possibly explains why hair follicles fail to grow in skin replaced after injury or surgery    our results show that stimulating fibroblasts through the sonic hedgehog pathway can trigger hair growth not previously seen in wound healing says study senior investigator and cell biologist mayumi ito phd an associate professor in the ronald o perelman department of dermatology at nyu langone health    regrowing hair on damaged skin is an unmet need in medicine ito says because of the disfigurement suffered by thousands from trauma burns and other injuries however her more immediate goal she adds is to signal mature skin to revert back to its embryonic state so that it can grow new hair follicles not just on wounded skin but also on people who have gone bald from aging    
ito says scientists have until now assumed that as part of the healing process scarring and collagen buildup in damaged skin were behind its inability to regrow hair now we know that its a signaling issue in cells that are very active as we develop in the womb but less so in mature skin cells as we age she adds    key among the studys findings was that no signs of hair growth were observed in untreated skin but were observed in treated skin offering evidence that sonic hedgehog signaling was behind the hair growth    to bypass the risk of tumors reported in other experiments that turned on the sonic hedgehog pathway the nyu langone team turned on only fibroblasts located just beneath the skins surface where hair follicle roots dermal papillae first appear researchers also zeroed in on fibroblasts because the cells are known to help direct some of the biological processes involved in healing    hair regrowth was observed within four weeks after skin wounding in all treated mice with hair root and shaft structures starting to appear after nine weeks    ito says her team plans further investigations into how chemical and genetic stimulants of fibroblasts might activate the sonic hedgehog pathway in wounded human skin her goal is to identify likely drug targets for hair regrowth
     sonic hedgehog    i will always love that the guy actually named it this
thats pretty cool
  its a better name than the ron jeremyzer
so essentially they induced spesifically hair cancer on the surface of skin
  from this article i can conclude that sonic is bald
  im surprised they didnt try to make it seem more legit and label it ogilvie maurice signaling     science full of memes gives me something to look forward to reading in 40 years
  theres a fly with a golden ass named after beyonce
  beautiful cant wait to see this develop into a species of mud dobber called bane
    is this true google only shows a few websites reporting it and theyre all right wing sources
  how is this news either way guns arent a protected class which allows the property owner to dictate if they can be stored on their property or not
  guns arent a protected class  owning them is a protected right and any protections provided by the second amendment have been incorporated to the states with heller even california has laws protecting gun owners against landlords
  educate me more anon     so you are saying that i cant rent out my house and say no fire arms or things that go boom without getting sued then how does the state get away with gun free zones on public property or hell deny armed protests for that matter
its true but misleading and retarded reporting the landlord doesnt appear to give a shit about the guns however the landlord would much rather six people replace one roommate than one person replace six roommates
  what on earth are you talking about
  only states with certain provisions for lawful tenant ownership have to be strictly outlined in the law the only place i know if that does that is minnisota
  get your jew guns off my property
  you can prevent people from owning guns as long as i can prevent people from being niggers deal    oh no well go fuck yourself then     kill libs
a chinese researcher claims that he helped make the worlds first genetically edited babies  twin girls born this month whose dna he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life the researcher he jiankui said  his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have  an ability to resist possible future infection with hiv the aids virus the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed and he would not say where they live or where the work was done    there is no independent confirmation of hes claim and it has not been published in a journal where it would be vetted by other experts his tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered with no evidence of harm to other genes he said people with one copy of the gene can still get hiv although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do    
several scientists reviewed materials that he provided to the ap and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm they also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes its almost like not editing at all if only some of certain cells were altered because hiv infection can still occur church said    church and musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt because the chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered in that child there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against hiv and yet youre exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks musunuru said the use of that embryo suggests that the researchers main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease church said    even if editing worked perfectly people without normal ccr5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses such as west nile and of dying from the flu since there are many ways to prevent hiv infection and its very treatable if it occurs those other medical risks are a concern musunuru said
how is this even news
  you can only modify embrios and discard them this guy went to the madman step
  chinese are going to be improving their genetics while disgenic white countries are cycling themselves to low iq migrants
  translation chinese boys with 13 inch cocks
  take any scientific advancement out of china with a grain of salt they have a bad history of academic fraud especially with this caveat in the article several scientists reviewed materials that he provided to the ap and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm they also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes its almost like not editing at all if only some of certain cells were altered because hiv infection can still occur church said
  we eugenic wars now
  chinese girls with 13 cocks anon
  science man didnt report anything and said fuck it
  marvelous
  when they can modify the gene that makes them smelly shower and toothbrush adverse dog eaters thats news
  when they can modify the gene that makes them smelly  may chinese dont even get bo although smelly breath is definitely a possibility
eugenics wars soon
  13 cock and vagina
  human gene alterations are not news to you
  the perfect form tbhwyf    if they did indeed tried this it hardly matters if it only halfworked this brings in a new age soon race as we know it will be irrelevant    this this could literally be the most happening post since the 2016 election

  i think i saw that video
  so does that mean that anthros are gonna be a reality
democratic rep kyrsten sinemas lead over republican rep martha mcsally in arizonas senate race grew sunday as some gop figures continued to distance themselves from president donald trumps claims of misconduct    sinema led by 30310 votes as of 1 pm et on sunday according to the arizona secretary of states office that puts her ahead by 14 percentage points with more than 21 million ballots counted    on saturday sinema campaign manager andrew piatt continued to express a belief that there are more democratic ballots left to be counted than republican ballots    mcsally can hope for a miracle tomorrow night but the data show it wont happen he said in a statement    as votes continue being counted republicans are divided over how to handle the close election    arizona gop elected officials including mcsallys camp have defended the lengthy process and said the state must make sure every ballot is counted  president donald trump and the national and state republican parties meanwhile have cast doubt on the elections legitimacy  even though there are no allegations or evidence to support those claims    in a shift on sunday however the chairman of the national republican senatorial committee backed away from his own groups fearmongering about the races outcome    arizonas process of counting votes moves slowly because about 75 of the states electorate votes by mail every one of those ballots goes through a verification process that involves matching voters signatures on their ballots envelopes with their voter registration forms    
  75 of the states electorate votes by mail  convenient for the voter not so much for the elections board    eh no rush weve got two months lets make sure its done correctly quick n sloppy is no good for an election    also its you isnt it the guy who always posts leftfriendly articles with an anime image youre harder to spot than the sock puppet    i wonder how many actual people there are on /news/
  weve got two months lets make sure its done correctly  tell that to the republicans who originally wanted to suppress the votes until mcsally fell behind also theyre in full voter suppression mode for the recounts in florida    youre harder to spot than the sock puppet  thats sarcasm right the anon who sock puppets sticks out like a sore thumb
can you stop using random anime pictures for your threads you dont even play kancolle
  convenient for the voter  also convenient for vote selling trading and intimidation scenes these require verification ie the ability of an interested third party to look over your shoulder and make sure youre acting in accordance with their wishes voting by mail is the greatest enabler of heinous fraud possible
 75 of the states electorate votes by mail  what is the reason for this
guy who runs cook report called the race for sinema said the race has been over for a wile too  
vote counter is a trump hater and was involved in obamas fast and furious scandal that killed people  magically keep finding votes that are almost completely democrat    after the massive stink democommies made over russian election fraud youd think they wouldnt be so eager to cheat apparently its okay for the left to steal elections though
  also theyre in full voter suppression mode for the recounts in florida  wondering why random boxes of ballots are being found late after the election / voter suppression
    talking to yourself to make it seem like youre not the only one going off on rants about sock puppets  watch this fool derail yet another thread going off chasing another one of his mental dragons while mods do nothing
    kek is this board becoming 4chans mental ward
  seems like it with the popular patient table being full of r/politics transients
    the irony of accusing people of talking to themselves when the ip counter proves youre the one doing it
  he should have been reading it from the start it writings have clearly showed  and  are different people     but thats par for the course with trumpists everyone who disagrees with me must be a samefag
  its okay for the left  they believe this for every one of their activities they believe that they are on a crusade and in a crusade all things in service to the cause are moral if you couple that with a lack of belief in objective reality my truth etc or any mechanism by which restraint or repercussions may be suffered you wind up with a terrible monster
    i like how youre convinced theres fraud going on just because they keep finding dem votes in broward county one of the most liberal districts in the state
  only one of those was made by me thanks for further proving my point about mentally unstable posters here though    everyone who disagrees with me must be a samefag  literally what the guy you are responding to is claiming
  second part was meant for  
  herewegoagainjpeg
  new headline  bisexual tops lesbian in arizona senate contest
  i like how youre convinced theres fraud  i like how you believe you can read my thoughts and motivation it is a strong indicator of cognative dissonance which means im getting through delightful  i did not write a word about fraud or anything else related to this specific tendril instead i described an aspect of the monstrous body
  arizona is a inhospitable desert wasteland full of old people air force base personnel and navajo indians they cant easily drive to places
  you would be better off posting the election results from the sites of the individual counties especially maricopa politico isnt updated as often as those county sites are
  i love spats
she ran a centrist campaign i know trump and the gop has been hell bent on trying to label her as a far left wacko but in reality her campaign was all about denouncing partisanship and promising to represent her state first and foremost she has repeatedly attacked chick schumer and has promised to not support him as minority leader her voting record also lines up with trumps more than the lefts roughly 60 of the time she even refused to criticize him when asked to at the debate just look at the arizona democratic primaries where she beat the farleft hijabwearing radical sinema said her muslim oppinents socialist plans like a single payer healthcare system were complete fantasy projects that dont work out in reality  now only time will tell how she actually acts as a senator but if she does it in a similar way to which she campaigned she will be fine    the point im trying to get across here is that this wasnt arizona trending blue as a part of some massive antitrump wave it was the democratic candidate in arizona going the way of joe manchin and swinging towards the center or even slight right we need more senators like this not less
  there was never an expectation that red states would immediately elect a hardline liberal but if they elect a few leftists they will begin to trend to the left on issues as those things become more socially accepted the dems made huge ground by getting people who will reliably vote with them on their major issues elected
  it entirely depends on what you mean by major issue  you cant get mad at someone for voting against the complete dismantlement of the current healthcare system without providing an alternative on the same vote
  sinema believes in universal healthcare and has voted to protect the aca she just does not believe in single payer     in the future its possible that if it came up for vote that she could be persuaded to support a single payer healthcare system if there were a republican in her seat the chances of that are basically zero even if she cant be persuaded to support a single payer healthcare system its still possible for democrats to compromise and agree on a public option instead a republican senator likely wouldnt support that either republicans do not believe in universal healthcare at all they just cant publicly state that even the worst democrat can agree to healthcare for all
  incompetence / voter fraud  
  as long as she believes in a public option thats what matters the republican bitch was the one who had the audacity to vote in favor of taking away everyones healthcare and giving it the rich and then proceeds to whine when democrats beat her to death with her vote    funnily enough it was pelosi who told the dems dont focus on trump hammer home healthcare and it worked for the most part
  healthcare is the 1 issue with voters democrats can point to their achievements at protecting people with preexisting conditions and lifting lifetime coverage caps republicans are on record voting to revoke protections for preexisting conditions its just a really bad matchup
trump now demanding end of recount and to not count every ballot in order for the republicans to steal florida elections  
  the fact that they were trying to label her as a communist nutcase means that no matter what campaign she ran this was a huge loss for trump and the gop and it really is because she has a six year term so even if trump achieved the increasingly unlikely goal of being reelected she would be there all the way till the end of his term no matter what hes lost arizona
its over  
  the fun however has only just begun
  you literally just corroborated a post claiming voter fraud      wheres the proof nigger republicucks are grasping at straws because theyre losing
  indeed the dem just took the lead in the sos race too  
cant wait to see ole mike pence have to swear a nonreligious bisexual into the senate with her hand on the constitution
jeff flakes seat going to a democrat is the second biggest finger he could give trump the biggest one is if he runs as a third party candidate to split the conservative vote in 2020  will the mythical principled conservative that only seems to show up when the criminal writing is on the wall appear again
i think the gop drank their own koolaid they circled the wagons so much that they think americans want to hate gerrymandering has caused them to ignore reality    americans want to be able to afford decent lives and homes they want a healthily environment and populace they want the dream to come back
  the funny thing is republicans see democrats as much more spiteful and downright evil  
  its a win for bypartisanship  hes lost arizona  what all this election did was prove that the only way dems can win is if they love to the right
  sinema believes in universal healthcare and has voted to protect the aca she just does not believe in single payer  good thing they dont need her vite to protect or destroy aca  in the future its possible that if it came up for vote that she could be persuaded to support a single payer healthcare system  false she staked her whole campaign around it arizona has had the highest rate increases in the country  if there were a republican in her seat the chances of that are basically zero even if she cant be persuaded to support a single payer healthcare system its still possible for democrats to compromise and agree on a public option instead a republican senator likely wouldnt support that either   republicans do not believe in universal healthcare at all they just cant publicly state that even the worst democrat can agree to healthcare for all  health care is going nowhere with a democratic house so im not sure why youre staking the arizona senate contest as mattering in this regard republicans will keep their senate majority until at least 2024 now when sinema goes up for reelection anyway
  seriously every candidate trump threw his weight behind besides cruz lost if anything the only rightwingers that won are the ones who moved closer to the center
  republicans will keep their senate majority until at least 2024 now  in 2018 republicans only had nine senate seats up for election democrats had twenty six a massive numerical disadvantage    in 2020 republicans will have twenty vulnerable seats compared to only eleven for democrats    game on
  look at the seats in question  even 538 is admitting they hold on in 2020 even in a bad presidential contest      seriously every candidate trump threw his weight behind besides cruz lost  completely false
  farleft candidates got annihilated across the board in the midterms democrats that moved to the center won
  democrats that moved to the left also won people voted for democrats by an overwhelming majority    farleft candidates  basically no one is farleft in america
  republicans will keep their senate majority until at least 2024 now  thats for the people to decide compared to the 2018 class of senators 2020 and 2024 are both much more favorable if democrats cannot gain in either then they dont have any right to lead the country anyway
  health care is going nowhere with a democratic house so im not sure why youre staking the arizona senate contest as mattering in this regard  healthcare is going nowhere with a republican senate and president the democratic house would be willing to pass a bill to implement a public option but mitch mcconnell wouldnt bring it to the floor to vote though because the optics of voting against a public option would haunt the republicans in the upcoming elections republicans dont want to improve healthcare they want to revert it back to the way it was prior to the aca
mueller then reveals that orrin hatch was involved in the cover up and he is removed before he can be replaced pelosi names hilary clinton as secretary of state and promptly resigns hilary then abolishes the government email servers and moves the white house to benghazi completing the republican doomsday scenario    to celebrate hillary clinton opens up a new chain of sex slave pizza restaurants across the united states which also double as marijuana dispensaries    obama is at the grand opening in a brand new tan suit eating a slice of pizza covered in dijon mustard and handing out copies of his kenyan birth certificate    elon musk and george soros then use their amassed wealth to fund universal health care and government aid for immigrants and refugees    just as it seems that things cant get any worse for the republicans pelosi names bernie sanders as her vp and they pass a federal law allowing abortion and lgbt rights whilst kneeling for the national anthem    finally the homosexual communist obamacare immigrant caravan utopia weve all committed so much voter fraud for
  this is advanced
  based and blueballed
  how will the gop block the vote counting now
    update judges recount extension sidelined by federal lawsuit  theyre going to bring this all the way up to the supreme court huh unless roberts has a conscience i cannot see that turning out well    on the bright side all this contesting might take long enough for them to finish the recount anyway
funny thing ive seen a massive decline in trump curse posts after this election    you cant very well claim that theres a trump curse when almost every antitrump politician just won
  if republicans block the recount again you can sure as hell bet that democrats are going to be even more emboldened to either pack the courts are just outright ignore their rulings if its clear theyre partisan     either way democrats better start para dropping in supporters to combat the republicans machine since theyre going to follow the 2000 playbook which involves rioting to stop recounts and assaulting election workers
  fucking amazing to me that there are people who will actually go out there on the streets to protest all the votes being counted this is what gets them motivated
  the trump curse was a crock of shit anyways  really a convenient way for brainlets to larp several coincidental isolated incidents into some halfassed curse
  yeah its really just basic statistics 90 of people are sane enough to hate trump so its inevitable that a handful of them will have something that can be construed as bad happen to them which in most cases is either just an old person dying of old age or some filthy rich person making slightly less money but still being filthy rich     the idea of a socalled curse conveniently ignores the hundreds of thousands of people who shit talk trump regularly and are still doing quite well for themselves honestly it really says a lot about trump supporters that the only defense of trump they can muster is literally believing that fucking magic exists
  you have get into their mindset from their point of view every extra vote is an illegal vote dumped out of a bag by evil liberal poll workers to steal the election from conservatives phrase it like that and you can see why theyd show up even of the alleged fraud has no evidence besides unsupported claims by one of the candidates
josh harder just beat a republican incumbent    dun dun dun another one bites the dust
    i know the word gets thrown around and has lost all meaning but this is definitely a paid shill no one can be this disconnected from reality without it being intentional
  amazing how you speak of anyone being disconnected from reality while accusing anyone who disagrees with you of being a shill    its not working dude it just lost your side the midterms time to reevaluate your tactics
losing republican my opponent is trying to steal my seat by winning    rather than accept the will of voters a couple of california republicans are telling nefarious lies in an antidemocratic effort to undermine the integrity of the election    without citing any evidence rep mimi walters rca wrote democrats are already preparing for a recount to try and steal this republican seat after the fact in a fundraising email to her supporters according to business insider    walters a staunch trump supporter has seen her election night lead of 6200 votes disappear and is currently trailing uc irvine professor katie porter by 261 votes    her fellow california republican young kim running for the seat abandoned by rep ed royce joined the chorus of baseless allegations kim accused the campaign of her democratic opponent navy veteran gil cisneros of harassing and intimidating vote counters in orange county in order to change the results kim has seen her substantial election night lead dwindle to barely 700 votes over cisneros    however there is no evidence whatsoever to back up kims claims the la county registrar the district straddles both la county and orange county rebutted claims of any malfeasance saying we have not addressed anything related to ballot tampering or physical tampering with ballots our process is transparent and secured    the dangerous language of walters and kim  insinuating that counting all the ballots somehow amounts to theft  runs counter to the most basic principle in a democracy that all votes be counted    walters and kim join republicans in arizona georgia and florida in embracing an antidemocratic agenda of suppressing and disenfranchising voters    while walters and kim face the prospect of losing by lashing out with wild false claims their chances of winning diminish more each passing day as the la times explains its completely expected for late votes to trend toward democrats
the times reported the results are not due to fraud or nefarious activity as some partisans allege but the fact that older more conservative voters tend to vote early and younger more leftleaning voters cast their ballots closer to election day meaning they are tabulated later    election expert dave wasserman recently said he was convinced it would take a miracle for republicans to win either of these two races    but rather than pray for a miracle walters and kim would rather spout unfounded allegations to thwart the democratic process of counting all the votes play out    as votes continue to be counted in california one fact is abundantly clear the california gop delegation has been absolutely decimated politico wrote    democrats have already flipped four seats from red to blue including victories over russiafriendly rep dana rohrabacher and trump lackey rep steve knight if democrats win the two seats mentioned earlier californias republican delegation would shrink from 14 members to just eight    on top of their loses at the federal level republicans could not even muster a candidate to compete for californias us senate seat which saw incumbent sen dianne feinstein defeat fellow democrat kevin de leon    on the state level republicans lost all major statewide races and democrats regained a vetoproof supermajority in both the state assembly and state senate    the california republican party isnt salvageable at this time writes former republican assembly leader kristin olsen the grand old party is dead  partly because it has failed to separate itself from todays toxic national brand of republican politics    in their political death throes both walters and kim are using their final moments to cling to trumpinspired lies unable or unwilling to separate themselves from his toxic politic
liberals are more willing to negotiate and are not hung up on passing legislation based on biblical nonsense ask yourself what do you actually lose under a theocratic conservatives world and what do you lose under a liberal world im a woman a mother a person of color stay at home mom on a budget with a child who needs daily medication that is really expensive im sure you can guess i have a lot to lose under a conservative led world people dont lose rights under liberals they gain rights things are indeed more regulated by liberals as they should dont you want clean water air and land you want maniacs with guns you want an unregulated food industry on and on capitalism must be on a short leash or it will literally kill us all just to make another penny
its looking more and more like hillary losing was for the best for this country if shed won shed probably have only lasted four years shed have a republican controlled congress to deal with and nobody would have voted in the midterms leaving room for the republicans to put up an eight year candidate in 2020 as it is were dealing with some stupid shit under trump but its causing the republican party to completely crumble after this we may be able to get two democrat presidents in a row for the first time in who knows how long
  with the electoral college deciding the president i have serious doubts about that it favors small states so the party that is more likely to get two presidents in a row is the republicans hillary nearly had it but the distribution of voters simply wasnt in her favor
  thats how it was formerly i have a feeling its finally going to change look at how close they got with hillary being one of the most notoriously uncharismatic candidates of all time put up beto in 2020 and someone as likable as him when he finishes in 2028 and it may finally happen
hm
remember that isis was at its most violent when it was near death the republicans are the same way    we need more than two major parties in this country and we need them to be more than just democrats but and republicans but like green and libertarian are
    an exit memo put together by strategists for rep martha mcsallys raz failed us senate campaign draws disturbing conclusions for president donald trump and his hopes of a second term    the memo explains mcsallys narrow loss to democrat kyrsten sinema in part by citing internal polling indicating that trump is not popular among republicans  particularly women  in a state that will be crucial to his 2020 hopes    a significant segment of the az gop was hostile to the president it says in internal polling during the primary president trump never broke 80 favorability among republican voters a certain segment of az republicans was outright hostile to president trump and was against the kavanaugh appointment this segment of moderate republicans especially woman sic proved very difficult to bring home to a republican candidate that supported president trump and the confirmation of justice kavanaugh    so trump and the republicans appointing a rapist to the high court actually cost the them the arizona senate seat that solves the kavanaugh question of whom did it help for the election
  a rapist  acquitted and funnily enough i dont hear you about abusers acosta and avenatti libtard drone
  put up beto  yeah put up someone who cant even win their local elections they will surely be president
  if kavanaugh is a rapist then comet pizza was a child sex den
  acquitted  by an improper and sham investigation that didnt interview everyone possible to get a complete story and republicans made sure to hide the results from the public by shooting down every attempt to make it public by democrats and then producing one copy and putting it in a locked room so it couldnt be released anyway  if its not a cover up republicans excel and making it look like one
  acquitted  he was never tried the case couldnt be tried because it happened too far in the past the kavanaugh hearing was not a trial though it was a job interview and kavanaughs nonanswers should have been disqualifying
  lincoln lost a senate race and then ran for president and won    try learning about history next time you want to run your mouth
    also he ran an unapologetic liberal campaign in blood red texas that included gun control and still came within 3 points of winning     and if you want to talk about texas george hw bush lost a race there and then went on to become vp then president
  i really believe beto could be the next kennedy he has the power and this time they wont be able to kill him because presidents have so much more protection
the answer is always because hes a psychopath
  of course thats ultimately the reason but im specifically wondering what his thought process was i know well never know for sure but speculation is fun
  flouride in the water made him a commie
he was having an affair wasnt he obviously thats not the whole motivation but its a factor
  the disturbing thing is that we still dont fucking know this shit we have thousands of incidents where people just snap out of the blue i was watching mindhunter on netflix and it acted like we got through this era of ignorance in the 60s by realizing that most psychopaths were abused as children by their parents but this era of ignorance about the true causes behind these brutal crimes clearly extends to the present
  he didnt just snap he was a psychopath their lives and goals conflicted with his and so he killed them its that simple
  the term psychopath is not recognized by any psychological foundation or publication the term youre looking for is sociopath
  intermittent explosive disorder i have it and it sucks every 3 months or so i get really fkn mad im not taalking anger issues its almost chemical like blood fire you cant stop seething its not a matter of calming down either or controlling yourself sounds like total bs i would never believe if i didnt have it but look it up the real problem is you dont really feel any diffrent until later when you ask  why did i get so mad i think anyone who  blacks out with anger should be checked for ied it can seriously fk up all aspects of your life
1 psychopath  2 low iq  3 mistress succubus
  how do you treat it
  bullets
  youre retarded arent you
she was a cheating whore deserving of death the kids dont deserve to live if they arent going to get an adequate development two parent household its honor killing i dont understand why people make him out to be a psycho
  psychopath is a colloquialism for sociopath happy
  honor killing  are you muslim by chance i understand that there is probably nothing in this world that enrages a male more than learning his wife has cheated on him but if that ever happens to you youd be better served by smashing a few things and waiting it out until you can think clearly again instead of exacting revenge on her by killing her or i dont know dont do that and go to jail your choice
  nah im not a muslim but if youre other half the one you married and said vows to the one you may have offspring with commits the ultimate betrayal disrespecting you the lord and everything there was those people deserve death how could you look at your wife the same how could you look at your children the same i couldnt for everything will remind you of the person who did you the most wrong in your life its nature for good to conquer evil in the long run
  letting a dangerous mental case freely roam the streets  one day theyll skip a dose snap at a loud noise and kill someone this is where no apparent motive crimes come from
  she was a cheating whore deserving of death  except he was the one having an affair not her you feloniously stupid prick
  you need to see a doctor
      these are both meme terms  off yourselves motuh breathers
  a shame your dad didnt share this sentiment
  fucking kill yourself my man
  betraying the lord  and suddenly you shall not kill stops being a thing just for you huh you doublestandard assmunching faggot
  she wasnt the one doing the cheating you stupid retard its a shame your parents didnt abort you
  please commit yourself before you hurt someone else
        trolled
  thats simply false they are two separate traits get your facts together before spreading ignorance
the office has been without a permanent leader since october and top deputies are departing leaving just a skeletal staff in place        the white house counsels office is down to a skeletal staff potentially leaving them unprepared to deal with a flood of subpoenas for documents and witnesses when democrats take control of the house    the office has been without a permanent leader since exwhite house senior attorney don mcgahn left the administration in midoctober his replacement pat cipollone is caught up in an extended background check thats prevented him from starting and in the coming weeks deputy counsel annie donaldson who served as mcgahns most trusted aide and as the offices chief of staff is expected to leave the administration according to two republicans close to the white house donaldson is moving to alabama with her husband brett talley whose nomination for a federal judgeship the white house withdrew in december 2017    amid the leadership tumult the counsels office has shrunk to about 25 lawyers according to a second republican close to the administration thats lower than its recent high point of roughly 35 attorneys and well short of the 40 people that some expect it will need to deal with a reinvigorated democratic party eager to investigate the presidents tax returns and business dealings in foreign countries reopen probes into russian election meddling and explore the behavior of a bevy of cabinet officials    they only have roughly 20 dedicated white house lawyers and a bunch of detailees who could leave at any time one former white house official told politico i dont think anyone who is paying attention thinks they are prepared for a democratic takeover    denuded and shrinking was how a third republican in touch with the white house described the offices current state
cipollone the incoming lead attorney is an experienced litigator and former justice department official but he is still undergoing his background check and working to untangle himself from his law firm business according to an administration official  meaning he is weeks away from taking the helm in the meantime emmet flood is overseeing both the white houses response to the russia investigation as well as the counsels office    when the head guy is leaving it is hard to find replacements said the third republican close to the white house speaking about the lapse of time between mcgahns departure and cipollones arrival    other key deputies from the counsels office have scattered throughout the administration to top legal posts at federal agencies to judgeships or to the private sector under mcgahn many of the attorneys in his office were from his former law firm jones day    a former george w bush white house official warned that trump needs to be mindful during the lame duck period when minor scandals can explode if the proper team isnt in place to deal with democrats already gearing up on the oversight front    the thing you have to be careful about is the transition said the official who noted that when the democrats took both the house and senate in 2006 the bush administration wasnt staffed to deal with the backlash after the justice department ordered the surprising dismissal of seven us attorneys democrats swiftly pushed for probes into whether the firings had been carried out for political reasons    a white house official said the administration is planning to work with democrats but prepared for harassment of the president the same official declined to give the most current headcount of lawyers inside the counsels office
as soon as cipollone arrives at the white house a huge part of his job will involve hiring new attorneys for a white house sure to be under siege from democrats in addition to the slate of white house investigations democrats plan to press the administration on the behavior of cabinet heads like interior secretary ryan zinke commerce secretary wilbur ross nand education secretary betsy devos    jim schultz former special assistant to the president and senior associate counsel to the trump said he expects cipollone will try and bulk up his team to about 40 people    theyre not there now schultz said certainly by the time the new congress is sworn in you want your army of lawyers    but hiring a bevy of lawyers and former supreme court clerks to handle an onslaught of investigations presumes that the trump white house will respond to subpoenas in a typical fashion it could just as easily ignore them and claim executive privilege a move that would ultimately land them in court but would fit with the trump white houses atypical approach to governing and politics  k street sign    the state of the understaffed white house counsels office stood in sharp contrast late last week to the annual gathering of the rightleaning federalist society  a nerd prom for conservative lawyers and scholars    at a gala on thursday night at union station attendees were jubilant over the confirmation of two rightleaning justices to the supreme court under trump said two attendees while the newest supreme court justice brett kavanaugh received a standing ovation
the federalist society gathering frequently serves as an informal audition for future judges or top administration officials a number of judges on trumps short list of potential supreme court picks appeared on various panels over the threeday event    but while conservative lawyers celebrated their ascendancy under the trump administration and the rights remaking of the judicial system veterans of past white houses warned that the trump white house was legally unprepared for the onslaught that lay ahead under a divided government    the white house counsel job is more than a fulltime commitment even in ordinary times said former clinton white house counsel jack quinn adding one  or more  investigations or an independent counsel inquiry just adds a second job on top but one that often demands sustained attention and always demands exquisite patience
two years of congressional gridlock flashy but toothless potential subpoenas and pearlclutching theatre when trump inevitably breaks out his phone and pen to write eos  empowered    if we could attach generators to left wing news outlets like politico the spin they generate could provide us enough electricity to finally move off of fossil fuels completely
  ctrlf subpoena  0 results  there is a problem with your post anon
  dems havent been talking about a dem house subpoenaing trump since before the election  there is a problem with your long term memory anon
  and republixans were talking about repealing the aca look how well that turned out
  no more individual mandate  going pretty well so far     youre right though i should just be forced to give my money to big health insurance corporations
  huh i literally heard the incoming judiciary committee chair talk about subpoenas this morning
  to be fair you only need to subpoena someone if theyre uncooperative im sure trump will cooperate with the rule of law
  lol
  republicans causing premiums to skyrocket  if anything republicans just made it easier to push through a single payer system or public option as long as the american people are stupid enough to blame democrats for the giant mess republicans created
the spirit of gritty  the wildeyed orange hockey mascot thats been appropriated by antifascists  was alive and well in philadelphias historic district on saturday as hundreds of people gathered in response to a planned farright rally    protesters vastly outnumbered the poorlyattended rally organized by a coalition of fascists farright agitators and maga faithful under the banner we the people zachary rehl a key member of the proud boys  a fascist streetgang linked to recent violence in new york city  was one of the lead organizers of the event and yet they comprised just a handful of roughly 40 attendees    event organizers positioned the rally as a promotion of mainstream conservative values while protesters  some with gritty emblazoned on posters or hats  chanted go home assholes    this event is for all patriots militia 3 percent constitutionloving americans the facebook page for the event stated pro good cop pro ice pro law and order pro life pro american value pro gun and anti illegal immigration    the two sides were kept separate by metal barricades and rows of police the independence visitor center an educational center at the site where the declaration of independence was signed functioned as a conduit between the two groups    there were scattered incidents of violent scuffles on one occasion a member of the farright infiltrated the protest side leading to a fist fight and culminating in his arrest and in the arrest of a antifascist law enforcement kept a close eye on clusters of blackclad antifa who moved in groups of about ten many who came equipped with helmets gas masks and goggles    
the farright rally was an exclusive affair penned off by police for their protection a stocky man in a security jacket determined who was allowed to enter the pen where attendees some in red maga hats waved american flags    people on our side have jobs and on saturdays a lot of them are resting said bill helder 54 explaining the poor turnout helder said he wanted to attend the rally to counter antifa and doesnt rule out violence in the future i dont think its time for violence yet said helder who works as a truck driver near philadelphia but if they get organized they start doing raids or bombs if you want a war well give it to you worse than you can imagine    alan swinney a member of the proud boys traveled all the way from texas to attend saturdays event he thinks he might have attended 10 such events so far from portland oregon to seattle and now all the way to philadelphia swinney who towered above the crowd at around 6foot5 was dressed in a helmet armor and knee pads which he said was to protect himself from antifa    they attack at every rally swinney said    swinney said that over time hes seen momentum growing on both sides hes motivated by the lefts refusal to accept legitimately elected leaders    and he added the low attendance of this event shouldnt fool you you say were outnumbered but you forget that the cops are on our side swinney said cops dont vote democrat    over on the protest side which was bolstered by about a hundred members of the democratic socialists of america the atmosphere was more carnivalesque aside from those wearing the colors of gritty the philadelphia flyers mascot someone played a tuba and one group of protesters weaved around the crowd inside a chinese dragon that was made to look like the popular meme grumpy cat
graham clarke and elizabeth lieb were meant to celebrate their oneyear wedding anniversary this weekend but instead they dropped their plans and traveled to philadelphia from new jersey to protest lieb and clarke were wearing matching knitted gritty hats gritty hates fascists lieb said explaining their affinity for the hockey mascot despite not being residents of philadelphia    but residents of philadelphia also turned out in full force including jim oconnor and melanie fortino who were waving a rainbow lgbtq flag and a resist flag theres nazis in our town said fortino and not doing anything is complicity    this isnt something we thought wed ever have to do  to protest nazis said oconnor people in other countries need to know that thats not who we are people need to know that theres more of us    philadelphia resident richard scott also turned out to protest the fascists but said nothing he saw saturday surprised him    im black i see this injustice every day this isnt new my people have been living like this forever scott said im scared of law enforcement im afraid of the cops theyre killing my people everyday on camera but you know what at least now were all out here    the most heated moments came as the day started to wind down and fascists clashed with antifascists beyond their designated rally areas police also clashed with antifascists including one incident where a cop beat a protester with a baton leaving him bloodied    leaving as it turned out was harder than expected for some of the fascist attendees the day came to an end outside the roundhouse which is philadelphia polices former headquarters there three fascists including key organizer rehl and another in a we are all dreamers tshirt stood behind a row of police surrounded by seemingly weary protesters some of who were sitting on the ground
police were trying to organize for the three attendees to leave via ubers from there a comical sequence of events ensued an uber would pull up protesters would swarm and say that they were about to pick up fascists and the uber would speed off    three unsuccessful uber attempts and one unsuccessful metered cab attempt later and law enforcement switched plans bringing the remaining three further into the old precinct headquarters signalling to everyone that the show was over    disclosure gavin mcinnes was a cofounder of vice media he left the company in 2008 and has had no involvement since then he founded the proud boys organization in 2016
police were trying to organize for the three attendees to leave via ubers from there a comical sequence of events ensued an uber would pull up protesters would swarm and say that they were about to pick up fascists and the uber would speed off   thats great i needed something to cheer me up
      its also fascinating to see how gritty was coopted the anti fascist and workers movement
  philadelphia is an underdog city that really impacts and runs through a lot of the politics particularly the sports spirit throughout the city he said so when you see the launch of this mascot gritty who is by all accounts a sort of hideous monster the response from an underdog city is to say yeah but hes our hideous monster and if you dont love him then fuck you    the grittyasantifa meme found its way offline on tuesday when trump visited philly demonstrators marched behind the antifa gritty banner some carrying homemade gritty signs of their own    this town only has room for one orange asshole read one
right wing bad left wing good   riveting journalism from vice
  i have nothing to contribute so i will call anyone who disagrees with me an npc  another amazing tactic from the side that just got their asses beat in the midterm election
  and the one that tried to pick a fight with antifa this weekend got their ass kicked too
  i have nothing to contribute so i will call anyone who disagrees with me an npc  whomst called anybody an npc
  if anything this article doesnt do enough to convey just how bad the right is its far too neutral for my tastes calling it biased in favor of the left is some serious delusion from the losing side seeing everything remotely honest as an attack on them because if anyone knows what left bias looks like its me
  3/10 far too obvious
      same angry person who couldnt get a taxi today  
  this also shows that the article is actually biased in favor of the right because they made it sound like an angry mob was scaring the cabs off and you can see in this video that its very quiet and civil
  bai gawd the right wing media bias is real
  i mean the site was founded by the creator of the proud boys
  this actually shows that the article is biased in favor of the left because they made the right wing rally goers sound like violent paranoid armed gangsters and the left wing protestors sound like happy go lucky free spirits and you can see in this video that the left wing protestors are actually quite vitriolic and aggressive
  ah yes repeating someones post back at them slightly modified a classic mark of low intelligence
  fascists  fascist street gang  nazis  calling the outnumbered rally fascists is just disengenuous and tiresome antifa beats people for saying things they dont agree with and are therefore also fascists also they dont report why police clashed with antifascists as if the police just beat people unprovoked
  ah yes misunderstanding the purpose of a post so you attribute it to low intelligence a classic mark of low intelligence
  gets called out on doing something stupid  does it again  not very bright are you
  antifa beats people for saying things they dont agree with  im sure you have so much video evidence of this which you will proceed to never post while insisting its totally out there if you just look it up
  still doesnt understand   not very bright are you
  still repeating things like an npc
  while insisting its totally out there if you just look it up  this is true though to say otherwise shows you are choosing not to look at any of the evidence or are just trolling us
  i dont understand what you are implying therefore you are an npc  never change /pol/ppets
  what it shows is that you dont have any evidence or else you would have posted it
    610    lol its actually very easy to find videos of antifa committing violence against people they disagree with you just want to pretend it doesnt exist
  you arent spoonfeeding me you must be lying   the absolute state of the american left
  lmao your video literally shows a trumptard autistically screeching about commies at your timestamp did you even watch this before you linked it holy shit lol
  no idea what video you watched  everyone who isnt blinded by their ideology sees that antifa are the fascist street gang
  the people protesting fascism are the real fascists did you know hitler was a democrat    lol every time you claim to be alpha then cant even commit to your beliefs
  protesting fascism  by attacking and trying to intimidate people who disagree with them good job becoming your supposed enemy no idea why you are squealing about hitler and alphas   fascists attack people who dont conform to their ideology thats exactly what antifa does
  and its what youre doing right now
  im beating you with a bikelock kek if you say so
noooo
  muh bikelock  still the only thing youve got  inb4 russia
  proud boys are a fascist street gang after being attacked in new york city bullshit vice isnt news its a propaganda machine post some real news next time
  post even a single example of the proud boys doing anything good
well they simultaneously believe that the left are unemployed losers and rich out of touch coastal elite hipsters it doesnt have to make sense to them because they arent saying it because they believe it themselves    fascism requires enemies to be simultaneously overwhelmingly powerful and omnipresent yet incredibly feckless weak and impotent likewise the fascists themselves are both beleaguered underdogs and übermenschen masters of the universe    fascism tends to be bad at accurately assessing things
i only wanted to say fuck the leftards
  how are they not
  well it cannot be both  hollywood celebrities are all leftists  and college kids who never had a job are also leftists
  are you actually this delusional or just being deliberately obtuse
  still no evidence  just says are you kidding me  so predictable
  its such a bullshit babyboomer stereotype that left leaning people are lazy ive had a job since my 16th birthday im 29 now im a democrat and most of my coworkers are too we want health insurance we can afford and higher wages and were not stupid and we know immigrants arent to blame for why our wages are so low     i can see why thats hard to understand for some underage /pol/tards who have had stable parents providing everything for them
  i always wonder where they get the idea that the left does not work the left is more educated which is more like to lead to solid employment and generally you look at the blue states they pay more into the system then they take    they think that everyone who isnt an extreme far rightwing nutjob is a lazy taker and welfare queen who does nothing but collect money from the government funny enough pretty much every unemployed person i know is a right wing nut job
im no fascist youre the fascist   projection strikes again from the fascist right
  theyre what they call a useful idiot    and alot of them have never seen an illegal worker in their life but they blame immigrants for not having a job     they have no intelligent insight on the welfare system and have no friends or family who have ever been on it yet theyre all experts on the social safety net and know for a fact that dismantling it would solve all of the problems for trumps amazing economy
i need an image of gritty trouncing pepe in an arm wrestling match
  useful idiots was a term coined by lenin to describe sympathetic communists in the united states
  lenin  wikipedia says his use of the phrase isnt documented and instead says it came from a 1948 new york times article about the rise of the iron curtain    assuming he did say it what was the context was he even referring to western communists  or was he referring to the financial interests/bankers who had after the bolsheviks won the civil war an interest in attempting to garner some favor with the new government of vast country full of natural resources
  people just say lenin coined it but its never been proven pretty much like everything that was unsubstantiated during the red scare boogieman era today it just describes bootlickers who spout propaganda that benefits the leaders in power
  lenin probably never said it but its like alot of the propaganda that came from mccarthyism amazing how some of that stuff continues to pervade    a more accurate term might have been fellow traveler to describe noncommunists who were sympathetic to their cause
  i think you missed the part where it was extrem right not just right
  the extreme right is the right now because of trump
  proud boys are a fascist street gang after being attacked in new york city   i think you mean the proud boys attacked innocents in new york city because it was the proud boys who were arrested and charged for their rioting
      fuck off you communist apologist
  it was the proud boys who were arrested and charged for their rioting    political correctness may have had a hand in that
  yes surely it was pc culture that caused them to be charged with riot act violations       gavin pls go
proud boys  was the name a reference to orks
  go home assholes  fucking lmao
  political correctness may have had a hand in that  so causing a riot and assulting people is the fault of political correctness once again we have proof that the fascist right are filled with whiny little bitches
  no thatd be too creative
  no theyre selfproclaimed male chauvinists hence the name they consider themselves the antithesis to the antifa protesters and encourage members to punch them in the face as a rite of passage
  they consider themselves the antithesis to the antifa  so theyre fascists   that just sounds like terrible marketing
  billypenncom  ah yes truly a bastion of quality journalism /s
                that last link there should particularly interest a man such as yourself
  daily caller  expresscouk  lol okay retard
  and the other sources
  the proud boys and most other conservative groups tend to get permits antifa comes in response to conservatives to create trouble antifa hides their faces because they are anarchists who has burned more cars and broken more windows anyone painting antifa as good guys is delusional
  tend to get permits  prove that
  implying proud boys and other facist street gangs are good guys because antifa breaks stuff  theyre both bad
  is your google broken or are you just lazy
  you made a statement and he asked you to prove it you dont make other people do your homework do you
  the proud boys and most other conservative groups tend to get permits  fascists tend to be anal about paper work whod have thought
  le shareblue boogeyman  retard detected
      its often true though i went to college too and i have a shitty job but just because i made poor choices in my major doesnt mean i think i deserve welfare or govt assistance
  it supports my prejudiceso it must be honest journalism  nah vice is trash and you only listen because of the deep bias all of the current social issues stem from the lefts insane rhetoric and the fact its been co opted by overgrown children who cant think for themselves and throw a fucking tantrum anytime something doesnt go their way  the right is the last bastion of american values and you subversives are a constant reminder why communism is an evil that must be erased
  strange in my personal experiance left wingers are most uninformed sheltered people who fear the outside world and unemployed drugs addicts who try to get diagnosed with a mental illness to get money from it  most factory workers and people in physical positions are right wing      the stereotype comes from the constant begging for free collegehealthcaremoneyetc without working for it and constantly bitching about shit wages when its your own fault at this point if you cant find a decent position entitlement is why

  anecdotal evidence against anecdotal evidence its almost if i did it on purpose at least i explained my position      his evidence involved comparing red states and blue states the data does back him up there    no it doesnt like at all   youre is just making his point about pointing out stereotypes of entitlement and resorting to anecdotal evidence     the truth isnt a stereotype    hes winning the debate so try and different course of action and ill ref  youre full of shit and biased as fuck so     how could you be aa ref for anything
  the truth isnt a stereotype  ahahahah he calls his shitty opinions based on anecdotes and stereotypes the truth  youre a fun guy 10/10 would laugh again
  not so sure bout that he didnt say foxnews for instance or pbs newshour
  he or she
  nhk  that one japanese corporation that works hard to turn people into shutins
  thats what i said you dumb fuck redditor being called a fascist is a compliment to me    trump isnt a fascist though hes just a zionist like most us politicians
  its clear he has a right wing bias because he doesnt want sites that carry water for trump and other antiamerican news sites to be banned       t butthurt fascist
  i always wonder where they get the idea that the left does not work  too much time to shitpost
  sounds like the the article is non biased because it only reported the facts where the right wing rally goers were like violent paranoid armed gangsters and the left wing protestors were happy go lucky free spirits who used non violent resistance like informing taxi companies they were about to serve fascists to stymie the fascists
  that describes the right
  i always wonder where they get the idea that the left does not work  by observing reality ie noting similarities among people who are constantly trying to expand the welfare state and get more free stuff from the government    funny enough pretty much every unemployed person i know is a right wing nut job  you must not know many   talk to anyone who works in public service social services the dmv child services adult services public librarians etc i used to work in a library 90 of the homeless people milling around talked about how they voted straight ticket democrat one of them threw a temper tantrum the day after the midterms over late fees and told us we couldnt stop her from taking out more items because the dems won the house and our fascist right wing library system was going down
  you must not know many  talk to anyone who works in public service social services the dmv child services adult services public librarians etc i used to work in a library 90 of the homeless people milling around talked about how they voted straight ticket republican one of them threw a temper tantrum the day after the midterms over late fees and told us we couldnt stop her from taking out more items because the republicans and trump had the house stolen by niggers and spics voting illegeally and our commie liberal library system was going down
  you must not know many  thank you for demonstrating you dont with your poor attempt at a ftfy because what i described actually happened  go into a dss building or a public library in any major city like nyc or chicago and ask the people there employees or otherwise how they usually align politically
  go a blue city in an azure blue state to ask how people align politically  hmmm    id rather go to a red city in a blood red state to ask how people align politically
  id rather go to a red city in a blood red state to ask how people align politically  good luck finding a major city in a red state thats that explicitly red theres a reason urban centers tend to maintain blue population blocks and a reason you find the most homeless in urban centers
  that just proves your theory is without merit
  that just proves your theory is without merit  actually quite the opposite that proves my theory is right on the money  urban centers are more likely to have larger blue voting blocks even in deep red states  urban centers have more homeless people  you may find higher numbers of right wing homeless individuals in deep red states in urban centers than blue states but given that most major urban centers are blue in blue states its statistically more likely for homeless in the urban centers to align with left wing ideologies     fun side note homeless people are also statistically more prone to mental illness
  what i described actually happened  sure it did /pol/babby sure it did
  thats blatantly retardedit would be like saying all right leaning people are nazis and klansmenhomeless and mentally ill people are not in great enough number to produce half of the voting population in americayour a right wing version of a libtard
  apart from pro life sounds like most democrat voters as well if these groups represent the values in their mission statement they represent the average american antifa and vice are the actual extremists here
  arent you ashamed of yourself inciting violence with lies these things will lay heavily upon you youre such a lost soul
  what exactly are the lies im sure youll take the time to carefully list them instead of posting more vague wannabereligious bullcrap
   democrats support social programs   homeless people use social programs   homeless people vote democrat  gee i wonder why     veterans get paid by the government   republicans support more money for the armed forces   veterans vote republican  it all comes down to which side of the aisle is giving you more stuff
  the funny thing is republicans love to abuse veterans since the money they hand out goes to mercenaries and the war industry never to the troops look at how trump just installed personal friends to run the va and its even more shitty now

  leftliberals do not deserve free speech for the rest of society to prosper and be free leftliberals must be deplatformed
  yikes  and then youre surprised when normal people liken you to nazis imagine the cognitive dissonance
  left liberals are not normal you are a very small minority of the population that has outsized influence due to unearned privilege normal people hate your guts
    reads like satire of the far left and antifa  hopefully so
  this is where youre wrong you with your fascistic views views such as  leftliberals do not deserve free speech for the rest of society to prosper and be free leftliberals must be deplatformed  are the minority you drape yourself in labels like normal and salt of the earth but those people do not share your extreme views no one is fooled by this but nice try i guess
  no its just one autistic tumblrite trying to force it
  far left liberals like yourself are less than a quarter of the population you are a psychotic fringe
  the fascist right strikes again  free speech for me not for you
  fuck gritty and fuck jannies
  muh freeze peach    remember that     its not taking away your free speech if the government isnt doing it    remember that      were going to make you eat those word
  so dense you cant see hes just echoswitching leftist talking points  this board is so illiterate it hurts
  were going to make you eat those word  you already do that im banned from r/thedonald  you mean youre going to demand everyone give you a platform for whatever bullshit or gross bigotry you have to offer and then when you have authority proceed to systematically deplatform everyone else and stop recognizing the constitution as applying to anyone outside of your ingroup  thats nothing new its virtually always been the modus operandi of american conservatives
  the left has the demsocs they literally shitpost for a living
trump is just like one of you morons who get all their news from fox news it would be funny if it werent sad
personally i realize fullwell that im buying into statesanctioned news but whats the alternative pizzagate enthusiasts lets be real for a moment there is no real alternative until shit gets bad enough for the majority of people there is no real reason to fight the establishment
  and we know immigrants arent to blame for why our wages are so low  why would your wages be high when they can hire an immigrant for less or offshore your job youre competing in a global economy now and theres literally billions of people wanting to take your spot
  the right does nothing but project what you hear them claim the antifa believes is actually what they personally believe
    you mean youre going to demand everyone give you a platform for whatever bullshit or gross bigotry you have to offer and then when you have authority proceed to systematically deplatform everyone else and stop recognizing the constitution as applying to anyone outside of your ingroup    isnt this the exact same as what the american left was doing over the past ten years during the fifties you all said that maccarthy was wrong for holding peoples politics against them and using them to get them blacklisted now you guys do the same thing and any response is taken as a reason why youre right  same as the maccarthyites
    what they say antifa believes is what antifa believes i spent four years trying to get antifaggots to actually organise and they proved to be walking flakes   their only accomplishment has been calling proud boys and the lambda freaks into existence while providing no positive socialist alternative pardon the expression kshama is gutter to the core
you know youre a loser when you need rupert murdochs pet hacks to spread your limp menes
change the name of the board to /newfags/
  /pol/ppets in charge of board name    /news/men now  /news/men tomorrow  /news/men forever
  you can see people on both the far right and antifa who clearly are opposed to free speech for the other side
  im banned from r/thedonald  muh freeze peach    you should be banned from using a computer    the rest of this is just nonsensical but deplatforming leftists would be an entirely justified response
  they dont even generate their own arguments or criticisms any more they just take the most effective of ours and post them back at us
  were going to use private corporations to deplatform you and prevent your speech from actually reaching anyone  ok well do this back to you but twice as hard using the government  ugh how dare you    lol libs still dont seem to understand that their enemies can hit back just like when you go around talking about punching nazis and then a few of you die you act outraged
  free speech is okay as long as its my speech  the fascist right strikes again
  still dont seem to understand that their enemies can hit back  this seems to describe you guys when you cry like little babies that your own memes are being used against you
  i still love /pol/s damage control when theyre shown this video

  there will be no repercussions for facebook they are too big to fail and too big to punish    zucc should embrace this and is undoubtedly just testing the waters to see if they can accept advertising for the human trafficking trade
  id hit it
  this is still pretty normal in a lot of parts of the world unfortunately any american company shouldnt be facilitating that shit though
  well facebook isnt omnipotent
  theyre good enough at banning conservatives but not very good at banning human trafficking  i feel like their priorities are misplaced
  auction daughter  receive cows
  lmao cowpal is popular in those emerging countries he got a great deal considering im just imagining the cookie traffic working out whom to show adverts for virginauctions where money is optional as payment for humans its normalised behaviour for them and guess what its discrimination stopping them doing it cos every man does his thing a little different
discrimination to stop it    no not really all civilized behavior is implicitly forced onto people its not something that the unwashed masses all took up at once its something we were taught whether we like it or not because thats what it takes to get people to stop acting like savages and only doing whats best for their own enrichment even if it means human trafficking even now many people on the planet have never been taught how not to behave like a moonworshipping mouth breather and theyll have to be forcibly civilized just like the rest of us were many generations ago
after all dont do that dumb savage shit here or well kill you or throw you in prison is pretty much the rule of law in a sentence

her father received 500 cows two luxury cars two bikes a boat some mobile phones and 13800 in exchange for his daughter  good deal
  i dont like what happened to her even though i wonder if 16 is adult age in south sudan some cultures it is uk and in some its 14 others 21 but most are at 18
  yea and boys get it too its awful
  at least read the article instead of jumping at whatever ghost fits your victim complex    this is 4chan not a library remember that

  with the 500 cows
  i agree they paid far too much

  if you fancy dying of aids at 30 sure
  the look in her eyes says she is going to give hiim hell
  so youre telling me i could go to sudan and make a bunch of children and sell them off for money  i suspect this is why they are making so many children in the first place
  any american company shouldnt be facilitating that shit though  if only both facebook and google grovel before corrupt governments just to get the smallest sway in those countries google has bent over backwards to satisfy the chinese zuckerberg went out of his way to marry a chink to try and get favor with xi     oh and what did mark have to say about xi jinpings book   ive bought copies of this book for my colleagues as well i want them to understand socialism with chinese characteristics mark zuckerberg founder  ceo facebook
what a ripoff
  dont see any problems with that or maybe on second thought that was a fucking ripoff the dude paid way too much
  cute i wouldve paid more but paypal wouldnt accept my offer of 700 cows
  he would have paid more  prime teen pussy is no meme but 700 cows man
  got anyone else for that price
  seems like a pretty decent trade tbqh  for the dad anyways
ever notice how there seems to be a direct correlation between the number of people with mbas and the decline of the united states     thanks for giving our manufacturing might away to china in exchange for your own personal gain   the west was sure the chinese approach would  not work it just had to wait its still waiting    by philip p pan photographs by bryan denton nov 18 2018    in the uncertain years after maos death long before china became an industrial juggernaut before the communist party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside shanghai there in the bamboo forests of moganshan the young scholars grappled with a pressing question how could china catch up with the west    
  w bush was the first mba president trump is the 2nd
china has people many many people cheap physical labor but they also have asian pressure to succeed the children are expected to support the parents eventually and the parents invest in their children to make sure that happens high stress high pressure immense competition leading to ultra educated people that often work menial jobs because theres not enough white collar work available i dont see how china wont surpass the usa we dont have the numbers and we dont have the work ethic the usa is still a global power because were still capable of recruiting brilliant foreign minds using our universities and tech companies as lures but theres already signs the usa isnt as attractive as it used to be the number of international students at american universities are declining tech startups are moving overseas the usa is headed in a bad direction
  china has a demographic problem when it comes to the number of elderly people    
  theres more families with multiple children now that the onechild policy is gone but the overall birthrate is still low due to an apparent lack of women of childbearing age thanks to the onechild policy and female infanticide so yeah any time a country has a suppressed birth rate over an extended period of time the proportion of elderly people will increase and its a slow process to correct it
just imagine a country that could one day become basically like 10 japans they will flatten everyone else    i know they are rude and litter everywhere but you never know things could change pretty quickly also look at singapore which is basically just chinese people but away from the mainland hell look at hong kong they just need a change of circumstances
say what you want but chinese culture will never run the world the west is ultra dominant when it comes to culture and this wont change by 2045 or what ever    the west exchanges information too quickly for the chinese to keep up really so long as they censor media and the internet they cant really compete
  ever notice how there seems to be a direct correlation between the number of people with mbas and the decline of the united states     nice fucking opinion you retard this is literally against the rules of this board  end yourself
  theyll outbreed us
president trump has privately asked aides about his vice president mike pences loyalty the new york times reported friday    trump reportedly questioned pences allegiance so many times that many of his advisers are alarmed as those kinds of inquiries tend to indicate that he is irritated with someone     according to the times most people within the white house have been supportive of pence when asked but some of trumps outside advisers have suggested that the vice president may have used up his utility    trump has reportedly not made it clear whether he is seriously considering a 2020 ticket change or whether he is simply trying to get advisers opinions before the campaign begins    the times noted that some outside advisers have suggested outgoing united states ambassador to the united nations nikki haley as a potential replacement for pence trump praised haley when she announced her intentions to leave her post at the un in october        tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down
i have no love for trump but this is actually worrisome
funfact anonymous sources are the leftwings version of birtherism
  quick on the damcon arent ya    the times has apparently heard this same story from no less than four different groups of staffers which is why theyve reported it the way they have    either its actually real or the entire wh staff is having a seriously good laugh at the times expense or perhaps trumpsnot sure
  i have no idea what you just said  but it sounded like  anchor babies are the laissez faire version of communist border walls
  communist border walls  walls designed to keep you in    lazziez faire  lazy nongovernment controlled economics    so anchor babies are the nongovt regulated way of letting you stay in the country holy shit that actually worksbarely
    or the sources dont even exist
  see you might not be wrong but ive heard this a lot and then a legal filing drops or someone in the wh admits its true and so on and so forth    im just following the trends
anonymous sources say that op is a faggot
if trump has to ask it proves hes an idiot
  anonymous my ass id put my damn name on that shit
    trumpies sweating hard lately
  everyone who points out tabloid tier trash for what it is must be a mindless trumpanzee    partisan retards out in full force tonight yet again
  id be ecstatic if trump got rid of pence all the ha ha you cant impeach trump or watch out for president pence talk right out the window haley would be a ridiculously stupid replacement considering the illegal shit she just got caught doing but hey thats trumps favorite
  the hill  tabloid  yeah nah trumptard confirmed
  omarosa for vp 2020
  pence is the one person in the executive branch that trump cannot fire pence can only be removed by impeachment trump could choose a new running mate for 2020 though    one theory of what trump is thinking of doing is hes thinking of stepping down and letting pence pardon him he may be asking if pence would pardon him
  pardoning wouldnt protect him from state crimes though i hope hes stupid enough not to realize that
  also in accepting a pardon youre basically admitting you committed the crimes youre being pardoned of the state level prosecutors could use the acceptance of a pardon as evidence in prosecution trump is stuck in a very precarious place
  pence could always double cross him
  to quote count dooku treachery is the way of the sith
    yep the dual pursuit of federal and state level prosecution seems designed to bypass the pardon power here its only possible for someone whos done a lot of shit but it works    unless that supreme court case goes wonky
  iirc ive heard that even thomas is on the correct side about the issue so i could plausibly see only the trump puppets gorsuch and kavanaugh voting in gambles favor
  two of the old reds could defect to trump and it wouldnt be enough youd need all three to join him and at this point theyve got to be realizing the man is poison
  i would see roberts voting against trump purely on political reasons to make the court look nonpartisan similar to how he didnt kill obamacare     if the republican supreme court said trump was above the law that would be the death of any credibility and respect of it had and give democrats license to outright ignore the court under the justification is just a partisan instution
  different poster but ignore the court in what sense are their rulings not legally binding im not very informed about how they work
  the courts can issue a ruling but they do not have a way to enforce their rulings enforcement is done through the executive branch ie president if the judicial branch goes completely off the rails the president can just refuse to enforce their rulings and if the congress doesnt see anything wrong with that and doesnt initiate impeachment proceedings theres really nothing the judicial branch can do about it it would be a terrible precedent to set though
  there is a very weak precedent for this the supreme court ordered president jackson to honor his treaties with the native american community jackson basically ignored them and did the trail of tears anyway im grossly oversimplifying but thats where the apocryphal statement of john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it came from    this does not mean doing it today would be a good thing there would be riots
  the courts only power is that the people trust them to be fair and impartial when they rule on things and that trust compels the other branches to respect their authority in theory the judicial branch is the weakest branch because they basically have no direct check on the presidents power and congress can make new constitutional amendments which supersede their authority
  if youre a strict consitutionalist the supreme court is not a coequal branch because it has no way of enforcing its rulings in fact judicial review was something the court created themselves and im sure if the supreme court was controlled by democrats youd see trump challenge that as well       this the only reason you didnt see the democrats revolt against the supreme court after the republicans on the court stole the 2000 election for bush was under the assumption they wouldnt politicize anything else to that degree but after mcconnell stole obamas pick and the kavanaugh shit show the court is on extremely thin ice to where youll see democrats either go all out to pack the courts or just ignore their rulings if democrats pass a medicare for all the republican supreme court strikes it down
  that or hes just paranoid considering all the accusations and slander put against his presidency
  hes an idiot for not realizing pence has designs for the presidency hes the only person in the world who seemingly doesnt know pence has dreamed of being president since high school if he realized it at all pence would have been gone a long time ago
  damn that is dull of him
    apparently you missed the memo this isnt the 90s and before anymore people are having an increasingly harder time verifying sources hence why many are calling this a posttruth world any news site can post tabloid nonsense what makes it tabloid nonsense is whether or not the source can be verified or not     this is exactly the problem julian assange warned us about 15 years ago journalism has gotten too comfortable with allowing anonymous sources to say whatever they want without providing a single shred of evidence that can be open and independently verified instead of we got x evidence from an anonymous source and here is the x leak that we were provided so that others can look into it and verify that its true we get our anonymous source told us x happened and no we dont have any documentation or video/audio evidence that can be verified but were a super elite msm conglomerate so if you question us youre a tinfoil hatter conspiracy theorist this is retarded its unethical and sets society up in such a way that the masses are totally complacent with being fed unfalsifiable garbage and just eating it right up without question    the problem with this the source itself could be lying lets give the hill the benefit of a doubt for a second lets assume they didnt just make this person up that it really is a white house staffer close enough to trump who gave them this info the problem here is that this staffer is clearly keeping their opposition a secret and clearly wishes to undermine the current administration sowhats stopping this person from just flat out making shit up in the case he doesnt have anything journalists are clearly glad to just take his word for it without need of any proof whatsoever other than his position so why wouldnt the guy just spew hot air if his goal is to subvert the white house then his reports to make it look bad dont actually need to be true thats the problem with sources without proof
  thats a lot of pointless words to defend the baseless assertion that the hill is tabloid trash its ridiculous on its face particularly in light of the fact that multiple studies conducted by various universities have confirmed it to be one of the most unbiased news sites currently in operation
  its a post truth world because our president and his administration cant stop lying their asses off
    if you actually read that post and understood it you would know it isnt calling the hill tabloid trash
  tldr gaslighting post  if so many sources are fake why do you almost never see a story be forced to be retracted protip because theyre real why do you think trump is trying to find any way possible to destroy the 1st amendment
  gets presented with logic and reasoning that is contrary to current beliefs  omg gaslighting111oneoneoen11    wew laddy
  its not that people are having a harder time verifying sources    a the sources of information have expanded exponentially there are far fewer gatekeepers than before at least online which is both a pro and a con woohoo anyone can write anything on the internet but then oh shit anyone can write anything on the internet     b oodles of information even if its literal shittier conspiracy theory quality ahem fox cnn or flat out lies and propaganda rt is easy to access truth is probably hiding in plain sight but how would you know people are as stupid as always but in the past stupid people only had shitty latenight am radio to get their virtually free access to more stupidity and it was mostly a crapshoot if youd connect with other stupids now they can organize way easier    c lots of players would like to poison the wells western liberal democracy is a threat to the likes of erdogan putin xi and every other tinpot dictator trump is obviously a fan of these sorts
  if so many sources are fake why do you almost never see a story be forced to be retracted  why do unfalsifiable things never get proven wrong    there is a magical invisible pink elephant taking a magical invisible pink shit on your head prove me wrong
  the hill is has a very good reputation for getting things right so i am certain that this source is a source they have used before and as such are confident that the information is accurate you dont seem to understand that a competent journalist still actually vets their source before printing some nonsense like my source just told me that donald trump is standing in front of the white house with an ar15 mowing down anyone who approaches which you might see on daily mail this is getting sidetracked but its insane there are people on this website who actually trust the daily mail just because it leans a bit to the right they literally took some edits of riley stearns instagram that people posted as memes on /tv/ and posted them as if they were real and yet when i call out the daily mail which has a terrible reputation idiots will still defend it because it tells them what they want to hear    also the phrase posttruth comes specifically from people repeating the same lies over and over again even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary and people accepting those lies because it sounds right it has absolutely fucking nothing to do with people are having trouble verifying sources because theres plenty of shit with verifiable sources out there the problem we have now is that people are outright refusing to accept those sources because they dont like whats being said hence posttruth furthermore fuck you for citing julian assange when we now know hes been paid to say shit like that to sow discord really fucking funny that the wikileaks guy would have a problem with anonymous sources
  isnt that a phrase invented by steven colbert
  furthermore fuck you for citing julian assange when we now know hes been paid to say shit like that to sow discord    this was a garbage hitpiece against him that is highly inaccurate yes he got funding from some shading however the false implication in that is that wikileaks has been publishing nonsense  which they have not not one single thing on wikileaks has been proven to be false
  he is a notoriously dull person
  julian assange when we now know hes been paid to say shit like that to sow discord really fucking funny that the wikileaks guy would have a problem with anonymous sources  those who play by the sword    anyway id say wikileaks started out as a good thing it exposed official american lies  lies which anyone with half a brain would understand anyhow  and this of course brought the wrath of the gov and attempts to discredit     since assange was largely rejected by the mainstream it pushed him into a corner and forced him to make strange the wrong bedfellows the protection of illiberal antiwestern forces does not help but thats the situation compare with snowden by now assange has become a twisted character more than he was before and the character assassinations dont help
sources supposedly close to a friend familiar with a friend of ops thinking report that he is indeed a nigger more at 11
  not one single thing on wikileaks has been proven to be false  sentences like that raise a red flag for me
  its more like some of it is inane or already known but if you think nothing valuable has come out of it you arent reading closely enough not to sound tinfoil but mainstream media in the us has by choice generally not gone near wikileaks information
  probably because none of it is actually verifiable
  none of it has even been denied
  if it was denied theyd just say youre lying best not to dignify it with a response
  i thought it was common knowledge that pence would be happy either way if trump stayed or left on one hand he gets paid to do fuck all and push his party on the other hand he gets double pay and gets to implement party policy on a national scale in some ways hes even worse than trump as hes exactly what the drain the swamp crowd wants to be rid of a career politician and a sly one at that
  i used to think he was sly but then he wasted taxpayer dollars flying to a football game that he intended to walk out of and everyone saw right through it and i realized hes fucking dumb too
  who can deny an anonymous source they are both unverifiable and undeniable
  wikileaks does not publish anonymous sources they publish documents that they claim are for example us diplomatic cables    now its also possible instead of publishing us diplomatic cables they published some retards fanfiction but when the us government agrees that they are in fact us diplomatic cables and condemns the leaks and issues subpoenas and investigations to figure out the source of the leaks and leads to diplomatic fallout all around the world one can reasonably suspect that they are in fact diplomatic cables
  what illegal shit it seems ive been out of the loop lately last thing i remember everyone was fawning over her as the next conservative wonder lady who was definitely gonna be the next republican president
  i dont remember people saying that at all but then again i dont hang around conservative circlejerks      she resigned from the un position right after she got caught doing this
  or the entire wh staff is having a seriously good laugh at the times expense  at this point with how crazy shit is i wouldnt even be surprised
  bro weve got a good track record  just trust us 
      the hill covers both sides on the political spectrum and generally sources information properly the hill rarely uses loaded words in their headlines and articles such as this trump says he wont sign gops compromise immigration bill all news stories are sourced to either journalists in the field or credible media sources story selection slightly favors the left but is generally balanced a factual search reveals the hill has not failed any fact checks the hill always corrects factual errors in a timely manner and therefore maintain a high factual record
  i wasnt referring to that post but the previous post it was quoting the post in question presumes the hill might make up a source out of thin air which is the same as calling it tabloid trash
  this why do some people put so much effort into gaslighting others the presumption is that its because they just simply dont have anything better to do with their lives
  that seems correct they like to project that other people dont have jobs but they sure have a lot of time to spend trying to convince the world that lies are the real truth and really if you have to lie to gain the advantage its time to step back and realize that maybe your cause isnt the correct cause
  some of it has been verifiable in fact
  like what be specific
      gaslighting is a retarded buzzword people use when they see a fact they dont believe
  gaslighting simply means calling some bullshit you just made up a fact usually over and over again even in the face of disproving evidence kinda like you just did in your post
  most famously     big brother is watching you     bbut i have nothing to hhide    just the main stuff here     im not a conspiracy theory type and i think assange is a shiteater and the same of kind sewer rat as alex jones rt editorial etc etc but some of the stuff is definitely true if selectively leaked
  believing that wikileaks fabricates documents is literally a conspiracy theory
a lotta loyalty for oh wait not a lotta loyalty
christ this thread is pathetic this is why your board gets no readers you know that right
  you sound desperate
  its because no meme pics or nudes can be posted
  whatever will we do without another poorly drawn picture of a wojak opening his mouth
  why is it that people from /pol/ think that lack of /pol/acks is something that other boards would be disappointed by
  theyre still deluded into thinking theyre well liked the only support /pol/ ever gets is from other /pol/shits

    washington ap  president donald trump has rejected a central conclusion of a dire report on the economic costs of climate change released by his own administration but economists said the warning of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in global warming costs is pretty much on the money    just look at last year with hurricanes harvey maria and irma they said those three 2017 storms caused at least 265 billion in damage  according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration    the national climate assessment report  quietly unveiled friday warned that natural disasters are worsening in the united states because of global warming    it said warmingcharged extremes have already become more frequent intense widespread or of long duration the report noted the last few years have smashed us records for damaging weather costing nearly 400 billion since 2015    the potential for losses in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of this century the report said it added that if emissions of heattrapping gases continue at current levels labor costs in outdoor industries during heat waves could cost 155 billion in lost wages per year by 2090    the president said he read some of the report and its fine but not the part about the devastating economic impact    i dont believe it trump said adding that if every other place on earth is dirty thats not so good    nearly every country in the world in 2015 pledged to reduce or slow the growth of carbon dioxide emissions the chief greenhouse gas    were already there said wesleyan university economist gary yohe who was a reviewer of the national report which was produced by 13 federal agencies and outside scientists climate change is making a noticeable impact on our economy right now harvey florence michael maria
yohe said it is devastating at particular locations but for the entire country no    economist ray kopp a vice president at the think tank resources for the future and who wasnt part of the assessment said the economics and the science in the report were absolutely credible    i believe this is going to be a devastating loss without any other actiontaking place kopp said monday this is certainly something you would want to avoid    earlier the white house had played down the report spokeswoman lindsay walters said in an emailed statement that the report is largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts longestablished trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population     throughout the 29chapter report scientists provide three scenarios that the united nations climate assessments use one is the businessasusual scenario which scientists say is closest to the current situation that is the worst case of the three scenarios another would envision modest reductions in heattrapping gases and the third would involve severe cuts in carbon dioxide pollution    for example the 155 billion a year in extra labor costs at the end of the century is under the businessasusual scenario modest reductions in carbon pollution would cut that to 75 billion a year the report said    the report talks of hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses in several spots in one graphic it shows the worstcase businessasusual scenario of economic costs reaching 10 percent of gross domestic product when earth is about a dozen degrees warmer than now with no specific date
trump only cares about the parts of the country that vote for him    the coastal cities dont vote for him    of course this doesnt stop him from being catastrophically wrong  the coastal cities also pay most of the taxes
  trump should put his faith behind assumptions of an international body of globalists
    why did op leave out this part of the article  yohe said it was unfortunate that some media jumped on that 10 percent number because that was a rare case of hyperbole in the report    the 10 percent is not implausible as a possible future for 2100 yohe said its just not terribly likely  you arent being dishonest or anything right leaving that out doesnt make you look impartial
  i wasnt aware the coastal cities of the united states counted as another country    or are you just completely ignoring my point
  how is it trumps fault that coastal shitlib cities are using more green house gases than fly over country
  wildfires dont count my guy and before you throw that point around actually look up how much greenhouse gases are generated by what    see where agriculture is on that list
  iowa pumps out more ghg than new york city  who the fuck believes this besides retards in brooklyn
  every other place on earth is dirty thats not so good  what does this even mean
  3 seperate fucking threads about muh trump climate outrage  we only need one thread on this topic not one for every new article that covers the same thing  please stop spamming the board
  dems are desperate
  well we are all going to die if we dont do something about it    soyes
  well we are all going to die if we dont do something about it  were all going to die even if we do mr gore    you know what wont kill you though keeping similar articles covering the same topic in one thread
  no you and i are going to die    i said all as in all of us the human race    havent you ever wanted to save the world
  i wish you were better at baiting so this could at least be enjoyable youre such a fucking npc at it i cant even laugh or have any motivation to engage you any further
  okay bye
  havent you ever wanted to save the world  youre not saving the world youre advocating to the government to fight climate change despite said government being one of the greatest driving forces behind threats to the environment because the tv tells you to do so
  govt is doing a bad thing  tell govt to stop doing bad thing  i dont see the problem here
   govt to stop doing bad thing  youre not youre advocating giving it more power and money then it goes and drops bombs on people and calls you wasteful for using plastic straws and you thank them for it    i dont see the problem here  well you are an easily led idiot so thats no surprise
  huh    how does i think the govt should pursue more regulation of environmental policy translate to i want more military spending
  iowa  primary transportation 30 year old john deere tractors  ny  primary transportation feet  hmmm i wonder
  the international scientific community backed by decades of evidence and research
the climate models are off by 500 anyway id throw them in t he trash too were headed into an ice age
world leaders are paid money by big oil companies obviously trump is getting his share and since hes fucking old and will die in the near future hes like fuck it
  who the fuck believes this besides retards in brooklyn  everyone who ever bothered to check the science in their entire lives
more taxes will please gaia  man in dress pees in girls room    the absolute state of settled science
  kek thats pretty funny
  it would be funny if these kikes werent trying to make us to live in tin huts while forcing our sons to take estrogen pills
  all money is from the government its right there on the bills  most power comes from the government too unless youre quite literally in the middle of nowhere
can somebody tell me why this is a big deal and makes trump look bad if the us stopped all pollution right now as in we stop producing all ghg global pollution would go down by what 10 maybe our country already has very very clean air and water were among the best in the world in that regard we can do better but its not a big fucking deal for us we need to work on iran pakistan india and china     libs will make anything into a big deal because theyre so desperate to show trump is bad for this country but the truth he hasnt made any poor decisions so far
  our country already has very very clean air and water  we dont  we need to work on iran pakistan india and china  when these regulations are usually suggested countries want everyone to be subject to them including the us  since it would cut into profits at any amount companies pay off politicians to reject the equal rule    this isnt really just a trump thing but as he is currently the president anything he does is a big deal as it has big impacts whether he meant to or not
  we can do better but its not a big fucking deal for us we need to work on iran pakistan india and china   ghg emissions per country in 2016 millions of metric tons international energy agency     china  9101 657 per capita  usa  4833 1495 per capita  india  2077 156 per capita  iran  563 702 per capita  pakistan  153 079     were not the biggest player in the house but were certainly part of the problem and were absolutely not even close to the best in the world when it comes to ghgs per person we are one of the worst
  surethats happening  good analysis there sparky
based as fuck if climate change isnt a hoax then its completely natural
if youre so worried about the climate you should be preaching in china or india not america   also this is all based on cherry picked and cooked up data for fake news and a smear against conservatives
  no    what about china and india
  yeah the real problem is the country that pollutes less than half as much with five times the population    pay no attention to the united states of america
      trumps war on fact and science is ratcheting up
  the washington times reports that manaforts three passports reveal just two visits to england in 2010 and 2012 which support his categorical denial of the totally false and deliberately libelous report in the guardian which said that manafort visited assange in the ecuadorian embassy  ostensibly to coordinate on the wikileaks release of hillary clintons emails   the times does note that manafort could have conceivably entered the uk from another european country and not received a stamp  however a representative for manafort insisted to the times that manafort has only made those two visits to england since 2008 and that a libel suit against the guardian is under discussion   while two of manaforts passports were entered as evidence at his tax evasion trial  something that the guardians luke harding and dan collyns could have easily looked up  the times has obtained a copy of his third passport which confirms the two visits   wikileaks immediately fired back at the guardian  betting the paper a million dollars and its editors head that manafort never met assange      this is going to be one of the most infamous news disasters since stern published the hitler diaries    following the guardians epic faceplant an excia agent penned an article in politico suggesting that russia tricked the guardian into writing the manafortassange story   lol
you could have posted any source reporting on this but you had to post the one owned by the right wing religious cult
  isnt it true that once you enter the eu you can travel anywhere within it without passport checks
  he could have entered from another european country but he pinky promises he didnt  simply irrefutable    whether manafort met with assange or not we already know that team donald had close ties to russialeaks via stone the day after stone discussed the stolen emails with assange he talked on the phone with donald stone pinky promises he didnt discuss it though which is also irrefutable evidence
  you could have posted any source reporting on this  well wapo nyt and politico for excample arent really touching the story i cant think of even a   single  reason why they wouldnt want to put the truth out there and correct the record maybe theyll get around to it in a few days/weeks    thankfully we have actual journalists like glen greenwald in the meantime  
  this is correct the schengen area has no internal movement controls
  simply irrefutable  burden of proof lies on the accuser sweaty 
  probably because it didnt happen also greenwald has been on the russian payroll since he delivered ed snowden to them
   the guardians epic faceplant an excia agent penned an article in politico suggesting that russia tricked the guardian into writing the manafortassange story      bwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahah    putin opens in the night the friedge and see that puding is all shacking and wabling around  calm down i am for cheese        exdeputy head of the us department of homeland security suzanne spoulding said that the russian media are telling the truth to weaken the americans  during the discussion at the washingtonbased center for strategic and international studies on global security the former deputy minister complained that in presenting the truthful information the russian media are simply trying to worsen the situation in the united states so it is necessary to counter this    i think it is necessary for highranking people to explain how our opponents use information wars sometimes using it tools to weaken us sometimes they dont even need to invent anything they use truthful information and repeat it in a onesided way ria novosti quotes spowling    russia is not on anyones side she is on her side and her desire is not to make us better and not to raise our problems solve them but to make us weaker she added    the discussion was attended by american experts and retired officials who came to the conclusion that the united states has two main enemies  russia and china who are fighting in the gray zone at the same time washington allegedly was always on the bright side and does not use forbidden methods of struggle    
  greenwald has been on the russian payroll  source
  the source was how he turned anticlinton and was piling on all the other fake news about her during the 2016 election look at his archives for yourself theyre all protrump anticlinton stories before 2017
  do you not know greenwalds role in the snowden affair hes the guy who hid him in the hotel in hong kong hes the guy who told him not to go to brazil or ecuador but to russia
something has to change with russia and ukraine  not everything youve heard about the sea of azov incident is true    
    you can get your passport checked by police as proof of id rather than as a passport its just that there are no fixed control points at internal borders
  yeah thats not a source thats a conspiracy theory      and your point is if someone is seeking protection from the united states russia is a fairly good option
the only people claiming the story is false are the russian media right wing media in britain that are enemies of the guardian and right wing media in america who have a vested interest to protect trump ill wait for someone who doesnt have skin in the game to confirm it    also we already havea wikileaks connection to trump via stone and his coconspirators so this who story would be a moot point if it was faked
  there are far better countries than russia to seek asylum in that dont have an extradition treaty with the us the point is that the usual journalistic hack sources are coming out of the woodwork to do damage control on this because it would look horrible if the white house staff did it themselves
  probably because it didnt happen  manafort visiting assange i agree    also greenwald has been on the russian payroll since he delivered ed snowden to them  since i know and you know you cant prove this should i even ask for a source or should we just skip to making fun of you for spreading disinformation      the source was how he turned anticlinton and was piling on all the other fake news about her during the 2016 election look at his archives for yourself theyre all protrump anticlinton stories before 2017  nice conspiracy theory there cenk      do you not know greenwalds role in the snowden affair  you clearly dont but humor us anyway with your totally not batshit versiopn of said events    hes the guy who told him not to go to brazil or ecuador but to russia  because russia is the only one of these three countries that doesnt extradite to the usa you fucking dullard
  few sources have outright claimed that the story is false but many journalists have said that they would like to see corroborating information before accepting its claims      there are far better countries than russia to seek asylum in that dont have an extradition treaty with the us   such as
  because russia is the only one of these three countries that doesnt extradite to the usa you fucking dullard  thats wrong and youre probably glen himself      ecuador for one which is why assange is in their embassy right now
    so its almsot as if manaforts three passports not disclosing a visit to the united kingdom means nothing
  glenn goto bed
  thats wrong and youre probably glen himself  do you actually believe the words that come out of your mouth    ecuador for one which is why assange is in their embassy right now  assange hasnt openly committed massive breaches of united states national security law while it appears that he has been indicted for something the pentagon papers case nominally protects him for publishing leaked documents provided to him by third parties its infinitely easier to resist us pressure on assange because he hasnt actually been accused of any crimes other than the swedish rape one
  i wonder if manafort has already been buttfucked in jail its a shame for donald though hes got such tiny hands that it must be difficult to keep a firm grip on the soap         you can keep ignoring the evidence that just keeps piling up and up but its just going to make the inevitable emergence from cognitive dissonance that much harder i mean holy shit were not even talking about how manafort has spent the last fifteen years working for proputin politicians or how michael cohen perjured himself to congress because of trump tower russia im beating a dead horse here but if this was a totally innocent real estate project why break the law to cover it up there isnt a preponderance of evidence yet for manafort meeting with assange but thats hardly what the case is resting on right now the link from donald to stone to assange to putin is quite clear as is the link from donald to flynn to putin from donald to don jr to kislyak to putin and from donald to putin directly remember when he gave the russian ambassador classified information about a russian enemy israel in the oval office and when he stood on stage and agreed with putin against the united states
  thats wrong and youre probably glen himself  thats 100 correct and youre definitely a dullard          ecuador for one which is why assange is in their embassy right now  ecuador isnt not extraditing him because they dont they granted him political asylum     you are a fucking dullard stop posting
  manafort had a private prison suite when he was first in jail and was later moved to solitary confinement
  link to article about cohen  long rambling paragraph about cohen  youre in the wrong thread      you can keep ignoring the evidence that just keeps piling up and up  this thread is quite literally the opposite directly addressing and presenting evidence and debunking bad journalism your tears and irrelevant tangent are are noted though 
  hey idiot  
  
  youre missing the point of why it was ever attractive to him to start with
  whats your point it would have been a poor choice for him to go to ecuador given that they eventually bent to us pressure its not reasonable to argue that at the time snowden should have gone to ecuador because he didnt know for a fact that they were going to chance his minds the fact remains that ecuador was not the correct option for snowden and he made the right decision with respect to his own subjective wellbeing by choosing russia
  greenwald is a rare example of a lefitst useful idiot on the russian payroll like jill stein and that the intercept is a shit source
  greenwald is a rare example of a lefitst useful idiot on the russian payroll  assumes facts not in evidence
  it does  it shows negative proof  now do you have any positive proof to present  something like footage from an airport showing him arriving there  his signature at the ecuadorian embassy as he had to sign to get in  a named source
  i have a 197 year old newspaper with a history of reputable accurate reporting and a jaded exemployee who was upset he didnt get a bonus for being given the snowden story glenn greenwald siezing on this story is proof its true
  were you even alive when glenn greenwald was widely considered a respected reporter
  so are there wmds in iraq
  no one has ever been alive when glenn greenwald was a respected reporter
  so hes won a bunch of journalism awards including an actual pulitzer prize for doing oh literally nothing    its glad to know that /news/ is full of retards who first gained political sentience in the year 2015
  youre leaving out that he moved to brazil and became a tinfoilfag
  you claimed that he had literally never been a respected reporter ever
whats a locker
bump
  since when does your locker drive itself home and back
  thatsnot a bad idea actually    by middle school id swapped to a roller backpack because i had to tote around five textbooks every day and the damn thing weighed twenty or thirty pounds it was that perfect storm of lots of knowledge with no digital learning    nowadays in the us most homework is digital which means you can do it on your home pc or laptop but it used to be bad
  fuck books and digital we need to mix trade and grade school so the future generation of children actually know what theyre doing as they learn instead of trying to figure it out after a decade of talking nothing
  most trades require a working understanding of mid level mathematics and a basic understanding of finance which is a midlevel mathematics discipline youre going to start in middle school at the earliest and at this stage the brain is also at the critical spot to pick up language comprehension which means english lit and lote classes this on top of the history stuff that is required for any american citizen to have the basic understanding of what our country is and why it is    i had shop courses in middle school but nothing that was usable as a trade there just isnt time    in high school there was more room mainly because you had electives i picked up shop courses because i loved working big machines i still had to go to college/trade school to learn how to use a standing mill
  theres plenty of time what im suggesting is that just like in kindergarten from grades 1 through 12 every class should have a handson approach like science does and do to rework the entire curriculum away from reading and writing as means for learning its not memorization is only helpful for things like the times table why do we pretend that everyones going to become some bookwrite with all the damn essays they have kids do instead of more projects and less tests  my salt is showing
  yea im sure every 10 year old grows up knowing he wants to be a plumber or an electrician you tradefags need to kill yourselves you may not realize it but education does have value for a lot of people plenty of people still become artists journalists mathematicians teachers translators or anything else their ambition guides them to do thanks in part to the education they recieved in grade school kids dont need to be funneled into manual labor just because thats the only way you can imagine to make money
  im in this early college program in the 13th grade super senior so i have to carry 40 lbs of stuff a lot of it isnt books either its food and pencils and other stuff i need to survive
  it is anon    i actually agree with you that inclass tests are junk and handson training is more effective than memorization unless your student is a bookworm i was  i read my history texts for fun hes not going to pick up a whole lot in the time he has    this doesnt mean you should change what he is learning of course and that limits you as painful as it is math is math  you learn your times tables so that you can multiply in your head in later years how often do you do brain math in your daily life those dumblooking early exercises are mental weightlifting  working up to the inyourhead calculations you do as an adult    and because its math you cant really do it handson maybe basic arithmetic but beyond that its paper and pencil it sucks but there really isnt a better way as far as i know
  get a roller bag before you get scoliosis
  if carrying 40lbs is too much for an adult man then he isnt cut out for this world
  adult  hes a hs senior not a 25year old trade worker hes either 18 or 19 thats not an adult
  im 19 which is technically a young adult and it only gets annoying when i have to run
  at 18 years old people in the military carry 100lb packs for dozens of miles 40lbs isnt that heavy and at 18/19 youre about strong as youre ever gonna be rolling bags are for homos
  stop the moto routine kid  literally every vet i know and i work for the military as a civilian employee so i know a lot of them has fucked up knees or a slipped disc or some form of long term damage to their skeleton all of them associated with long distance running under load and these are men in their thirties    you are not going to tell me that the human body is good to ruck the loads that service asks you to do i have seen the results
  thats how it feels now sure but its going to do some long term damage    and a roller bag is just easier anyway you cant look stupid if youre walking with your back straight while all your classmates are hobbling around like quasimodo
  i didnt say its good for you im saying carrying a 40lb bag for a 10 to 20 minute walk to school/class isnt that bad if youre a healthy young male i did it all the time in college and have no back problems there are plenty of well designed bags that make the load easy to carry
  they are improving the designs yeah  ive seen that bag that has a stabilizer track on it so it doesnt bounce while you move pretty damn cool    of course they wont have that in india
  thats exactly why i mentioned it honestly besides that what good did you really make of everything else do you see the point im getting at
  what do you consider young i remember being forced to carry 5 text books plus notebooks and supplies in 4th grade
  what textbooks did you have in fifth grade that were that heavy
  im not that anon
  this is that guy who is a super senior and i had the same thing  also the teachers would go crazy and overflow us with homework on nights that were supposed to have some special occasion like the fall festival
didnt kids used to carry a few books that were bound by a belt back like a century ago
  yes and people have been complaining about it since
  also the teachers would go crazy and overflow us with homework on nights that were supposed to have some special occasion like the fall festival  this should be a crime    oh hey youve got five days off five days worth of homework kiddies
  dumbass i bet your parents put you through school     not everyone comes out of highschool knowing what they want to do and most people need to support themselves on more than minimum wage to have enough free time for school
  and being forced to choose a trade at freshman year helps you with this problem how
  cant have it be a crime we need to get people used to having to work even when theyre not working so we can beat those evil commies into space  also cut space funding we need more money for education so they get more homework
  having four years of welding or plumbing carpentry erc under your belt can float you through life till you decide what you really want to do and get you through college with a lot less debt for misc things you are already handling for yourself like a place to live
  reading and writing and essays are absolutely worthwhile over several years only a handful of kids including myself were actually proficient with any of those things    have you ever heard someone struggle reading a short story page in the english textbook holy shit its awful even during senior year it was terrible kids these days just barely know how to read above an eighth grade level
  thats why some people join the military unfortunately the majority in the us anyhow are non eligible for service
  poo in book bag

  press s to shit on their graves ladies and gentlemen
that is definitely not the way to handle a porn website
  problem is that tumblr thinks they arent a porn site when whats basically keeping them afloat is all the porn you can find there
  when i first heard of tumblr 6 or 7 years ago it was just a blog site once people migrated to other sites i guess porn was the only thing left this certainly is the nail in the coffin for the site though
porn is the only redeemable aspect of tumblr this wont go well
  when i first heard of tumblr 6 or 7 years ago it was just a blog site    its not a blog site i always thought it was basically livejournal but for spastic attention whores with poor understandings of science philosophy and politics i know a lot of webcomics use it too but thats often the same thing
  i cant tell if your question is rhetorical or not anyway the first time i saw someone on tumblr was back in like 2011 or 2012 in my community college library funnily enough it was a black dude and not a blue haired feminist
reminder tumblr is part of yahoo and yahoo is now part of verizon they have all the reason to ban people from using tumblr for what theyre currently being used even if it mean getting rid of all its users  read also  nobody at yahoo understood tumblr why marissa mayers big bet on tumblr never panned out
good    now maybe these otherkin asswipes and sexually frustrated fatasses can get a life and stop reblogging
its really difficult to see how expelling fandoms from a site made entirely of sjws and fandoms will improve the site or make it more popular in pretty much any way
  well thats obviously not their goal to make the site more popular
  im pretty sure porn was on there from the start honestly you can have blogs about porn and you can also have blogs with pornographic images on them      they also have all the reason in the world not to given that this is basically going to kill whatever small amount of profitability tumblr ever had
  they care more about themselves than what they own whether thats justified is another separate question
maybe theyre trying to rebrand tumblr into a serious social media player instead of being that one place where all the underaged girls deranged fans and sjws hang out
  verizon yahoo  serious social media player  yeah that would be really serious
  theyll just come back here the other strange corner of the internet
    tumblr has very successfully made itself a big player by marketting towards a specific niche its famous enough to have their own subculture and stereotype much like 4chan and reddit  by pretty much kicking out half the site the users arent going to evaporate they will just migrate to other sites   its not going to work it took a long time for them to cultivate that corner of the net and its not easy to build it back up
  i cant tell if your question is rhetorical or not    not rhetorical i dont know enough about tumblr to know if my impression of it is accurate or not that its apparently full of porn was news to me
  except theyre not making money from tumblr now despite the size of the user base in the niche they occupy and then given corporate culture of verizon and corporate culture if yahoo i very much doubt whether they care about any niche they currently occupies instead of trying to become a mediocre mass market product
twitter pixiv and newgrounds are already picking up the slack of porn artists tumblr will be reduced to the echochamber its been marketed for the last years
wtf is tumblr
    shitposter telling rebloggers to get a life
tom inglesby the director of the johns hopkins center for health security in baltimore said that if the ebola outbreak becomes endemic in the congos north kivu province it shows weve lost the ability to trace contacts stop transmission chains and contain the outbreak in this situation ebola could spread which could negatively impact both trade and travel according to a report by beckers hospital review    the problems with containment of this particular ebola outbreak stem from the fact that the disease is spreading in an active war zone with several armed groups attacking health officials government aids and civilians some civilians with ebola have refused treatment and health care workers are still being infected about 60 to 80 percent of new cases do not show an epidemiological link to prior cases    the daily rate of new ebola cases had more than doubled in early october in addition there is community resistance and a deep mistrust of the government as the raging outbreak continues to spread through an active war zone     i do think this is one of the challenges well have to see whether were able to contain control and end the current outbreak with the current security situation or do we move into the idea that this becomes more of an endemic ebola outbreak in this region which weve never really confronted dr redfield told the washington post    
 60 to 80 percent of new cases do not show an epidemiological link to prior cases  time to head for the bunkers
  the one disease i fear is unstoppable and evolving i warned people but they never listen now look at us
  are you african the disease is easily containable if it doesnt break out in destructive shitholes that actively avoid treatment and attack helpers
  kek why are african countries always killing aid teams fucking witchdoctors
  cool i expect no actual footage of this taking place and plenty of broll of black people on cots in tents
    do you people not remember when they found ebola in dallas
  do you bot remember those it was instantly quarantined and didnt spread passed those who are required by law to help
oh hell yeah
legit    
i say let it spread freely in africa so it rids us of a whole bunch of moneysucking niggers
  the one disease i fear is unstoppable and evolving  theres many diseases that are heading in that direction people better hope their immune systems are strong because antibiotics are going to be useless eventually
  says anon moments before ebolaresistant superniggers invade europe
  we gotta stop europeans from traveling now that i remember about eball
we love you ebolachan
  antibiotics against virus  shouldve shut the fuck up instead of trying to sound smart
  this sounds really plausible unfortunately
  i was talking about diseases other than ebola that may eventually be untreatable you realize that bacteria causes disease yes you know mrsa gonorrhea borrelia burgdorferi c diff all of which are very resistant to antibiotics
ebola chan answered our prayers  soon ot will all be over   glorious sacrefices will be made
  dont joke /pol/ was tempting fate by initiating those rituals blood magic is scary shit
itt there are people working in africa that ask for help and money due to diseases while secretly spreading them
  africa is a radical problem that requires a radical solution
  do you think the niggers read our forums and know our aid workers are spreading the disease deliberately
    dont they attack helpers quite often
i like how the ambrosia vaccine doesnt provide immunity just delayed death just like real vaccines
  bacteria causes disease  bullshit      unlike pasteur who spawned a mentality of fearfully killing germs to prevent disease béchamp essentially understood the balance of and the importance of the environments we create with foods that our internal systems either support or dont support disease    
  yes but just as often as they are spreading the disease not curing it mobs pop up there are also they are secretly vampires and they are here to steal our cocks mobs
  they are here to steal our cocks  that actually makes a lot of sense israel has often been caught in the illegal organ trade and replacing a limp circumcised cock that can only feel 10 of sex with a working one and possibly bigger to boot has to be a strong motive
i just hope it reaches a major african city and doesnt fizzle out like the last time
  africa    thousands upon thousands of years of time to develop and theyre still assraping monkeys and catching ebola
  itt there are people working in africa that ask for help and money due to diseases while secretly spreading them    if only this were true
  you can get it from bites too
  lmao
  you have to be joking youre being unbelievably pedantic now i guess you should contact the cdc to explain how infectious disease is a scam why dont we infect you with hiv or gonorrhea to test your hypothesis sound reasonable
  whaleto/b/hivhtml  the techniques of the hiv test have not been standardised and the  magnitude and the consequences of interlaboratory variations have not been  measured its results require interpretation and the criteria for this  interpretation vary not only from lab to lab but from month to month  new england journal of medicine 317238241    positive tests do not prove aids or preaids disease status nor that these  diseases will be acquired manufacturers of western blot hiv test kit    in the general population which the cdc estimates to have a prevalence  of hiv infection of 0006 using a test with a specificity of 99 the  result is that 94 of all positives will be false positives christine  johnson continuum magazine april 1994    a study last month by congresss office of technology assessment found  that hiv tests can be very inaccurate indeed for groups at very low risk   people who dont use iv drugs or have sex with gay or bisexual men  9 in  10 positive findings are called false positives indicating infection where  none exists us news and world report nov 23 1994    hiv tests are notoriously unreliable in africa a 1994 study published in  the journal of infectious diseases concluded that hiv tests were useless  in central africa where the microbes responsible for tuberculosis malaria  and leprosy were so prevalent that they registered over 70 false  positive sacramento bee october 30 1994
  your entire defense is false positives really so when someone takes a pregnancy test and it says theyre pregnant when they really werent that means all pregnancies are bullshit your argument is completely senseless
hivpositive response means nothing of any relevance to health it can be  triggered by vaccination malnutrition ms measles influenza papilloma  virus wart epstein barr virus leprosy glandular fever hepatitis  syphillis over sixty different conditions    the great hiv/aids lie was created by robert gallo who was found guilty of  scientific misconduct instead of trying to prove his insane theories  about aids to his peershe went public then with the help of margaret  heckler former head of health and human services who was under great  political pressure to come up with an answer to aids the infamous world  press announcement of the discovery of the socalled aids virus came about  this great fraud is now responsible for the deaths of hundreds of  thousands it was no accident that gallo just happened to patent the test  for hiv the day after the announcementgallo is now a multimillionaire  because of aids and his fraudulent aids test dr willner    by grouping together 25plus different diseases and other allied factors   pneumonia herpes candidiasis salmonella various cancers infections  vaccine and antibiotic damage amyl nitrate damage malnutrition etcand  particularly in africa tb malaria dysentery leprosy and slim disease   and calling the whole thing an aids epidemic a multibillion  dollar/pound aids research and treatment racket has been created    glaxo wellcomes lethal drug azt in combination with the diagnosis of  hivpositive and the prediction stated or implied that  you will die of  aids is one of the great pieces of medical black magic  voodoo medicine  at its most impressive  people have committed suicide on the basis of the  ludicrous diagnosis    considering that there is little scientific proof of the exact linkage of  hiv and aids is it ethical to prescribe azt a toxic chain terminator of  dnato 150000 americans  among them pregnant women and newborn  babies  repg gutknecht
  by grouping together 25plus different diseases and other allied factors  pneumonia herpes candidiasis salmonella various cancers infections  but infections dont exist remember herpes pneumonia candida salmonella all fiction
  nice comprehension   bacteria is not the cause of disease / pathogens dont exist
  so youve never had a cold or the flu in your entire life you must be a modern miracle whats your explanation for the sudden spread of disease if not for pathogens
  nice quads ever heard of famine yeah just scraping by on only bugs meat bark or low quality carbs does a number on a populaces immune systems now read up on those links about pasteur vs bechamp or fuck off
  even people with healthy immune systems get sick the symptoms are caused by the healthy immune response the difference between a healthy immune system and a suppressed immune system is that the person with the healthy immune system will have an acute bout of illness and return to good health whereas the person with the suppressed immune system will have a dragged out illness that could potentially be fatal    do you know what disease means again it feels like youre trying to argue semantics and poorly at that like you dont actually understand whats being discussed
  by the way im totally fucking aware of the interplay of bacteria fungus viruses and our immune system my original argument in this thread was that excessive antibiotic use has made things worse by making bacteria more virulent however to suggest that a healthy immune system is totally immune from all pathogens is retarded
      thats wrong in a completely healthy body no pathogen based infection can take hold these are the people who never experience cold or flu symptoms despite living in the proximity of people who arent  mystery diseases like cancer cannot occur in a healthy alkaline environment it isnt enough to simply believe one is healthy when their diet is mainly meat and carbs which leads to micro nutrient deficiency all the other mystery diseases alzheimers ms autism are not caused by pathogens nor genetics but pervasive pollutants which are present nearly everywhere today to varying degrees namely mercury aluminum and lead
  in a completely healthy body no pathogen based infection can take hold  and then hiv exploits your perfect immunity and blows that idea right into flat earth territory
  you mean azt
  thinking azidothymidine can destroy immunity  heres a you for the keks
   excessive antibiotic use has made things worse by making bacteria more virulent  ebola is caused by a virus antibiotics are useless    you can saturate a patient with every antibiotic known to man and hes still just as dead     the only thing you can do is replace the fluids lost by excessive bleeding and wait it out
  thats wrong in a completely healthy body no pathogen based infection can take hold  that is the dumbest thing ive ever heard please provide me evidence theres people who have never been sick in their life    when you feel sick its not due to the infection its due to the immune response feeling awful with the flu is a pretty damn good thing as it means your immune system is actually fighting the infection you only run into problems when your body cant eradicate the infection in a timely manner    you seem to be confused some people can be exposed by those with a cold or flu and not become ill theres two reasons one theyd already been exposed to something similar in the past which means they were sick in the past and theyve developed antibodies or two the pathogen is basically crowded out and has nowhere in the body to take hold most often the nasal passages or the digestive system this latter point is a reason why excessive antibiotic use can be problematic as it allows other pathogens to take root which arent susceptible to the antibiotics however this is all moot when the pathogen is injected straight into the bloodstream via needles or insects bypassing our friendly floral defenses    mystery diseases like cancer cannot occur in a healthy alkaline environment  good lord i hope you dont believe in the alkaline diet or paleo you mentioned carbs earlier youre hitting all of their talking points plenty of microbes do quite fine across the ph spectrum      ebola is caused by a virus antibiotics are useless  im well aware of that the conversation about ebola led to conversation about other infectious diseases were heading towards strains of bacteria that are completely unresponsive to the antibiotics we currently have their are antiviral compounds but pharmaceutical companies havent found a great way to package and market them
  feeling awful with the flu is a pretty damn good thing  anon i had to be hospitalized from a 104 degree fever last christmas i think you might be full of shit
  no because then you could get it from spit
  fever is a classic unspecific immune response its relatively effective at killing microbes faster than it disables the host but some of them are quite durable and would win the tug of war  you usually want to let a weak fever work its effects but strong fevers are dangerous and should be treated  its still a good thing in the sense that your basic immunity is working properly
  im imagining a balding 57 jewish bank manager with a massive bulge and a shriveled cock in a jar strung around his neck each arm around a woman half his age
  just asking are you just shitposting but actually believe the assraping part      the disease is easily containable if it doesnt break out in destructive shitholes that actively avoid treatment and attack helpers    ebola is endemic to the region it will always exist there
from the book of revelations  so the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth and loathsome malignant sores broke out on those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image    what did jesus mean by this
also why did jews conspire to kill jesus
  so then the western world practises safe hygiene like always and everyone else who doesnt want to live just simply continues shitting in the streets and licking their shit fecale covered palms and dies off simple its not like ebola is even that easily transmittable in well off places
    update    
  im sorry you felt awful you survived though awesome theres a belief that a fever can kill but im skeptical i suspect deaths from an aggressive immune response are more often caused by dehydration but yeah an extremely aggressive immune response requires care to be taken
   no because then you could get it from spit  you could ebola works through attacking the capillary wall tissue the victim bleeds out the mouth nose eyes ears and yes the anus too     the thing that makes the virus a bitch is the low number of viral particles needed for infection for something like a cold its on the order of millions hand washing is usually enough to prevent most transmission for ebola were talking hundreds of particles are enough one drop of saliva mixed with infected blood is enough
  the victim bleeds out the mouth nose eyes ears and yes the anus too  that sounds fun
why contain it
  a strong fever kills you the same way it kills pathogens  our enzymes dont work so well when its too hot fucking the entire metabolism  if you stay feverish too long it will do more harm than good and you want to stop wasting your energy both generating that heat and having to sweat it out  thats why we made medicine to block the whole process
latest numbers as of 11 november 2018  deaths 209  total cases 333    
good luck ebola
the future is bleak
  deaths 209    215 now
i wonder which will burn out first the outbreak or the armed gangs keeping the red cross from treating people    inb4 the gangs die of ebola
update        as of 20 november 386 evd cases 339 confirmed and 47 probable including 219 deaths 172 confirmed and 47 probable1 have been reported
  219 deaths  already up to 231 after 3 days
    the democratic republic of congos deadly ebola outbreak is now the second largest in history behind the devastating west africa outbreak that killed thousands a few years ago according to the world health organization who    dr peter salama whos emergencies chief called it a sad toll as dr congos health ministry announced the number of cases has reached 426    that includes 379 confirmed cases and 47 probable ones    so far this outbreak declared on august 1 has caused 198 confirmed deaths dr congos health ministry said
christmas is going to be grand this year
  /news/  post about ebola  use single image in entire thread to post ebolachan    finally ffs people this is how you report ebola
    deaths 245  total cases 426
  im dreaming of a red christmas
  465 lethality  come on ebola you can do it
ebola will cleanse africa in your lifetime
  i wish
thats a pathetically low death count viral pneumonia causes several times more victims in every country and no ones raising a fuss about it
  expose your self to both let us know whats worse
  viral pneumonia if only because it flourishes in the first world
  deaths 245    255 now
  260  is it accelerating
  
there are already several things like this /jp/ has an onahole general that is worth checking out if youre a virgin and plan to be one forever it is so worth this looks like shit though
in one week president trump has transformed from a nonstop campaignrally machine to a nearly invisible figure communicating mostly by tweet trump returned late sunday from a 43hour trip to paris where he sat out some big events and clashed with allies and on monday he ended his public day at 1003 am skipping the veterans day trip to arlington national cemetery every president since at least john f kennedy has made to lay a ceremonial wreath on tuesday trumps only public appearance was a brief showing at a diwali ceremony and he had secretary of state mike pompeo meet with visiting king abdullah ii of jordan    trump sent vice president mike pence to the asia pacific economic conference apec summit typically attended by presidents potentially offending asian leaders canceled a trip to colombia and opted not to visit the us troops he sent to the usmexico border to protect a caravan he seems to have forgotten about maybe trump is just tired but white house officials and trump allies say hes in a particularly sour mood amid a string of late democratic victories in areas where he campaigned looming investigations by house democrats expected indictments from special counsel robert mueller and bad press from his france trip    trump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment the los angeles times reports citing multiple administration sources behind the scenes they say the president has lashed out at several aides sketching a picture of a brooding president trying to decide who to blame for republicans election losses even as he publicly and implausibly continues to claim victory    its like an episode of maury one former trump aide told politico the only thing thats missing is a paternity test you can read more about trumps five days of fury at the washington post and los angeles times and politico has more on the mood in the white house    
 a picture of a brooding president trying to decide who to blame for republicans election losses  he only has himself to blame but trump is a whiny little bitch who never takes responsibility its incredible how hes managed to manipulate his sheep followers into thinking hes an alpha and strong    the arizona senate loss was entirely trumps fault for pushing out flake who would have been a shoo in if he ran for reelection and a rubber stamp for his agenda  
  ive heard that flake is planning to run in 2020 and peel away some of trumps votes which would be delicious if true assuming trump makes it to 2020 of course what do you think of that
  flake has moments where it appears he has a consequence like when he asked for the fbi to look into kavanaugh after he was confronted by the rape victims in the elevator after he was going to rubber stamp him  if there are any real patriots left in the republican party one of them would run as a third party candidate to be a spoiler candidate against trump but like flake bending over for kavanaugh in the end i dont see anyone actually doing it
so how long before he pulls a howard hughes and goes completely batshit
  depends entirely on whether he runs as a republican or an independent    if he runs as an independent hell peel away electoral votes from the president and likely sink him vs his democratic challenger if trump wasnt already doomed    if he runs as a republican trump will shitstomp him core republicans who are the ones that vote in the primary are super fond of trump
  is there anything that would restrict him from running as an independent or is he free to do that
  there is nothing to stop someone like flake from running as a third party candidate outside of the money and base voter support required to get on the ballot and youll know trump will do everything in his power to stop that
  none at all there is no independent party so running as an independent allows you to skip the primaries most candidates dont do it because willing a primary nets you the party loyalist voters which comprise something like a third of the electorate and shitton of campaign money furthermore most candidates for public office cut their teeth in one camp or the other so the only guys who run as independents are disillusioned members of one party who also find the other party unnaceptable    jeff flake will not be president but he m8gjt be able to ruin trump
  if he runs as a republican trump will shitstomp him core republicans who are the ones that vote in the primary are super fond of trump  it should be noted that the reason why republicans are fanatical supporters of trump still is because all of the moderates left the party leaving only the absolute extremist wing left just to show how bad its gotten in the midterms republicans made up the third largest voting bloc behind independents and democrats so independents outvoted republicans in the midterms       this there is no way flake would win the presidency his only objective would be would be to stop trump and cripple the current republican party in order to see a cause a realignment to see the moderates retake power from the power vacuum trump leaves   im sure this also banks on the fact that trump will either have been killed or in jail before the 2024 election due to the fact he would be able to run again
  all of the moderates left the party leaving only the absolute extremist wing left  correct this is actually very very bad for the republicans because it means the primary and the general election ate now two fundamentally different races a candidate that wins the primary could get shitstomped in the general because his racist dog whistling might have galvanized his base but it turns off independents and leaning voters who would otherwise vote for him    this is what happened in a lot of house races in california its so severe that the california republican party is basically in a death spiral  democrats have a supermajority giving them singular authority over the budget
    thats funny i heard the same thing about john kasich
  again depends on whether he runs as a republican or an independent
  this primary trump is a waste of time unless they intend to then run as a third party candidate the the primary was strictly to build up an election infrastructure for the general
trump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment the los angeles times reports citing multiple administration sources    if you were wondering the la times piece literally says according to multiple administration sources they didnt cite shit they literally just making shit up now with unattributed but totally credible insider sources and people eating up this tabloid tier trash
  nice blog full of suppositions and unsourced hearsay not really what /news/ is made for though
  cope
    hi /pol/ damage control team who are we to believe you or the fact that trump is sulking and spiting in the face of the troops by refusing to honor them in france or at home on veterans day because hes butthurt over the fact the republicans and by proxy he lost the election
  who are we to believe speculation or speculation  hurr durr
  who are we to believe a source where trumps behavior confirms what theyre saying or trumps damage control team
  its a false dilemma believe neither because they both have zero credibility
  wrong one clearly has evidence to support them based on how trumps acting you just cant go nu huh and dismiss it because it makes your side look bad
  this is literally just a blog piece written by a tabloid /news/ is for citing your claims not making retarded orange man bad threads   brietbart has news pieces every single day saying insider sources tell us but never citing those claims no one uses them because theyre a fucking tabloid too     your posts reek of desperation
  wrong one clearly has evidence to support them based on how trumps acting   what evidence is that because the article literally just says insider sources tell us there is no statement from anyone or cited claims  half of the article is the the authors opinions based on their own feelings for example   in one week president trump has transformed from a nonstop campaignrally machine to a nearly invisible figure communicating mostly by tweet  which is an opinion this isnt an actual fact do you need to take the facts vs opinions thing on pbs website because you seem like a person who does
  insider sources are at least a rung above anonymous sources  but anonymous insider sources probably refer to someone who was working a drive thru window when the prez wanted a burger
  damage control team    im just trying to clear a few things up for the retards who are actually influenced by articles like this
fake totaly fake ass news i wouldnt wipe my ass with any of those rags reporting bullshit dream on fuckers 2020 trump 4 more years you ll see
          attempts to undermine the pillars of democracy by implying news magazines just lie about sources and make it up as they go along  implying an article written by a news magazine is not worthy of being on /news/
  criticize junk journalism  stop attacking the pillas of democracy shitlord    lul
  thanks for correcting the record
  well then what isnt junk journalism    so far all weve had is anything that criticizes the president is fake news doesnt really work as a definition of journalistic integrity now does it
  no one in the thread argued it was fake news because it was critical try to keep up
  thats what its really about though you tards always attack journalists for using anonymous sources when its a story that doesnt help your narrative but ignore the issue of anonymous sources when theyre used in a story you like anonymous sources isnt something liberal journalists use its something all journalists use its a nonsensical complaint to hide your obvious agenda
  anything that criticizes the president is fake news  whistle  strawman   topic reset to the spot of the foul  repeat 4th down
hes pouting like a child what a surprise
  in fact a protected source which is the journalistic phrase is a critical part of the process because we wouldnt get this info at all if it had to have a name attached to it thats how journalism has always worked
aww orange man sad
  sad
  trump isnt sad hes never sad this is fake news
  give me proof any information in the article is wrong  protip you cant
  trump is pissed at everyone and getting fatter
  why is trumps myspace status on the news forum
  hes the president his hair is newsworthy
  npcposting  cringe
  did you honestly expect anything different after voting for a reality tv star
  i didnt vote  for exactly this reason its just a high school popularity contest no one gives a shit about actual government and it really doesnt matter who wins since anything they do is either rolled back or rolled over when the next guy gets in office     if government mattered at all we wouldnt have gossip as news headlines
  both sides are the same  ah youre one of those    isnt it interesting how the people who say this always tend towards defending republicans though
    if there were anything wrong with this article it would have been deleted    im sure you already tried reporting it and it didnt work which is why you are now lashing out and trying to claim its not news
  your average high school unpopular dropout ladies and gentlemen
  he isnt sad he is just tactically bitching and moaning to own the libs
  i didnt vote  i know its trite but holy shit dude you are fortunate enough to be able to vote for your government vote
  i think its for the best that someone with an attitude like his isnt voting to decide the fate of our country no point wasting breath trying to convince him
  the week is less reliable than huffington post
   this article is legitimate since its reporting from valid sources and the white house hasnt been screaming fake news
the blue wave keeps crashing into republicans and sweeping them out to sea  
  i like seth meyers he actually tells the jokes with human cadence instead of feeling like hes reading them off a teleprompter i mean im sure he is but he hides it better than most plus his silly voices are entertaining
  got shamed into firing someone by his wife on twitter  ha
    i agree that saying insider sources is at best incredibly vague but the accusations coming from them seem to match up with his documented behaviour its not like theyre saying trump is ordering strippers to the white house and creating plans to build the death star theyre saying hes acting increasingly insular and bitter as his setbacks continue to mount which aligns perfectly with what someone like trump would do
  plus respectable news organizations that cite anonymous sources tend to have done their research and have good reason to trust said sources and are putting their own reputations on the line by citing these sources i find that most people attacking the idea attack it because they dont like whats being said and funnily enough have no problem believing anonymous sources from say alex jones even though nothing we have seen backs up anything alex jones sources have claimed
  fuck you man theyve got frog children in tubes and shit
  and theyve got chemicals in the tubes that turn the frickin frog children gay
you know whats amazing i havent seen a single conservative offer up any argument other than halfheartedly insisting that this was a completely normal loss they just keep hanging on to that same talking point repeating it over and over like a mantra    nevermind that if trump was as great as they claimed they wouldnt have lost seats at all bush didnt lose seats does this mean they admit that bush is better than trump
  this looks like a bait post but for those that took it seriously the only reason bush didnt lose seats in 2002 is because he was riding the 9/11 high and nobody wanted to vote against the partyeading the fight
  interesting because trump tried to pull the same thing with the migrant caravan and he still lost seats    maybe trump is just unpopular
  this is correct furthermore bush maintained the momentum in 2004 and gained more seats in the house and the senate    which makes the complete and utter reamings the gop received in 06 and 08 hilarious
  no wonder they keep pointing to obama and clintons midterms with the nothing to see here just business as usual angle because if you looked at bushs gains and how they didnt stop the republicans from getting destroyed later on then it really doesnt bode well for trump who gained a maximum of one senate seat and lost everything else in an economy where any other republican president would have done just as well as bush really says a lot when trump cant even be compared favorably to his own party
    the reason bush won was because he was much better at slimeing people one of the big reason republicans won in 2002 was because they politicized national security majorly with homeland security where they made it so that the department shit on its workers rights forcing democrats to vote against it on principle bush than said democrats were siding with the terrorists and the rest is history   bush and trump were the same just trump is direct in his slander and lies while bush was more insidious
  it would be most accurate to say that trump is surviving as a president because the economy is so good he has almost never been positively favored in polls no matter what he does even though the economy is doing better than it ever did under his predecessor this sort of economic condition allowed clinton to survive an extremely hostile congress    there is something to he said for personality  trump is a wholly unlikable figure but many americans vote with their wallets and dont give a shit how much of a slime he is as long as the economy is working its a solid survival strategyuntil the economy goes bad
  its amazing that bush has successfully managed to convince people he wasnt so bad despite being the guy who got america stuck in two pointless wars which are still not over among many other things appalling that michelle obama even gives him the time of day
  well he was professional     im not sure who was worse for the country bush maintained the dignity of the office but ruined the economy and embroiled the nation in war trump might have ruined the economy too soon to tell and has ruined our international image but at least were not in a new war or two
  bush is the type of guy who will stab you in the back with a smile on his face also because the media has a right wing bias they never held him accountable for all the shit he did to ruin the country you cannot tell me with a straight face that if 9/11 happened under a democrats watch everyone would be blaming the democrats for it even to this day     also as for dignity thats the glory of republicans you take down one and they will always find someone even worse to replace them with  well never find someone more corrupt and incompetent than reagan in comes gingrinch  well never find someone more corrupt and incompetent than gingrinch in comes bush  well never find someone more corrupt and incompetent than bush in comes palin and the tea party  ll never find someone more corrupt and incompetent than palin and the tea party in comes trump  which ever democrat takes charge after trump must rectify the mistake that obama made in not prosecuting his predecessors crimes because rule of law is meaningless if trump gets away with what he did when he can be prosecuted   but nixon  he was able to slither away with a pardon thats not going to happen with trump
  he was able to slither away with a pardon thats not going to happen with trump  heres my theory    because the senate isnt blue the dems have zero chance of really getting impeachment through as a result they wont try theyll investigate hold hearings expose everything but they wont actually try and push trump out    theyll let him die in 2020     the election of 2020 will be an utter slaughter if trump is still in office and everyone knows it a highly hostile senate map something like 1123 in favor of the dems and another 2 years worth of trump being trump combined with even less governmental process because now the budget actually has to be approved by the opposition and the current republican party literally does understand what bipartisanship is are going to make the biggest electoral knockout ever itll make the 2018 wave look like a splash in a bathtub    alternatively the republicans could oust trump themselves to try and control the damage this would effectively end them as a party  the only group of consistently loyal voters they have left white evangelical christians are fanatically devoted to trump and would desert them entirely it might be even worse    basically they have a choice between a fight to the death and suicide    and either way trump will never get away with it even if he somehow manages to avoid jail time via abuse of the pardon which incidentally will almost ensure a constitutional amendment making sure that will never ever work again his finances will be ruined and his name will be mud hell be effectively blacklisted as a name in business which is a fate worse than death for old money the one thing any man born rich fears above all else is being poor    there is no way out and he knows it somewhere deep inside he knows the only way to go is down
  he has almost never been positively favored in polls no matter what he does  shareblue detected
  there is no way out and he knows it somewhere deep inside he knows the only way to go is down  thats what makes trump a bigger threat than nixon nixon for his contempt for the rule of law and the constitutions was still an insitutionalist so when it was clear he wasnt going to win he backed down trump on the other hand would have no problem burning the country to the ground if it meant he could get away
      his aggregate approval rating has literally never passed above 50 only a few biased polls here and there break the fiftyfifty mark
  shareblue boogeyman  why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time
  i fucking love this quote it perfectly encapsulates whats wrong with the altright they will never be satisfied theyre like incels  permanently enraged at their own inadequacy
could a viable third party emerge in 2020
  facts  shareblue  go back to your hole
  depends on what you mean by viable    theres certainly a strong chance a third party representing the more moderate former republicans could form and do quite well but there is no possible way theyd win the election theyd simply act as a spoiler for trump and if that happened the aftermath would likely just be them reintegrating into the republicans rather than the start of a genuinely influential third party
  libertarians wont try to run
  of course they will but i doubt theyll do any better than in previous years and certainly not enough to be considered viable the same goes for greens
  no the election system makes it impossible for a third party to be viable the only time youll see one is if there is a realignment of one of the two parties major parties ie when the whigs broke into the republican and constitutional union   at this point all theyll do is act as a spoiler to stop trump although theres a chance theyre also hurt the democrats because it would siphon otes that would originally go to democrats but instead go to the third party republican candidate
  what is aleppo
  unlikely the spoiler usually grabs votes from the less popular candidate and trump isnot popular
  bush was a war time president during a time when war time meant something long as he didnt stoop to trump level periods of stupidity and tactics he wasnt going anywhere     06 and 08 were standard tide turnings and people getting fucking fed up with the war
  even in times of war the house still shifts it was because bush was the master of dirty politics that republicans gained seats in 2002 it was because republicans were so brazenly and openly corrupt that they got voted out in 2006 and republicans crashing the economy caused even bigger losses in 2008 obama being a weak leader and not putting his boot on republicans necks was why they were able to rebound in 2010
  bush was a war criminal during a time when being a war criminal meant something  awhat did you say
  i will say i do genuinely want to see trump lose in 2020 because if they force him out people will always say its a conspiracy and he would have won but if he were to genuinely lose while im sure there will be some stragglers who insist the election was rigged it will decisively show that nobody wants him and there will be four years worth of screencaps of people shouting eight years to laugh at the compilation image is going to be enormous    i do as always have a slight worry that hell pull off reelection but i was also anxious thinking that hed somehow hold on to the house and he wasnt even close to doing that so apparently they cant silence the voice of this many democrats
  it was really funny too that all the republicans running for reelection would only ever point at the economy they couldnt defend anything else trump did they just kept repeating but look at that economy and its not even trumps work its obamas amazing    i hope someday we get two democrats in a row so that a democrat finally gets to take credit for the good economy that a democrat created
  the best part is they couldnt even run on their tax cuts for billionaires because even their own voters realized it was a giant scam
  in the end they even abandoned that talking point when it became blindingly obvious the trump taxes werent working literally all they had to run on was immigration and dog whistling which is why fox news trumpeted the caravan nonstop and has dropped all segments about it since last tuesday
  anonymous unverifiable source  totally legit guiz i swear    this is why you get called npcs
  prob bc they have to put up with the lefts democrats bs about losing the election and about this russian shit so much  go independent
  the reform came closest in 1996 with ross perot at about 1/5th the popular vote which for a third party isnt that bad
  this is why you get called npcs  because youre an idiot who has no arguments and just repeats memes over and over again
  were not the ones using reddit articles as a source of shitposting anon
  sure you arent
  repeatedly calling other people npcs just makes me think that youre unaware of the irony of the insult
  needing the russians to steal the election for you
  i find that pointing this out never works on them either because theyre too stupid to understand it or genuinely believe that repeating it anyway is trolling people no wonder they lost the midterms
    wait people still unironically believe this despite knowing about 4chan    its common knowledge that the russian hackers were just pollacks on tor using russian proxies     we know it wasnt russia because it was literally us    where the fuck are all these newfags coming from top fucking kek
  its common knowledge that bullshit i read on /pol/ and have no evidence is true
  gaslighting the post  nice try /pol/ppet
        i was one of the people who participated lmao    this is hilarious you newfags are making me laugh all this shit we concocted and then the msm just says muh russia and redditors like you flock here in droves    my sides are in fucking orbit
  reddit spacing outside of op  not the the guy your talking to but holyshit you are the stereotype for /pol/posters
  i was one of the people who participated lmao  sure you were    i know it doesnt matter to you but to anyone else who is watching the discussion and might be fooled by this idiot id like to remind you that actual russians have been convicted over this anyone who tries to paint this as a 4chan thing is lying and desperate    and by the way if you were actually telling the truth and did participate in it admitting to it here would be an extremely stupid move because you just admitted to breaking the law on a site that the fbi is clearly watching closely is that really the path you want to go down hm
    reddit spacing is another nonmeme we made    we have had people posting this way since 2003
  he thinks im using my own connection    the keks keep coming
  2003  you werent even born yet
  so just to be clear you participated in hijacking the 2016 presidential election but are still stupid enough to admit to political sabotage on 4chan     you do understand that 4chan isnt truly anonymous right
314113  and people say ebaumsworld is dead  you wont get a you for stealing credit for something you had no part of
    wew lad you really dont get it do you    very few people actually did anything illegal most of the russia hullabaloo is in fact just propaganda and spread of information made highly effective through the internet basically russia along with 4chan and many others used the internet to spread altright propaganda much of which was intentionally forged to make it seem less so guess what most other countries and people with a political point did the same     for shits and giggles many pollacks went on tor / used russian proxies to spam facebook/twitter/etc with said propaganda    you didnt lose the election to russian hackers    you lost to fucking memesters pulling your chain    notice how much of the russiagate news doesnt actually include any concrete details you say muh russia stole election durr but what exactly very specifically did they actually conspire with trump to do you have absolutely no fucking clue lmao     so instead you keep using subjective statements such as they subverted our election process despite not actually having any idea what that even means     stay clueless newfaggot
  all this desperate damage control  lmfao
  but what exactly very specifically did they actually conspire with trump to do  hack into the dnc and release politically damaging material that benefited one candidate at the expense of another
    you missed the conspire with trump part
  russia if youre listening
    hahaha oh man    how did i predict you would state this exact line     any serious lawyer will explain to you why that was in no way incriminating the context doesnt actually admit collusion just a hope that the enemy of my enemy is my friend
  whats your idea of a serious lawyer
  actually taking that guy seriously    much of what he said was nonsense but come the fuck on dude if you arent a newfag you should be able to spot a trolling shitpost when you see one
  based on his spasms of genuine anger i get the impression hes one of those people who thinks hes an epic troll but also genuinely believes the shit he spews
  q predicted this
  weak sad
  nope as i said i go independent  im just tired of how they keep on with this
  on occasion one still hears about the russian investigation i have not payed much attention to the news in a few days or so it might have finally stopped
  the russia investigation is still ongoing but mueller doesnt leak so we know very little about what is going on with it    which is why people who say it hasnt found anything are full of shit we dont know what it has found yet    well hear about it when hes done no sooner
  supposedly hes dropped a court filing that days hell have something substantial in 10 days    or rather he dropped that2 days ago i think so 8 days some time within the next two weeks    hes the only guy i know who can generate hype with fucking court filings
  have you seen this      i hope eiding does that again with whatever we see next
  hahaha holy shit    the one thing missing from that was making him talk to raiden instead since all that info warfare would be 150 mgs2 material
  in case you missed the subtext i was calling him a fucking retard there isnt any question that /pol/ was proliferating memes for propaganda only that hes stupid for admitting to a crime
  still dont get it do you    didnt admit to any crime because spreading propaganda isnt a crime if you genuinely believe it is youre a retard should all the left wing news sources that took trumps words out of context to make them seem like something else go to jail no how about all the outlets that spun his comment about illegal immigration and dishonestly spun it to be about all immigrants which is still done to this day and you probably believe    democracy is only as good as the information people have access to with 90 of the media brainwashing the public with cucked shit nonstop we simply decided to even the score thats not a crime dipshit its called freedom of speech you lost and you cant accept that so instead you assume that trump admin must have conspired with russia to hack the election despite having no agreed upon definition of what that even fucking means pathetic
  just about any of them if they arent in the mood to blow hot air and are seriously considering if they have a case    there are thousands of leftwing prosecutors in this country and yet not one actually put forth the effort to incriminate trump when he said that
  hes a sitting president different rules
  he wasnt the president when he said that he held zero political positions and was one of the most hated people by the establishment at the time if there was a case in his words do you seriously think they would not have dogpiled him right then and there they didnt because the rest of his speech showed it was in the context to how he believes the dnc is hiding key information from the public and he just wanted it to come to light if you had actually watched the whole thing instead of just the media spin you would have already known that and already understand why he didnt get put in jail for it but thanks for the laugh by literally repeating a huffington post talking point
  the point being made is that if we now received information that cast such remarks in a different light and we might just we would not be able to do anything about it because the president may only be impeached  nothing else
  the point being made is that if we now received information that cast such remarks in a different light and we might just  we most likely wont  we havent yet and the longer we dont the more its more likely it is we never will because it most likely doesnt exist  because the only reason its relevant as a concept is an all but debunked conspiracy theory
  flake is a neocon so virtually a democrat hes also as corrupt as mccain was so its a great thing hes gone however trump is an absolute bitch for not doing anything about the dems stealing the az senate race and trying to steal fl and ga races
  where the fuck are all these newfags coming from top fucking kek  you need to work on using 4chan colloquialisms more naturally ivan
  following election law  stealing
  basically russia along with 4chan and many others  basically you and many others were a tool used by russian officials   to carry out their agenda while leading you to believe that was your agenda as well and for what all the keks   pathetic
  flake is a neocon  hes a democrat  oh no hes retarded   neocons are republicans dumbass
  its why theyre called /pol/ppets
  i just wanted to put it into plan writing for him so that he would read it and has a moment of clarity to realize what a douche he is
  le epic mastermind still trying to pretend he didnt get outwitted  youre either spouting bullshit or admitting to a crime pick one and if you know whats good for you dont pick the latter
  its amazing how people were saying that the specter of bush was going to haunt the gop for years and then in comes donald fucking trump
  to be fair the specter of bush is certainly a good way to describe donald trump
    lul    4chan is an anonymous imageboard if /pol/ was somehow hijacked by 1337 russian hk0rz then /news/ would be too     the relationship between /pol/ and russia is much more simple than what you are thinking and can be summed up as the enemy of my enemy is my friend /pol/s general view is that russia takes a conservative stance on many issues and thus aids conservative parties under the hope that conservative parties will be less likely to slap russia with economic sanctions which if you payed attention to russia and read actual good sources such as meduza you would know this already as opposed to having your understanding limited by muh rushan hakorz stol da elecshun11oneone
  youre seriously still going after having been btfo god knows how many times good grief
  has yet to post a single shred of verifiable evidence  dood u been btfo
  has yet to post a single shred of verifiable evidence  but enough about you
so /news/ stands for newfags
  let me guess /pol/ got butthurt after the midterms and is trying to raid the board
    russells teapot
  4chans retard you
  you got it  funnily enough the fact you cant post images cripples /pol/s and their attacks on /news/ because most of their shitposting comes from memes they got from reddit or altright sites    even better since they only get their information from fringe conspiracy websites they cant even post threads here without immediately being idd as /pol/ppets
  i mean we for awhile had a resident ivan spamming prorussian antiukraine stories
  the image part in particular is so true one of /pol/s favorite tactics is to dump images either of black crime rates or of transgender people and without that all they can do is fire off links to said fringe conspiracy sites so theyre boned
  it does speak volumes when a group cannot argue their point on the basis of accepted fact
  the difference between /pol/ and /news/ is the community its much easier to brute force propaganda on /pol/ because you just need a few people to dog pile on someone and because of how heavy the traffic is reddits fault because /pol/ is a reddit board its hard to tell them apart    on the contrary with /news/ where its one of the slowest boards you people can easily sniff out both a dog pile or samefagging and call it out
  you people can easily sniff out both a dog pile or samefagging and call it out  everyone who disagreed with me was a samefag    done
  done fuck off back to /pol/ reddit then
wouldnt it be great if espy won one last blow to the senate when trump thought hed seen the last of it what do you think hed do
  doubtful republicans are running a protraitor racist mississippians arent under the same pressure as alabama was when they had to choose between a democrat and a disgraced theocratic pedophile    not enough white people would put americas interest above their partisan racism this time
  perhaps not but the state does have a lot of black people who were the ones to save the alabama election too
i want you to watch the doctor who episode rosa i want you to know that the man that assaulted ryan for merely addressing his wife was considered a fine upstanding gentleman of good character by his society i want you to realize that the average republican wants to return to that world to those values ditto for the cop that harasses the doctor    hillary clinton doesnt want that world rather openly shes spent her life trying to take it apart and shes an uppity woman who doesnt know her role they cant stand that
  not an argument
  i agree hillary clinton was the best we have a historic chance to right our wrongs in another years hillary for 2020
  the african american vote will be out in force like it was for alabama but espy still needs 25 of white mississippians to not be racist to have a chance     and supporting a racist is much easier to stomach than a pedophile even though a vast majority of republicans would still vote for a pedo
  didnt like a good 90 of white alabamans still vote for moore would espy really need as much as 25
  fake news if ive ever seen it maybe if obama or hillary worked half as hard as trump did dems wouldnt be in the position they are in
  hillary would have been a good president but i think theres little to no chance that republicans would have let her do anything in her first two years and without the shock from the 2016 elections i find it unlikely that dems would make significant gains in next two to four years either trump is an awful president but might inadvertently do some good
  you mean if they worked an hour and half a day they would get more done because trump only works 3 hours a day
  at this point people hate trump so much that hillary probably could win if she ran again but i still hope its a more leftwing candidate this time shell probably get primaried out by orourke
/news/ is the most cancerous board
  i want you to watch the doctor who episode rosa  yeah nah i think ill just watch vengeance on varos again
  sour grapes from someone who lost
  or it could have been all the voter fraud by the dems
state of art  macron is removing some taxes especially taxes of rich people but in the other hand lets taxes and taxes for middle class and poor people  actually poors people need to work more and more to finish the month and eat    facts  last week some manifestatin happened and people block road/street/shop the governement said  we ear the people but we wont change our mind about the taxes to make it simple  we dont care about you peasants  the people said  ok we will now all go to paris to make a big strike but pacifist because we want to be taking seriously    today  peaceful people were walking in the champs elysées when police start shooting gaz and water people were old women also   and now people starts blocking everything and making fire on the champs elysée revolution is starting again    and macron  just say  shame on you and congratulation to the police    sorry for my english  link  
  fuck you pierre you wanted a libshit pro (((eu))) merkel puppet and you got it now be happy suck off achmed like a good little cuck and shut up
  macron was always right wing you lobcock the french election was like voting between the right wing and the fascist right wing    if anything we should see this start happening in america once people realize how badly they got fucked by trumps economic policies and obamas economy wears off
french people are so stupid i heard these are all rural retards showing up in cities
  its going to happen in america too but well have guns you better listen to the white hicks you look down on when they come for you dont make sudden moves either
  this is what happens when retards cave in to the liberal ways of thinking they thought they got the right guy in for being so open minded but instead they got played by a total kike
  macron is nothing like an american liberal he is the french equivalent of mitt romney or jeff flake
  hes a racist too he tried to say african women should not be having many children    its not his business to tell africans how many kids they should have
  so a conservative in name only gotcha
  republicans are so far to the right they think conservatives like romney and flake arent conservatives  it shows how fringe right they are and why they get away with shifting the political spectrum so far to the right where were have a moderate conservative party democrats and a fringe right conservative party republicans
  economically speaking this is more cosnervative than liberal
the fascist loses the election  this must mean the liberal wins  this is why republicans are a cancer
  god you people are so fucking crazy i cant even believe it it would be amusing if it werent terrifying
  right wing  he was always pro eu and we got charming articles that gave us the meme of the radical centrist
  protests are not revolution unless they cause a regime change op  fucking attention whores
  if you are proglobalism you are not the right  thats not how words work you dont get to define them willy nilly i henceforth declare that the word for cat is now giraffe why just cause
  right wing  he was always a ultraliberal new world order pusher and never really hid what he would do electing le pen would have set the country on fire but voting macron if you werent rich was the most retarded thing you could do hes going to accomplish his mission and when hes done with us you can say hello to retirement at 99 years old and no social security only private insurances and so on oh and open borders for the entire 3rd world to come here kalergi plan and all that
  right now means cheeto dustcovered internet conspiracy theorist  got it
  im not sure whats your point exactly but im sure it makes sense for your npc script
  hes a racist too he tried to say african women should not be having many children  its not his business to tell africans how many kids they should have      someone has to they breed like rabbits
    you should have voted for lepen
  literally nothing you just said falls under any definition of right wing
  and obamas economy wears off  love this meme also the core do the issue in france is taxes on gas youre very misinformed
  black plague rages across the country  should have gone for aids instead  yeah no
  uhuhnun of that okeedokethese jobs arnt coming backuhyou didnt built that uhiran heres billions in cash help yourself uh uh
    european far right is like a bernie who just wants fewer immigrants
  basically this if you are european dont you fucking dare complain about eu cancer muslim rape gangs or mass immigration you had your chances but you still kept voting to get raped some more
  you know that the kalergi plan is to basically create a christian european state right this whole post is retarded
please please please let a revolution take hold cucks like macron deserve capital punishment
  you lobcock  best response
  that youtube hippie rations guy to have supplies of food  niiice
  there is so much ignorance in this post the character limit isnt enough  what are neoliberals
  he isnt a racist he is an environmentalist less people are better for the environment
  its hes buisness and france buisness from the moment this africans cry for coming in our country because they cant feed these kids    its our country buinsness at the moment they are crying in front of camera for get money from association because they cant buy food for their kids
  yes the leeches are complaining that the person theyre sucking blood from wants to tear them off
  americans are unable to escape their black and white thinking how can they theyve been brainwashed since birth
  muslim rape gangs or mass immigration  why are people like you so obsessed with gang rape the average person has more pressing matters in his daily life than being worried about ending up in your rape fetish scenario you sound like a /pol/ educated american though
  learn how to use big tent politics buddy
  big tent politics  my favourite is when dumb americans dont know how to use terms from established political economy but make up their own labels big tent politics and when they do attempt to use names they mess it up royally libertarian leftist antifascist liberal etc
  cant wait till all the regular americans who just want to be free and have a good life put all you leftright whatever you want to be called traitors in the ground so we can just get back to fucking living free again
  t enlightened libertarian with a phd in basic economics who knows the free market is the solution to all problems
    harm to communities and the economy is inevitable the administration says in a report released in the middle of black friday one democrat vows the days of denial and inaction  are over    federal scientists warned in a new report friday that changes in the climate will disrupt the economies of every region in the country in the coming years with costs threatening to reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually by the middle of this century    the message echoing decades of sobering conclusions from the worlds leading climate scientists is at odds with president donald trumps repeated scoffing at the idea of global warming and the administration chose to release it on black friday the busiest shopping day and one of the slowest news days of the year    but despite the timing the report is bound to energize the new class of progressive democrats set to take control of the house in january many of them led by incoming rep alexandria ocasiocortez of new york are already pushing for an expansive green new deal as one of the rallying cries the party would take into the 2020 campaign    democrats wasted no time in pouncing on the report    rather than hiding the facts president trump should heed the message of our nations preeminent climate scientists and experts said new jersey rep frank pallone who is in line to chair the house energy and commerce committee he added the days of denial and inaction in the house are over as house democrats plan to aggressively address climate change and hold the administration accountable for its backward policies that only make it worse    rep eddie bernice johnson of texas who is set to take the gavel at the house science committee said its time to start addressing the causes of the wildfires devastating storms coastal flooding and toxic algae blooms that plagued much of the us this year
that is why i have made climate change one of my top priorities for the committee going in to the next congress she said in a statement    the report which runs more than 1600 pages is the latest scientific work to warn that the planet is due to undergo devastating changes in the coming years that will permanently alter the coastlines worsen droughts and storms and foster the outbreaks of dangerous diseases as temperatures climb and while the report said quick action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution could dramatically affect the state of the planet by the end of the century many of the impacts the us will see in the next two decades appear irreversible    because several greehouse gases in particular carbon dioxide reside in the atmosphere for decades or longer many climateinfluenced effects are projected to continue changing through 2050 even if ghg emissions were to stop immediately said the fourth national climate assessment vol ii    while mitigation and adaptation efforts have expanded substantially in the last four years they do not yet approach the scale considered necessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy environment and human health over the coming decades the report said    the government officials who oversaw the report said there had been no political influence over its findings but they sidestepped questions about whether the white house sought to bury the report by releasing it in the middle of a long holiday weekend    we hope you will focus on the content of the report david reidmiller the director of the national climate assessment told reporters we think the report speaks for itself    progressives are pushing house democratic leader nancy pelosi to bring back a special committee on climate change and empower it to craft new legislation some senior democrats have opposed that move as an erosion of existing committees powers
ocasiocortez pressed that case in a tweet taking her democratic colleagues to task    people are going to die if we dont start addressing climate change asap its not enough to think its important we must make it urgent she wrote thats why we need a select committee on a green new deal  why fossil fuelfunded officials shouldnt be writing climate change policy    even before its release trump was attacking climate change science this week as cold temperatures bore down on the east coast tweeting on wednesday whatever happened to global warming weather and climate are different things scientists frequently point out    the white house tried to downplay the new reports conclusions friday claiming that they are largely based on most extreme scenarios the white house also noted that us greenhouse gas pollution has declined 14 percent since 2005  although the causes of that drop include trends that trump opposes such as a shift away from coalfired power plants    the new report which congress requires to be issued every four years was released by us global change research program it is the product of 300 scientific experts under the guidance of a 60member federal advisory committee and it was open to review by the public 13 federal agencies and a panel at the national academy of sciences    scientists who worked on the report such as andrew light a fellow at the world resources institute and professor at george mason university said it was the most comprehensive look at what various regions and economic sectors could expect to see    there is essentially no sector of the economy that will not suffer if we dont get a handle on climate change told a conference call with reporters    the report also makes it clear that the changing climate will cause the most suffering to poor areas minority communities and indigenous people said brenda ekwurzel the senior climate scientist at the union of concerned scientists
while the report doesnt offer policy recommendations the findings certainly make a convincing case that the white house should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger scale response is required to keep people safe she said    its the first climate report that is wholly a product of the trump administration a previous volume the climate science special report published a year ago was started under the obama administration but published under trump    last years report said the 18 degree fahrenheit increase in global temperatures since 1901 had lifted temperatures to their highest level in the history of modern civilization and that it was extremely likely human activities especially emissions of greenhouse gases were the dominant cause of the warming since the mid20th century    the new federal report lays out grim scenarios for each part of the country including how changes in the amounts and timing of snow and rainfall is leading water stress    for example hydropower production in the southwest and the northwest will be under threat even as groundwater depletion is worsening drought risk in many parts of the united states particularly in the southwest and southern great plains dependable and safe water supplies for us caribbean hawaii and pacific island communities are threatened by drought flooding and saltwater contamination due to sea level rise    the frequency and severity of allergic illnesses including asthma and hay fever are expected to increase as a result of a changing climate it said and warming temperatures are projected to alter the geographic range of diseasecarrying insects and pests exposing more people to ticks that carry lyme disease and mosquitoes that transmit viruses such as zika west nile and dengue    communities in the southeast for example are particularly vulnerable to the combined health impacts from vectorborne disease heat and flooding the report said
agriculture will be particularly affected it said with new challenges to livestock health declines in crop yields and quality and extreme weather will threaten rural livelihoods sustainable food security and price stability    increases in temperatures during the growing season in the midwest are projected to be the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of us agriculture the report said    the northeast will suffer from flooding from heavy rainfall storm surge and rising high tides which will compound issues with aging infrastructure in the northeast    fossil fuel producers are likely to feel the changes too it predicted with increased drought risk expected to hurt oil and gas drilling and refining as well as electricity generation from power plants that rely on surface water for cooling    even if significant emissions reductions occur many of the effects from sea level rise over this century  and particularly through midcentury are already locked in due to historical emissions and many communities are already dealing with the consequences it said     still the report offered some modest hope that communities could stem some of the harm by acting now to adapt to changes such as by protecting shorelines and conserving coastal ecosystems to guard against increased coastal flooding more than half of the damages to coastal property are estimated to be avoidable through welltimed adaptation measures the report said    but even if democrats put climate change at the top of their agenda it will be difficult for them to overcome the trump administrations aggressive rollbacks of the obama administrations climate policies from its weakening of controls on power plants and vehicles greenhouse gas pollution to its withdrawal from the nearly 200nation paris climate change agreement
even the paris agreements voluntary pledges are too modest to prevent many of the catastrophes that are on the way according to a report issued in october by the uns international panel on climate change that report said countries would need rapid farreaching and unprecedented actions to prevent massive changes including cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reducing net emissions to zero by midcentury no plans for such severe cuts are even remotely in the works    kristiana huber a fellow at the center for climate and energy solutions said the reports focus on regional impacts will help give communities a sense of what they are likely to face in terms of rising temperatures or intensifying disasters    we hear from cities we work with  that uncertainty about climate data is a real barrier to decisionmaking she said    in an email friday the white house said the report took a particularly pessimistic point of view    the report is largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts longestablished trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population a white house spokesperson said in the email    the next report  due out in four years  would look more closely at climate modeling and projections the spokesperson said which would provide for a more transparent and datadriven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes
this means democrats can accuses trump of being a threat to national security on an entirely different front outside of all the ways hes already jeopardized the country
  federal scientists  that is a terrifying term
  not as bad as patriotic republican  of course those never existed
that new green deal looks more like a winning issue for the democrats every day
trumps climate change denier ways will cause half a trillion dollars in damage to the us every year and thats according to trumps own government    sounds like a good platform to run on for an election
as a trump voter i still would have shopped that photo to make it look like the weather pattern shown on the right was a penis shooting a load  i really get sick of you lowquality shills that come here and shit up the board with your nonanime 100 stock photos
  theres no better way to trigger /pol/ppets than posting pictures of trump sulking or looking like a whiny little bitch
  otherwise known as 95 of all photos ever taken of him
  why is it a terrifying term
  why is it a terrifying term  scientist requires and should bear no qualification hell actual science need not be performed by a scientist at all  the implication of that term is that theyre more sciencey than your runofthemill scientist theyre federal scientists ooo ahh  its a twice baked appeal to authority that makes whatever message following almost surely a fraud
  hell actual science need not be performed by a scientist at all  how should one distinguish between actual science and crank science    its a twice baked appeal to authority that makes whatever message following almost surely a fraud  federal scientists also say eating radium products is bad for you i guess its safe now     appeal against authority is no more valid and is probably less valid than appeal to authority since authorities sometimes have authority for a reason
  how should one distinguish between actual science and crank science  the scientific method    appeal against authority is no more valid and is probably less valid than appeal to authority since authorities sometimes have authority for a reason  this is literally another appeal to authority
  the scientific method  i eagerly await your robust scientific critique of the report that was produced    this is literally another appeal to authority  its literally correct to accept the appeal to authority sometimes you dont have to believe it though just make sure you put your money where your mouth is and be sure to get your medical advice from a hobo rather than a doctor next time youre sick
  i eagerly await your robust scientific critique of the report that was produced  nah you asked a specific question and i answered    its literally correct to accept the appeal to authority sometimes you dont have to believe it though  exactly but it then would be your burden to prove why they /should/ accept it    just make sure you put your money where your mouth is and be sure to get your medical advice from a hobo rather than a doctor next time youre sick  since you clearly dont understand the concept of an appeal to authority i will say hobos dont cause medical errors that kill 250k440k people every year    
  exactly but it then would be your burden to prove why they /should/ accept it  we should accept it because the authors have demonstrated geophysics expertise as demonstrated by peerreviewed publications in scientific journals with results that have been robust against followups and largely unrefuted by critics and while there is a gatekeeper effect nothing stops people from publishing refutations to arxiv and the like    i will say hobos dont cause medical errors that kill 250k440k people every year  i agree all of our medical decisions should be made by hobos
  are you schizophrenic honest question
  distinguish between actual science and crank science  reproducability of results yknow science  eating radium products  i bet you think youre funny well why not investigate the history of the usda food pyramid to see what happens when politics meets science
  reproducability of results yknow science  is astronomy science they dont run experiments in that field after all
  is astronomy science they dont run experiments in that field after all  i have heard very reasonable arguments that it is not it has been suggested that the term natural philosophy be resurrected for such fields
  i think hes just really fucking thick  hardcore deniers are literally btfo at this point  you can expect more weak unreasonable and outright bizarre outbursts over the next couple of days
  okay so wheres the control earth that were comparing our planet to
  wheres the control earth  exactly

donald trump was recorded off camera saying get me out of here to an aide at the end of the g20 summit in argentina as he walked off stage even as other world leaders gathered for a photo     the us president was also scheduled to pose for the final photos as the meeting in buenos aires came to an end after a whirlwind two days     but footage shows mr trump shaking hands with mauricio macri the argentinean president before rapidly walking off stage     mr macri who stretched out a hand after him appeared confused by the us leaders behaviour and was left alone in front of the photographers     an aide then rushed across the stage after mr trump who off camera can be heard saying get me out of here     despite the presidents wishes he did eventually return to the stage to pose for group photos with the other world leaders     the 72yearold has previously made awkward blunders during photo opportunities with other dignitaries    he briefly wandered out of a press event with benjamin netanyahu in 2017 only to be ushered back by staff moments later    
mr macri who stretched out a hand after him appeared confused by the us leaders behaviour   hes not the only one
thats hilarious
trump is autistic   based
hes under a lot of stress right now
  of course having mueller expose his double agent and the public finding out what motivated his conspiring with the russians and him committing treason would put him under a lot of stress
trump confirmed for turboautism
  indeed trump certainly is cringeworthy
  not sure if autism or some other phobia  but yeah the dude doesnt like mugshots    kinda went with the wrong job for that
  indeed trump certainly is cringeworthy
  fuck off  reeeee drumpf
  they insulted muh god emprah to the keyboard warriors
  not your hugbox
  /pol/ status btfo
  indeed trump certainly is cringeworthy
sounds like stage fright i had the same issue when i was in band in high school
        legacy cringe
  certainly trumps legacy is indeed cringeworthy
      cry all you want trump is smarter than youll ever be
  how so
  a smart guy wouldnt have gone bankrupt four times
  still a multibillionaire  pointing to a few failures when hes still a massive success and beloved the world over
  a massive success and beloved the world over  lol
  eloquent but knows how to speak to the common man  btfo the libs and conservatives  angers the establishment  etc
  lol  not an argument
  eloquent  look having nuclear  my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer dr john trump at mit good genes very good genes ok very smart the wharton school of finance very good very smart  you know if youre a conservative republican if i were a liberal if like ok if i ran as a liberal democrat they would say im one of the smartest people anywhere in the world  its true  but when youre a conservative republican they try  oh do they do a number  thats why i always start off went to wharton was a good student went there went there did this built a fortune  you know i have to give my like credentials all the time because were a little disadvantaged  but you look at the nuclear deal the thing that really bothers me  it would have been so easy and its not as important as these lives are  nuclear is powerful my uncle explained that to me many many years ago the power and that was 35 years ago he would explain the power of whats going to happen and he was right who would have thought  but when you look at whats going on with the four prisoners  now it used to be three now its four  but when it was three and even now i would have said its all in the messenger fellas and it is fellas because you know they dont they havent figured that the women are smarter right now than the men so you know its gonna take them about another 150 years  but the persians are great negotiators the iranians are great negotiators so and they they just killed they just killed us
  yes trump is eloquent your point
  a smart guy wouldnt have gone bankrupt four times    trump has never gone bankrupt he has had corporations file for bankruptcy 4 out of over 500 businesses have filed for bankruptcy that less than a 1 failure rate     whats your batting average
    cucks
  make an utterly ridiculous assertion  act surprised when mocked for it
  0/1 infinitely better 3
  oh the irony
  he doesnt know how much the jews and asians like trump  heres a hint anon the whole world doesnt think like you do
  thatsh ridiculusth lisped the tranny
  seething
  makes another ridiculous assertion with no source  the entire world is literally laughing at trump
  they dont like him they know hes a narcissistic retard that will bend over backwards for you if you compliment him
  someone could explain their philosophy of life in that amount of text and trump narrowly manages to explain nukes are powerful
  and then just in case anyone were to think it was a fluke he went and did it even worse with the elton john speech the man is a walking catastrophe
  go repeat that rambling wordforword the next time you discuss nuclear weapons and see if people dont start checking you for signs of stroke
  and this isnt even an isolated incident there are scores of rambling droning diatribes like this in trumps resume as president it definitely gives credence to the theory that hes suffering from senile dementia along with his extremely arbitrary behaviour just compare this to speeches he made way back when he was a ceo
probably had to poop from whatever weird food they have there
  based autist
i wouldnt want to be photographed with a bunch of tyrannical overlords either
  but trump desperately wants to be one because hes a beta himself who wants to project hes an alpha
  very cool and very legal
  and somehow this man was elected president of the united states   _ツ_/
wow impeachment and cream any day now
  because america rejected the most cheated on woman in america
  trump has worse alzheimers than reagan at the end of his presidency at this point
  all that kfc has to go somewhere and its not out your ass
      epic win xd
  ass blasted trumptard  at least try to be less obvious idiot
  quite the opposite im a full fledged resister can i have an invite to the r/politics discord i want to share my epic clapbacks with you
  trump is shit but so was shillary fake liberal clinton
lock her up    ivanka trump sent hundreds of emails last year to white house aides cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account many of them in violation of federal records rules according to people familiar with a white house examination of her correspondence    white house ethics officials learned of trumps repeated use of personal email when reviewing emails gathered last fall by five cabinet agencies to respond to a public records lawsuit that review revealed that throughout much of 2017 she often discussed or relayed official white house business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband jared kushner    the discovery alarmed some advisers to president trump who feared that his daughters practices bore similarities to the personal email use of hillary clinton an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign trump attacked his democratic challenger as untrustworthy and dubbed her crooked hillary for using a personal email account as secretary of state    some aides were startled by the volume of ivanka trumps personal emails  and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice trump said she was not familiar with some details of the rules according to people with knowledge of her reaction    the white house referred requests for comment to ivanka trumps attorney and ethics counsel abbe lowell    in a statement peter mirijanian a spokesman for lowell acknowledged that the presidents daughter occasionally used her private email before she was briefed on the rules but he said none of her messages contained classified information
while transitioning into government after she was given an official account but until the white house provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did ms trump sometimes used her personal account almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family he said in a statement    mirijanian said ivanka trump turned over all her governmentrelated emails months ago so they could be stored permanently with other white house records    and he stressed that her email use was different than that of clinton who had a private email server in the basement of her chappaqua ny home at one point an archive of thousands of clintons emails was deleted by a computer specialist amid a congressional investigation    ms trump did not create a private server in her house or office no classified information was ever included the account was never transferred at trump organization and no emails were ever deleted mirijanian said    like trump clinton also said she was unaware of or misunderstood the rules however clinton relied solely on a private email system as secretary of state bypassing government servers entirely    both trump and clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records    clinton originally said none of the messages she sent or received were marked classified the fbi later determined that 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received    austin evers executive director of the liberal watchdog group american oversight whose record requests sparked the white house discovery said it strained credulity that trumps daughter did not know that government officials should not use private emails for official business
theres the obvious hypocrisy that her father ran on the misuse of personal email as a central tenet of his campaign evers said there is no reasonable suggestion that she didnt know better clearly everyone joining the trump administration should have been on high alert about personal email use    ivanka trump and her husband set up personal emails with the domain ijkfamilycom through a microsoft system in december 2016 as they were preparing to move to washington so kushner could join the white house according to people familiar with the arrangement    the couples emails are prescreened by the trump organization for security problems such as viruses but are stored by microsoft the people said    trump used her personal account to discuss government policies and official business less than 100 times  often replying to other administration officials who contacted her through her private email according to people familiar with the review    another category of lesssubstantive emails may have also violated the records law hundreds of messages related to her official work schedule and travel details that she sent herself and personal assistants who cared for her children and house they said    people close to ivanka trump said she never intended to use her private email to shroud her government work after she told white house lawyers she was unaware that she was breaking any email rules they discovered that she had not been receiving white house updates and reminders to all staff about prohibited use of private email according to people familiar with the situation
using personal emails for government business could violate the presidential records act which requires that all official white house communications and records be preserved as a permanent archive of each administration it can also increase the risk that sensitive government information could be mishandled or hacked revealing government secrets and risking harm to diplomatic relations and secret operations    revelations about clintons personal email system led to an fbi investigation of whether she had mishandled classified information the scandal shadowed clinton throughout the 2016 white house race culminating in thenfbi director james b comeys controversial decision to hold a news conference a few months before the election to announce his conclusion that she had been reckless with government secrets but that there was not sufficient evidence she had intended to skirt the law    during the campaign donald trump said the democratic nominees corruption is on a scale we have never seen before and called her personal email use bigger than watergate    trump supporters still chant lock her up at his rallies and the president nearly two years into his administration continues to tweet about clintons emails  big story out that the fbi ignored tens of thousands of crooked hillary emails many of which are really bad he tweeted in august referring to a fox news story about claims that the bureau did not scrutinize all her emails also gave false election info i feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption at some point i may have to get involved    ivanka trump first used her personal email to contact cabinet officials in early 2017 before she joined the white house as an unpaid senior adviser according to emails obtained by american oversight
in late february 2017 she used her personal email to contact small business administration chief linda mcmahon and propose they meet to explore opportunities to collaborate the following month she emailed education secretary betsy devos suggesting that their staffers meet to discuss ways to collaborate on locational/workforce development and k12 stem education    while her messages were largely about government work trump was not then subject to white house records rules    when she joined the white house on march 30 trump pledged to comply with all ethics rules responding to complaints that her voluntary role gave her all of the access and perks of the white house  but none of the legal responsibilities or constraints    throughout this process i have been working closely and in good faith with the white house counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role she said in a statement at the time    but trump continued to occasionally use her personal email in her official capacity according to people familiar with the review    her husband jared kushners use of personal email for government work drew intense scrutiny when it was first reported by politico last fall the revelation prompted demands from congressional investigators that kushner preserve his records which his attorney said he had    but trump had used her personal email for official business far more frequently according to people familiar with the administrations review  a fact that remained a closely held secret inside the white house    she was the worst offender in the white house said a former senior us government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics  after discovering the extent of her email use in september 2017 white house lawyers relied on lowell ivanka trumps attorney to help review her personal emails to determine which were personal and which were official business according to the people
the white house counsels office did not have access to her personal account and could not review it without invading her privacy and possibly violating privileged communications with her attorneys people familiar with the review said    after his review lowell forwarded emails that he had determined were related to official business to ivanka trumps government account a move he viewed as rectifying any violations of the records law they said    lowells review found less than 1000 personal emails in which trump shared her official schedule and travel plans with herself and her personal assistants according to two people familiar with the review    separately there were less than 100 emails in which trump used her personal account to discuss official business with other administration officials    the scope of her personal email use had not emerged in response to american oversights records request which sought trumps correspondence with cabinet agencies in early 2017 most internal white house communications are not subject to the freedom of information act    im disappointed  although not entirely surprised  that this administration disregarded clear laws that they more than anyone should have been aware of evers said    in many cases government officials contacted ivanka trump first at her personal email address that was the case with a note she received in april 2017 from treasury official dan kowalski who was seeking to set up a meeting between the president and the secretary general of the organization for economic cooperation and development an international economic group of which the united states is a member    i apologize for reaching out to you on your personal email for this but it is the only email i have for you he wrote according to an email obtained by american oversight
oh my god lock her up this instant
  arrrgh    this title    why    this is legit    but    aaarrrggghhh    you had one job op    one job
  ivanak kinda sounds like the name of some alien on star trek i actually kinda like it more than ivanka
  trump said she was not familiar with some details of the rules  that sounds familiar
lock
  her
    man i havent been on r/politics for awhile
  they fucked it up over there too    democrats arent as good at chanting mindless refrains they think too much
  they think too much    hahahaha
  the ability to posses critical thinking is a curse for the left
  am i on /r/politics what the hell happened to this board
  dont mind cletus hes just waking up for the day youre lucky he hasnt called you a communist yet
didnt exchange classified info  didnt exchange confidential info  didnt host the email on a private server in her home  didnt attempt to hide the fact for months  didnt attempt to destroy evidence of email record  didnt attempt to physically destroy devices used to access the email to obstruct an investigation  hurrr same thing lock her up  we made excuse after excuse for hillary but now we care about private email usage
  what the hell happened to this board  occupied by r/politics drones who weep uncontrollably if everyone around them isnt talking about trump 24/7
  you came to this thread for a reason what was it
  we made excuse after excuse for hillary but now we care about private email usage  do you really think people want ivanka locked up apart from a few loonies the point is after the hell her daddy raised over hillary are we really supposed to believe she didnt know any better    didnt exchange classified info  didnt exchange confidential info  well thats what were being told anyway wouldnt surprise me at all if thats not the case even if there was an exchange of classified info excuses would be made
  who wants to bet she did all of those and trump is just having the doj cover it up
  what is it like the 745 consecutive day with a trump general in /pol/
  did she send classified documents editing them so they wouldnt have the tags marking them as such too
  first she isnt the sec of state second sis she delete 33k emails and scrub her hard drives and servers to cover it all up
  after the hell her daddy raised over hillary are we really supposed to believe she didnt know any better  t exchange classified info  t exchange confidential info  well thats what were being told anyway  you forgot  didnt host the email on a private server in her home  didnt attempt to hide the fact for months  didnt attempt to destroy evidence of email record  didnt attempt to physically destroy devices used to access the email to obstruct an investigation      one thread   /news/ catalogue 20 threads on trump
  the classification detail is a huge sticking point the reason hillary got so much hell and turned off so many federal workers is because any other average joe doing the shit she did would be in jail/fired no questions ask     until some evidence shows up she was using it for her job duties and sending classified info everywhere she isnt any worse than your standard dc politician
good find out what laws she broke and then lock up the dumb bimbo    then do the same for hillary because i hate her too
  oh god   get to the shelter boys   op just triggered trumptards who will launch their defensive what about hilary and what about her email server posts
clinton email good ivanka email bad  also  according to someone familiar with  hahahaha keep reaching /leftypol/ppets
not saying we should jump to conclusions but we should investigate these claims since house and senate republicans decided it was significant enough to warrant an investigation for hillary gotta keep things consistent
  yup i agree with you stupid decision by ivanka but if she really did steer clear of classified info then theres not much to be outraged over
  but what about her emails
  stupid decision  this is more than a stupid decision when seen in the context of the catalog of the breaking of ethical boundaries norms rules and laws that characterize this administration    over time restrictions are put in place to preserve public interest to deter corruption or the appearance of such and to help the republic to perfect itself  sometimes the regs get too onerous and need review but wholesale breaking of them for personal gain is the evil we should guard against  we are use to politicians playing fast and loose with special interests and hidden personal but this administration has to be the worst in recent history and the very swamp like activities it said it would destroy    oh well off to get a round in before the rain and those pesky veterans crowd the course
if they plan on doing anything hillary first
  even if a crime was committed that boat has now sailed i doubt that there is any political will  if there was anything there then the most motivated people to after her are those who oppose her and have the political and legal power and opportunity to do so    trump has had 2 years with the opportunity and the powers of the office and state to go after her   even his personal psychological need to be right and under no circumstances to be shown to be wrong should have driven him to investigate her  he hasnt  why not    hmmm
white house officials tried to hide details about ivanka trumps troubling use of a private email account used for government business according to a bombshell new report by the washington post    from december 2016 throughout last year ivanka sent hundreds of emails to government officials potentially in violation of the presidential records act her use of the account under a personal domain created by her and husband jared kushner caused concern throughout the white house according to the report    however when politico first revealed the private ivankajared domain last year white house officials let kushner take the fall coverage at the time focused on kushners use of the private account to conduct government business without being archived and the original report stated there was no indication ivanka used the account for government business    the white house insisted that kushners use of the account was limited and claimed fewer than one hundred emails were ever sent from kushners account    while democrats in congress demanded that kushner immediately preserve those emails white house officials intentionally remained silent about ivankas own rampant misuse of the family domain    she was the worst offender in the white house a former government official told the washington post    the white house moved quietly to end ivankas use of the private account in september 2017 and to meet the requirements of the presidential records act without attracting any attention as part of the process ivankas personal attorney reviewed the emails and allegedly passed along ones pertaining to government business to the white house counsels office    however the white house counsels office was never granted access to the account  meaning ivanka and her team personally decided what material would be preserved according to washington post reporter james hohmann it seems the trump family and complicit white house staffers hoped that would be the end of it
now with the secret out the white house is in damage control mode    a spokesperson for ivankas ethics counsel claims the whole thing was just a big innocent misunderstanding and that ivanka had not been given proper guidance on emails and federal record keeping    while transitioning into government after she was given an official account but until the white house provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did ms trump sometimes used her personal account almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family the spokesperson said    in other words ivanka used a private email address to conduct government business despite having an official government email and despite her father just wrapping up a campaign that made his opponents use of a private email address its defining issue
god ivanka is so sexy if only she had blue eyes
hey this crime wasnt as bad as that one ignore this  no you arenit allowed to have a moral fiber now or ever until you retroactively go back in time fix all your mistakes ever then touch this one  comparison game   whataboutism is truly the most sad state of mental affairs
the emails the emails wont somebody please think of her emails
  perhaps this is more my biased view speaking but as a guy with a lot of washington intern friends i can tell you first hand most congressmen violate the safe communications rules that have been put in place im not saying they go to hillary levels of corruptions but a vast majority of them use their personal communication devices for work related manners instead of following the guidelines given to them by security     trump powell etc are a lot more common than we care to acknowledge but i do get what you mean from the broader view
  democrats arent as good at chanting mindless refrains    repeating words given to them by a loudspeaker is a fundamental feature of democrat/left rallies have you never watched one
  ops post is already a whataboutism referencing the hillary email debacle      democrats arent as good at chanting mindless refrains  lol  they think too much  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  you lost the plot bro
  what you mean like lock her up    no wait
  no one because thats not even plausible

  some people because its plausible if you tilt your head and squint a little
  the white house moved quietly to end ivankas use of the private account in september 2017 and to meet the requirements of the presidential records act without attracting any attention as part of the process ivankas personal attorney reviewed the emails and allegedly passed along ones pertaining to government business to the white house counsels office  however the white house counsels office was never granted access to the account  meaning ivanka and her team personally decided what material would be preserved according to washington post reporter james hohmann it seems the trump family and complicit white house staffers hoped that would be the end of it  so she was using her own private email account for eight months if this is true plus theres potential that emails were deleted a la hillary since the white house counsels office wasnt given access to the account      a spokesperson for ivankas ethics counsel claims the whole thing was just a big innocent misunderstanding and that ivanka had not been given proper guidance on emails and federal record keeping  theres no way she went eight months without guidance even the most low level federal employees have to be briefed and sign off on this kind of thing as soon as theyre hired i cant imagine the white house just said screw it when it came to the presidents daughter      perhaps this is more my biased view speaking but as a guy with a lot of washington intern friends i can tell you first hand most congressmen violate the safe communications rules that have been put in place  thats irksome if true ive witnessed people get into serious trouble over minor security issues security is constantly harped on if the people who actually have information that could be damaging to national security are so loose with the rules and are allowed to be then what is the point
to address misinformation being peddled about ms trumps personal email she did not create a private server in her house or office there was never classified information transmitted the account was never transferred or housed at trump organization no emails were ever deleted and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules
  wow its so much better that she used a thirdparty service that thousands of people at microsoft could access instead of a private server that only she could access
  no emails were ever deleted and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules      the white house moved quietly to end ivankas use of the private account in september 2017 and to meet the requirements of the presidential records act without attracting any attention as part of the process ivankas personal attorney reviewed the emails and allegedly passed along ones pertaining to government business to the white house counsels office  however the white house counsels office was never granted access to the account  meaning ivanka and her team personally decided what material would be preserved according to washington post reporter james hohmann it seems the trump family and complicit white house staffers hoped that would be the end of it
  reminder that hillary had a security it expert install her system and it was never hacked by anyone pence used aol while he was governor of indiana and all of aols email accounts were hacked by someone in russia meaning some guy in russia got all the information that pence had in his email he was ordered by the court to turn over any emails that were government related but he was the one who got to choose which ones were government related it was the same fucked up shit with hillary governments need to be transparent and accountable
she wasnt called crooked hillary for mistakenly sending classified emails from a private email server while she was working as secretary of state she was called crooked hillary for trying to scrub the record and hide the scandal     this is petty as fuck and retarded but hey thats just what being a democrat is all about these days
      holy fuck the spin control is on this hard
  reddit are posting here in higher frequency since the 4channel news came out they think hiroyuki is doing more to fight neonazism than reddit so this is a better place now or something
  she wasnt called crooked hillary for mistakenly sending classified emails from a private email server while she was working as secretary of state  i dont see how she unintentionally did this i think she just didnt care same as most politicians the fact that she had a secure server installed makes me think she knew what she was doing    she was called crooked hillary for trying to scrub the record and hide the scandal  which appears to be similar to whats happening here white house tries to quietly handle it and blames jared for the bulk of the emails ivanka and her lawyer decided what was worth preserving and denied the white house counsels office access to the account so who knows whether or not they went about the task honestly maybe they really did pass along all of the ones pertaining to government business but given the way they handled it id be surprised if thats the case
  you think you have room to talk about pettiness with this president representing you how laughable
  as expected of /pol/ppets
  none of them are wrong though  by now everyone should be locked up  also    to send hundreds of government of government email  of government of government  nice try xiao
  yes ivanak must be punished
    the assumption that thought comes into this at any point would be a mistaken one
  i bet her daddy would love to
  how many of her emails covered topics that are classified as top secret has she disclosed all of her emails to the secret service and what is her level of security clearance to know yell lock her up as though this is at all the same as clintons situation is absolutely dishonest
  what you mean like lock her up  organic formed by the people without any need for central control a grassroots meme of sorts  i believe that she will win  i really shouldnt need to explain this further
  riiight and the fact that youve been calling for someones imprisonment for two straight years doesnt strike you as out of place at all
  so your defense is trump might not have given a senior advisor and his own daughter a high level security clearance
  ivanka  sexy  blinkingmangif
  not a defence simply pointing out that this is not comparable still wrong but not at all the sameyou are being dishonest if you claim otherwise
  you havent shown that it isnt comparable at all youve only pointed out that theres things about the case with ivanka that we dont know at this point given what we do know so far its exactly the same
  come back when the fbi is demanding she hands over her hard drive but shes accidentally bleached it then maybe ill believe your phoney outrage
  hillary did not bleach her hard disks i seriously doubt she had any involvement in the maintenance of the email server at all her it person used a program called bleachbit to perform periodical maintenance on the email server like securely deleting things that had been market for deletion previously you dont need to have some nefarious reason to use a program like bleachbit     hillary had been led to assume her emails were all things that werent classified but there were apparently a handful of emails that were classified but didnt have the correct headers to identify them as such and some were retroactively classified
  this post is literally 100 bullshit and you do yourself and your side as i guess this is what politics has become to you no favours wow
  in a statement peter mirijanian a spokesman for lowell acknowledged that the presidents daughter occasionally used her private email before she was briefed on the rules but he said none of her messages contained classified information  apples are not oranges
top gop congressman admits ivanka may have broken the law    rep trey gowdy rsc the outgoing chairman of the house oversight committee stonewalled an investigation into ivanka trumps potentially improper email use a year before it became a public scandal    but now that he cant avoid it anymore gowdy is finally admitting ivanka may have broken the law when she used a private email account to conduct government business    ms trumps use of a personal email account for official communications may implicate the presidential records act and other security and recordkeeping requirements gowdy wrote in a letter to the white house requesting a briefing on the email issue    the presidential records act requires government business to be conducted through proper government channels so that the record can be preserved for future reference    the washington post reported monday that ivanka trump along with her husband jared kushner used a private email system to send hundreds of messages to government officials ivanka trump did this while serving in her capacity as an aide to her father and sent messages pertaining to government business    the white house initially tried to hide that she had done this minimizing the extent of the problem and placing the blame on kushner    and republicans in congress led by gowdy helped enable the coverup    gowdy knew about the potentially illicit email exchanges over a year ago but he dropped a bipartisan investigation into the issue after taking the white houses unverified word for it that everything was on the upandup
but now we know that it wasnt  and that congressional democrats on the oversight committee led by rep elijah cummings dmd were right to object to gowdys actions and push for the committee to do its constitutional duty    donald trump tried to cover for his daughter on tuesday by weakly arguing that the reporting on her email use was fake news    for years trump has attacked hillary clinton for using a private email server and led his supporters in chants of lock her up at rallies but now that trumps daughter is under fire after he gave her a senior position in his administration he suddenly sees things differently    and only now that the white houses deception has been exposed by the washington post is gowdy starting to do the followup work that he should have done over a year ago    gowdy has already announced he is leaving congress and democrats will be taking over leadership of the house after sweeping republicans out of power in the midterms    cummings office has said the ivanka trump email scandal will be one of many investigations that will be conducted under democratic leadership in the new congress
   do you suck cocks by any chance shes pretty sexy my only complaint is the brown eyes it makes her look like a mongrel
    /pol/ is the board filled with redditors     half of them came over from r/the_donald including yourself     why dont you fuck off back there
  /pol/ is definitely filled with redditors but not everyone who isnt a deranged leftist is from /pol/    /pol/ is neocon kike central and /news/ is tranny and leftist maniac central both of you browse reddit the only difference is that /news/ is filled with tumblrites    inb4 tranny calling me a centrist or getting butthurt and reporting me to the hot pocket gods
  /pol/ is the board filled with redditors  only the ones trying and failing to raid the board the rest of you clearly come here    congratulations friend with a few more entries from the 4chan word bank you too might be able to pass off as a regular lurker and not an r/politics drone
  who is ivanak trump
  i think you might need to go offline for a few months
    youre fucking dumb if you think this isnt a giant refugee board we have two boards that serve this boards purpose but those arent enough because people were getting triggered over memes and flags
  to be fair shes been up to shady stuff before bill was even elected as governer of arkansas how shes avoided any sort of legal retribution is kind of crazy     
  so trump can get the doj to cover up crimes for his daughter but he cant get them to prosecute hillary
the sitting president will not let his daughter go to jail be real
so is this where /leftypol/ posts their political bullshit because theyd get btfo on /pol/ proper
  youre free to bring the alleged btfo to /news/ if you like
  come argue with me in my heavily controlled image disabled hugbox kiddo
  aww baby cant argue without his meme images
  i need stormfront infographics and memes to prove my point  stay on /pol/ then
    not him but images are really good at proving a point because you can post charts and graphs  having images disabled is a huge mistake and simply makes it easier to hugbox by samefagging i wish flags and ids were enabled
  i need stormfront infographics and memes to prove my point  i need ids and flags too  you must go back /pol/ppet
  do you get tired just posting the same tired shit every fucking thread every thread now is just someone probably you or someone you know reeeeeeing because someone came into your board and said something you didnt like you dont even try to argue with them   look at the front page every other thread is just someone screeching go back to /pol/ does it hurt having them live rentfree in your head like that
  nothing ever happened to hillary with all of the leftists defending clinton actions back then it really goes to show how callow and pathetic they are attacking a person over what they once deemed as nonadmissible haha
this is nothing like what hillary did if youre familiar with both stories hillary clinton set up a private server for emails in her home then destroyed it ivanka did not
  wants to make /news/ more like /pol/  wow im so fucking tired of everyone accusing me of being from /pol/ youre just mad i cant turn this board into another propaganda hub for brigading faggots from russian discord servers  yikes
  just fuck off back to /pol/
  lol
  you can post charts and graphs  you mean cherrypicked ones with biased cohorts its a good thing that you have to post where you got your source from if you want to insert bullshit infographics   i wish flags and ids were enabled  hahahaha    i know they say this too often here but you really need to go back
    the political climate is shifting the days of right wing schizophrenia are drawing to a close
punish them both hillary/ivanka for crimes committed in accordance with the law investigate hold the trials and sentence them but dont bitch when hillary gets 60 years and ivanka gets 6 months they didnt do the same thing
  they didnt do the same thing  we still dont even know what ivanka did just what her reps said she did its likely far worse considering how the white house handled it
  i cant recall the last time i saw an info image that wasnt complete bullshit
  not him but images are really good at proving a point because you can post charts and graphs  infographics are really good at perpetuating complete bullshit    i once spent like twenty hours straight arguing with someone who posted an infographic correcting subpoint 5a or some shit and in the end even the person who posted the infographic agreed that i had provided an incontrovertible primary source demonstrating that subpoint 5a was in fact bullshit and graciously offered to produce a corrected infographic    meanwhile in the rest of the world the uncorrected infographic was subsequently posted another ten thousand times and mislead several thousands more people because thats what infographics do
  threadspecific ids might be helpful but balanced moderation would help more it would be something at least
  balanced moderation  no doubt your notion of balanced moderation would preserve 100 of your posts given that youre a perfect poster and all and would only delete the posts of people you didnt like
  it doesnt really matter if im an angle or devil the point still stands
  infographics are nice when theyre accurate unfortunately they tend to be a load of crap and people repost and forward without even thinking of fact checking first basically yeah what you said
  balanced moderation  almost every mod is /pol/ friendly so unless we get a change in leadership expect things to get worse
ivanka my email scandal is different please dont lock me up    ivanka trump said that despite her fathers attacks on hillary clintons emails the same standard does not apply to her use of a private email account to conduct government business    the white house attempted to cover up the possible violation of the presidential records act by jared kushner and ivanka trump who both used their private accounts while working as employees of the government    during the presidential campaign donald trump led lock her up chants calling for hillary clinton to be arrested and jailed over her email use    this was referenced by abc reporter deborah roberts in her interview with ivanka    but ivanka quickly asserted that the same standards do not apply to her    all of my emails are on the white house server there is no intent to circumvent she protested    and there were mass deletions after a subpoena was issued my emails have not been deleted nor was there anything of substance  nothing confidential that was within them so theres no connection between the two things    roberts then asked so the idea of lock her up doesnt apply to you    no ivanka replied laughing off the question    but there is no independent confirmation of her assertions about how she used her private account or the content of the emails she sent    her dismissive attitude echoes donald trumps excuses for her behavior and he declared concerns about her alleged misuse to be fake news    when republicans leading the house oversight committee were alerted to the use of private accounts they merely accepted the white houses version of events without investigating or demanding records from the trump administration    based on the new revelations incoming house oversight committee chairman rep elijah cummings dmd has said he will reopen the dormant investigation and discover if ivanka her husband or the trump administration may have violated the law
busted  doing exactly what they did  they cant even talk about him doing what they did  lmfaokekafamalamadingdong
  i wish some scrawny lib faggot would use this cletus shit irl so i could stomp your head in
  no the mods are normal but when you are judging from an extremely left point if view of course you would call them pol friendly  also they are grade a idiots i got a ban on this board for posting a link to a website that i mistyped i ended it in com instead of com  i got banned for evading content filtering but it wasnt even a filtered link to begin with just a typo

    how will the trump administration get along with democrats when the opposition party holds subpoena investigation and budgetsetting power in january    interior secretary ryan zinke offered a preview friday afternoon responding from criticism by the top democrat on the house natural resources committee by insinuating on twitter that arizona rep raul grijalva is a drunk    grijalva will likely chair the committee which oversees interior when democrats take control of the house at the beginning of next years congressional session    earlier friday grijalva had published an opinion piece in usa today calling attention to various ethics scandals that have swirled around zinke and urged the montana republican to resign    its hard for him to think straight from the bottom of the bottle zinke responded in a statement posted on twitter including a hashtag referencing a bar near the us capitol where lawmakers and political operatives drink after work he also called him hostile and suggested the democratic congressman should step down    grijalva ignored the attack issuing a statement saying the american people know who im here to serve and they know in whose interests im acting they dont know the same about secretary zinke    zinke has been one of president trumps more highprofile and aggressive cabinet secretaries he has aggressively promoted national parks while also expanding oil and gas leasing on public lands rolling back environmental regulations and scaling back the size of two national monuments at the same time zinke has generated publicity for himself by commuting to the interior departments offices on horseback on his first day as secretary among other highprofile actions
like several other trump cabinet members zinke has also faced numerous ethics inquiries including probes into his personal finances travel and blending political actions with his official capacities the most highprofile ethical questions have been focused on a land deal in montana involving zinkes family foundation and a project tied to halliburtons chairman    zinke has been cleared by several internal investigations but many questions are still lingering especially among democrats like grijalva    these are not the hallmarks of an effective leader grijalva wrote in the usa today oped we would hardly look the other way at the mayor of a small town let alone a cabinet secretary who faced unending ethical questions formal investigations and substantiated claims of attempted nepotism    the two men will likely be able to continue this backandforth come january with a committee dais and witness table in between the two of them
respond the accusations youre extremely corrupt by calling the other person drunk  are we sure zinke isnt a /pol/ppet
  remember when accusing people of being drunkards was all the range    it was like last month
the pentagon is also looking at living camouflage selfhealing paint and a variety of other applications of engineered organisms but the basic science remains a challenge    how do you detect submarines in an expanse as large as the ocean the us military hopes that common marine microorganisms might be genetically engineered into living tripwires to signal the passage of enemy subs underwater vessels or even divers    its one of many potential military applications for socalled engineered organisms a field that promises living camouflage that reacts to its surroundings to better avoid detection new drugs and medicines to help deployed forces survive in harsh conditions and more but the research is in its very early stages military officials said    the naval research laboratory or nrl is supporting the research heres how it would work you take an abundant sea organism like marinobacter and change its genetic makeup to react to certain substances left by enemy vessels divers or equipment these could be metals fuel exhaust human dna or some molecule thats not found naturally in the ocean but is associated with say dieselpowered submarines the reaction could take the form of electron loss which could be detectable to friendly sub drones    in an engineered context we might take the ability of the microbes to give up electrons then use those electrons to talk to something like an autonomous vehicle then you can start imagining that you can create an electrical signal when the bacteria encounters some molecule in their environment nrl researcher sarah glaven said at a november event put on by the johns hopkins universitys applied physics lab      
glaven believes the research is about a year away from providing concrete evidence that she can engineer reactions in abundant marine life forms that could prove useful for the military subhunting in particular is what we would like it to be applicable for she said    the reason we think we can accomplish this is because we have this vast database of info weve collected from growing these natural systems so after experiments where we look at switching gene potential gene expression regulatory networks we are finding these sensors said glaven    geneticists have already shown that its possible to manipulate the genes of e coli bacteria to exhibit all sorts of properties that might be useful for sub sensing but in synthetic biology ecoli are similar to lab mice in conventional medical research theyre abundant cheap and easy to work with but their realworld relevance is limited what works in e coli or in lab mice doesnt always work in other organisms and you just dont find them in the sorts of places you would want to detect submarines    theres currently a 45 million effort across the army navy and air force dubbed the applied research for the advancement of science and technology priorities program on synthetic biology for military environments aimed at giving researchers the tools they need to engineer genetic responses into organisms that would be useful for the military    us army researchers are focused on getting synthetic organisms out of the lab and into the field that also means getting useful new reactions out of abundant organisms and finding new nanoscale one billionth of a meter in size techniques to engineer those molecular reactions    we want to move synthetic biology from the laboratory to the field thats a big thrust of ours and so theres a lot of tool development in order to do that said dimitra stratiscullum who leads the biomaterials team at the us army research laboratory
if you want to move a biological biobased sensor to the field you try to ruggedize those organisms you try to protect them you try to encapsulate them you try to basically increase their longevity in these harsh environments so if you had for example embedded in a uniform a sensor that detects a hazard thats a biobased sensor and perhaps it also causes more than one color change depending on the complex input so theres more than one function or it would sense and alert you and also decontaminate a material for example its very difficult now to do that with the organisms that have some bio tools in them now like e coli    her nearterm focus is using biology to do and accelerate the nanoscience in traditional coatings that exist now the hope is that soldiers will one day be able to produce or print new coatings in the field to conceal equipment in the open were looking to build nextgeneration coatings where we can dovetail into additive manufacturing essentially 3d printing and other more pointofneed production technologies those could be useful to control and minimize detection of our materials or of our assets she said    back to the november jhu event where us chief of naval operations adm john richardson said the united states and the navy in particular is investing heavily in synthetic biology to better compete with china an emerging syntheticbiotechnology powerhouse    weve taken a look at this in terms of its implications in terms of the operating environment  biotechnology as a form of sensing whether that be algae or any number of other organisms the ability to detect dna as its left behind in the water column advanced sensors on the beach heads he said we recently stood up task force ocean which is about getting us back into a competitive stance in terms of ocean science
  military is genetically engineering new life forms to detect enemy subs    was only question of time those fucks will kill this planet to defend it
    detroit ap  the latest on general motors restructuring plans all times local    general motors will lay off 14700 factory and whitecollar workers in north america and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles    the reduction includes 8100 whitecollar workers some of whom will take buyouts and others who will be laid off most of the affected factories build cars that wont be sold in the us after next year they could close or they could get different vehicles to build they will be part of contract talks with the united auto workers union next year    plants without products include assembly plants in detroit lordstown ohio and oshawa ontario also affected are transmission factories in warren michigan as well as baltimore    about 6000 factory workers could lose jobs in the us and canada although some could transfer to truck plants
is everyone tired of winning yet
  gm is a failure and has been a failure
the changing market is at fault gm is closing non productive factories
  oh so the economy isnt something the president has control over    why all the tariffs then
  its to hurt china for their trade practices  stealing tech and corporate espionage and such
  we can do that without stabbing the farming and steel industries in the back cant we
  its trumps fault canada is losing auto worker jobs  cut this part out next time you shill this article i dont care canadians are losing jobs thanks to trump
  promotions for everyone
  if it was the economy then all models would suffer gm is cutting specific models just like ford did its an evolving market you have to make what the customers want or you will be stuck with excess inventory
  its always funny how little americans know about canadian trade canada sells large amounts of hydroelectric power wood water and several other resources and utilities to the states several states like california rely so heavily on canadian trade that if it was to shut off there would be massive consequences america simply lacks the infrastructure in too many places where canada has filled in the gaps    the funny thing is canada sells excess to the states they could shut off all the taps and end up with a surplus while the usa would start facing a humanitarian crisis with out power and water    fact is america has been living on the backs of the rest of the world trumps fucking that up for you guys by having no understanding or knowledge of basic trade the natural arrogance breeds from ignorance and keeps you oblivious to the fact that the world actually tolerated and supported america not the other way around
  california bought all the maple syrup and now its on fucking fire
  none of you shills even drive american made cars i worked for gm gm made poor executive choices female ceo got rid of the car guys and replaced them with slits pajeets yes men solid but lifeless designs they could take a page out of the iacocca playbook make an affordable spartan car that can be upgraded after purchase a/c entertainment seating powertrain license the aftermarket products must be made in 8 hours or less under one roof supply chain order custom on line
  canada who wouldnt negotiate a trade deal is getting some payback those other plants prolly had militant union locals anything built in detroit can move to lansing or pontiac ohio has other gm plants balimore can go to hell
  not unless you want a real war the options are as follows  a continue to take it up the ass from chang and do nothing at all  b put some tariffs on them to punish them and hopefully make them stop youll notice this is the cheapest option given how much ip the chinks steal and how much tanks planes and warships cost  c just go over there and fucking kill them  now personally id prefer c and find a unacceptable option b is what you might call a compromise now stop shrieking about the middle ground because both alternatives are worse
  none of you shills even drive american made cars    my f250 begs to differ
  if i list a few options then its an exhaustive list  or d cooperate with allied countries on a mutual coordinated strategy e more negotiations etc too bad tpp got ripped and trump is blowing putin up so there goes option d and e for personal reasons rather than practicality
  e more negotiations  negotiations dont matter if you arent getting the result you want    its pretty indisputably true that china steals intellectual property and and enacts protectionism on its own markets in order to enjoy a statelevel economic boost even if you dont agree with trumps approach to international trade
  i have one domestic and one import still would never buy gms overpriced shit
  the tpp is good   how is getting sued over chinese profit loss because of safety regulations exactly going to do anyone any good
and to think gm got bailed out by congress and w bush just 10 years ago
  would you rather the jobs go to china and mexico oh wait they are
imagine owning a government moters vehicle so ugly so shit
    trump warns general motors hell cut all its government subsidies in retaliation for closing us auto plants and tweets this is the thanks we get    welcome to the command economy
  
  cutting subsidies centralizes business into government control  
  threatening individual companies in order to force them to comply with government demands is in fact government control
  i always laugh when poltards say certain candidates will turn the us into socialist nation  it already is  and hold onto your balls republicans and trumpites love it  what is every subsidy other than welfare what is every payment to stop a bank or other corporation deemed too big to fail other than welfare
  welfare is for people i dont like  youre thinking of economics
  negotiations dont do anything as china doesnt abide by anything that is an inconvenience to it
trumps trade war costs corporations money  corporations then cut jobs to compensate for trumps trade war  trump now threatens to punish corporations for actions he caused  this would be like if trump ordered the army into a death trap and then said hes going to cut funding to the military because of all the troops that died because of his order
  focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles    utter garbage
  its almost like the professional economists who said tariffs are a terrible idea were correct or something
  you know how when you wear a hat so long you forget youre wearing a hat
  if we removed an entire country from the economy there would be massive consequences    this is literally true of any country you fear mongering fuckhead
  another person who didnt read the tpp  theres literally nothing stopping businesses from suing governments over whatever they like the australian government is currently being sued over their plain packaging laws  the tpp has clauses that specifically protect governments from being sued by businesses where public health concerns drive legislation among other protections  dont get your news from alex jones
  theres literally nothing stopping businesses from suing government  except for sovereign immunity in the united states you cant sue the government unless if they consent to be sued
  that applied only to parties who are exclusively in united states jurisdictions but theres nothing to stop a foreign corporation from suing a government in their own jurisdiction it happens every few years too iirc the united states government was sued over that canadian oil pipeline
trumps been played like a fiddle by gm  
make them payback the gov bail out 51billion taxpayer dollars  let gm burn
  how dies trump trade war relate to gm
  remove botswana    0 shits given  any country eh
  no gm has been on a decline for a while gm wants way to much money for something that will just start falling apart in a few years people are tired of gms shit
  other anons have said this but i just have to reiterate that china doesnt give a fuck about international law theyre not a country you can negotiate with in good faith you absolutely have to put the screws down on them to get results
  they did auto group are the only ones who have
fuck general motors they ruined the plans for putting in public transit rail lines throughout detroit because they bitched about the profits from their bus factory then they moved their bus factory out of michigan they can collapse without a bailout this time or did everyone forget they clearly cant run their bussiness right
    that guys kinda looks like me at an angle still doesnt make me want to get a red car the chinese tricks dont work on me
post the actual reason why gm is closing factories  has no relation to trumps trade economics whatsoever   completely disregards that gm has been a sinking ship forever because of bad business decisions and policies    nice spin
  jej
  fact is america has been living on the backs of the rest of the world    what part of world police didnt you get all you have described is one half of the global market exchange     you and other counties provide those resources for our spoiled first world life style in exchange for military protection and the ability to spend mass amounts of your budget on social services without the services the us provides your home life becomes gimped as the rest of the western world has to fill in to provide counter balance to russia canada trade routes and any missing us trade resources such as oil
  lmfao you tremendous fool these plans have been in the works for at least 5 years my buddy who went to do supply chain for gm out of college 3 years ago told me right when he started that this kind of stuff would start happening blaming it on trump is patently stupid
  lmfao d and e dont exist in the real world of cut throat globalist corporatism you stupid fucking soyboy goddammit 4chan is dead
  if it was the economy then all models would suffer gm is cutting specific models just like ford did its an evolving market you have to make what the customers want or you will be stuck with excess inventory    gm has forfeited the small car business since they suck at it
    osaka japan ends ties with san francisco in protest of comfort women statue    the mayor of osaka japan is ending its sister city relationship with san francisco this week following a dispute over a statue that honors women and girls who were sexually enslaved by japans imperial army during world war ii    the column of strength memorial consists of three women in bronze who are holding hands in a circle as they look into the distance an older woman stands to the side    the statue commemorates comfort women a euphemism for thousands who were forced coerced and deceived into serving men at brothels near the front lines    but the monuments inscriptions about the comfort women present uncertain and onesided claims as historical facts osaka mayor hirofumi yoshimura contended in a 10page letter dated tuesday to mayor london breed of san francisco    sexual assault and harassment may have lasting health repercussions for women  shots  health news  sexual assault and harassment may have lasting health repercussions for women  yoshimura called the information an interpretation that has yet to be proved  adding that the number of women who were enslaved and how they were treated during their time in captivity were embellished
  lol im sure men would love to trade places being coerced into having sex with multiple women who will likely be traumatized for life endure the horrors war entails be crippled injured stabbed shot boomed napalmed gassed etc im sure theyd love that
  no surprise japan doesnt think it did anything wrong during the war
  this i dont know why women think they can be equal to men
  virgin detected    after youve had sex a couple times youll realize its not indiscriminately fun    imagine being forced to fuck your mom thats basically what its like    granted quite likely better than being savaged by combat but comparisons mean nothing a cold is still a cold even when compared with cancer
  putting up a statue scolding some other places embarrassing history is profoundly thoughtless and hypocritical    do they want osaka to put up monuments to san franciscos abuse of early chinese immigrants or native americans or its woeful mishandling of the early aids epidemic    seriously it take real oblivity to actually go through with this idea and not even think of the hypocrisy of it
  whataboutism  this doesnt work because it assumes that not only are the same people in charge since then but that at no point are you allowed to take a stance on anything but if you do you now have to go back and fix every single little mistake you ever done and no im not talking about the statue or san but this bullshit logic and reasoning towards brushing aside anything
  san francisco has far more descendants of chinese and koreans than it does japanese if the city wants to make a display relevant to that they can if youre an american and want to complain about it you should but foreign countries get no say it in you might as well complain that the holocaust museum shouldnt exist because its a gigantic monument to how much germany sucked
  virgin or not argument stand i wouldnt know what its like however i dont see how intercourse with different army men is equivalent to insect with a parent  i didnt say it was fun but compared to conscription is small not irrelevant but small few women in the history of fucking earth were not protected by the state from forced conscription and even in the few countries that do allow they rarely ever see combat   stop pulling red herrings out of your ass
  conscription into the military of your country was associated with duty and honor and if you didnt like it you could have presumably voted your government out of office even japan had elections at the time the same cannot be said for actions imposed on you by a foreign enemy  everyone agrees that conscription into foreign armies sucked which is why people criticize the nazis for forcing poles to fight for them on penalty of being sent to a concentration camp    and historically women didnt fight in exchange after they lost the war the invading armies would rape them en masse and they would be forced to bear the children of the people who killed their brothers and fathers a better end of the deal than being killed sure still probably sucked    virgin or not argument stand i wouldnt know what its like however i dont see how intercourse with different army men is equivalent to insect with a parent  why wouldnt you fuck your mom though is there some reason you would be against it of course you would put that reason into words
  i doubt they were raped by their fathers though so your comparison is retarded compared to other enemy civilians they were safe and well cared for
   statue of young girls   old guy in lower left corner is groping her leg chikanstyle  yup its japan
  the statue is in san francisco
  yeah it was great being a comfort woman beatings starvation stds abortions 90 of them were dead by the end of wwii those who did survive became outcasts ostracized by society many died young due to injuries and diseases inflicted upon them others committed suicide what a wonderful life
    your objection doesnt apply to me but to the concept of accountability itself    theres an obvious difference between taking a stance and putting up a thoughtless and staggeringly hypocritical statue      im american and i say all humans get a say    the museum has a clear core purpose to prevent future holocausts this statue has no such utility its civic masturbation      youre just proving my point youre so ignorant of the reality of sex you literally cant even imagine with any useful accuracy what being a forced sex worker would be like and youre basing your objections on that ignorance        no you moron the point is that being forced to fuck someone you find sexual repulsive is a horrifying trauma    people like you are proof democracy is a really bad idea
  theres an obvious difference between taking a stance and putting up a thoughtless and staggeringly hypocritical statue  yeah the difference consists of your personal opinion united states soldiers did commit mass rape in germany and japan postwar but not in an institutionalized fashion and not on a scale remotely comparable to that of japan or the soviet union    im american and i say all humans get a say  so call for a worldwide referendum on the statue between china and korea theyll have enough votes to keep the statue and then also put a new one on every corner    the museum has a clear core purpose  the purpose of the statue is to raise awareness of a largely forgotten aspect of history
  i think id rather be conscripted and deal with the statistical 515 chance at being a casualty than being sent to a sexslave brothel and having a 100 chance at being beaten and raped by ugly and dirty random women and then having my experience minimized by subhuman faggot animals like you
  not on a scale remotely comparable to that of japan or the soviet union  the us didnt occupy their captured territories to the extent that japan/russia occupied theirs us soldiers raping japanese women is an ongoing problem even today although youre right that it wasnt institutionalized with us soldiers like it was with others    also what does the inscription say
  the point is that being forced to fuck someone you find sexual repulsive is a horrifying trauma  says who prostitutes do it every day and using sex as a tool is a staple for feminists
  says who  everyone that it happens to including the prostitutes you mention     using sex as a tool is a staple for feminists  and for the wartime japanese government
  prostitutes do it every day  this just in slavery now nontraumatizing because of all those people who show up to work every morning    how bad could it be really
  prostitutes do it every day and using sex as a tool is a staple for feminists  for what its worth many prostitutes have horrible lives however i think we need to be clear here that comfort women were not prostitutes they were enslaved tortured beaten and starved the majority of them died while they were enslaved the repeated rapes are only a part of what they suffered through
  go to youtube and search this  dozens if not hundreds of comments by japanese and japaneseamericans telling this never happened and this is just korean chinese dutch etc propagandaand how would the american like if it japan build statues about the native american genocide or the concentration campa they build for the issei and nisei    not a day goes by that i wish i was not born japaneseamerican its all so troublesome
  and how would the american like if it japan build statues about the native american genocide or the concentration camps they build for the issei and nisei    in my experience we might not build statues about those events but youre sure as hell not getting through public school history lessons without learning about them why theyre bad and why they should never happen ever again so im pretty sure americans wouldnt give a shit because unless you slept through history class you already know about and have accepted that sometimes bad shit goes down in your nations history if anything foreign statues to our failures would be amusing like that shrine to jesus who escaped his crucifixion and retired to japan
good fuck california and their leftist propaganda
  how would the american like if it japan build statues about the native american genocide  wed probably respect it    concentration campa they build for the issei and nisei  dont we have our own memorials or museums for that i was taught about a ton of bad shit the us got up to back in public school but from the sounds of things japan doesnt teach their citizens shit
  hypocritical    not really sf has a strong japanese community and many would have been affected by the shit japan got into during wwii
its very simple you guys should search dianne feinstein and russel low  unfortunately there are always some people who are controled by china easily
  i thought this was just troll but you really have no idea how sex works do you    basic question do you really fucking think a resource strapped army and bunch of men with nothing to lose are going to take the time to practice safe sex your ignorance is even more ironic because many of the reasons women suck as front line troops is the exact same reason they lost their lives as military cum dumpsters     really just look up female biology on wiki or something
  im sure that it being in california theres already 12 statues of all the victims by now they would probably revel in it
this is clearly one of dividing operations between us and japan  global alliance for preserving the history of ww ii in asia is behiend this
  this
  then having my experience minimized  lol what the fuck are you talking about some statues built 80 years after the facts 5000 miles away has absolutely no effect on your supposed experience  what is dumb about this whole thing is that   a hundreds of thousands is a very high figure for comfort women  and b why the fuck is san francisco building statues to scold what another civilization did 80 years ago completely unrelated to sf  they would have been better off builing a statue about the armenian holocaust
    because sf has a significant population of asians and japan tends to gloss over their condemnable actions in ww2 even moreso than the us glosses over the japanese internment camps and treatment of natives
  because many panda huggers in california for china its easy to exercise thier influence
  and b why the fuck is san francisco building statues to scold what another civilization did 80 years ago completely unrelated to sf  because many of them probably ended up in san fransisco seeing as how an organization that represents them is headquartered there
  prostitutes are being paid for a service i bet you think that slave labor is bad because factory workers and farmers exist
  the difference is that while even today america still has a troubled relationship with native americans the government and most people will not outright deny that things like the trail of tears happened
  sf has a huge chinese and korean population peoples who made up a majority of comfort women
  most of confort women were japanese
cutting sister city ties  oh woe to san francisco whatever shall it do
japan did nothing wrong fuck the chinks and gooks
  when was the last time you got so fucked that you raised a statue for it
burgers getting pissy when they realize that not everyone has guilt tripped themselves for the past 60 years like they have  what else is new   this is like trudeau throwing a crying fit because he found out that saudi arabia doesnt have progressive liberal values and more people like oil than they like canada
  i dont think its that but more that japan most of the world really doesnt spend every waking moment fixating on im so sowwy so so sowwy beating themselves with their reparationswhips while crawling on their hands and knees to kiss the shoes of minorities     like westerners do
  like the other anons said japans government actively denies that things like comfort women or the rape of nanking happened and has not once issued a formal apology to china or korea for the events of ww2 japanese history classes to this day portray japan in ww2 as a victim of things like the tokyo firebombing and atomic bombs not as a perpetrator of evil in its own right    in comparison no one of any influence in the us denies the trail of tears and while things like internment camps or the atomic bombs are often the subject of attempted justification at least everyone agrees they happened and that regardless of whether they were a necessary evil or not the us is fully responsible for it    as a comparison postww2 austria adopted the narrative that they were the first victims of the nazis and werent to blame for any of the atrocities committed by nazi germany all while continuing to promote former nazis to positions of power it wasnt until just a few decades ago that international pressure forced them to admit involvement in nazi crimes point being just because someone isnt japanese korean or chinese doesnt mean they dont have a right to be upset by japans denial of its history
  admitting responsibility for past crimes  guilt tripping  progressive liberal values
    no they actively deny it while neatly suppressing their peoples knowledge of the topic through a neartotal lack of mention in their history education    itd be like if germanys only acknowledgment of the holocaust and their aggressor status in ww2 was a single paragraph in their history textbooks
if this sex slave story was true japans goverment would not deny it they has never denied the existence of comfort women they were prstitutes and it was llegal at that time  but what that statue is saying is totally fiction no evidence at all
until now there are some uncertain testimonies thats all no witness no record nothing
if immigrants from vietnam build a statue in tokyo and it says american soldiers raped killed 100millions of vietnamese women without any objective evidence would americans still say sorry  i dont think so
  no they actively deny it while neatly suppressing their peoples knowledge of the topic through a neartotal lack of mention in their history education  if youtube comments are anything to go by and they certainly may not be theyre actually being taught that koreans are primarily at fault for comfort women      that depends does tokyo have a large vietnamese population    also the no objective evidence claim is what the japanese have been using seemingly ignoring the evidence their own soldiers provided through documents    
commiefornia is such a degenerate shitheap
  a government would not deny a crime if its true  oh you sweet naive child
  you dont get the point it doesnt mutter of immigrant population   and the site you show me doesnt prove anything some people say japan did bad thing thats all is there any objective eveidence without old womens picture
  well the sad thing is that many would
japan was fucked up during ww2 
  is there any objective eveidence  theres documentation from japanese soldiers detailing how the comfort women were used which japan has worked extremely hard to suppress and keep hidden theres documentation from us army officials from the 1940s with interviews of comfort women and japanese soldiers theres accounts from soldiers of other armies despite japans best efforts more evidence continues to surface theres a video shot in 1944 showing a grave of comfort women after japanese soldiers shot them    
columbus is actually really important to both us history and the history of just about every nation in the americas to celebrate the comparatively less important natives then him is to put pc nonsense over actual history
  american soldiers raped okinawan women because mainland japanese force okinawa to host the american military base against the will of the okinawans
  japan is responsible for american rapists  nani      by this logic we should celebrate hitler day in europe due to his significance in european history
  ah i see now so all those us citizens of japanese decent that were herded into our own version of concentration camps just so we could keep an eye on them are irrelevant got it     im not saying sex trafficking didnt happen in war time but why bring it up now and why only for chinese people there were hundreds if not thousands of german women raped by russian troops during wwii i guess they deserved it though right i mean china has never done anything unfair to its own people or the mongols or the uyghurs     yes im being facetious but i stand by my point that bringing this up now and concentrating solely on one offender and one victim of a war that involved many victims and many offenders is ridiculous and hypocritical especially since a us city is erecting this monument
    s an obvious difference between taking a stance and putting up a thoughtless and staggeringly hypocritical statue  yeah the difference consists of your personal opinion united states soldiers did commit mass rape in germany and japan postwar but not in an institutionalized fashion and not on a scale remotely comparable to that of japan or the soviet union    some rape is ok if the government allowing it to happen turns a blind eye
  we should celebrate hitler  you mean you dont
   do it every day   just in slavery now nontraumatizing because of all those people who show up to work every morning    nice false equivalency between a group kidnapped and taken to a foreign land where their survival depended on them doing forced labor versus a woman who has made a choice to perform sex acts in exchange for money
  there were hundreds if not thousands of german women raped by russian troops during wwii  they kinda did
  you barely deserve a bullet
  yes im being facetious but i stand by my point that bringing this up now and concentrating solely on one offender and one victim of a war that involved many victims and many offenders is ridiculous and hypocritical  this isnt new the koreans chinese and filipinos have been complaining for decades that japan refuses to properly take responsibility for its heinous acts japans offered small apologies for certain acts while trying to suppress the release of information that would be more damning many countries have apologized and tried to make legitimate amends for what happened in the past but japan thinks the past should never be mentioned maybe its a cultural difference but thats simply not going to fly for the rest of the world
  why is it san franciscos responsibility to bring that up in the form of a monument shouldnt they be concentrating on clearing the hundreds of pounds of human feces off the street priorities anon
  why is it san franciscos responsibility to bring that up in the form of a monument  have you ever looked at the population of san francisco the statues would be relevant to many of them why should japan get their panties in a twist over a statue shouldnt they be worried about their dwindling population and economy priorities anon
  small apologies    no abe you cant really apologise for something whose existence you minimalize or dont even acknowledge there is absolutely no reason at all why japan shouldnt formally admit culpability to all the blood they shed other than national pride
osaka must have signed on to the himtoo movement
  obliviously china funded that they have a hand in most leftist bullshit
the great artist with no sin casts stones across the pacific  the artist is a coward picking on the peaceful japanese but fears erecting a statue of muhammed the patriarch of male chauvinism misogyny and war  leftist liberal artists are the problem
  myopic in the least please quit lecturing western men go to saudi arabia or iran and try to change them  in america you can walk the streets as a woman alone or with a male friend or gay lover not there
  japan is pacified they are forward looking and the past is just that  the past those who dig up their own demons of the past are unhappily haunted in the present and future  those who dig up other peoples past to advance selfish agendas are evil      based anon and much needed bump
  for what its worth sf only approved the monument no public money went into it
  i we could all end ties with san fagcisco  someone please drop a nuke on that aids infested shithole already
  japan is pacified they are forward looking and the past is just that  the past  hilarious they have their own memorials for their fallen soldiers and civilians yet other countries are apparently not supposed to do the same this isnt a statue in japan theyre trying to control what other countries are allowed to memorialize    those who dig up other peoples past to advance selfish agendas are evil  more like those who dig up a past we want buried are evil other countries have ugly pasts guess what they gave a proper apology and people moved on until japan does that then i hope they keep getting their past thrown in their faces
  nip detected    two bombs wasnt enough
  theres a mountain of that shit its a very common wartime practice the fact that youre even skeptical means youre a gullible fuck    two seconds on google for some babysfirst level shit just for you 
  this
  they still do from time to time that is why all us military in japan have a curfew okinawa wants the military bases gone
  thinking its just the ones who die from it that have it rough    clueless entitled roastie spotted
    this    there is a big fucking difference between recording history and trying to impose guilt on people for shit that happened at a time before most of us were even born       based japan calling out sjw virtue signalling nonsense for what it is
  says the clueless incel that has never once had it rough in the life its parents gave    ps retard casualty isnt a synonym for death
  says the clueless incel that has never once had it rough in the life its parents gave  literally baseless accusations    are you mentally retarded you cant possibly know anything in depth about a persons life from a single post on an anonymous image board     topkek what a total idiot
  should it be more than a single paragraph  yes  your insistence that   his insistence is that governments shouldnt lie about and try to suppress their past  oh noooo your greatest weapon guilt trips are ineffective   it caused the mayor of osaka to start autistically screeching and renege on their sister city status if the desire effect was raising awareness it seems to have been highly effective   even moreso than r9k  weird you would say that when youre robot personified
    holy shit you are fucked in the head    first off he wasnt even talking about casualty its piss obvious he means thousand yard stare    second off saying someone must have lived an easy life if they disagree with you actually quite ironically proves that its you that has lived life on easy mode the only way you could think the world is simple enough to fit in your little box of political correctness is because you have never experienced firsthand just how utterly insane reality is    people as stupid as you should literally die
   is meant for 
    oh please the average anon has been through more shit in a day than the average roastie will go through in her entire life
      if the problem was simply that japan refused to apologise thatd be one thing but its not that instead japanese schools brush over the topic as quickly as possible and japanese politicians actively deny that any war crimes happened its not an issue of guilt here its literally revising history
  the ideology many powerful japanese politicians and figures including abe support denies the existence of any japanese war crimes and calls for the military limits placed upon japan to be removed that doesnt sound pacified to me
  ah i see now so all those us citizens of japanese decent that were herded into our own version of concentration camps just so we could keep an eye on them are irrelevant got it     no one denies the existence of japanese internment camps and while some people try to justify them they at least take the view of it being a necessary evil    im not saying sex trafficking didnt happen in war time but why bring it up now and why only for chinese people there were hundreds if not thousands of german women raped by russian troops during wwii i guess they deserved it though right i mean china has never done anything unfair to its own people or the mongols or the uyghurs     noone denies that german women were raped and the fact that china has also done awful things is irrelevant comfort women were from more countries than just china korea the phillipines even australia and the netherlands    yes im being facetious but i stand by my point that bringing this up now and concentrating solely on one offender and one victim of a war that involved many victims and many offenders is ridiculous and hypocritical especially since a us city is erecting this monument    the us doesnt deny the trail of tears or other historical evils
  i got raped this is the worst    yeah you didnt get horse piss injected into your veins like the unit 731 pows you werent fed lethal amounts of cocaine you werent stitched together to another person you werent subject to all the heinous shit done in curiosity you didnt get your arms and legs blown off you werent a baby beaten to death by a shovel like the japanese did in nanking     but your vajayjay got bruised and your pride hurt so nobody has ever suffered more than you
  why would japan want to spend more on its military it couldnt be because of the rise of china and an increasingly isolationist us no it must be because they want to commit more war crimes all over asia
  japan has apologized multiple times to korea and china and has even provided them with developmental aid china refusing to bury the hatchet despite these overtures has led to a generation of politicians like abe who resent having to apologize and dont do it anymore    its not called apology fatigue for nothing
  why shouldnt they what would it accomplish all it would do would fill the japanese with selfloathing
  if someone tries to defame you would you be silent hardly autistic screeching
  yes i would show my palms stare down my jury and say i have absolutely nothing to hide i would let whatever investigation they wanted to perform happen unimpeded and entirely transparent so that when they find nothing i can have the smuggest shiniest asshole this planet has ever seen this is the consensus textbook behavior of what an innocent person would do that youre pretending to not understand this really says a lot about our society bottom text
  so what will you do when stacy from highschool accuses you with rape regardless of your ego
  there is no jury or investigation in the court of public opinion its only based off of who can pay to have the loudest voice the chinese and koreans in sf have a vested interest in being seen as victims as they think it will allow them to coerce japan to do its bidding by bringing down international pressure on it     the japanese naturally do not want to be beholden to a foreign people in this way hence them attempting to defend themselves     then we have selfrighteous autists like yourself in this thread demanding that japan break down crying and subject themselves to satisfy your twisted idea of justice
  japan has offered soft apologies its also retracted apologies told other countries to stay out of their affairs white washed their history and used textbooks with fabricated history to make sure their students grow up believing what the government preaches and theyve actively suppressed the release of information concerning comfort women while trying to pressure allies to only conform to japans version of history    the fact of the matter is japan has their version of history and it differs from everyone elses version of how it happened and then japans government gets angry whenever countries wont abide by the history theyve deemed appropriate this idea that theyre looking forward instead of looking backward is a load of crap visit any of japans war memorials or history museums and youll see theyre quite proud of their history theyre happy to look into the past but only if it shows japan in a good light and theyve taken it to the point where theyre even trying to manipulate how other countries are allowed to view japans past
  thats a good answer thanks i still think its dumb but at least its understandably dumb
  well said
  look up the bio warfare research unit unit 471 or something i always forget the number but really they made hell look like a spa and we gave them immunity in exchange for the data
  what are you even talking about did you reply to the wrong comment or something
  sidenote it is impossible to reject suffering match ups like this while supporting intersectionalism without being a gargantuan hypocrite if its fair game to rank the oppressed its fair game to rank oppressions
  i agree we should put a monument to the rape of nanking and a monument to unit 731 the two adjacent corners of the block after seeing how evenhanded we are surely the osakans will be won over by our dedication to preserving history      this is not advice that any competent criminal defense lawyer would ever give you
  no surprise japan doesnt think it did anything wrong during the war    the japanese saw what happened and continues to happen to germany and quite wisely refuse to apologize for anything knowing that once they do theyll have to apologize for everything forever
  tfw no hostage
no49reportit was recorded in 1944    the us army report no49 issued in 1944 clearly states that korean comfort women were well paid prostitutes indicating they were not sex slaves deprived of freedom   contents  the report shows how the japanese recruited these korean comfort girls the conditions under which they lived and worked their relations with and reaction to the japanese soldier and their understanding of the military situation    a comfort girl is nothing more than a prostitute or professional camp follower    the interrogations show the average korean comfort girl to be about twentyfive years old uneducated childish and selfish she is not pretty either by japanese of caucasian standards    in myitkyina the girls were usually quartered in a large two story house usually a school building with a separate room for each girl there each girl lived slept and transacted business     in myitkina their food was prepared by and purchased from the house master as they received no regular ration from the japanese army   they lived in nearluxury in burma in comparison to other places this was especially true of their second year in burma they lived well because their food and material was not heavily rationed and they had plenty of money with which to purchase desired articles   they were able to buy cloth shoes cigarettes and cosmetics to supplement the many gifts given to them by soldiers who had received comfort bags from home    while in burma they amused themselves by participating in sports events with both officers and men and attended picnics entertainments and social dinners they had a phonograph and in the towns they were allowed to go shopping    the girls were allowed the prerogative of refusing a customer    in the latter part of 1943 the army issued orders that certain girls who had paid their debt could return home some of the girls were thus allowed to return to korea
  who will likely be traumatized for life endure the horrors war entails be crippled injured stabbed shot boomed napalmed gassed etc im sure theyd love that  nonsequitur  the alternative to being sex slaves wasnt sending the women to war it was just not raping them  and in any case they werent given a choice either way  if i were just interested in saving my own skins my instincts tell me be a soldier rather than a pow
  the japanese saw what happened and continues to happen to germany  japan as a country should make whole those who were wronged in order to benefit japan  that doesnt necessarily mean individual japanese persons have reason to be ashamed if theyre not supporting or indifferent to the unnecessary suffering of others theyre not doing anything wrong  nobodys asking japan to sacrifice anything nobody can obtain justice for the victims of the imperial armys atrocities at this point but they can make whole their descendants whose families had been destroyed to benefit japanese  it wouldnt even be a difficult or expensive ask for a country like japan if national pride is a concern im more proud of my country when it isnt known to ignore its own commission of horrific war crimes its great that different cultures do things differently but to an extent we shouldnt celebrate saudis lopping off heads of sorcerers and neither should we chalk up official ignorance of war crimes as cultural difference  what if i were to break into your house tomorrow and hold your family hostage and rape your girls for the glory of my familywould your response be well judging by how germans are being treated i for one think we should let it be water under the bridge
  of course everyone who was a victim of a war crime volunteered to be raped and often murdered    and then countless women volunteered to be tortured and killed too and have pictures taken    everyone who says otherwise remember its a conspiracy    and if you find evidence thats just evidence of how deep the conspiracy goes that folks who fabricate convincing evidence
  the japanese murdered a lot of the women they raped
  based japan killing 1 in 3 american captive and for raping then killing all the chinese korean and dutch women they captured they dindu nuffin they good boys thats why japan got billions after the war from the allies and didnt have to pay for damages or return everything they stole from the war
  they were lured under false pretenses    the nature of this service was not specified but it was assumed to be work connected with visiting the wounded in hospitals rolling bandages and generally making the soldiers happy the inducement used by these agents was plenty of money an opportunity to pay off the family debts easy work and the prospect of a new life in a new land singapore on the basis of these false representations many girls enlisted for overseas duty and were rewarded with an advance of a few hundred yen    of course theres more than enough evidence to suggest many werent treated so kindly
  japan as a country should make whole those who were wronged in order to benefit japan  holy fuck then i guess mongolians owe a massive benefit to all of asia the egyptians to all of northern africa the greeks to all of europe and the chileans to all of south america  fuck off with your post ex facto reparations bullshit
  funny thing is japan demanded and get reparations in fact they got reparations for the nuking and for the internment camps somehow japan gets babied and receives apologies constantly but no one can criticize them for their fucking bullshit
  holy fuck then i guess mongolians owe a massive benefit to all of asia the egyptians to all of northern africa the greeks to all of europe and the chileans to all of south america  yes and no go far back enough in history and ethical lines blur because lack of industrialized society people desperate sometimes theft murder even invasion was just a matter of desperation if your tribes lands werent fertile people were starving we still can say it would be nice if everyone respected everyone elses rights but we cant pretend destitute peasant farmers fighting destitute peasant farmers for a better chance of their familys survival is as bad as folks living a comfortable standard of living just fucking up random innocent peoples lives to the point of horrific atrocities out of romantic notions of empire building    fuck off with your post ex facto reparations bullshit    it isnt feasible to right all historic wrongs but there is also a danger in creating a precedent where anyone can violate anyone elses rights and that any resulting benefit inherited by future generations by the offender be considered legitimate gains so long as a generation has passed its dangerous because plenty of people are willing to do fucked up shit if it benefits their kids    where should we draw the line thats a complicated question but when emotions still run raw over a particular instance of war crimes last century i dont think recognition by one state to the descendants of those wronged is too much to ask for
  japan didnt get reparations they got the opposite of versailles please lets not have another fucking world war 20 years from now this time with ubiquitious nuclear weapons
  
  when youre so perennially butthurt you have to go off on an autistic tantrum over your own strawman greentext that nobody said but you  imagine the sheer agony that is this miserable retards day to day life
  this is not advice that any competent criminal defense lawyer would ever give you  especially the part about staring down the jury any defender would tell you to not look at or even acknowledge the jury whatsoever
  imagine living in a world where snark replaced argument perhaps thats more honest i mean really did argument ever persuade
  are you serious did you read the article
  werent unit 731s victims almost entirely chinese civilians   the discussion was would you rather be a conscript in the army of be forced into prostitution if youre forced into sex slavery then you are being raped by definition however statistically the large majority of soldiers in the war or any war make it through the war safe and sound so its would you rather have a 100 chance at being raped repeatedly or a statistically much smaller chance at being injured or killed as a soldier    your entire argument here is literally would you rather face the worst most extreme experience faced by a soldier or pow or the experienced faced by every forced prostitute you can see how disingenuous that argument is
  his argument is deluded autistic screeching that doesnt deserve anything beyond ridicule
  this and other present day situations are about the only issues really downplayed by us and mostly because its political suicide to admit the us troops can do wrong its not juicy enough for the mainstream media to grab onto and the average burger doesnt give a fuck about the organizations that try to combat them     on the flip side well be the first to scream were repeating history such as recreating japanese internment camps mexican edition
  they got reparations by negotiating for it at that time not half a century after the fact
  515   source
  if were talking japan only the japanese deployed nearly 8 million troops both army and navy and lost nearly 25 million soldiers so the rate is more like 2530 if were talking japanese only however the rate drops like a rock for america the us deployed over 12 million men bye the end of the war and had a mere 400000 casualties thats a 3 rate looking up the militaryonly rates of other nations would take too long but for reference the rate for total casualties civilian and military vs total population of participating nations is 3 meaning your odds of being killed regardless of line of work was 3 in a hundred so the rate of dying as a solider could be as low as any other job america or many times the rate japan 515 is probably a good average of the two rates but i cant verify it     size of us military and military deaths   japanese deaths and total deaths   rough size of japanese military      theres also the aspect that its the conduct of individual soldiers vs a government action rape by a us serviceman can be considered the actions of bad individuals mass incarceration of us citizens and immigrants by ethnic origin cannot its the key reason for the starkly different reactions americans in general are afraid of giving government too much power to mass incarcerate you could be next etc on the other hand they generally understand theres only so much you can do to stop individual rapists unless of course it can be proven that the government is turning a blind eye by failing to investigate and prosecute rape cases which then loops back to being a government action and no longer the crimes of an individual
  outliers raped men rape women and men forced to be celibate are more likely to there isnt mass rape groups like japan did and its silly to try to downplay japan or upplay the us
fucking japs never accepted their role in ww2 damn you hirohito for calling a cease fire we had more nukes waiting for you back on tinian

  imagine being forced to fuck your mom  well nofap can wait until next month
  because they can always compare themselves to what the germans did to the jews during ww2 japanese did nothing wrong as just being perverted sex addicts the lesser of the two evil so to speak in a war its a common motto to burn down all the village and rape all women the american did that in vietnam and in iraq and afghanistan but you dont hear that on the news its a non issue when compared to the japanese why let others get away with it and not them should iraq and afghanistan have some deserve to have a rape memorial also its best not to talk about the past history of by not having any more war in the future one can only dreams
  you are absolutely right women are more intelligent and they dont go around raping people
 you have some mental illness please get professional help
  or like a holocaust memorial in every major western city hmmmm
  lol     that is because the american only get involved with the war within the last couple of months of the war for the land grabs johnny come lately of ww2 its the russian that did all the work
  karma is a bitch     japan got raped with two atomic bomb and they are still getting rape monthly by the usa in okinawa     but seriously most of my friends would not join the military if raping is off the menu most of them are trained killers in their youth by playing games like counter strike and fortnight they are also into raping by watching all those japanese hentai on /b/
  japanese did nothing wrong as just being perverted sex addicts the lesser of the two evil so to speak  unit 731  nanking massacre  bataan death march  probably still the lesser evil compared to nazi germany but dont pretend that they were just sex addicts similarly youd have to reach to compare imperial japan to american conduct in vietnam iraq and afghanistan the scale of the my lai massacre pales in comparison to nanking and the cruelty shown in abu gharib where nobody died not that torture is a walk in the park is absolutely nothing compared to bataan    unit 731 is probably the most heinous shit because they got away with it scott free by threatening to destroy their research results the germans failed to leverage their findings in this way    should iraq and afghanistan have some deserve to have a rape memorial also  iraq could certainly build an memorial to abu gharib but i think that has gotten overshadowed entirely by the current isis situation not to mention by the previous war with iran and the atrocities under saddam      im forever astounded by the ability of people to confuse wwi where america shows up in the last year to wwii where america was an active though undeclared participant through the entire war even before december 1941 america was collaborating with the uk and the ussr via lend lease and intelligence sharing a majority of soviet locomotives and transport trucks were produced in america allowing the soviets to focus on combat production and a significant fraction of soviet combat vehicle replacements in 1941 were made in britain though through the whole war british vehicles made up only 1015 of all soviet combat vehicles which helped keep the soviets in the war that first tumultuous year the soviets certainly shed a lot of blood for victory even there they get beaten by the chinese though most of those were civilian deaths but they certainly didnt win it alone
  that is called fighting in a war by the side line without officially announcement declaration of war its a war crime that is against the geneva conventions of 1906 and 1929 usa is a will known war criminal which was never held responsible for causing the axis power to lose ww2 spineless war cheater
  who made you the king of post nazi
  im sure there are a few japanese living in san francisco that is totally against it unless you think those few minorities also have no rights as us citizen
  are you serious are you an official 4chin mod
  damn its like they should go on a march or something perhaps through batan
                          oblivity  lmao  hey look its a fucking nip trying to shame westerners for remembering history as it happened and not some specious rewriting of it god i hate you subhuman island monkeys so much  how do i know jap spelling errors and grammar makes no sense
  usa is a will known war criminal  this english  i laughed    also participating/fighting the us providing material support is not the same as the us fighting in the war without declaring which is what the geneva conventions are specifically against providing material support can still be considered a casus belli but is not a crime in itself by your standard literally half the world was committing war crimes by selling anything from weapons to merely food to either side without declaring war
  grammar nazi   doesnt know there are people typing on mobile with auto correct opposite to a keyboard warrior sitting at home in his underwear   attacking the person instead of the main subject     fact is all those japanese that committed those criminal acts are all dead asking their descendants for reparations is wrong because they were not the ones that committed the crime     according to your logic we can put you in jail if your dad killed someone and since we cant catch him and he is also dead already just to teach you a listen and make you remember what your family did wrong in the past
  lets just say its supposed to be a one on one fight in a boxing match but in between rounds one of your friends in the corner jumps in and give you a steroid shot just for a pump up causing the opponent to lose that is fine to you by your logic     no that is absolutely wrong and criminal
by mahatma gandhi  his quote an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind    i think the emperor of japan hirohito is already dead while visiting disneyland back in the 80s     its best for all of us to just end this by putting it behind us and move forward
  no your logic the opponents coach is cheating by training him the sports equipment shop that gave him his gloves is cheating by giving him free shit the companies that sponsor him are cheating by giving him money and his fans are cheating by giving morale support and free shit all of these things are outside aid that can affect the match but nobody tries to ban the fans because everyone can cheer for whoever they want without stepping into the ring if they start giving him steroids undeclared combat units ex russian units pretending to be ukrainian rebels then they cross the line into illegal behavior it has to be serious direct combat contributions not material or intelligence aid otherwise world trade would come to a standstill any time a nation went to war with another    seriously by your logic america should be charged with war crimes for sending oil to japan during the sinojapanese war and then they should be charged again when america decided to stop sending oil because japan aligned themselves with germany in turn japan should be charged with war crimes for allying germany without declaring war on britain germany should be charged with war crimes for aiding the finns during the winter war without declaring war on the ussr and so on and so forth basically every nation on earth would be charged with war crimes because fucking every nation was sending some sort of aid to the battling nations of wwii but not every nation was at war    again its only a war crime if you commit your combat forces without declaring war trade in military equipment or other material is not a crime
    again its only a war crime if you commit your combat forces without declaring war trade in military equipment or other material is not a crime    hyde chose a number of officers to assess german pow recruits for the special missions behind enemy lines one of the officers chosen was first lieutenant peter viertel united states marine corps    
    on december 8 1941 congress approved a resolution declaring war with japan the senate unanimously approved the resolution 820 on december 11 1941 congress approved a resolution declaring war with germany the senate unanimously approved the resolution 880    on december 8 1941 congress approved a resolution declaring war with japan the senate unanimously approved the resolution 820    
    during the night of september 2 1944 germanborn socialist and passionate antinazi jupp kappius became the first oss agent to parachute into germany     
        franklin d roosevelt also made himself guilty in that he wanted and provoked the attack on pearl harbour however this was only discovered 60 years later by a former naval officer named robert stinnett in relation to that one expert said an act like this was required in order that the american people be immediately and totally pivoted around to war with a trade embargo roosevelt forced the japanese into coercive measures which came to the fore in a counterattack against the embargo  thus to an attack on pearl harbour in which there were 2403 dead and 1178 wounded to mourn as well as the destruction of 14 warships and 320 destroyed or severely damaged aircraft 90 percent of all us americans were initially opposed to an entry into the second world war that is to say the third world war however after pearl harbour the people also screamed for war by the way roosevelt learnt of the imminent attack through the secret services
  with a trade embargo roosevelt forced the japanese into coercive measures  for most people the why did you make me hit you thing is reserved for elementary school bullies but i guess some people think the whole world runs off it
        stinnett has worked for many years on the question of whether american leaders civilian and military had foreknowledge of the japanese attack on americas army and navy bases on oahu his review of the diplomatic evidence merely confirms what charles beard george morgenstern harry elmer barnes charles callan tansill percy greaves james martin and other revisionists have firmly established that roosevelt secretary of state cordell hull and secretary of war henry stimson desired and provoked war with japan and that they certainly knew that japan was going to war a day or more before the december 7 attacks which hit us bases in the philippines as well
    pearl harbor case closed    day of deceit the truth about fdr and pearl harbor by robert b stinnett new york simon and schuster touchstone 2000 paperback 399 pages index illustrations maps  pearl harbor betrayed the true story of a man and a nation under attack by michael gannon new york henry holt 2001 hardcover 340 pages index illustrations maps  reviewed by theodore okeefe    as the sixtieth anniversary of what president franklin roosevelt called a date which will live in infamy and who would know that better than he passes the controversy over pearl harbor is as lively as ever in no other area of the history of the second world war have revisionists had quite as much success in convincing a broad section of public that the official version has it wrong that it is president franklin roosevelt not local commanders general walter short and admiral husband kimmel who should bear the blame for the devastating japanese attack    two recent books argue that admiral husband kimmel in particular was gravely wronged by his superiors not merely after december 7 1941 but in the weeks and months before one robert stinnetts day of deceit is radically revisionist claiming to abound in new evidence for a conspiracy involving the president the war and navy departments the army chief of staff and the chief of naval operations among many other participants the other michael gannons pearl harbor betrayed makes no explicit accusations of conspiracy nor does it seriously fault americas confrontational diplomacy visavis japan in the years leading up to the attack odd as it might seem this reviewer found the second the more satisfying book
      by the way roosevelt learnt of the imminent attack through the secret services as did george w bush yet he roosevelt did not respond in order to prevent something any more than george w bush did when the need came to prevent the terror disaster of september 11th 2001
jesus christ are you flipping out quoting random articles doesnt suddenly give you a coherent argument you need to be able to stitch this all together        i like how you are citing operations that occurred after war was declared as part of your argument            pearl harbor conspiracy  everyone who believes in this fundamentally misunderstands american foreknowledge of the attack did america think japan was going to attack yes at some unknown time place and method    to the timing it was a political reality that japan would have to react to the embargo at some point as they could not sustain their war on china without crucial oil however fdr was banking on the japanese not doing shit until after germany had attacked america in some way every war plan had america backing up the uk and later ussr first and dealing with the japanese problem later from this perspective american war planners didnt think japan would ever attack first    to the place america believed that a japanese attack would strike south towards the philippines and prepared as such by sending most of their equipment down there for the eventual attack a military strike on pearl harbor was considered unlikely due to the distance from japan and shallow depth of the harbor which brings us to method    to the method america thought any attack on pearl harbor would have to be sabotage by spies and thus took precautions to prevent such an attack grouping up all the ships to make them harder to sabotage but also easier to bomb further carrierbased aircraft were still considered second string to battleships even by the japanese further reducing the perceived threat of air attack    taking all this together any warning of imminent attack on pearl harbor would have been laughed off as unlikely further letting the japanese attack would have been strategically insane given the danger to the crucial ships and fuel reserves at pearl
     not     4 roosevelt with all these knowledge decided not to send warnings to the base of the coming attack and let it happen as a reason to rally the population from against entering the war to for it
    stinnett has worked for many years on the question of whether american leaders civilian and military had foreknowledge of the japanese attack on americas army and navy bases on oahu    stinnetts attempts to establish that americas civilian and military leadership was or should have been privy to the japanese plans for pearl harbor through the interception and reading of certain of japans naval codes is harder to credit a fair amount of his case rests on a sizable number of messages from ships and units of the japanese navy that stinnett was able to make public for the first time not without diligent effort under provisions of the freedom of information act    a central contention of day of deceit is that american cryptanalysts solved the main operational code of the japanese navy designated as the 5num code for its five number groups by the code breakers well in advance of the postpearl harbor solution date accepted by most historians on page 71 stinnett writes that not only the americans but also the british the dutch and the chiang kaisheks nationalist chinese had solved the 5num code by fall of 1941 here however he is writing of three other codes as well so the reader must leaf back to page 23 to discover that recovery of the 5num code was effected by the us before april 1941    
    i always thought it was interesting no aircraft carriers were at pearl harbor at the time of the attack but 8 of 9 pacific fleet battleships were battleships were widely considered to be obsolete     
    from this perspective american war planners didnt think japan would ever attack first    you did not read the link if you would have you will know that the time and place of attack was intercepted by capturing and decoding of the enemy message guessing not really required     tldr roosevelt and his cabinet wants to enter the war by provoking japan to fire the first shot and let 3500 american citizens die as reasons to rally the population into war roosevelt is guilty of war like aggression and being a warmonger     its not a conspiracy theory anymore as you can read it thanks to the freedom information act
  american war planners didnt think japan would ever attack first      a diplomatic message from secretary of state hull the hull note of november 26 1941 harshly stated that the japanese withdraw all military and police forces from china and from french indochina this was a reversal of the last us proposal submitted by hull on june 2128 foreign minister togo felt that the hull note required the denial of the nanking regime and the abolition of the tripartite alliance and thus must at least be an ultimatum without time limit29 however as the note did leave japan an alternative to war namely concession to american demands and did not even express an intention to cease negotiations it cannot be seen as an ultimatum from the perspective of international law30 while the japanese may have felt that they could not accede to such demands and thus were provoked into war
  doesnt surprise me  california critizising the japan goverment when their own goverment fucking nuked japan
the hull note is considered as a declaration of war by the japanese     as perceived by the japanese the american embargo of oil and other resources necessary to power the japanese war machine certainly rose to such a level of severity that a military response was justified since 1940 the americans were visibly trying to deny japan access to the natural resources of southeast asia that had come to be regarded as vital to the empireís security and wellbeing33 these pressures especially the embargo imposed by president roosevelt in the summer of 1941 were perceived as a return to the past century of western pressures and insults beginning with commodore perryís opening of japan in 185354 and the unequal treaties of 185834 despite these perceptions of impending doom and the slights to the japanese national pride
  to mention also the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki where 250000 people die were mostly civilian     that is an absolute criminal act
  you did not read the link if you would have you will know that the time and place of attack was intercepted by capturing and decoding of the enemy message guessing not really required   at least from this anons link       there is no reliable evidence found by the author that establishes how much of the 5num text could be deciphered translated and read by naval cryptographers in 1941 p 334 n 18    which would indicate we have no idea how much of those intercepted messages was readable
japans declaration of war in response from the hull note before he attack on pearl harbour     that no agreement which either has   concluded with any third power or powers shall be interpreted   by it in such a way as to conflict with the fundamental purpose   of this agreement the establishment and preservation of peace   throughout the pacific area it is presumed that the above   provision has been proposed with a view to restrain japan from   fulfilling its obligations under the tripartite pact when the   united states participates in the war in europe and as such   it cannot be accepted by the japanese government      
  only the americans but also the british the dutch and the chiang kaisheks nationalist chinese had solved the 5num code by fall of 1941
  thats the authors claims but as in the quotation provided later in the paragraph the author admits that he has no evidence to support his claim
  naval cryptographers    those guys along with the books reviewer are amateurs compares to the intelligence agencies and the warmongering in waiting and hoping for war roosevelt and cohort the attack was planned months ago on both sides you cant read or maybe you want to stuck your head into a hole in the sand maybe you really think roosevelt is too dumb and forgot his own plan for war aggression roosevelt knew 1 day before the attack take place but not to prevent it to start a war by letting the enemy fire the first shot to rally the population
  roosevelt knew 1 day before the attack take place but not to prevent it to start a war by letting the enemy fire the first shot to rally the population  again there isnt any evidence to support that theory that is not to say that its wrong this theory is pretty much unfalsifiable but there isnt any justification for one to believe that its true
      that later part was written by the book reviewer okeefe     you need to go back to elementary school and play in the sandbox adults are talking here be quite and be gone
  no its a quotation from the book heres the unabbreviated segment  stinnett could have spared his readers a good deal of confusion and frustration by featuring more prominently a statement buried at the bottom of a long footnote that seems to be his clearest and most unambiguous statement on the matter there is no reliable evidence found by the author that establishes how much of the 5num text could be deciphered translated and read by naval cryptographers in 1941 p 334 n 18
  no they really are in the book i pulled the book up just to be sure and it is indeed in the notes section theres even an additional section in chapter 8 where he says it right in the middle of his argument
  5num  was only one of the three codes in 1941 what about the month and date    does matter to you if its decoded in april or some in december which one of the code is the one you are looking for roosevelt already got two of them decoded and he already know because the declaration of war was already given to him the other code is coordinate of attack but he dont have to care about that as he is letting the japanese to fire the first shot     if pearl harbor would have decoded it themselves they would have been saved and probability of engagement and ruin roosevelts plan for rallying the population to vote for war
  you owe the actual book what is num5     its attack time and place
  was only one of the three codes in 1941  yes but that was the code used to encrypt these messages in question which wouldve informed the united states of an imminent attack given that they could decipher them the main question of the text being whether they did decipher it or not    the other code is coordinate of attack but he dont have to care about that as he is letting the japanese to fire the first shot   again theres no evidence to suggest that the us was capable of decoding these messages     roosevelt already got two of them decoded and he already know because the declaration of war was already given to him the other code is coordinate of attack but he dont have to care about that as he is letting the japanese to fire the first shot  the declaration of war it was written in a way that it wasnt an actual severing of diplomacy or a declaration of war the japanese gave to the embassy in washington didnt get decoded and delivered to roosevelt until after the attack had already begun although it was intended that it reach him before     ruin roosevelts plan for rallying the population to vote for war  im not sure what you mean by getting the population to vote for war voters in the united states dont vote for war congress does
  population to vote for war voters in the united states dont vote for war congress does      will back in the days when it comes to a world war involvement yes congress vote for war but they will not if 90 population were going against it     its not like today when we invade thirdworld shit hole country where the president dont even ask before we march into iraq     you bet your ass the if we ever going to have a war with russia congress will not vote for war if 90 population dont want to
  dont poke the giant if you arent prepared to get squashed
  let me see you say this again in 2 years screen cap this
   i read everything but clearly you didnt actually read my argument  points 1 and 2  every plan roosevelt made was for germans to attack he was ready for a lusitania type situation to occur which he believed in conjunction with the horrors of the london blitz would rally the american people to war with germany japan would be dragged in second in which the usn would fight primarily on defensive footing to preserve the uss territories until germany was defeated  points 3 and 4  all assessments of japans capabilities indicated they could not launch a conventional attack on pearl as such defensive arrangements were made to prevent sabotage as i outlined earlier despite intercepts the japanese task force managed to avoid detection which would have further made us command believe the attack was sabotage plus maximizing the damage at pearl would have been a grave strategic error not only were the battleships present which were still in vogue despite what 20/20 hindsight would have us believe but the naval fuel reserves which the us avoided losing only because admiral nagumo didnt want to risk his fighters in a third wave      battleships were widely considered to be obsolete  your own link prove that wrong in the headline no less and the us navy didnt listen every navy still believed in a decisive battleship engagement even the japanese continued to try and force a grand battleship fight all the way to 1944 battle off samar the only reason japan and the other naval powers invested in carriers was because the washington naval treaty banned them from further battleship construction forcing them to use the hulls of now banned battleships and cruisers to turn into carriers which were not restricted by the treaty      we  buddy dont even pretend youre american with those grammatical errors you keep making
  why are you trying to make these unless points in your argument as clearly it didnt happen distraction dont work on me you never put links to back up your nonsense     you seems to get your information from your high school history class back in the 80s im high tech because i only use google to let others see up to date information none of that false teaching and biased propaganda     you should consider yourself lucky as everything i wrote is the truth with links to back it up i am also fortunate to have a conversation with you as i learned so much about this subject at the end of the day we both won i dont even have a dog in this race i am not even japanese     im living in a world without borders i consider the whole earth as my homeland
see you all next time we are all brothers and sisters we are human being all in the same boat riding along the milkyway trying to get to somewhere nice     my friend is calling me to go play     bye
  but he is not saying that at all you retarded jap putting up a statue is non equivalent to throwing someone in jail and you fucking know it maybe if you werent so busy burning pictures of your grandfather chopping chinese babies in half with glorious nippon steel you would see that  also  says spelling mistakes are caused by phone  not spelling checking yourself after writing  find a better excuse
  my friend is calling me to go play  underage confirmed
  i like how you dismiss everything i say as distractions that didnt happen while ive been trying to address every one of your points and i apologize for the lack of internet sources most of my information is in physical books or from articles that i read a while back and cant find because im bad at refinding things fuck it let me write you a book 2000 character limit be damned because i absolutely love arguing wwii  you seems to get your information from your high school history class back in the 80s  first of all i think you vastly overestimate the depth of knowledge in public schooling from the early 2000s which is not only when i went to high school so youve pegged me two decades older somehow but also not where i learned anything of substance with regards to pearl harbor public high school knowledge is basically the attack happened now lets talk about potsdam conference because thats whats going to be on the test which in my teachers defense was way more historically relevant than the specifics of the battle in depth coverage of fdrs exact knowledge is not something that was covered you were probably going to get more out of watching tora tora tora or even god forbid micheal bays pearl harbor everything that ive been saying was learned from web research just like you and collegelevel history classes the books for which ive pulled out just for this conversation so lets get that smug assumption of superiority out of the way    this is going to be post 1 of 4 holy shit
 2/4  i acknowledged from the start that america had warnings of an attack what youve done however is simplify things without actually looking at context in your view the americans had intelligence to suggest an attack could occur therefore they let the attack happen however these things do not actually logically flow from one to the other for instance russia knew germany was going to attack as politically the ussr and nazi germany could never coexist and militarily there was significant buildup along the border however this does not mean they let the germans steamroll them it merely means they underestimated the german capacity for war stalin was reportedly in complete disbelief that hitler would attack him now after predicting hitler would not attack while hitler was still engaged with the british hell there was a point stalin had deluded himself that hitler might actually be his friend sending significant resources to hitler to aid him in his battle against the capitalist imperialists since youre a stickler for sources most of this comes from russias war by richard overy    the same can be said for america and japan america truly underestimated japans capabilities and resolve to go to war believing that either sanctions would work or japan would wait until germany declared war you have to remember that japan was not considered a serious threat in the washington naval treaty they got a smaller share of battleships compared to the uk and us 3 for every of the uss 5 japan had barely participated in the great war seizing some german islands which they were forced to give up postwar and their only recent fight against a modern power was at khalkhin gol in 1939 which they lost badly us military planners even believed that the ijn could only coordinate one operation at a time so when they received intelligence on an attack in the the east indies they dismissed all other reports as misinformation
 3/4  further you must remember that this is a period where racism actually factored into decision making japs couldnt shoot straight because they had squinty eyes couldnt fly because they were carried on their mothers backs as babies thus disrupting their sense of balance and couldnt march for long periods because they wore wooden sandals i shit you not these were actual ideas that us commanders believed hell the british commanders at singapore left the lights on because they were that confident the japs couldnt hit for shit they could resulting in the biggest surrender in uk history which churchill even considered the greatest failure in british military history most of this is from war without mercy by john w dower    you also have to remember that pearl harbor was an almost unheard of military achievement japanese carriers traveled 4000 miles undetected to bomb an enemy fleet at anchor with pure air power only the battle of tranato which occurred the month before was comparable as an all carrierbased aircraft attack on a port and even then it was at a much smaller in scale carriers were otherwise viewed as supporting elements to a conventional surface attack it took the total loss of the pacific fleets battleships for the us to come up with a carriercentric strategy which ultimately came to define the postwar era again even japan pioneers of carrier strategy kept trying to force a direct battleship duel at midway and as late as 1944 in the battle off samar the lack of understanding regarding carrier strategy furthered dismissals of a japanese air attack at pearl
 4/4 god damn  and as you argued with that other poster theres no evidence to suggest that the ijn codes were broken before december 7th signals intelligence was badly undermanned before the outbreak of hostilities as was much of the us military due to the great depression and general isolationist sentiments there was also not enough data to fully break the jn25 code as the ijn was idling with nothing to do before the war and therefore not sending enough messages for interception couple that with the belief that sigint was for nerds and that japan was some shitty nonthreat and you can see how jn25 would remain unbroken until the outbreak of hostilities     in conclusion to my overly wordy nonsense pearl harbor was the result of multiple intelligence failures a fundamental misunderstanding of japans capabilities and an unrealistic diplomatic strategy these factors are not unique to pearl harbor they repeat throughout history as leaders get complacent of their superiority over their enemies you can tell how little we learn from history based on how similar the wars of vietnam and iraq are you brought up george w bush and 9/11 and while i loath to defend the man i must say his administration fell into the exact same traps those with the proper intelligence failed to coordinate with other intelligence agencies hence the creation of the department of homeland security to coordinate all the alphabet agencies they did not understand the strategy al qaeda was capable of and they were still operating by the older rules of terrorism planes get hijacked for ransom not to be smashed into american landmarks his justification for iraq however is a different story as they say do not attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence
  oblivity is an incorrect word i intentionally choose to use obviousness sounds like newspeak to me to me it sounds like unifiedness as opposed to unity as a writer it just annoys me    as to the rest of your comment be advised only the last of your reply list is me and im so white and american its almost a cliche not that it matters even a tiny bit i just am amused at the severity of idiocy x
  its like these dirty continentals think english has a magic daddy in the sky like french or spanish or something
  every navy still believed in a decisive battleship engagement even the japanese continued to try and force a grand battleship fight all the way to 1944 battle off samar  battle off samar was not a battleship fight it was a fight between a battleship group and escort carriers     the only reason japan and the other naval powers invested in carriers was because the washington naval treaty banned them from further battleship construction forcing them to use the hulls of now banned battleships and cruisers to turn into carriers which were not restricted by the treaty  carriers were restricted by the treaty and japan cheated the restrictions a number of times to build more carriers than they were supposed to
  carriers were otherwise viewed as supporting elements to a conventional surface attack it took the total loss of the pacific fleets battleships for the us to come up with a carriercentric strategy which ultimately came to define the postwar era  this is simply wrong usn formed its carrier doctrine in a series of exercises between the wars one of the lessons learned was that carriers should be used first to destroy the enemy carriers nor did anyone else believe that carriers were to be supporting elements to a battleship group
  only the battle of tranato which occurred the month before  battle of taranto occurred in nov of 1940 you should really stop posting

weird that im getting replies a week later its good though i like being corrected      battle off samar was not a battleship fight it was a fight between a battleship group and escort carriers    sorry for not explaining further but samar was an attempt to force battleships back into relevancy either to attack americans landing on the beach or failing that finally have their big decisive battle vs the american navy and lose given how horribly outnumbered they were actually this would have also been better proof of some americans insistence on a big battleship fight halsey got tricked into hunting shadows because he wanted the big kills with his surface fighters which opened up taffy 3 for attack    perhaps a better example would have been operation tengo where the japanese flung their remaining battleships at the us in the hopes of doing something before being mercilessly destroyed by allied air power midway of course stands as another situation in which the japanese wanted to use their battleships though they ended up completely irrelevant    carriers were restricted by the treaty and japan cheated the restrictions a number of times to build more carriers than they were supposed to  neato didnt know that      isnt just kill the enemy carrier what sort of defines a supporting role admirably its not as supporting as battleships ended up being just big floating aa platforms to defend carriers and occasionally shell beaches but they werent the center of attention yet with the entire battlegroup built around them like they would be in the late war and modern era      fuck cant believe i fucked up the year of all things however the point still stands that pearl was an incredible achievement which had only occurred once before and at a smaller scale
  sorry for not explaining further but samar was an attempt to force battleships back into relevancy  samar wasnt an attempt to force battleships back into relevancy it was an attempt to destroy a large part of usn supporting elements given that the ijns carrier force was effectively dead their carriers were being used as decoys at this point due to lack of pilots they couldnt have sent a carrier force even if they wanted  tengo is the same japs werent using their battleships because they wanted their battleships to shine they had no choice    isnt just kill the enemy carrier what sort of defines a supporting role   not really historically the early supporting role that carriers played was to recon and spot the fall of shot for the battleships in the years leading up to ww2 the doctrine of the major navies changed to where carriers were to fight each other with the idea that whoever had carriers left would pretty much automatically win cf midway where the battleships trailed the carrier force with the understanding that they would mop up once the us carriers were dead    pearl harbor was historically unexpected but it shouldnt have been
  japs werent using their battleships because they wanted their battleships to shine they had no choice  thats a good point though i still think continued production of battleships particularly the yamatoclass indicates they still wanted to force the issue youre right that most of their end uses were more desperation than any particular strategy keyed around battleships    carriers roles  neat i was under the impression that a lot of that was learned under fire rather than before the war i stand corrected my perception might have been colored by an insistence by basically every power to continue production of battleships even powers that had no reason to have them germany why the fuck are you bothering just make more uboats and a failure by every power other than the big three us uk jp to produce a notable carrier force i guess wwii is more about the fall of the battleship than the rise of carriers since it seems that carriers were already well on their way to proving their importance before the war in the pacific    pearl harbor was historically unexpected but it shouldnt have been  i guess that was my original point way back when i was arguing with that conspiracy nut every indicator was there but nobody could put all the pieces together until it was too late    fascinating how far away weve been dragged from the original argument and how far we are from the op topic
  this is a strawman if i ever saw one would you enjoy being taken from your home and raped by other men all day
veritas radio  robert stinnett  day of deceit the truth about fdr and pearl harbor  part 1 of 2        3210    the authors book is titled day of deceit as in roosevelt betrayed the american people     the author is sure and confident of his evidence you can listen to him yourself if you are confused     the smoking gun
  californians are so ridiculous
  fascinating how far away weve been dragged from the original argument and how far we are from the op fascinating how far away weve been dragged from the original argument and how far we are from the op topic     i half agree with you as you guys are just talking about some battle situation that is not important to the ops post   the pearl harbor incident is important to ops post because if not for usa lied about it as reasons to enter the war the axis power would have won and none of the raping would have come to be known and the rape memorial in san francisco would not be there as the victor is the one that gets to write what is in your school history books the loser gets raped in a war and have no say
and i was there  breaking the secrets  pearl harbor and midway hardcover  may 15 2001  by rear admiral edwin t layton author    about the author  rear admiral edwin t layton was from december 7 1941 until the surrender of japan the staff officer who bore responsibility for keeping the commander in chief pacific fleet informed about japans strategic objectives capabilities and intended operations        laytons argument is detailed and comprehensive but in general he maintains that although washington was reading the highest level japanese diplomatic code purple little of this was ever made available to the field commanders other than to macarthur in the philippines who failed to act not only on the purple data but even after he knew that pearl harbor had been attacked the diplomatic information that they were denied not only contained data about the imminence of war but also included messages sent from honolulu to tokyo by takeo yoshikawa the spy sent to observe and report daily on the exact positions of ships in the harbor using a grid system that was obviously designed for the purpose of targeting torpedoes and bombs    
  usa lied about it as reasons to enter the war  oh lawd hes back    the axis power would have won  oh boy were escalating sorry to break it to you pal but the axis could never have won even without americans fighting in the war american supplies would still flow to the brits and soviets why would they ever stop given that the american public advocated for intervention against the axis as long as that action fell short of war and those supplies would have been enough to beat the germans but not as cleanly meanwhile japan would have sat on its ass because in this timeline they never attack america which in turn means theyve resigned to their fate to never expand further to contest the oil and rubber they then end up running out of oil and get stuck in an eternal chinese quagmire until the soviets decide its time for khalkhin gol 2 electric boogaloo
here we go again    review summary of     layton concludes that the withholding of critical information from the commander at pearl harbor was due to bureaucratic bungling and not to washington foreknowledge of the attack  this book is a must for anyone interested in the beginning and the allimportant first year of the war and debunking conspiracy theorists like toland conspiracies become completely unnecessary when stupidity ego and general incompetence among top politicians and military leaders abound    reference from     during that first seven months of its existence the basement group had been assigned and was working on three japanese naval codes and ciphers which unfortunately either yielded no really useful information when we could read them or which we could not break at all the net result was that we detected absolutely no warning of the impending attack on pearl harbor a broken  hearted admiral husband e kimmel commander in chief of the us pacific fleet on that 7 december 1941 certainly had scant reason to thank our basement group for anything but that was hardly our fault    your own sources defeat you as pretty much all of it is blame shifting for incompetence not a grand conspiracy to let the attack happen
    the amount of ex ww2 naval officers commenting on his book reviews amazed me    j nsa oral history notes    fabian nsaoh0983fabian docid 4129563    from page 9 fabian answering      dennis went down and on his return he brought  back from the british a solution of this five number  all right    farley did he go to london    fabian dennis didnt go to london they went to singapore    farley singapore    fabian singapore he brought back the solution how to  recover the keys the daily keys how the code was made up  and a lot of code values and since it was a very heavy system  it was the heaviest volume system on the air i talked to my  people and i went back to the cno and requested permission to  drop everything else and go to work on this five number system  and we did pretty well on it    we couldnt do any solid reading no but we could pick up phrases  like enemy enemy submarine or enemy aircraft but we were  coming we along pretty fast incidentally we also had direction  finders way out on the point so we could keep track of fleet  movements and so forth     now within the congressional hearings wwwarchiveorg many document are there   large pdf files if you scan within that set for exhibit no 151 we might  come to that interesting document you recall the name safford yes     if you can find it read it several times  slowly  take notes    got it what means the sematic for translations as used by your   understanding
here is one of my favorite hater of his book    his premise would have us believe that the president secretary of state secretaries of war and navy the us army chief of staff the chief of naval operations a former commander of the us fleet and numerous others were privy to plot that allowed over two thousand american servicemen die that the army and navy heads intentionally set up two of their own lt gen short and adm kimmel to be sacrificial lambs    i dont even know why he is acting so surprised by this as george w also used this same warcraft as his handbook as reasons to the population to invade iraq and afghanistan dont forget bush senior was fighting in ww2 and borrowed that page of off roosevelt for 9/11     usa will use the same tactics for future war with russia
do you want what is a really crazy conspiracy theory    the usa development of the atomic bomb was intended to be dropped on japan not to make them surrender but to study the effects of the radiation on human beings a usa unit u571 kind of operation why do it to the japanese and not on germans    think about that for a minute because of racists     its also racist of why there needs a rape memorial in san francisco its a racist reminder of gross events that happened in a war whereby people dies with suffering it kept the other asian races from uniting together with his japanese because they simply cannot let go of this hatred for the descendants of their past generations history but they dont understand that the white ones approval to build the memorial in a city of majorly asians is to divide and weakens     you dont see a demand for a memorial for the victims of hiroshima and nagasaki for a reason     the japanese are such great people even as the government of japan dont apologize for the comfort women the people of japan does     stop blaming the whole population for the mistake of a few in government     bye and peace to all
  okay im going to just tear your argument apart at its logical core your premise is that fdr had to knew about the pearl harbor attack and deliberately did nothing to stop it in order to maximize damage to make sure the american public would support going to war if we believe this premise then we must also believe the following if the attack was successfully fended off there would not be enough damage for the american people to support war with japan    there are several problems with this logic the most glaringly obvious being that japan declared war on america any attack by japan on america regardless of damage inflicted would have included a declaration of war and as such the american public would have zero choice but to accept war if japan for some reason decided to make an undeclared military strike it would have also caused america to join into the war remember that the historical war declaration failed to arrive before the attack which was a huge part of why americans were so pissed because no nation on earth just goes they didnt declare war so its no big deal lol    declarations of war aside we move to the next problem in your logic that minimal damage would not rally america to war no nation upon being attacked would ever surrender and this would be a surrender as america would be giving up half its pacific holdings without a fight because damage was minimal that is absolute insanity a defending nation that only sustains minimal damage during the initial attack has even more incentive to beat the living daylights out of the attacker because they have a massive upper hand to immediately surrender squanders any ability for the defending nation to secure favorable concessions and reparations they could have gained by fighting the japanese knew this their entire strategy banked on dealing massive damage right off the bat for force an american surrender
  the usa development of the atomic bomb was intended to be dropped on japan not to make them surrender but to study the effects of the radiation on human beings  it was dropped to dickwave at the soviets and tell them to watch the fuck out we have superweapons too bad the soviets already knew and were well on their way to developing their own further the us had no idea about the dangers of radiation at the time and you can tell this because operation downfall included dropping nuclear bombs in close vicinity of us troops irradiating literally millions of american citizens    why do it to the japanese and not on germans   because germany surrendered the allies had literally no qualms laying waste to entire german cities see every axis supporter crying about dresden so an atom bomb would not have been a drastic escalation i do not deny that there was significant racism but lets not pretend the us was more keen on bombing japan over germany germany first    you dont see a demand for a memorial for the victims of hiroshima and nagasaki for a reason   maybe its because we already have a bunch of memorials      notice that a bunch of these things are in america    it kept the other asian races from uniting together with his japanese because they simply cannot let go of this hatred for the descendants of their past generations history  if the japanese wanted asian unity maybe they shouldnt have been tremendous dicks to their fellow asians imperial japan already tried the whole asian unity against the whites shtick with the coprosperity sphere but that shit fell apart once the other asian nations realized that an asian master was no better than a white master and once they overthrew the japs they overthrew the whites shortly after see vietnam
had the americans namely stopped the attack then that would have meant the quick end of japan whereby the entire plan for the future bombardment of the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki would have fallen through and indeed precisely for that time when the atom bomb was then developed
  haha oops that backfired
  are you trying to say that america deliberately crippled itself in pearl harbor so it could drag the war out long enough to test the atomic bombs on japan beyond the impossibility of knowing exactly how the war would turn out war is infamous for never ever turning out as planned let alone sticking to a tight time table the allies had no way of knowing when the manhattan project would be ready which hadnt even started in 1941 and its predecessors had only conducted preliminary research timing the two at the very start of americas involvement in the war would be absolutely impossible unless you could divine the fucking future with a crystal ball    it doesnt help your idea that fdr ended up dying before the trinity test meaning it was up to truman who wasnt briefed before fdrs death and therefore unlikely to be privy to fdrs omniscient fortune telling to determine the final usage of the new weapons
  oh lawd hes back    back just for the laughter as i got fact and links to back it all up its hard for low iq npc to know what the people were thinking back in the days     look it as this way japans current citizens is not the same as they were during ww2 they have moved on     i appreciate everyones patriotism but with the internet all lies will be brought to light no more darkness and hiding the truth     now i must leave you again as another post caught my undivided attention     trump is repelling the constitution of birth right citizenship that will lead to another civil war     last time we die for the freedom of blacks this time we will die for the mexicans     which side will you pick    just like jack and the beanstalk     jack is bringing the end to the giant     okay its not fun but im always bored
  haha oops that backfired    bullshit what he copy and paste was not in the wiki link     whoever he is he is an old piece of shit in his 50s wasted his and every ones time he is a disinformation agent or just an old dog that cant teach new tricks to
  bringing quotes and links doesnt mean you automatically win an argument you have to actually weave together your quotes and links to form a coherent message otherwise they are completely open to the readers interpretation youve failed to do that and have instead thrown out links without context many of which without your added context dont actually back your conclusion that fdr deliberately let pearl harbor be attacked just that serious mistakes were made    as it stands all youve done is show that the fdr administration was incompetent and that signals intelligence had a partial but incomplete picture of japans intentions youve failed to actually prove malice on fdrs part nor have you provided logical support besides insane conspiracy theories that require fdr to be a literal god as to why fdr would ever do such a thing    based on every post that ive read of yours i can come to the conclusion that you are the asian equivalent of a jewish conspiracy theorist except your jews are white people or like the feminists/leftists who believe in the patriarchy fdr having near omniscience like the jewish illuminati check nothing is the fault of me or my fellow asians but the fault of the white man conspiring to keep us down check resorting to memetic name calling and a smug sense of superiority when you cant form a logical argument check    you have managed to combine the worst aspects of the american far left and right with broken english to boot and at this point i cant wait to see what insane shit comes out of your mouth next      not checking the wiki pages sources hence reference from   reference 2  i seriously hope youre not quoting a wikipedia article without reading the original sources from which it is derived    also i fucking love that you keep incorrectly dismissing me as some old man as if age would make my arguments less valid
  as it stands all youve done is show that the fdr administration was incompetent and that signals intelligence had a partial but incomplete       your own ex ww2 naval officer came out with verify written books on the subject and you are still in denial     im not going to convince you as that is like trying to convince a jew to convert to an islam     those books by those ex us naval officer cant be unwritten its on sale at amazon     do you understand this     if so dont go killing the messenger
  would make my arguments less valid    you are invalid as you are arguing against your own ex usa naval officer admiral     who are you     are you even in the military
  links to form a coherent message otherwise they are completely open to the readers interpretation    no my links and copy paste are 100 their words     the link is there and if you dont read it entirely thats your fault its not like im trying to hide it    do your own research please dont take my word for it
  your own ex ww2 naval officer came out with verify written books on the subject and you are still in denial  see this is what i mean you wave the source around but then fail to show the proper context from laytons own words and the many five star reviews of the book his goal in writing his book was to absolve admiral kimmel of what he viewed was an unjust blame and reveal he was a scapegoat of upper commands failure to recognize the nature of the pearl harbor attack notice the failure leyton is not intoning deliberate malice but incompetence of the highest levels as i have pointed out many times this level of incompetence is not unheard of in history let alone the same war soviets being surprised by operation barbarossa and therefore not in itself proof of a conspiracy in addition shifting blame happens literally every day in politics and military and therefore scapegoating kimmel is also not proof of conspiracy just that the brass was trying to deflect criticism from their failures    your entire argument is that fdr was malicious in his failure to protect pearl and you have failed to provide evidence of that malice time and again all youve done is provide evidence of incompetence and people covering their asses which is completely fitting with the traditionally accepted history of the attack and not sufficient to prove malice    im not going to convince you as that is like trying to convince a jew to convert to an islam   right back at ya pal because for you to function fdr must be a malign deity hellbent on the destruction of asian unity speaking of that unity will not happen any time soon not because of the white man conspiring against you but because like europeans asians have been fighting each other for millennia and as recently as the last century within living memory you cant undo that animosity with just nice sentiments nor can you blame that continued animosity on a single statue in a faraway land
  this is what i mean just copying and pasting others words does not make an argument by my own research reading your sources i have found no evidence of deliberate malfeasance just more evidence that everything was bungled you on the other hand have seen this failure as deliberate ive read the exact same thing but come to a different conclusion because quotes and sources alone are open to interpretation especially when it comes to things like intentthis is what providing context and a message means if you cannot work the quotes into a larger picture then they do not necessarily serve your argument    imagine if a student turned in an essay which consisted 100 of quotes without context they would fail that essay because they didnt point to why these quotes were relevant to the topic    i would further say that youve let your conclusion come before the facts and youve let that desired conclusion color the facts in a sinister color which otherwise would not be there what is easier to accept that the us government was and to still is incompetent or that the us government conspired to kill as many americans as possible so they could nuke the japs and destroy asian unity      i can turn this around too who are you are you even in the military why are you the unquestionable final arbiter of what admiral layton wrote i dont question laytons opinion and the documents it was built on but i do question your interpretation of his opinion
  i dont question laytons opinion and the documents it was built on but i do question your interpretation of his opinion    laytons book had one objective as the main point and that is  fdr was given the warning of the imminent attack on pearl harbour and he let it happen by offering no defense of any kind he did not state that fdr did it on purpose that is why i use him to back up stinnetts point as in he knew before hand as opposed to stinnett s claim that fdr let the attack happen for reasons for joining ww2     my points are simple as others can comprehend it easily but you     you are biased and you know it     if you think im biased like you think again     japans military fdr and truman are all devils in the same boat     i never denial japans crimes in ww2 why are you defending fdrs war crimes     the best you did was claiming fdrs ignorance but last time i checked that doesnt held up in court of law     claiming doesnt know of know of the imminent attack as the secret services is yelling it in your ears bullshit     saying trumans doesnt know of the radiation of the nuclear bombs with five years of building and testing of it bullshit     you believe the above therefore youre also bullshit get it
  you are invalid as you are arguing against your own ex usa naval officer admiral   who are you   are you even in the military    on this post my point is that who are you to argue against two ww2 naval officer when you are not even in the military not even close to their rank not me     i dont like to keep going back to point out old posts just to make you understand i also know that youre playing dumb to irritate the reader     i understand that you are paying defense and i offense you are losing badly as i can win easily with the sword of truth in my hand i am cutting through all your bullshit like knife on butter     why do you even bother
  citing stinnet ever  stinnett concocted this theory pretty much from whole cloth those who have been able to check his alleged sources also are unanimous in their condemnation of his methodology basically the author has made up his sources when he does not make up the source he lies about what the source says  donald steury cia historian     stinnet does the same thing you do which is read nefarious intent from benign statements of fact and work backwards from the conclusion but hes even worse than you because he literally makes up sources on top of that i mean his theories were debunked by the japanese there cant be any intercepts because we literally removed the radio transmitters from the taskforce who would have every reason to prove that fdr let them attack    the best you did was claiming fdrs ignorance but last time i checked that doesnt held up in court of law   it actually does because you need to know of a crime to be complicit in said crime further you cant charge someone with criminal negligence unless you can prove that they reasonably should have known better and the problem is nobody knew better every single level of intelligence failed to piece everything together and theres no evidence that suggests fdr got a complete warning of the pearl harbor attack which is supported by laytons account    radiation  scientists working on the bombs died after the war due to improper protection the us walked soldiers into radiation fields after the war if the us knew about the dangers of radiation and used hiroshima to prove it why would they be so careless with their own after the fact hell why would they allow the manufacture of radioactive toys in the 50s
  i understand that you are paying defense and i offense  yes and by being on offense it is up to you to prove your claims correct and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence which you have failed to provide what you have provided is proof that maybe us codebreaking was further along but nothing that indicates a complete picture layton complains that perhaps they could have solved it if given pieces that other branches but not that some other branch had the solution youve also failed to prove that fdr had anything to gain by literally setting the pacific fleet on fire as well as letting the japanese seize half of the uss pacific holdings outside of some mad delusion that he had the foresight to know exactly how long the war and nuclear research would be for the explicit purpose of testing the effects of radiation on the japanese something which would not be properly understood until after the war    again what is more credible the idea that the us failed to understand the full capabilities and will of the japanese or that they did understand and then concocted an elaborate conspiracy including multiple level of government and the military from the president all the way down to the aa crew chiefs who locked up their own ammo you know the guys who would have died in the attack to let thousands of americans die to justify a war that was already going to be justified by a japanese attack you are basically asking us to believe that america would not have entered the war if the attack didnt do enough damage which flies counter to basically everything we know about human nature    why do you even bother  because i enjoy arguing with people who are clearly off their rocker on a mongolian picture book forum about news i mean really outside of your quote and sources which are good outside of shit like stinnet youve rambled wax poetically about all sorts of wacky shit
  during that first seven months of its existence the basement group had been assigned and was working on three japanese naval codes and ciphers which unfortunately either yielded no really useful information when we could read them or which we could not break at all      during the first seven months     they got nothing that is because in may 1941 they were just beginning doing it as opposed to seven months later dec 7 they broke the codes the way you pick this section out of context proofs youre a disinformation agent     i also find it funny how you choose to use a quote from a cia agent to discredit stinnett the cia is the most distrustful agency of all and you pick them to use in your argument just shows how desperate you are    let me remind you that stinnett got his source for his book from the freedom of information act when its declassified     saying he made it all up is something a disinformation agent like you would have done     on amazon his book got a majority of positive reviews 43 stars    i rather spend time in reading the negatives review to find a better argument in there than you can give and most of them are ex ww2 veteran older than you in traditional cultural old age equal to wisdom unless you have mental disorder     its myopic that you really think there are only two author with books sharing the same view wrong as there are many dozen other authors sharing the same view as stinnett          for example he shows that from august of 1941 to late november 1941 the japanese tried to get a peace agreement with us but for reasons mentioned in the book fdr was trying to provoke japan into shooting first that they did so on dec 7 1941 was not a surprise
  oh give me a break  grow the hell up and move the fuck on none of you were ever oppressed not like youre going to be if you get what youre asking for  not real bright at all
  nothing wrong with rape
  the way you pick this section out of context proofs youre a disinformation agent   i find that hilarious because you ignored the second sentence  the net result was that we detected absolutely no warning of the impending attack on pearl harbor  oh and the third  a broken  hearted admiral husband e kimmel commander in chief of the us pacific fleet on that 7 december 1941 certainly had scant reason to thank our basement group for anything  which clearly implied that after 7 months ending on dec 7 they failed not that they succeeded youve managed to cherry pick the first sentence and wildly reinterpret it to mean what you want    i also love that you assumed that stuery is a cia agent hes a college professor like most historians who studies the history of the cia and other intelligence organizations you dont need to be in the cia to study the history of the cia      you left out the next part of that review  what did surprise fdr and his advisors was they thought japan would attack somewhere in the western pacific which they also did fdr and his advisors were truly stunned when the attack came at pearl harbor in the eastern pacific  which completely discredits your idea that fdr knew about pearl harbor and let it happen hoover says that fdr was itching for war not that fdr knew about and let pearl get attacked to maximize damage    plus trying to get a peace agreement does not mean they were going to get one even with different american leadership nazi germany sought peace with britain but britain refused because the terms were unreasonable and hitler had broken his promises again and again so without knowing the terms of the proposed japanese peace agreement we have no idea if fdr was sitting on what he wanted or if the japanese were just using the peace talks as cover/making unreasonable demands
  finally id like to reiterate once more that poking someone until they punch you is not a crime everything fdr did with regards to prewar policy was within the legal limits of what the us was allowed to do nothing was a war crime as you so allege if what fdr did is considered war crimes then anyone who sanctions another country is a war criminal and anyone who sends aid to a nation at war is also a criminal    this entire argument spawned from the fact you have no idea what constitutes a war crime  and have been desperately escalating your claims to try and salvage your original claim that the us entered the war illegally you started with claiming that sending supplies was a war crime its not you then tried to claim that us spies were war crimes pulling from events that occurred after the declaration of war afterwards you quoted nothing but stinnet a thoroughly discredited hack to prove that fdr knew and allowed pear harbor to happen now you are desperately trying to clear stinnet by making wild accusations against his critics and twist the words of other historical accounts to serve your purpose    you have been making bolder and wilder claims to cover up your initial failure while fluffing it all up with an indignant tone and plenty of fallacies and insults you honestly remind me of /k/s original fifty cent who would throw up faulty simulations of the plan vs the usn and then get super defensive when people corrected him using his own software and parameters to boot before declaring my simulation stands and claiming victory despite having been thoroughly beaten just like with how /k/ reacted to fifty i have long since abandoned the idea that you are arguing in good faith and am now entertaining you because i cant wait to see what stupid shit you post next
no     im in the implications that fdr willingly killed 2000 of us sailors citizens and the trumans atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki is a war crime just so he can rally up the population to enter war    f     the roosevelt lineage  claes martenszen van rosenvelt   wife  jannetje samuels or hamel or thomas  nicholas r   wife 1682  heyltje jans kunsy  johannes r   wife 1708  heyltje syvert or hilote syverts  jacobus r   wife 1746  annetja bogart  jacobus r i   wife 1793  maria van schaack  carnelius van schaack r   wife  margarey barnhill  theodore r   wife  martha bulloch  elliott r   wife  ann rebecca hall  franklin d roosevelt  jacobus   wife 1719  catherine hadenroock  isaac roosevelt   wife 1752  cornelia hoffman  james roosevelt   wife 1786  maria walton  isaac roosevelt   wife  mary e aspinwall  james roosevelt   wife  sarah delano    the new york times of march 14 1935 quotes the president as saying in the distant past my ancestors may have been jews all i know about the origin of the roosevelt family is that they are apparently descended form claes martenszen van roosevelt who came from holland  that is and was my claim since the beginning     tldr you are jew mentally retarded to think otherwise
while i dont want this subject to head towards antisemitism the holocaust did happened the comforts women did happened not denying of it fdr aka rosenvelt was a jew     i can honestly states that im not a jap but can you also states that youre not a jew by defending his massacre of millions of innocent
  escalating your claims to try and salvage your original claim that the us entered the war illegally    the laws are amended every day just like how trump is trying to amend the the constitution of birth right     now if the usa try to get away with what they did to japan during ww2 to russia no one will blame them in to nuking us all accordingly to their logic     if you think im russian no im not either     my grammar will throw you off but you will never guessed
while i have came to known that youre a jew i dont see the fun of it all to argue with a jew     its the same reason why i find it not fun to pick up on a disabled jew     to be on an even field you have to know your adversary     its sucks to be where are youre at stuck in an old history text book that cant be edited that is why googles is 1000 per share
this connection it is noteworthy that whos who in american jewry lists the new york brentanos as jewish sephardics from italy or spain delano and brentano end with o jews expelled from brazil settled in the us genealogist schmalix is quoted in the article mentioned as saying when the delanos changed to the christian religion can only be ascertained by further investigations in america  with this alleged jewish delano descent added to the other records herein the fact that new york jews on the east side constantly refer to the president proudly as rosenvelt it would seem that dr von leers in his letter of may 14 1939 to the undersigned transmitting his latest discoveries is justified in exclaiming it being true that the delanos are wellknown jews from the netherlands president roosevelt is from the standpoint of jewish heredity law as good jew as bernard m baruch baruch is a sephardic jew whose family is reported to have come from europe via brazil to north america signed robert edward edmonton  so this explains why roosevelt coming from a prominent and wealthy family moved america into the direct path toward communism the jewish names in fdrs family stand out samuels schaak and jacobus since jews frequently intermarry with their relatives roosevelts wife was a distant cousin and a niece of former president theodore roosevelt the universal jewish dictionary of 1943 states sara delano roosevelt born 1855 and died 1941 was often the guest and advisor to jewish institutions after her death the roosevelt new york city home was bought by the bnai brith hillel foundation and converted into the sara delano roosevelt interfaith house for students of hunter college  fdr was extremely prozionist from the very beginning of his political career and was often honored by jews henry morgenthau jr bernard baruch and samuel rosenman were among the jews who influenced his twelve years of office
  why has this thread devolved into japs calling fdr a jew
  this thread was about rape     which brought back to the time when the usa is pro isreal in to the the raping of palestine today by the jews connecting the dots in revelation
about the palestine and the jews occupation     there was an old saying  can a thief claim they own own something which they have stolen  this is never ending war for the jews
  you dont steal land you conquer it arabs tried to take it back a few times but always failed so long it belongs to the jews
what must be said is that before the jews was gypsy into palestine they were station at egypt as slaves before moses brought them out of slavery and into the desert and into the land of palestine where they tricked them as being friends and killed the palestinian into an drunken stupor and killed them in their sleep     how can a race of slave out of egypt claim to be the chosen one of gods people
  you dont steal land you conquer it    the jews would not have won the war if not for the backings of weapons and military by british and usa
  before the jews was gypsy into palestine  even for being barely fluent this is particularly bad i only have an abstract idea of what you were trying to say
  wwwnytimescom  alternative form of gypsy of or belonging to the romani people or one of it subgroups roma sinti romanichel etc offensive of or having the qualities of an itinerant person or group with qualities traditionally ascribed to romani people making a living from dishonest practices or theft etc  gypsy  wiktionary  
  i think youll find gypsy is also a noun and if you do use it as an adjective you cant have the adjective also function as a verb before the jews was gypsy into palestine is a syntactic mess personally i would have said before the jews gypsied their way into palestine
  why has this thread devolved into japs calling fdr a jew    you might also asked why have a thread about a statue of three little girl in the middle of nowhere in shit hole san francisco exploded in to the doxing of fdr being a closet jew and the killing of innocent victims of the atomic bomb and the current actual raping of palestine
  yeah no shit i made that word up i was using gypsy as a verb like you attempted to do
  youve right but the jews did not just gypsied they are still doing it today     as in the present jews gypsy into the land of palestine     was my wording
  yikes it seems that you still need my help buddy here let me show you how its done  youre most undoubtably correct dear boy but if i may clarify one point the jews did not just play the gypsy over three thousand years ago they are still most certainly doing it today   unto this day november second two thousand and eighteen anno domini jews still gypsy their way into the land of philistia   this was the meaning which i intended to impart onto you
  hey thanks     that was better
  literally killed over 100000 innocent people in less than a week     no u u da bad goizzzz    fucking americans
  it is inappropriate it isnt americas history to confront is it our place to dig up the dirty laundry of every nation on earth and place judgements upon it the sheer arrogance of modern liberals should japan erect statues in honor of the native american women raped by american settlers and soldiers what about the blacks raped and lynched by feral frenzied mobs or the segregation of jews in wwii military training camps just before we acted with garrulous selfrighteousness after victory what about the mi lai massacre how about a monument to all our recent mass shootings what about a monument to shame all police officers for the reckless wicked actions of the few what about the victims of cannibalism in our settlement at jamestown should the nations of the world take it upon themselves to build monuments to these things     is it now to be the common practice that we each build monuments to one anothers shame     this world is losing its mind
  written so pretty it almost makes the zionist sound like the good guys
just another contributor to why japan scares me    if it was up to them they would give women the gulf treatment given the chance but they cant because literally the whole world is staring at them    given their dozens of trillions in financial debt they lnow teyre fucked if any country cuts them off especially the us    so they just deny it because the moment they admit it they have to answer to everything else    its scarier every day
  it isnt americas history to confront  theres many chinese americans and korean americans especially in san francisco who feel both their american history and asian history is important this is clearly not something a japanese person could relate to since their population is overwhelmingly homogenized and even those born in the country but with ancestry other than japanese are treated like second class citizens    should japan erect statues in honor of the native american women raped by american settlers and soldiers  does japan have a booming population of native americans that i never learned about    what about the blacks raped and lynched by feral frenzied mobs  do you live in the usa this is a really strange comment because youre acting like there arent dozens if not hundreds of monuments and museums exploring the history of abuses african americans went through not to mention an entire month dedicated to it
  tell that to the japanese who cant stop gettysburg ng buttmad over a statue
  theres many chinese americans and korean americans especially in san francisco who feel both their american history and asian history is important this is clearly not something a japanese person could relate to since their population is overwhelmingly homogenized and even those born in the country but with ancestry other than japanese are treated like second class citizens  you said it chineseamericans japaneseamericans they forfeited the right to officially weigh in on japanese and chinese issues the moment they became expatriots nor is this an isolated asianamerican statement it is an american monument and it makes a statement for all of us  one which isnt our place to make if japaneseamericans wished to confront japan about its wrongdoings they should have done so through an organization of their own not an american governmental institution     should japan erect statues in honor of the native american women raped by american settlers and soldiers  missing the point entirely the point is this is something which took place in america as a part of our history it is something for us alone to make atonement for not for any other nation to attempt to make atonement for us  as if they could nor to attempt to shame us into public atonement    what about the blacks raped and lynched by feral frenzied mobs  and where precisely are those in japan no they are here in the us where they should be as it is our wrongdoing to make amends for and not anyone elses
  they forfeited the right to officially weigh in on japanese and chinese issues  no they didnt its the right of every american to have an opinion about any country he or she wants    one which isnt our place to make  a local constituency can make any statement that its local elected representatives are willing to make
  they forfeited the right to officially weigh in on japanese and chinese issues the moment they became expatriots  they forfeited nothing some people have dual citizenships some were born in the usa but still care about their heritage and the events that occurred in their ancestors past but none of that matters because  summed it up already we dont need anyones permission to have an opinion    the point is this is something which took place in america as a part of our history it is something for us alone to make atonement for not for any other nation to attempt to make atonement for us  as if they could nor to attempt to shame us into public atonement  who said theyre trying to shame japan they wanted to honor their ancestors who went through something awful why should another country be allowed to dictate who we can and cannot honor    and where precisely are those in japan no they are here in the us where they should be as it is our wrongdoing to make amends for and not anyone elses  and thats the difference between the usa and japan because japan for the most part refuses to acknowledge its ugly past and theyre even trying to control how other countries view their past the irony is the statue went up with very little press until osaka decided to sever ties with its sister city giving the statue far more press than it would have received otherwise
    its the right of every american to have an opinion about any country he or she wants  we dont need anyones permission to have an opinion  the right pffffft you modern libs and your notions of rights it is always about our rights and never about our duties or our place its always about what we have to say and never about when we should be silent    sure go ahead have all the opinions you want collect a cornucopia of them it doesnt mean you should have any that is the difference between the way i look at rights and the way you look at them you look at rights as in what im entitled to what i deserve i perceive rights as what ought and ought not to be done what is and isnt my place to do     a local constituency can make any statement that its local elected representatives are willing to make  a fair statement i agree however it is willful arrogance to make a statement as a singular constituency on an international as in nations issue which reflects only your own niche opinion and as far as our national opinions on the matter are concerned i think ive been clear in my belief that we shouldnt voice any the time to voice any grievances regarding wwii atrocities was at that time to the responsible parties holding them immediately accountable  not to their descendants to abstractly shame them for the actions of their forefathers     who said theyre trying to shame japan  oh boy youre naive this is all riding on the wave of the metoo movement which is as much about shaming vengeance and power as it is about justice that may not be how it started but that is what it is now not only that but unless youre assuming the average modern japanese person is okay the actions in question  which would be ignorant and obtuse then the effect produced on the japanese exemplified by the osakan response is obviously and predictably shame
cont    but hey for what its worth i hope youre right and their motives are the purest in the world     why should another country be allowed to dictate who we can and cannot honor  no one is dictating that is when you must be the most careful if no one is telling you what to do you dont merely have to judge whether their instructions are intelligent or not instead you must discern for yourself out of the nearly infinite actions available to you what is to be done this is a much more sophisticated dilemma think of international relations in this simplified manner for arguments sake  as being roughly the same as interpersonal relationships in our daytoday relationships our actions are not dictated to us by others generally rather we take into account the effect which our actions will have on others and try to behave with civility and respect this should be even more true in our international affairs a wise man chooses his enemies carefully his battles carefully and even more so severs friendships carefully     san francisco is a notoriously impetuous place in an infamously licentious locale however so while their actions are a disappointment they are not a surprise
  they forfeited the right to officially weigh in on japanese and chinese issues the moment they became expatriots  no
  no one is dictating that is when you must be the most careful if no one is telling you what to do  osakas mayor gave san franciscos mayor an ultimatum to remove the statue or lose their sister status how is that not trying to dictate who another country is choosing to honor    i perceive rights as what ought and ought not to be done what is and isnt my place to do   i perceive that thousands of women who were raped and tortured deserve to be remembered and honored and i dont care if it hurts someone elses feelings because theyd rather live in denial about their history i perceive that trying to sweep the issue under the rug is not the right thing to do and its not japans place to tell others how they should honor victims of war crimes because it doesnt fit their narrative of how the events occurred
  how is that not trying to dictate who another country is choosing to honor  because its saying if you choose to publicly shame us we will no longer be sister cities  maybe dictation in a certain sense of the word but certainly not unreasonable
  i perceive that thousands of women who were raped and tortured deserve to be remembered and honored  no one is honored by a fool  not even a wellmeaning one they may appreciate the sentiment but when a person cannot express their sentiments tactfully it is best they remain silent     your other statement was addressed by another gentleman hes right san francisco should have and likely did expect the response they received from osaka if they didnt theyre fools
  why should japan be shamed it happened many years ago by men that are now dead its a tribute to those who suffered atrocities if japan chooses to feel shamed for the actions of their ancestors then thats their prerogative their ultimatum was basically a threat to prevent the placement of the statue japan had no other real recourse but they did attempt to dictate who the usa was honoring      san francisco should have and likely did expect the response they received from osaka  im sure they did because japan continues to deny their atrocities committed san francisco did a noble thing in choosing to honor the victims and japan chose to be petty about it    when a person cannot express their sentiments tactfully  i wouldnt call the museums japan has glorifying and revising their militaristic past tactful would you
  i wouldnt call your argument tactful are you an expert on a society as complex and private as japan are you fluent in their tongue if you lack fluency youre certainly no expert and if you have no expertise you should stop hurling accusations at what is one of the most complex and immensely private civilizations on this planet japan indeed has a glorious military history but the nature of a military is to wage war and war has its darkness as much as its glory i would call war museums glorifying japan absolutely necessary rather than giving any thought to tactfulness     you do not understand the state of the japanese psyche after the second world war their nation in ruins literally reduced to rubble in many places a once powerful and regal military  a symbol of national and therefore personal in japans case vigor competence and strength beaten and humiliated to the uttermost extreme possible an indelible failure looming over their heads like a felons rap sheet a failure to care for family as japan is 99 ethnically japanese the museums are therapeutic they are built to rebuild japans selfesteem does one remind ones self of shortcomings while building confidence no of course not one focuses on strength     as you seem overly concerned with japans failures ill remind you of my stance from the beginning a stance which is ancient even concern oneself with ones own deficiencies and owe no one anything but to love them     that is justice
  if anyone raped palestine it was the people who dwelt there prior to and during english rule palestine was an uninhabited uncultivated wasteland which is precisely why britain gave it to the jews it is only in jewish hands that it has become desirable real estate and the palestinians iranians and all the rest of their hateful neighbors cannot handle this for one simple reason no one likes to see people they dislike do well  much less to see them take something we thought valueless and make a fortune from it     the land is not only historically israels but it was handed over by the english and held by the israelis in the seven day war by right of history treaty and conquest they own it and as if that isnt enough theres divine right
  sure hasbara drone whatever you say
  when a family grows they need bigger house and land the plan for the greater isreal must continue
japan should break its relationship with korea
  jews are the original terroristscausing so many revolutions in europe including the russian revolution  the rise of communism which is one of the most horrific types of dictatorships   plus they terrorized the british to get their state with cowardly attacks like the king david hotel massacre even today these jews have infiltrated  control white nationalist movements just as they control islamic groups like alqaeda  isis none of these extremists has ever carried out a major antijewish operationthey only serve jewish interests
    no japan denies literally every bad thing it did during wwii despite having the worst track record if you exclude the holocaust every single country they fought every single civilian body the occupied nearly every single soldier they captured reported more or less the same thing the japs were fucking evil not even the nazis were as consistently shitty to innocent civilians and their prisoners as the they were and again the current japanese government denies basically everything    the japanese tortured mutlitated and killed loads of their comfort women especially the ones from china    you all look exactly fucking the same fuck off with your delusions of being able to distinguish chink nationalities based on their faces    prostitutes do it to make a living with very little active effort on their part if it really wasnt so unpleasant it wouldnt be as reviled an occupation as it is
  literally baseless accusations  how long have you been using this site since this summer
  this was just the official storyreally they just hated having to visit every once in a while and have the whole place smelling like shit
  japan has been fixing the mixtake for fifty years and the gooks are never satisfied its just the asian holocaust foundation at this point
  once youve had sex it like fucking your mum  you need to stop fucking your mum

  the day israel attacked america  al jazeera investigates the shocking truth behind a deadly israeli attack on a us naval vessel    
  youve a point     those that wanted the status still think theyre chinese and koreans just living in a foreign land or do they see themselves as actual americans     if so why is america shaming another country for the raping of people during a war when they also did such raping when fighting wars     the chinese and koreans living in america were not the actual rape victims why are they not letting go of the past     are they thinking that this will stop act of raping and killing in all future war just by having a statue     we can only appreciate the statue if it brings peace and unity but its not its bring up more hate japan already paid money as repatriation to those comfort women as apologies     in 1994 the japanese government set up the publicprivate asian womens fund awf to distribute additional compensation to south korea the philippines taiwan the netherlands and indonesia110 sixty one korean 13 taiwanese 211 filipino and 79 dutch former comfort women were provided with a signed apology from the then prime minister tomiichi murayama stating as prime minister of japan i thus extend anew my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women      
the chinese comfort women had no idea they were at war or even being attacked they had no sense of nationalism towards the country they lived in they stepped up to be sex workers because it was profitable
i had no clue there were so many japanese on 4chan
  discussing history is not shaming a country   if people think that they need to get over themselves
based osaka fuck leftist parasites
  would you rather have sex with your mom or have a limb blown off and spend and hour bleeding out in agony  being force to be a soldier is worse than being forced to be a sex slave
    i dont think any amount of money or apologies japan can gave and make that will satisfy a rape victim those old comfort women will never be happy and they cant be blamed for it     the problem is that what the statue stand for is based on half fake and half real history according to osaka mayors 10 page report     termination of sister city relationship    
why the fuck did they have one in the first place japan is based and san fran shitsco is whats everything wrong with america
  a monument is not a discussion nitwit
  its just korean and chinese racism against the japanese
    quiet jap your still on time out     you know what you did      the longer you deny it the longer you stay in the corner 
  as a virgin japanese i am offended what did i ever do to you

  women have a much smaller spectrum intelligence than men if you genuinely believe women are more intelligent then you should look at a list of all historical inventions
for the first time researchers have succeeded in creating an iron molecule that can function both as a photocatalyst to produce fuel and in solar cells to produce electricity the results indicate that the iron molecule could replace the more expensive and rarer metals used today    some photocatalysts and solar cells are based on a technology that involves molecules containing metals known as metal complexes the task of the metal complexes in this context is to absorb solar rays and utilise their energy the metals in these molecules pose a major problem however as they are rare and expensive metals such as the noble metals ruthenium osmium and iridium    our results now show that by using advanced molecule design it is possible to replace the rare metals with iron which is common in the earths crust and therefore cheap says chemistry professor kenneth wärnmark of lund university in sweden    together with colleagues kenneth wärnmark has for a long time worked to find alternatives to the expensive metals the researchers focused on iron which with its six per cent prevalence in the earths crust is significantly easier to source the researchers have produced their own ironbased molecules whose potential for use in solar energy applications has been proven in previous studies    in this new study the researchers have moved one step further and developed a new ironbased molecule with the ability to capture and utilise the energy of solar light for a sufficiently long time for it to react with another molecule the new iron molecule also has the ability to glow long enough to enable researchers to see ironbased light with the naked eye at room temperature for the first time    the good result depends on the fact that we have optimised the molecular structure around the iron atom explains colleague petter persson of lund univers     
ity    the study is now published in the journal science according to the researchers the iron molecule in question could be used in new types of photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel either as hydrogen through water splitting or as methanol from carbon dioxide furthermore the new findings open up other potential areas of application for iron molecules eg as materials in light diodes leds    what surprised the lund researchers is that they arrived at good results so quickly in just over five years they succeeded in making iron interesting for photochemical applications with properties largely as good as those of the best noble metals    we believed it would take at least ten years says kenneth wärnmark
  only a matter of time before this tech is bought out like so many other advances in recent years only to be locked away to hold us down by the powers who fear fear
  its a shame really we need more people like jonas salk
  do you have any links or just koolaid
  intellectual property was a mistake

    london police say their tough tactic of ramming violent thieves off their moped as they flee has helped bring down crime in the city  scotland yard released a video friday showing a team of specially trained drivers knocking suspects off their mopeds and motorcycles saying offenders will be targeted at every opportunity  offenders on mopeds and motorcycles who attempt to evade the police are making a choice that puts themselves and others at risk commander amanda pearson said in a statement so our message is clear we can we will and we do target those involved in moped and motorcycle crime at every opportunity
  play stupid games  turn to roadkill
  i bet they wont fucking do it again when they get literally shunted back to reality when a marked police car adjusts their attitude
    you people crack me up if brutality cured crime wed have run out of crime literally hundreds of years ago     could you be more transparent about a moronic sadist
  your welcome bongs  t america
nice
  if brutality cured crime wed have run out of crime literally hundreds of years ago   funny you should mention that violent come rates at these levels are a recent phenomenon so we kinda did  hospitals are likely to blame though in much the same way seatbelts kill pedestrians
  specially trained drivers knocking suspects off their mopeds and motorcycles saying offenders will be targeted at every opportunity  this is a clear sign of the new brutality which will be a hallmark of society to come so you just need to be a suspect riding a moped and some asshole might justifiedly ram you claiming you were suspect what guarantee is there you wont be injured whether seriously or not is not even relevant
   here i dont think it will solve anything but fuck if ill let that prevent me from laughing over it
  what guarantee is there you wont be injured  then dont be a suspect you tard
  violent come rates  heh
  but violent crime rates have been going down for some time at least since the 1990s
  how would you know there is almost zero data from before 1950
  brutality absolutely cures crime if youre willing to go far enough the ussr or north korea had/have very low crime
  it seems they can only knock down thieves caught in the act
  not because of ramming mopeds
  funny you should refer to the ussr or north korea as a model     do we really want that kind of socety
  and police never accidentally shoot innocent people
  1990s    1950s  you poor pathetic little children you horizon is so short  im referring more to the 950s or 990s
  look at singapore id rather live there than in london
  british police
tfw your ass gets handed to you in handtohand combat so you overcompensate with your car
  not new this is sop for the rcmp they do this and then release statements to the effect that the accused damaged their patrol cars
  patrol cars  i thought mounties were supposed to ride battle moose
  they armor the moose
  damaging the moped being stolen  just use guns you insufferable british retards what convoluted means are you going to come up with next to attempt policing without having the means to police catching escaping criminals with elaborate mousetrapstyle rube goldberg machines
  all i can say is good on them moped crime is huge over there
government regulators in beijing have become so desperate to stamp out pornography that they have raised the payout to citizens who report these pernicious publications come december 1st citizens who report locations distributing pornography online or in reality will be rewarded with as much as 600000 yuan 86000  double the usual bounty for porn hunters    the cyberspace administration of china for example cleaned up nearly 10000 accounts on social media accused of spreading politically harmful information and rumors and it looks likely a porn reporting tally will be a good way for drones to keep their social credit score high enough to ensure such necessities as employment education and oxygen    
  way to go ant people
  why is porn harmful
  it reduces your productivity and consumerism  clearly unacceptable
  its addictive and gives a false impression of sex
shitaku complex  antichina news
  be china  have such a horrifically imbalanced gender ratio that some 20 of men will never be able to marry  prostitution is likely illegal so its difficult for them to find sex without a mate  crackdown on porn because lonely single men masturbating is apparently a crime against nature   profit       what the fuck are they thinking who does this benefit i genuinely feel bad for the chinks men need release and there literally arent enough women in china so what does the government expect those millions of men to do when they need to bust a nut this is one of the worst examples of government fatcats being disconnected from the populace that ive ever seen its easy as fuck for them to find partners because theyre rich but for the poorer people women arent gonna be as easily available since theyll have a much larger selection of men to choose from       fuck china
  clearly never read 1984 by penting up all the repressed sexual energy it can be channeled into productive uses such as attending meetings participating in school and government functions working extra hard at your job being a moral busybody and the like  we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother  obrien 1984
  well maybe all those men should just find loving relationships with eachother building a family with a homo and adopting one of the millions of abandoned female babies in china is far more productive than looking at porn all day
if this were to happen in america wed all be billionaires
  not everyone is a faggot like you
  it is not unreasonable for chinese men to be prison gay when they already live under a policestate
    porn is the reason why im a loser  no you are the reason why youre a loser
  well maybe all those men should just find loving relationships with eachother    isnt being gay also illegal in insect hive that is china
have they not heard of vpns
  and just think this is the regime google is going to be assisting soon
  porn is misogynistic and promotes toxic standards towards women
  we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother  so the society we have right now
  yes if they have also heard of 10 years in prison for disturbing the peace
  my gf is chinese they use vpns all the time and have groups of people on website chats that share vpn providers but generally eventually get shut down  never heard of prison sentence though unless if they use it for something highly illegal
  who said porn is the reason people are losers the meaning behind it is that sex is energy spent for selfpleasure resulting in expended energy and being to tired and happy to do anything else for a while not to mention those who are addicted and would be distracted by thoughts of sex while doing other things by removing outside influences of porn the govt could then start circulating its own kosher porn that would probably end with hail to the party in most cases and be rather modest in comparison to other shit no way are they going to show gangbangs tentacles animals homo lesbian or gay or the glorious according to europe bbc
  kek
  if anything this will just contribute to the chinese people deciding theyve had enough bullshit from the government and start rolling heads funny thing is how obviously scared the party is of this possibility despite continually taking steps towards making it more likely by debasing people further and further towards a breaking point
  you can bet faggottry is gonna be next on the ban list if they crack down on sex homosex is nearby
  its already on the banlist
  china is a complete shit hole  if you are found to be gay they will arrest you and force you to have sex with women until you are straight again  absoutely disgusting
  damn im finna go to china and loudly profess how much i love cock then ill be drowning in fishy asian pussy

up to 17 of children could have the symptoms of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder fasd because their mothers drank during pregnancy according to a new study whose findings were criticised for potentially causing pregnant women to panic and seek an abortion    foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is diagnosed from a collection of mental and physical problems in a child including some distinctive facial features such as a small head small eyes and a thin upper lip it can be associated with learning difficulties and mood problems    until now it was estimated that between 2 and 5 of children in the uk had the disorder as a result of their mothers alcohol intake while she was pregnant the nhs says alcohol crosses the placenta to the growing baby who cannot process it well resulting in damage to cells in the brain and body    but the uk has one of the highest reported rates of drinking in pregnancy at just over 40 only exceeded by ireland belarus and denmark leading some to question the prevalence figure      they developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with fasd    they found that 79 of mothers had drunk any alcohol at all when they were pregnant between 6 and 17 of the children in the study had symptoms depending on the exact way in which the researchers did the screening    dr cheryl mcquire researcher in epidemiology and alcoholrelated outcomes at the university of bristol who led the research said this sort of screening is not the same as a formal diagnosis    nevertheless the high rates of prenatal alcohol use and fasdrelevant symptoms that we found in our study suggest that fasd is likely to be a significant public health concern in the uk      
it was important to have better figures so that children affected could get the help they needed she said    however the british pregnancy advisory service bpas disputed the figures and warned that women who are pregnant could panic and consider abortion if the results were miscommunicated    we advise real caution over the interpretation and communication of these findings said clare murphy director of external affairs at the charity which sees over 70000 women each year for pregnancy counselling and abortion care    this study as the authors themselves acknowledge does not prove any causal link between pregnancy drinking and the developmental outcomes recorded and may cause pregnant women and parents needless anxiety    many women have drunk before finding out they are pregnant and messaging around pregnancy drinking which overstates risk or distorts the available evidence can lead some women to consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy or spend that pregnancy wracked with guilt and anxiety this does not benefit anyone    campaigners welcomed the findings however these figures should raise alarm bells throughout westminster and wake up everyone in the nhs and the department of health who for decades have been keeping their heads in the sand about this largely avoidable public health crisis said sandra butcher chief executive of the national organisation for foetal alcohol syndromeuk
she and other support groups hail the advice of the chief medical officer sally davies in 2016 who said it was safest for women who were pregnant or trying to conceive not to drink at all but they said the government needs a strategy for diagnosing children and supporting the families    dr christopher steer of the royal college of paediatrics and child health said many cases remained undiagnosed and that screening studies of children are needed fasd remains the most common and potentially preventable cause of learning and behavioural difficulties in the world he said    while we incorporated expert clinical judgment in our algorithm specification and validation process it was not feasible to conduct individualised assessments of fasd  the new study published in the journal preventive medicine was carried out by researchers at bristol and cardiff universities looking into the records of nearly 13500 children born in the 1990s whose families had signed up to a major ongoing study    they developed a screening tool to analyse the data and assess whether children born to any woman who said she had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy had symptoms consistent with fasd
   whose findings were criticised for potentially causing pregnant women to panic and seek an abortion  if youre two months pregnant and had several glasses of wine most of those days then you probably should get an abortion
  but the uk has one of the highest reported rates of drinking in pregnancy at just over 40 only exceeded by ireland  bartender the smallest shot glass you have i wish to contain my surprise

president donald trumps company planned to give a 50 million penthouse at trump tower moscow to russian president vladimir putin as the company negotiated the luxury real estate development during the 2016 campaign according to four people one of them the originator of the plan    two us law enforcement officials told buzzfeed news that michael cohen trumps personal lawyer at the time discussed the idea with a representative of dmitry peskov putins press secretary    the trump tower moscow plan is at the heart of a new plea agreement by cohen who led the negotiations to bring a gleaming 100story building to the russian capital cohen acknowledged in court that he had lied to congress about the plan in order to protect trump and his presidential campaign    the revelation that representatives of the trump organization planned to forge direct financial links with the leader of a hostile nation at the height of the campaign raises fresh questions about president trumps relationship with the kremlin the plan never went anywhere because the tower deal ultimately fizzled and it is not clear whether trump knew of the intention to give away the penthouse but cohen said in court documents that he regularly briefed trump and his family on the moscow negotiations    
the two men worked furiously behind the scenes into the summer of 2016 to get the moscow deal finished  despite public claims that the development was canned in january before trump won the republican nomination sater told buzzfeed news today that he and cohen thought giving the trump towers most luxurious apartment a 50 million penthouse to putin would entice other wealthy buyers to purchase their own in russia the oligarchs would bend over backwards to live in the same building as vladimir putin sater told buzzfeed news my idea was to give a 50 million penthouse to putin and charge 250 million more for the rest of the units all the oligarchs would line up to live in the same building as putin a second source confirmed the plan    sater a brash real estate promoter who pleaded guilty to racketeering in 1998 and became a longtime asset to us law enforcement and intelligence agencies had worked with the trump organization on deals in the past and said he came up with the idea cohen sater recalled said great idea    cohen would not comment cohens attorney guy petrillo did not return a detailed message the trump organization also did not return a message seeking comment a spokesperson for the kremlin declined to answer questions about the project    trump had personally signed the letter of intent to move forward on the trump tower moscow plan on oct 28 2015 the day of the third republican primary debate    on thursday shortly after news broke about cohens guilty plea trump told reporters there was a good chance that i wouldnt have won the presidential election in which case i would have gotten back into the business and why should i lose lots of opportunities
buzzfeed  thats gonna be a yikes from me guy
according to the criminal information filed against cohen thursday on jan 20 2016 he spoke with a russian government official referred to only as assistant 1 about the trump tower moscow plan for 20 minutes this person appears to be an assistant to peskov a top kremlin official whom cohen had attempted to reach by email    cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward both in securing land to build the proposed tower and financing the construction the court document states    cohen had previously maintained that he never got a response from the official but in court on thursday he acknowledged that was a lie    two fbi agents with direct knowledge of the trump tower moscow negotiations told buzzfeed news earlier this year that cohen was in frequent contact with foreign individuals about the real estate venture  and that some of these individuals had knowledge of or played a role in 2016 election meddling the identity of those individuals remains unknown    developing a tower in russia had long been a dream of the trump organization which pursued a deal there for three decades after trump announced his candidacy in the summer of 2015 sater saw an opportunity to revive the development    i figured hes in the news his name is generating a lot of good press sater told buzzfeed news earlier this year a lot of russians werent willing to pay a premium licensing fee to put donalds name on their building now maybe they would be    so he turned to his old friend cohen to get it off the ground they arranged a licensing deal by which trump would lend his name to the project and collect a part of the profits sater lined up a russian development company to build the project and said that vtb a russian financial institution that faced us sanctions at the time would finance it vtb officials have denied taking part in any negotiations about the project    the backandforth carried into the summer when sater said that top bankers and govern
  didnt they leak the leak about the leaks on a mattress  the one that is more and more credible by the day
why doesnt trump just suck putins dick and get it over with already
things fall apart  the center cannot hold  mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
buzzfeed  could you shills get any more obvious
  yep and nothing in the steele dossier has been disproven trumphumpers just repeat the discredited dossier over and over again because they dont want people talking about it    buzzfeed is quickly becoming a respectable news source what a world we live in
  they released unverified intelligence labeled as unverified intelligence    its consistent with whats in cohens guilty plea which are filed court documents if its untrue trump can simply sue for libel he loves doing that
  and the fact that he hasnt sued speaks volumes if you have an airtight case there is literally no reason not to sue
  buzzfeed is quickly becoming a respectable news source what a world we live in  buzzfeed shills pls go and stay go
  two fbi agents with direct knowledge of the trump tower moscow negotiations told buzzfeed news earlier this year that cohen was in frequent contact with foreign individuals about the real estate venture  and that some of these individuals had knowledge of or played a role in 2016 election meddling the identity of those individuals remains unknown  this is the important part its only a matter of time until the names of these foreign individuals come out
  its got literal quotes in it from cohens business associate felix sater    so are you going to claim that sater is lying or that buzzfeed fabricated a quote from sater
        youre samefagging this thread pretty hard must make you worried
  only one of those post are mine  why are you so nervous that people call your bullshit out dude
  youre not calling bullshit out that requires identifying where the bullshit is bullshit    youre simply labeling something bullshit without evidence
  im just the first post
  nno you are nervous  aaand youve already lost
  using buzzfeed as a news source when multiple stories they ran were false
  prove it
  be buzzfeed writer  spam your poorly written poorly researched articles on /news/  same fag them all and bump them in a vain attempt to get more clicks for your failing website  freak the fuck out when anons call you out on it  hmmmm
  nothing they have run was false they are known for clickbait top 10 lists not for being inaccurate
  given that buzzfeed has broken several hundred stories from a statistical perspective you would expect there to be a 99 chance that a given buzzfeed story is true even if they have run multiple false stories a claim also requiring evidence in the past
  1 i dont think you know what the word spam means  2 you are trying your hardest not to address the substance of the article  according to the criminal information filed against cohen thursday on jan 20 2016 he spoke with a russian government official referred to only as assistant 1 about the trump tower moscow plan for 20 minutes this person appears to be an assistant to peskov a top kremlin official whom cohen had attempted to reach by email    cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward both in securing land to build the proposed tower and financing the construction the court document states    cohen had previously maintained that he never got a response from the official but in court on thursday he acknowledged that was a lie  are you saying they are lying
  feel free to report it if you think its against the rules lets see which one of us wins    im sure youll keep crying in this thread when your report doesnt work
  hello buzzfeed writer  advertising is not allowed on 4chan
  how come people dont just normally visit your website is it because you arent a legitimate news source or something  like why do you have to spam your bullshit here

  youre free to report me for advertising if you believe my post violates the rules
  keeps hemorrhaging money  how did that whole hulk hogan thing go for you guys lmao
the only argument they have is to accuse random anons of being buzzfeed shills  this isnt going away kids trump either lied to the fbi about his business dealings in russia during 2016 or lied to the public or both that is an impeachable offense
  lmao that was gawker you enormous idiot i guess that confirms you were just a retard the whole time
  that is an impeachable offense  and better yet the democrats now have the votes to impeach him    maybe redhats should have spent less time whining about shills and more time trying to win the midterms
  he thinks the house preforms impeachment  oof   back to civics 101 kiddo
  i guess you would know your own industry better than me 
    preforms  this says enough about your post
veeeeery interesting how of all the threads on the board this is the one that one very bitter trumptard embarks on a massive campaign to astroturf its almost as if he has something to hide
  i was about to address the fact that the democrats still dont control the senate but i see you made a typo so it looks like i win haha better luck next time pal
  youre still wrong the democrats can impeach trump at any time    why dont you get educated before you run your mouth
  moving to impeach without the senate  anon
  impeachment removes the presidents ability to pardon    bet you didnt know that did you    next two years are gonna be fun
43 posts   7 ips  sounds like we got samefags in this thread
  moving to impeach without the senate  anon seriously take a civics class you obviously ditched yours in highschool
there are plenty of us congressmen who are israel citizens and every major industry in the united states is controlled by people loyal to israel who all literally go kiss that magic schizo wall  and thats why we need to stop the russian
  impeachment removes the presidents ability to pardon    bet you didnt know that did you    next two years are gonna be fun
  moving to impeach without the senate  anon seriously take a civics class you obviously ditched yours in highschool
  the facebook boomer posts like this are downright creepy
  id say the leftist astroturfing is worse
  and youd be wrong
  so you think the leftist astroturfing is actually a good thing then  i think it just makes an echo chamber where no one here dissenting points of view where no real discussion takes places you just turn a once great board into news article marketing   but hey you do you bro
    once great board  since when    by the way people are discussing youre just covering your ears because you dont like whats being said
  its really easy to copy paste articles and there is only so many ways you can type fuck drumpf over and over again before it gets stale dude   its been 3 years of this shit youd think you people would get over it by now
  buzzfeed  yeah no  buzzfeeds still desperate to recover after publishing the salacious and unverified trump dossier  no law enforcement official is going to leak to fucking buzzfeed
  fox news and the wall street journal have repeated the claim so it was good enough for them
  fox news and the wall street journal have repeated the claim  yes theyre reporting that buzzfeed is reporting on it they havent and cant verify any of the claims in buzzfeeds article    so it was good enough for them  because they dont take any of the heat if when buzzfeeds story proves to be salacious and unverified bunk nonsense because they only merely reported what buzzfeed was reporting
  the wsj has repeated the penthouse claim as verified without any reference to the buzzfeed article and without any qualifiers    
  the wsj has repeated the penthouse claim as verified without any reference to the buzzfeed article and without any qualifiers  too bad that cant be verified that from behind a paywall nice try you sneaky fuck
  moscowpresident trumps failed 2016 effort to build a trump tower in moscow is at the center of a charge unveiled thursday against michael cohen mr trumps former personal attorney    mr cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to congress last year that he ended negotiations over the moscow project in january 2016 mr cohen said talks including with mr trump continued until june 2016 one month before the former developer was nominated for president at the republican national committees convention    mr trump said thursday that mr cohen is lying and he noted that no deal ever happened but if it had it would not have been an issue because he was still operating as a private businessman the white house declined to comment    the moscow project marked the culmination of 30 years of interest by mr trump in establishing a foothold in russia and nearby ukraine the push involved more than 20 separate developments though ultimately none came to fruition one advanced far enough to leave a giant hole eight stories down in the ground before being abandoned the proposed plans for the 2016 project included giving russian president vladimir putin a 50 million penthouse longtime trump associate felix sater said in an interview mr cohen loved the idea mr sater said
what exactly is the problem here
  i like how as soon as a second source was provided the tune changed instantly from its not true to it doesnt matter
  what strategy shillkun  im here to shitpost
  just more proof they never intended to address the article in the first place    only way to beat them is to overwhelm them with articles they cant cover them all up
itt /pol/s gets desperate and goes full damage control
  that was my first post itt can you answer my question instead of being paranoid
  i wasnt aware i was running in the midterm elections
  if by that you mean providing multiple authoritative sources for a story im all for it    if you mean resetting your ip to spam /news/ with threads im not so much for that
  it matters because it was a proposed deal dealing almost directly with the government of russia at a time when donald trumps legal counsel represented to congress that no such deal was in the works
  i think you have schizophrenia anon
thread successfully derailed nobody is talking about michael cohen
  seek psychological help immediately
  all of these threads are just different facets of the endless neverending trump general discussion thread    the people who hate trump still hate him rhe people who like trump still like him and nobody still ever say anything interesting      copycat
  10 sentences  literally reporting whats being reported by buzzfeed without naming buzzfeed  holy fuck they actually put that behind a paywall
  everything in the wall street journal is behind a paywall except certain opeds    that said the article is longer than that it follows with more context and then a timeline of trumps business ventures    i dont even have a subscription with google and a new mobile ip they give you a free article or something im not sure how it works
  that said the article is longer than that it follows with more context and then a timeline of trumps business ventures  sure it does  with google and a new mobile ip they give you a free article or something im not sure how it works  sounds like theft jim
not gonna lie former trump voter here this is fucking hilarious watching trump crash and burn but in all seriousness we cant let this guy get the nuclear codes
  do you actually believe any of the things youve just said or are you just opportunistically shitposting
bbbut my no ccollusion meme  trumpfags btfo yet again
  trump likes to repeat the word collusion because collusion is not a crime but you know what is conspiracy thats what hes going to be charged with
    trump is a public figure and cant sue unless he can prove malicious intent something which is notoriously difficult to do suing would accomplish nothing but further reinforce the belief that he is anti free press
  he called them the enemy of the people is he really trying to convince anyone that he isnt anti free press
  unless he can prove malicious intent  malicious intent requires only that the statement made was either knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for the truth statements like those in the op are not made accidentally if they were false they were knowingly false there is no whoops it was a mistake available to the potential defendant
  im just saying why suing for libel makes no sense and the people arguing for it are absolutely retarded/underaged for not already knowing that      so long as they have plausible deniability you cant prove they had malicious intent seriously a simple google search will bring up numerous articles discussing why these suits rarely if ever work out
    /pol/babbies in a seethe
  buzzfeed news  news
  all of these threads are just different facets of the endless neverending trump general discussion thread  try actually reading the story sometime
the back peddling begins  
  it was all over the site when gawker got ass raped sounds like you were too young at the time to be here newfag
  i dont think you actually know what astroturfing is
  the right wing thinks anything that doesnt push their ideology is astroturfing and shilling because who can someone not be apart of their hive mind
  he actually only started repeating the word astroturfing after someone else said it earlier in the thread its amusing how predictable they are that they just say no you when theyre accused of something
  you do realize the president of the us engaged in a criminal conspiracy with russia to steal the election via hacking and propaganda and hes being investigated for this and the investigation has found many members of his campaign guilty of this already and it appears trump will be indicted himself any day now right no fucking wonder everyone is talking about it how could you not its insane that hes still president at this point
  you do realize the president of the us engaged in a criminal conspiracy with russia  they dont care theyll still defend him even if he gets charged with treason
  lumping people into groups to dehumanize using terms like they is just lazy it is also a great way to shut down any form of productive discussion lock yourself into an echo chamber and further exacerbate the partisan divide
  lol hey op get a life ohh wait you already do stalker kek
  well then maybe you shouldnt have used this tactic for the past two years you brought this upon yourself you have fucking ruined politics
  you you you  i was unaware that i personally had this much influence on the state of us politics or in any way supported this shift in tone do you have a source which supports your assertions
  its generally the public vote that has influence on us politics the people of the public the usa is suffering from its own disease
    thread still derailed nobody is talking about michael cohen or what hes admitting to doing in june 2016 for trump
  all the people who care are discussing it
  unnamed sources  told buzzfeed  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  the wall street journal has signed onto the accusations so youre going to need a new canned shitpost its in the thread
  too bad for you russians threads last for a very long time on /news/ you cant hide this forever
  you can bump it as many times as you want but you cant make people care
  ppeople ttttttotally dont care  in your fantasy world maybe
  if people cared on their own you wouldnt have to bump it seeking comments all the time
  no they dont
  thread still derailed nobody is talking about michael cohen or what hes admitting to doing in june 2016 for trump    but but muh russians
/pol/ in full cover up mode  not only does this give motive for why trump conspired with the russians business deals and money it blows up his forced meme that this was all a witch hunt   we now know trumps motive for why he betrayed the us     even better his kids going to be charged for lying to congress since thats what cohen plead guilty to and we already know trump jr lied to congress this should get fun
  it also proves that hes been lying this entire time when hes repeatedly claimed he had nothing to do with russia
  denying reality this hard

    michael cohens guilty plea in special counsel robert muellers investigation on thursday provided new details about why president donald trump pursued friendly ties with russia during the 2016 campaign he tried to secure a lucrative real estate deal in moscow    a court document filed by mueller states that cohen  trumps former personal lawyer and fixer  lied to congress about plans to build a trump tower in moscow    cohen told congress that negotiations to build the tower stopped in january 2016 but cohen now admits those talks continued into at least june 2016 well into the presidential campaign and even after trump became the gops nominee there were also plans to give the buildings 50 million penthouse to russian president vladimir putin    all of this puts trumps praise of putin during the campaign in a whole new  and disconcerting  light    since 1987 trump has wanted to build  or at least put his name on  a luxury building in russia his latest effort came in 2015 when cohen and felix sater a russianborn businessman who was trumps company liaison on a potential moscow deal worked their contacts in moscow to try to make a deal happen    on october 28 2015  the same day as the third republican presidential debate  trump signed a letter of intent allowing cohen to negotiate the licensing deal with the russians ultimately the deal fell through and the project never broke ground    after the revelations that russia had interfered in the 2016 election while favoring trump the negotiations took on new significance cohen told congress three lies about them    1 the trump tower moscow project ended in january 2016 and was not discussed extensively with others in the trump organization  2 cohen never agreed to travel to russia in connection with the moscow project and never considered asking trump to travel for the project
3 cohen did not recall any russian government response or contact about the moscow project    heres what cohen says now    1 discussions about the trump tower moscow project went on at least until june 2016  not january of that year as cohen previously stated he also admitted to speaking with trump about the project more than three times  2 cohen considered traveling to russia and taking trump with him cohen also asked a senior campaign official about the possibility for trump to go to russia  3 russian officials did respond to cohens inquiries about the moscow project around january 14 2016 cohen emailed the office dmitry peskov putins press secretary and trusted adviser seeking help with the tower deal about six days later a peskov assistant and cohen had a 20minute call    this is bad for trump cohen says he aimed to secure a lucrative business deal with russians closely linked with putin on trumps behalf during the 2016 presidential election  all while trump was repeatedly championing better washingtonmoscow ties in campaign speeches    whats worse its entirely possible trump knew a close confidant willingly lied to congress
trump once said he had no dealings with russia now he claims everybody knew about them  trump has dramatically moved the goalposts about his contacts with russia here are the receipts  
  and nothing in the steele dossier has been disproven    thats not how accusations work though
  so whats the evidence he planned to  wheres the contracts how much did he put down and when
  sadly for you nothing in the steele dossier has been dis proven however more and more stuff has been proven like trumps connections to russia

russian hackers werent the ones behind the theft of democratic emails that upended the 2016 presidential race conspiracy theorist jerome corsi told his infowars fans last year instead corsi said democratic national committee staffer seth rich had stolen the emails and was murdered in revenge for the heist    but corsi was lying in an email to trump confidante roger stone in 2016 corsi acknowledged that hackers were behind the email theft according to newly released messages    despite that admission both corsi and stone played key roles promoting the conspiracy theory about rich stone became one of the first major figures in trumps orbit to suggest rich was murdered over the emails tweeting on august 10 2016 that rich had ties to dnc heist    in 2017 after richs parents begged rightwing media personalities to stop pushing conspiracy theories about their son corsi put the blame for the email theft on rich in a threepart infowars series    corsis theory helped fuel conspiracists on the right who claim without evidence that rich was murdered on the orders of hillary clinton but emails from special counsel robert muellers investigation into the trump campaign and russia show that corsi knew all along that it really was hackers who gave the emails to wikileaks    in an august 2 2016 email made public tuesday in draft court papers prepared by muellers office corsi told stone that hackers were behind the wikileaks releases    
why does anyone listen to jerome corsi at all after the swift boat shit in 2004
  because when did republicans care about the codes of ethics facts human decency believing in america
  but im sure its just a coincidence they were promoting a conspiracy theory created and disseminated by russia and that gave cover for their crimes no collusion

  tdb  sidestepping that hot pile of tabloidtier garbage the passage from the court document not the actual email as per usual with tdb theyre using to base this article on      word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps one shortly after im back 2nd in octimpact planned to be very damaging time to let more thanthe clinton campaign chairman to be exposed as in bed w/ enemy if they are not ready to drop hrc hillary rodham clinton that appears to be the game hackers are now about would not hurt to start suggesting hrc old memory bad has stroke  neither he nor she well i expect that much of next dump focus setting stage for foundation debacle    in this context hackers sounds like a colloquial usage in reference to wikileaks tdb interpreting that necessarily as a group of hackers independent of wikileaks and definitely not seth rich is well its not very good journalism to be polite
  hackers sounds like a colloquial usage in reference to wikileaks  if he believed that wikileaks hacked the emails themselves then that doesnt do his position any favors    if he believes that wikileaks didnt do any hacking but instead referred to wikileaks as hackers anyway that doesnt do your position any favors as its selfevidently retarded
  if he believed that wikileaks hacked the emails themselves then that doesnt do his position any favors  referring to wikileaks as hackers does not mean he actually believed they did the hacking themselves given that wikileaks has been colloquially referred to as hackers in the mainstream regularly since chelsea manning went to prison    if he believes that wikileaks didnt do any hacking but instead referred to wikileaks as hackers anyway that doesnt do your position any favors as its selfevidently retarded  its not you just dont like the possibility that this article is just bad journalism
  given that wikileaks has been colloquially referred to as hackers in the mainstream regularly since chelsea manning went to prison  examples    its not you just dont like the possibility that this article is just bad journalism  im not the one desperately defending the honestly of a proven liar based on the notion that he secretly described something as something it was not    reading the term hackers to mean hackers is normal reading hackers to mean something else entirely is retarded mental gymnastics
  if he believed that wikileaks hacked the emails themselves then that doesnt do his position any favors  not him but this literally isnt how they work and has never been how they work they just publish things they receive   taking this  and expanding it into the article is a massive leap of logic
  examples  the entirety of news coverage of wikileaks since 2013 at least    im not the one desperately defending the honestly of a proven liar  im not defending his honesty im pointing out bad journalism by tdb    the notion that he secretly described something as something it was not  reading the term hackers to mean hackers is normal reading hackers to mean something else entirely is retarded mental gymnastics  and misinterpreting someone elses argument to make it easier to attack is textbook r/politics bugman tactic    wikileaks says it doesnt hack but it does work closely with hackers allegedly including seth rich someone referring to wikileaks as hackers especially someone born in 1946 in passing to a likeminded individual of similar age probably did so knowing the reference would go over
  the entirety of news coverage of wikileaks since 2013 at least  yeah thats not an example a quick check of recent new york times articles on wikileaks theyve got a whole subheading for it it seems shows zero references to wikileaks as hackers in the first five articles    completely blowing off a request for examples when asked for examples is retarded    wikileaks says it doesnt hack but it does work closely with hackers allegedly including seth rich  if he was referring to seth rich seth rich was dead at the time so its extremely unlikely that seth rich was now about any sort of game    someone referring to wikileaks as hackers  someone referring to hackers was probably referring to hackers and not playing some sort of magical rebus word game where you fill in the blanks to reveal the secret meaning within
  need a weed wacker to cut down the rest of the strawmen youre dealing with
  try pointing out alleged misrepresentations instead of just claiming theyve been made so as to not have to deal with anything in the actual post

    the company wants to retain as many executives as it can but sears is laying off employees who staffed hundreds of stores it is closing many hourly workers claim they will not be paid severance    shelia brewer who worked for 17 years as a fulltime hourly employee at a kmart in rockford illinois said the company told her shed get eight weeks of severance instead she received a letter saying that severance payments were being halted because of the bankruptcy and she would get only the four weeks of pay she had already received    it hit me hard i was already struggling as it was she said she said the bonus plan makes her angry    they say we cant get our severance because theres no money but theyre getting bonuses its like a slap in the face she said    a sears spokesman declined to comment on the bonus plan or its current severance policy    eddie lampert the companys primary shareholder and chairman apparently will not receive a bonus according to the filing    the three top executives who were given the responsibility for running the company during its reorganization are in position for the largest bonuses they are chief financial officer robert riecker chief digital officer leena munjal and gregory ladley president of the companys clothing and footwear business    cont
    each could receive as much as 240000 a quarter in bonus payments for hitting the maximum cash flow targets they could receive four times that much if sears goes out of business in something the company called an acceleration event    retention bonuses for top executives are not unusual when companies go bankrupt but bankruptcy law limits how much severance companies can pay    toys r us won approval for up to 16 million in bonuses for 17 top executives a year ago during its failed attempt to stay in business despite objections from employees groups and others    its outrageous that the bankruptcy court is considering bonuses for sears high paid executives while laid off employees get their severance pay cut off said carrie gleason campaign manager for rise up retail a retail employee advocacy group this is exactly what happened at toys r us a handful of executives who couldnt save the company got millions in bonuses while tens of thousands of dedicated employees were denied their promised severance pay    end
and people say free market works
  man i need to become an executive of a failing corporation
kind of makes you wonder what will happen if the government could legislate the multimillion a year execs who ran a billion dollar company into the ground to work for minimum wage or something while they work through the bankruptcy that occurred on their watch
  three top executives could get nearly 1 million each if the company goes out of business if sears remains in business they could get nearly 500000 each for hitting the top performance targets  so they stand to make more if the company fails
  in the short run i assune another years worth of paychecks is worth more than 500 grand
the peak of prosperity and the trough of corruption in the united states was in a time when there was effectually and income cap
  prove it
  it works as intended which means the average person should riot
    rich fuckers help each other  its the way of the world not just corporate america
amazing how no one in this thread has taken an econ course  what do you think will happen if they dont pay those bonuses  all the best talent of the corporation will leave asap and leave behind only the incompetent   please read prices law and consider how this affects a dying company
  
  people have taken an economic course thats why they think shit like free market works  they usually dont take the next level if econ which tells you dont stick with a dying company thats basic reasoning
  is this sarcasm the company is already fucked in a world racing to online shopping giants such as amazon walmart etc talent left a long time ago    only ones left at the company now are these assholes and wage slaves
  best talent  they sell everyday nonsense what talent
  the company is in a tailspin clearly the current upper management isnt doing their job and shouldnt be rewarded for driving it into the ground
  what do you think the executives are going to knuckle down and try to save the company its dead jim  the higher ups still working there are only there to finalize the paperwork and collect a paycheck for minimal effort  take the bonuses out of the picture and if management bails someone else will finish the bankruptcy and the 19 million will go towards letting the business last just a little bit longer so the other employees can try to find another job
give me doubles
  they did this to us who worked for sears canada said they couldnt afford to pay my dads pension    target canada did something similar for their ceo gave him a multimillion bonus for what essentially was a reward payment for mismanaging the company what a mad world we live in karl marx was right
  and try to save the company  no not at all  but its very tricky to dismantle a company in a way that is the least painful to investors  there is a right way and lots of very wrong ways  this work is not easy and very few can do it  hence the bonuses
  if theyre not able to save the company from bankruptcy i wouldnt call them talent by any means
  company is bankrupt  executives are talent  they are failures anon
  karl marx was right    kill yourself commie subhuman
  how about instead of telling him to kys you explain to him why hes wrong just makes you look like an ass
    what was he right about that people are greedy do you think thats insightful or unique to a particular economic system and not humans themselves
  the fuck are you on about i was stating that  should have explained his point of view of why he thought  was wrong instead of just telling  to kys
  you dont even know what the core argument here is youre just arguing for the sake of it it should be abundantly clear that my reply is in regards to  asking  to explain why karl marx was wrong
  because democracy is nonnegotiable initiating directive 7395 destroy all communistsred chinese infiltration unit eliminatedlet freedom ring
  they shouldnt be getting bonuses just for turning off the lights
what does an executive even do the thingy working at the front desk has to smile at people a lot and memorize the catalog i get that but what does an executive do
  different guy here his core argument was perfectly clear  these kind of things happen because of capitalism people who mismanage a company get a reward and people who work get a punishment for their mismanagement just like marx argued that these kinds of one could say perverse things would happen in capitalistic society  in some other kind of society people who mismanage would get the punishment themselves maybe get fired or a pay cut at least not get rewarded like in capitalism
  executive is the head boss they can enact policies throughout a company and fire people under them for not doing their job well enough the executive is also usually the one who gets blamed when a company does badly
  this is why i hate economics as it is taught now make up something designed to attribute value to useless people or services repeat it enough until it is considered a rule of economics everyone accepts it as true     id love to know what these fucks do all day at sears hq that warrants paying them this much on a good day let alone as the company declares bankruptcy
  what does an executive even do  get most of the profits
  watch american psycho if you want some insight
  economics isnt a science like biology or physics it cant be used to explain or learn anything it a system of recording like history but with more math
    the problem with economics as it is taught is the level of abstraction every supply and demand equation depends on perfect competition and perfect information which are impossible to measure and verify and also patently impossible anyway  this is the crux of why the invisible hand theory has largely been abandoned by modern economists not that anyone listens to them
  greed happens because it is human nature and will happen in every political/economic system eventually every system has a loophole that those in power can exploit to line their own pockets that is what  was saying    if your argument is that this specific form of corporate greed would not happen in a communist paradise than you may be right however by that logic i could say that using a planned economy to divert resources and wealth into political leaders pockets is something which cant happen in a capitalist country
  sure greed happens but in capitalism its more rampant and even favourable the more money you collect the better that is greed basically greed and money capital are intertwined     its not good for other people like workers if you give yourself a reward for doing a shittastic job so its not good for societies on the whole but capitalists seem to think it is every system has loopholes but in capitalistic society you can easily buy sorry lobby those loopholes for you lobbying costs money also when politician gets money for his election campaign its job well done for him he gets money and gets elected but i dont think its good for society in society where money is not the most important thing things are more balanced for example lobbying is more difficult    you are talking about communism and planned economies well i wasnt every ism is shit because they only work on paper they always lead to problems in the long run in capitalism the problem is rich people get richer and people who are rich have more power on everything because everything is dependent on money also every ism dont take account the problems with it in the real world there are no problems in paper so its easier just to ignore them because capitalism communism etc is the best system
  the initial person claimed marx was right whether that was meant as support of communism or not really doesnt matter as that is how it will be commonly interpreted my whole point was that no system is perfect because people are not perfect so long as greed exists there will be people exploiting one another we can go into the nuance of how easy it is to exploit one system or another as well as the pros/cons but that isnt what this discussion was about
  sure and my point is that in capitalism the greed and capitalism itself leads into unfair situations like in the op which pretty much was the point marx made so he was right
  greed leads to unfair situations in every context the method by which the greed manifests itself is the only difference this should be blatantly obvious and if you really want to get into the nitty gritty details the us economy is not capitalist but rather a mixed market which is closest to cronyism/corporatism
  not him but id say that corporatism and cronyism are the natural results of capitalism
  but they arent capitalism in any case as i stated before while we could go into the details on this it isnt what the discussion was initially about and i dont want to derail this thread further
  capitalism leads to cronyism which is in larger scale the point marx made that capitalism itself leads into trouble the problems in capitalism are written in the system itself it logically follows that if money is always the driving force and number one thing in capitalism the problems also come from money itself so basically capitalism itself the greed problem is bigger in capitalism than in any other system because greed is even favourable and more moneybetter people who have more money have more power in capitalism then even democracy is shittier in capitalism one vote is not one vote any more but after election people with money for example can lobby favourable things for them shittier things for other people because they have money to do that some other system has some other problems which are bigger than in capitalism but the scale of the problems is the most important thing i too dont want to continue this discussion any more though
  the company is closing so they will have to leave anyway     i think you should reread that econ book
the human intestine may provide up to 10 percent of blood cells in circulation from its own reservoir of bloodforming stem cells a surprising new study from researchers at columbia university vagelos college of physicians and surgeons has found    scientists had previously thought that blood cells are created exclusively in the bone marrow from a special population of hematopoietic stem cells    why it matters    intestinal transplantation is the only longterm option for patients with crohns and other diseases if their intestines fail but high rejection rates and lifethreatening complications from immunosuppression have limited the success of human intestinal transplantation    when a person receives a transplanted organ the immune system often recognizes the new organ as foreign and destroys it powerful immunosuppressive drugs blunt these responses but that makes the patient much more susceptible to infections and other complications    how do blood cells from the donor help the transplant recipient    analysis of circulating white blood cells in patients after intestinal transplantation suggests that the cells derived from the donated intestine have matured and been educated in the recipient to be tolerant of the recipients own tissues likewise white blood cells made by the recipient after the transplant may be educated to be tolerant of the donated tissue    we are clearly showing that theres immunological crosstalk between the two sets of blood cells that protects the transplant from the patients immune system and protects the patient from the transplant says sykes    the hematopoietic stem cells in the intestine are eventually replaced by a circulating pool from the recipient the researchers also found    how the finding could improve transplantation  
because patients with more donor blood cells had lower organ rejection rates the results point toward new strategies for managing organ transplantation    the intestines reservoir of bloodforming stem cells was discovered when researchersled by megan sykes md director of the columbia center for translational immunologynoticed that the blood of patients who had received intestinal transplants contained cells from the donor the researchers tracked the donors blood cells back to their source hematopoietic stem cells in the donated intestine    the blood cells created from cells in the donors intestine also may be beneficial to the transplant recipient the more donor blood cells a patient had in circulation the less likely they were to reject their transplants    its possible that patients with a high level of donor cells may not require as much immunosuppression as they are currently getting says sykes and reducing immunosuppression could improve outcomes    seeding transplanted organs with additional hematopoietic stem cells from the donor may also increase donorrecipient crosstalk and boost tolerance of the transplant    that could improve the lives of transplant patients dramatically sykes says our ultimate goal is to get immune tolerance which would allow us to remove immunosuppression altogether and have the graft treated as self by the patient thats really the holy grail
whats next    the researchers are planning a study that will try to boost the number of hematopoietic stem cells delivered during intestinal transplantation hopefully leading to higher levels of donor blood cells in circulation immune tolerance and a reduced need for immunosuppressive drugs    other types of transplants may benefit from similar interventions even for organs that dont appear to carry their own reservoirs of hematopoietic stem cells    caveats    this study analyzed 21 patients who had received intestinal transplants    although the finding of a novel population of hematopoietic stem cells is exciting it does not yet justify changes in the current standard of care    the study human intestinal allografts contain functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that are maintained by a circulating pool was published nov 29 in cell stem cell

  you could quote some of the article you know ya lazy bastich    brazils government has backtracked on hosting the united nations annual meeting to address global climate change just two months after offering to do so    the government conducted a meticulous analysis and determined that budgetary and financial restrictions prevent it from playing host according to the press office of the foreign ministry the current government made the decision in consultation with the transition team of presidentelect jair bolsonaro who will take office jan 1 and is in the process of alerting the un the press office added    incoming economy minister paulo guedes has pledged to prioritize debt reduction and cutting public spending in order to put the countrys finances back onto a sustainable path following four straight years of primary budget deficits bolsonaro has abandoned his plan to quit the paris agreement but still proposes loosening environmental regulations and developing the amazon much to the alarm of activists
good climate change needs to be addressed but the way the un is going about it is less about asking countries to participate and more about making demands of them
immigration lawyers say border agents are again removing children from their parents the explanation theyre protecting kids from criminal dads and moms immigration advocates say its zero tolerance by another name          the trump administration has quietly resumed separating immigrant families at the border in some cases using vague or unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing or minor violations against the parents including charges of illegally reentering the country as justification     over the last three months lawyers at catholic charities which provides legal services to immigrant children in government custody in new york have discovered at least 16 new separation cases they say they have come across such instances by chance and via their own sleuthing after children were put into temporary foster care and shelters with little or no indication that they arrived at the border with their parents     propublica stumbled upon one more case late last month after receiving a call from a distraught salvadoran father who had been detained in south texas and whose 4yearold son brayan had literally been yanked from his grasp by a customs and border protection agent after they crossed the border and asked for asylum julio the father asked to be identified only by his first name because he was fleeing gang violence and worried about the safety of relatives back home     i failed him said julio 27 sobbing uncontrollably everything i had done to be a good father was destroyed in an instant     propublica tracked down brayan who has reddishblond hair and an endearing lisp at a temporary foster care agency in new york city and reached out to the lawyer who represents him
until that phone call the lawyer jodi ziesemer a supervising attorney at catholic charities had no idea that brayan had been separated from his father the chaos she said felt disturbingly like zero tolerance all over again    its so disheartening ziesemer said this was supposed to be a policy that ended    officially it has on june 20 president donald trump signed an executive order retreating from his socalled zerotolerance immigration enforcement policy which called on authorities to criminally prosecute adults caught illegally crossing the border and separate them from any children they brought with them a week later a federal judge dana m sabraw issued an injunction against the separations and ordered the government to put the thousands of affected families back together    sabraw however exempted cases in which the safety of the child was at risk and crucially imposed no standards or oversight over those decisions as a result attorneys say immigration officials  taking their cues from an administration that has made it clear it still believes family separations are an effective deterrent  are using whatever justification they can find with or without substantiation to deem immigrant parents unfit or unsafe    if the authorities have even the most specious evidence that a parent was a gang member or had some kind of blemish on their record said neha desai a senior attorney at the national center for youth law anything they can come up with to say that the separation is for the health and welfare of the child then theyll separate them    in an email a senior cbp official acknowledged that immigrant families are still being separated but said the separations had nothing to do with zero tolerance the official added that this administration continues to comply with the law and separates adults and children when required for the safety and security of the child
the official declined to say how many children have been taken from their parents for what was said to be their own protection    cbp officials explained that brayan was such a case one official said that the agency had conducted a routine background check on julio and that it confirmed his gang affiliation with ms13 spokeswoman corry schiermeyer declined to provide the evidence the agency had to support the allegation saying only that it was law enforcement sensitive nor would she say why cbp believed julio was a danger to his child but sabraws order she said did not prevent these separations in fact it explicitly allows dhs to continue with this prior practice    cbp has also not shared any evidence supporting its assertion of julios gang ties with his lawyer georgia evangelista who said she wonders whether it exists    on tuesday a government lawyer repeated the allegation to an immigration judge in south texas but said he could not provide documentation to the court because it was confidential according to evangelista she said the immigration judge did not press for release of the evidence but freed her client on an 8000 bond evangelista was frustrated by the outcome saying how can we fight these charges when we dont know what they are    according to evangelista julio arrived at the border in midseptember carrying a letter prepared by a salvadoran lawyer that explained that he had fled el salvador with his son because he had been attacked and threatened by gangs there for years at evangelistas request the salvadoran lawyer and julios former employer sent sworn statements vouching for julios character and stating that he was never involved in criminal activity    im furious about this they arent playing by the rules evangelista said referring to us immigration authorities theyre treating him like a criminal so they can justify taking away his son wheres the proof its his word against theirs it sickens me
susan watson a civil rights and family lawyer said this kind of action could not be done without a judges review in custody cases that do not involve immigration issues constitutionally before a parent is separated from a child you are entitled to due process she said some decision in a dark corner by the border patrol doesnt meet that standard    in new york ziesemer says the new separations identified by her organization involve children between the ages of 2 and 17 including brayan all of them arrived in new york city without any records indicating they had been separated from their parents at the border and why a few weeks ago the aclu which brought the lawsuit over the first round of family separations sent a letter to the justice department raising concerns about the new cases specifically about the grounds for the separations and why the aclu hadnt been notified about them    lee gelernt the aclu attorney who led the organizations lawsuit against family separations in the spring said if the government is still secretly separating children and is doing so based on flimsy excuses that would be patently unconstitutional and we will be back in court    lawyers at the aclu and catholic charities said that the doj responded that it wasnt obligated to report the new separations to the aclu because they hadnt been done as a part of the zerotolerance policy the doj said that in 14 of the 17 cases flagged in the aclus letter the children were removed from their parents custody because authorities suspected the parents had some kind of criminal background that made them unfit  even dangerous but the agency would not specify what crimes the parents were suspected of committing and what evidence authorities had to support these allegations    the aclu and other groups representing immigrant children said the dojs secrecy is highly troubling on several counts
they worry that the department of homeland security has allowed authorities without formal training in custody issues  primarily border patrol agents  to make decisions using standards that could violate the spirit of the court order and that would never hold up in nonimmigration cases ziesemer has talked to relatives and social workers and says she suspects that at least eight of the cases involve parents whose crime is illegally reentering the country illegal reentry is a felony although previous administrations did not typically separate families in such cases ziesemer said the allegations the government has advanced to justify separations in eight other cases were either vague or unsubstantiated the final case she identified involved a parent who was hospitalized    the governments position is that because these are not zerotolerance cases they dont have to tell us or anyone about them ziesemer said our position is that when children are separated from their parents there needs to be some oversight    brayans case is a vivid example of how government officials are interpreting the court order to allow separations of families    i found out about him by accident early last month after the government reported that of the more than 2600 immigrant children separated under the zerotolerance policy only one child under the age of 5 remained in their care i decided to try to find that child thinking the case might make a compelling bookend to a story id written this year about a girl named alison jimena valencia madrid whose cries were recorded inside a border patrol detention facility in june the recording ignited a storm of outrage that tipped the political scales against the trump administrations family separation policy    an attorney on the border thelma o garcia said she represented a 6yearold salvadoran boy named wilder hilario maldonado cabrera who was in a temporary foster home in san antonio
wilder had been separated from his father in june garcia said and hadnt been reunited because the father had a 10yearold warrant for a dui charge in florida    the father hilario maldonado called me from the south texas detention facility in pearsall and said hed tried to keep in touch with wilder by phone but his social worker didnt always pick up when they did connect he said wilder pudgy precocious and missing his two front teeth scolded him for not coming to take him home    i told maldonado that it appeared he would be one of the last parents to go through such a separation because the government had agreed to stop them    maldonado 39 said that wasnt true the separations are still happening he said and he knew of one    a few minutes later i got a call from julio who was at the same detention facility he sounded desperate crying and pleading for answers he said hed turned himself and brayan into the authorities as soon as theyd crossed the border asked for asylum and told immigration agents that his mother who lives in austin texas was willing to help him get on his feet seven days later a border patrol agent took brayan dressed in a spongebob squarepants tshirt away screaming  julio said all he knew was that his son was somewhere in new york as soon as we hung up i called ziesemer at catholic charities which has a government contract to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors in the city i asked whether shed heard of brayan    we do know this kid ziesemer quickly responded but were not aware he was separated from his father    ziesemer was audibly shaken until you called all i had was his name on a spreadsheet she said    ziesemer immediately arranged to have brayan who had been placed in a temporary foster home brought to her office her experience told her not to expect much from their first interaction partly because brayan was likely to be afraid and partly because he was only 4
so she tried putting brayan at ease by opening a box of crayons and a spiderman coloring book    he warmed up to her quickly putting down his crayons to show her his spiderman moves and squiggling lines on a piece of paper when she asked whether he knew how to write his name but as ziesemer expected he was too young to make sense of what had happened to him on the border much less explain it to an adult hed just met and his lisp made it hard for ziesemer to understand the few things he could tell her    after the meeting she sounded both exasperated about having to grill a tiny child and terrified that there might be other children like him buried in her spreadsheets    we and the caseworkers and the consulates do what we can to fill in the gaps and figure out where these kids came from she said but that means days and weeks go by with a child not knowing where his parents are and vice versa and it doesnt have to be that way it shouldnt be that way    after ziesemers meeting with brayan i traveled to pearsall to meet julio he said hed fled the country with brayan because street gangs had threatened to kill him after finding out that he reported one of their members to the police his wife and stepson stayed behind because there wasnt enough money to pay for everyone to come i spoke to his wife who told me she was hiding out at her parents house because she didnt want to be home if gang members came looking for her husband    in photos his relatives sent julio looked sort of like a cop stocky with a crew cut but after a month in detention he looked pale and deflated he wore navy blue detention garb and his dark brown hair was wet though neatly combed he didnt have any tattoos which are common among central american gang members    through tears julio told me hed replayed the days since his arrival at the border in his mind trying to make sense of why authorities took away his son
julio and brayan had been taken to the ice box a notorious airconditioned cellblock that is the first stop for most immigrants intercepted at the border brayan developed a high fever and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment a border patrol agent who drove julio and his son scolded julio for bringing a small boy on such a harrowing trip could that be the reason they took his son away was it because the agents had looked at the color of brayans hair and didnt believe he was the boys father    julio wonders whether he had been fooled into signing a document at the hospital  they were all in english  surrendering his rights to his child was it because hed once been arrested for a robbery in el salvador but exonerated two days later when authorities realized they had the wrong person why would they consider him a danger to his child    it wasnt until i told him that julio learned his child had been taken from him because border patrol agents suspected he was a gang member the news hit him hard and it was confounding because at the same time the cbp had deemed him a gang member another agency within dhs had found that his asylum petition in which julio claims he was a victim of gang violence was persuasive enough to be heard by an immigration judge    in early october julio had met with an asylum officer for whats known as a credible fear interview according to the report of that interview which julio provided to propublica the asylum officer not only asked him why he fled el salvador but whether he had a criminal record among the questions were have you ever committed a crime in any country have you ever harmed someone for any reason even if you did not want to have you ever helped someone else harm people have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime have you ever been a member of a gang
julio answered no to all of them the asylum officer who conducted the interview deemed julios account credible and even more significantly indicated that she had been provided no derogatory information or criminal records that would automatically bar julio from winning asylum    the discrepancy reflects differences in the legal standards for asylum and family separation while the asylum officers decision is subject to review by a judge the border patrols decision to take away julios child was not    i dont know what information if any they really have on julio his attorney evangelista said they have total discretion when it comes to separating him from his child they can do what they want and they dont have to explain why    julio said his own father had abandoned him when he was about brayans age then his mother left for the united states when he was 7 he said he vowed never to do the same thing to brayan which is why he didnt leave the boy behind in el salvador he wonders now whether that was a mistake in every phone call with brayan julio says he feels his son slowly slipping away    he tells me youre not my papa anymore i have a new papa julio said of his son adding he doesnt even call me papa he calls me papi i never taught him that word    back in new york ziesemer said she worries family separations may be beginning all over again    sitting with brayan in her office she said brought back the faces of the 400 or so separated kids who had shuffled through over the summer as catholic charities point person during the crisis she said she came to know every single one of those kids by name one 9yearold girl went into a full panic attack when she was asked to step into a room without her sister because she thought ziesemer was going to take her sister away like officials had taken her mother
at one point we had to have a meeting with the entire office to explain why the conference room was full of all these wailing kids she said    catholic charities the aclu and several other large immigrant advocacy groups took the lead in putting the families together again working the phones to find parents who were still in immigration detention and dispatching colleagues to central america to track down parents who had already been deported in addition to the huge heavy lift of reunification ziesemer said there was a crush of calls and emails from congress consulates and the media  all seeking information about the separations    ziesemer said she and her team worked around the clock for months and though there are still several dozen kids awaiting reunification she thought things were winding down thats when she began seeing new cases like brayans which had some of the same hallmarks of the old ones    ziesemer didnt know much about brayan except the little bit of information shed gotten from him during their meeting so i shared with her some of the things id learned about him from his family that he could eat four hardboiled eggs in one sitting that he loved lightning mcqueen a character from the pixar movie cars and that he had a dog lucky whom he insisted on seeing during every whatsapp video call with his mother his grandmother in austin had fixed up a bedroom for him filled with mickey mouse dolls remotecontrol cars and winter coats i told ziesemer how distraught brayans father was that his son called him papi    a couple of weeks is a long time for a kid his age she said about brayan they start losing attachments to people even their parents
tldr version    trumps executive order stopping his child kidnapping policy left large loopholes in it that his agents are exploiting and because the latest kidnappings were found by chance america doesnt know how many more separations happened
with all the school shootings in america his kid would probably be safer in el salvador
  this fuck either way they would be bitching
  can there be a loophole in something that does nothing in the first place
should just get rid of all these subhumans and their spawn
  should just get rid of all these subhumans and their spawn  america certainly would be a better place if we wiped out conservatism and republicans
  please do a nation of leeches with no providers will provide some lulz
  reminds me of tyrell county nc  bunch of assholes used to run the place but thats all i can say    well i can say the public were ok
  do you even hear yourself read that post out loud in front of people until you piss off someone enough to get your fucking teeth knocked out
    you do realize its the blue states that are the ones funding this country while the red states are the leeches right
also the icc implies that trump can be charged with crimes against humanity with his chemical weapon attack on refugees in mexico  
  chemical weapon attack  tear gas  pick one     tear gas isnt a wmd
  i pick both      
update  trumps racist border stunt means troops wont be home for christmas    trump is expected to extend the deployment of troops to the southern border until january    
  lel found the butthurt mestizo subhuman    face it paco mestizos are worthless even nogs and arabs have more value mestizos are just a worthless race created by accident by the spaniards and portuguese
too kind if you ask me these people belong in the trash theyre like a plague of roaches
    cool story tear gas still isnt a wmd police and militaries all over the world still use it on their own populations all the time and dont get charged with war crimes because its nonlethal and its legal for them to do so
  how thick are you you yourself wrote own population
      only if we charge israel first    
  the chemical weapons convention explicitly does not ban the use of tear gas for law enforcement purposes    you cant just shout that something is a war crime you need to come up with some sort of legal basis for it
  tear gas still isnt a wmd  moving the goalposts intensifies      and thats only if its used domestically the chemical weapons in this case were used across international boarders
  and thats only if its used domestically  the cwc does not specify this its a condition that you invented just now
  what do you think domestic means when opcw says  riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare states can legitimately possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes but states that are members of the chemical weapons convention must declare what type of riot agents they possess  i think it means domestic
  nothing in the cwc specifies that states may not use riot control agents extraterritorially in situations outside of warfare    if its not in the treaty its neither binding nor creates war crimes
  use them for domestic law enforcement purposes  that means they cannot use them for purposes that arent domestic  protip shoot chemical weapons across an international boarder is not domestic use
  that means they cannot use them for purposes that arent domestic  it does not say this anywhere on the website and even if it did it wouldnt matter since it doesnt say this anywhere in the treaty
  it only mentions domestic use i know because you love trump you work under his mindset that unless its specifically said its legal but that doesnt work here     the treaty only mentions that use of chemical weapons as valid if produced and used in their own territory meaning it is a crime against humanity to use chemical weapons outside your boarders which was the case when the trump administration fired chemical weapons across the boarder and into mexico
  you work under his mindset that unless its specifically said its legal but that doesnt work here   i couldnt give less of a shit what works or doesnt work in the moronic shithole known as /news/ i care only what happens under the standards of international law    it only mentions domestic use  if a convention that prohibits things doesnt prohibit a thing you cant argue that the convention prohibits it    meaning it is a crime against humanity to use chemical weapons outside your boarders  crimes against humanity are not created by omission crimes against humanity are created by violations of treaties
  and since youve been bitching so hard about what constitutes a chemical weapon while tear gas is colloquially a chemical weapon in every day conversation according to international law tear gas is not a chemical weapon because it is not listed in schedules 1 2 or 3 of the chemical weapons convention    tear gas is banned for use in warfare because the chemical weapons convention explicitly bans riot control agents as a method of warfare not because tear gas is considered a chemical weapon
    see as the tear gas has caused asphyxiation and brain damage let me point out the direct line  each state party shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that toxic chemicals and their precursors are only developed produced otherwise acquired retained transferred or used within its territory or in any other place under its jurisdiction or control for purposes not prohibited under this convention  in case you need translating that means youre only allowed to use chemical weapons domestically so say if the refugees made it across the boarder and trump had used chemical weapons on them while highly unethical would be legal again the big difference is the fact that the tear gas was launched across the boarder into mexico hence it violates the treaty which specifically says youre only allowed to use it domestically which is why you see tear gas used for riot control so all your quibbling is moot
  in case you need translating that means youre only allowed to use chemical weapons domestically  chemical weapons may not be used domestically when saddam gassed the kurds that was a crime against humanity only riot control agents may be used domestically    treaty  which specifically says  youre only allowed to use it domestically  the treaty does not say this    i literally cannot argue with you as long as claim that something is the treaty which literally does not exist
  only riot control agents may be used domestically  glad you admitted that which comes the point that the they were used internationally because they were launched across the boarder at the refugees which is against the treaty     and again since you refuse to read the line  each state party shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that toxic chemicals and their precursors are only developed produced otherwise acquired retained transferred or used within its territory or in any other place under its jurisdiction or control for purposes not prohibited under this convention
  glad you admitted that which comes the point that the they were used internationally because they were launched across the boarder at the refugees which is against the treaty   your reading comprehension is complete fucking garbage only riot control agents may be used domestically is completely different in meaning from riot control agents may only be used domestically    article vi of the cwc exists only to state that states are responsible for the use of chemical weapons in their jurisdiction by any party its a jurisdictional clause if the united states did have jurisdiction/control over the area where the tear gas was used it was using the tear gas for purposes not prohibited under this convention if the united states did not have jurisdiction/control over the area where the tear gas was used then the united states has no responsibility whatsoever for the usage of tear gas under article vii 2
  which brings me back to the orignal point of you desperately wanting to find a way to justify using chemical weapons also they are responsible for chemical weapons in their justification if its domestic the issue is the chemical weapons were not used domestically but across international boarders which blows up both your first assertion and idea that if you launch a chemical weapon across a boarder youre suddenly not held liable for it l2r
  which brings me back to the orignal point of you desperately wanting to find a way to justify using chemical weapons  my motives do not matter because they have no effect on what the law is i could be hitler resurrected to gas the jews and it would have no bearing over whether the chemical weapons convention categorically forbids the use of tear gas across borders    the issue is the chemical weapons were not used domestically but across international boarders   tear gas is not a chemical weapon according to chemical weapons convention i realize ive been imprecise about it as well    which blows up both your first assertion and idea that if you launch a chemical weapon across a boarder youre suddenly not held liable for it l2r  the chemical weapons convention prohibits all use of chemical weapons everywhere    nowhere does the chemical weapons convention prohibit the use of toxic chemicals for law enforcement purposes in the jurisdiction of your own country or for that matter in any other country unless used in warfare
  wrong again  according to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the implementing body for the chemical weapons convention the united states is one of 193 parties committed to the convention member states are allowed to possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes the organization said  again this was not a domestic law enforcement purpose sine it was used across international boundaries hence it was a violation of the treaty of course you wont see anyone but ngos raise that point due to not wanting to rock the boat
  wrong again  nowhere in the chemical weapons convention does it say that riot control agents may only be used for domestic law enforcement purposes    nothing the politifact nor the opcw says can change the text of the chemical weapons convention
  except the fact that tear gas is classified as a chemical weapon that is banned in warfare and using weapons within the boarders of another sovereign nation is almost always considered an act of war especially chemical weapons but we go back the previous point of only ngos actually raising that point since no one wants to the rock the boat over the actions the us took    oh and going back to your saddam strawman the current treaty was written after he gassed the kurds so it would be a moot point granted at this point i wouldnt be shocked to find out trump has us pulled out of the treaty so he can use more potent chemical weapons on migrants and refugees in the future consider hes already authorized the general crimes against humanity where the military can shoot migrants and refugees if they feel threatened
  except the fact that tear gas is classified as a chemical weapon  no its not the classification of chemical weapons under the chemical weapons convention explicitly excludes tear gas from its definition of chemical weapons article i of the chemical weapons convention explicitly lists riot control agents as a separate category from chemical weapons    but we go back the previous point of only ngos actually raising that point  which ngos are you talking about here
everything i had done to be a good father was destroyed in an instant    what kind of good father has gang members after him    does the us make any effort to confirm these are the parents of the children rather than human traffickers
  probably answering the questions of the police is enough to get gang members after you in some shitty parts of the country
  wrong again riot control has its own category for types of chemical weapons but there is nothing in the cwc that specifically excludes tear gas from being labeled a chemical weapon in fact because it has a category it should be considered a chemical weapon    riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare states can legitimately possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes but states that are members of the chemical weapons convention must declare what type of riot agents they possess  riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare  use them for domestic law enforcement purposes  the two key points trump didnt use them for domestic law enforcement because the tear gas was launched across international boarders which is an act of aggression and act of war or in this case a method of warfare against migrants and refugees     as for the ngos off the top of my head amnesty international spoke out against trumps use of chemical weapons against refugees
  wrong again riot control has its own category for types of chemical weapons but there is nothing in the cwc that specifically excludes tear gas from being labeled a chemical weapon  article ii section 1a of the chemical weapons convention explicitly excludes tear gas for law enforcement use from consideration as a chemical weapon tear gas would is only a chemical weapon if fashioned into a munition for military use any summary the ocpw creates must defer to the actual text of the cwc if it were considered a chemical weapon by default then no state would be allowed to use it for anything as article i of the cwc explicitly states     each state party to this convention undertakes never under any circumstances a to develop produce otherwise acquire stockpile or retain chemical weapons or transfer directly or indirectly chemical weapons to anyone b to use chemical weapons    trump didnt use them for domestic law enforcement because the tear gas was launched across international boarders which is an act of aggression and act of war  youre a riot    or in this case a method of warfare against migrants and refugees  if this really was a war then the united states could have used machine guns instead of tear gas which im sure you would have preferred    as for the ngos off the top of my head amnesty international spoke out against trumps use of chemical weapons against refugees  do you have a source in which amnesty international accuses the trump administration of violating the chemical weapons convention or of committing war crimes
  again you conveniently ignore the stipulation  riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare states can legitimately possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes but states that are members of the chemical weapons convention must declare what type of riot agents they possess  seeing as this was not a domestic law enforcement act and it was fired across intentional boarders its a clear act of aggression and is classified as chemical weapon    and if the military did fire on the migrants and refugees the icc would have a great case to charge trump with crimes against humanity     moving the goalposts i was talking about calling the trump administration out for their use of chemical weapons youre the one who said violating the cwc or committing war crimes     im assuming youre getting talking points from trumps other propoganda station  
  again you conveniently ignore the stipulation  this stipulation is literally not part of the chemical weapons convention    im assuming youre getting talking points from trumps other propoganda station  i am getting my talking points from the full text of the chemical weapons convention still waiting on your ngos    moving the goalposts i was talking about calling the trump administration out for their use of chemical weapons youre the one who said violating the cwc or committing war crimes   you were defending the notion that donald trump has committed crimes against humanity which to be sure distinct from the category of war crime    identify another international treaty or international precedent indicating that the use of tear gas on the border constituted a crime against humanity
  figuratively and literally it says  riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare states can legitimately possess riot control agents and use them for domestic law enforcement purposes but states that are members of the chemical weapons convention must declare what type of riot agents they possess    also youre putting words in my mouth i said that no country would condemn trump for his use of chemical weapons on migrants and refugees only ngos would youre combining separate points to create a gatcha question
  figuratively and literally it says  this quote appears literally nowhere in the chemical weapons convention    also youre putting words in my mouth i said that no country would condemn trump for his use of chemical weapons on migrants and refugees   we are only having this discussion because someone explicitly claimed that trump could be charged with crimes against humanity for his use of tear gas    only ngos would youre combining separate points to create a gatcha question  your quote except the fact that tear gas is classified as a chemical weapon that is banned in warfare and using weapons within the boarders of another sovereign nation is almost always considered an act of war especially chemical weapons but we go back the previous point of only ngos actually raising that point since no one wants to the rock the boat over the actions the us took    so fine can you find me a statement by a ngo raising the point that the use of tear gas over the border was an act of war or was that not your point
actual debating without calling one another drumpftard or libcuck   continuing to inform and educate readers from both sides perspectives     this has been the best thread in /news/ in a very long time       thank you for this
  this quote appears literally nowhere in the chemical weapons convention  except where it states riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons    and you glossed over this  but we go back the previous point of only ngos actually raising that point  meaning they pointed out trump used chemical weapons on migrants and refugees in this case tear gas which is considered a chemical weapon due to being launched across international boarders and trump giving the specific order to shoot to kill
  urrdurr comparing metropolitan areas with places that are 90 farmland is totally a good comparison  hurrr
reporting on something secretly happening  is this cnn
this it doesnt technically say x is why us law is such a shitshow
  except the fact that tear gas is classified as a chemical weapon that is banned in warfare and using weapons within the boarders of another sovereign nation is almost always considered an act of war especially chemical weapons but we go back the previous point of only ngos actually raising that point since no one wants to the rock the boat over the actions the us took  almost always is key here  it is onyl an act of war if the other side considers it to be an act of war  because we were assisting mexican police in their attempt to stop them from crossing the border i doubt the mexican government considers it an act of war  its not like theres a law that says country a must declare war on country b if c happens  like arts beauty being in the eye of the beholder an an act is war only in the eye of the beholder and if they dont see it as one it is not an act of war plain and simple
  if its a secret why is there a news article written about it
  except where it states riot control agents such as tear gas are considered chemical weapons  it doesnt state this anywhere in the chemical weapons convention    meaning they pointed out trump used chemical weapons on migrants and refugees  can you identify the ngo and press release that accused trump of using chemical weapons on migrants and refugees engaged in an imminent attempt to unlawfully breach the border of the united states      this is an important feature of law everywhere its what makes the law the law as opposed to random shit you made up that sounds good
  this is an important feature of law everywhere  its not though
i hate these hit piece articles
are there actually any true refugees per the legal definition i can only think of venezuelians i dont think cubans fit the criteria anymore
  hard to say the current migrant group trump wants to murder is escaping gang violence that the government wont stop   it doesnt look like they fall under the legal definition of refugee but they still have a right to claim asylum
  did you know that people who make over 100k are overwhelmingly likely to vote red
  did you eat paint chips as a kid
  im going to take that gaslighting as a yes
  nice projection there bud awfully specific
  ttotally not mad anon
    actually its only when you get to 200k and higher that you see more people voting republicans by a larger number hardly overwhelmingly like you claim
  have class at uni with a lady from central america  tells us about how its literally common place to see decapitated bodies in the street  cant trust police to not be on cartel pay roll or to kill you for reporting a crime  tells us america has school shootings because were raising our children wrong not like how it is where shes from  she literally said we dont have that kind of violence  i dont know how anyone could be so unconscious
  tbqh i was going off mental memory of the 2012 election where that proves to be true  2018 would obviously be a more recent and accurate data set        goddamn anon you are bipolar
  america would be a better place if we got rid of half the population and over 70 of the economy  whats it feel like to hate so much you are willing to cut off your own nose to spite your face
  after you kill all the rich people you can take their stuff    standard leftist procedure
  we already do this with regular criminals in the usa so im not seeing any real problems here

    how us military spending keeps rising even as the pentagon flunks its audit    on november 15 ernst  young and other private firms that were hired to audit the pentagon announced that they could not complete the job congress had ordered an independent audit of the department of defense the governments largest discretionary cost centerthe pentagon receives 54 cents out of every dollar in federal appropriationsafter the pentagon failed for decades to audit itself the firms concluded however that the dods financial records were riddled with so many bookkeeping deficiencies irregularities and errors that a reliable audit was simply impossible    deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan tried to put the best face on things telling reporters we failed the audit but we never expected to pass it shanahan suggested that the dod should get credit for attempting an audit saying it was an audit on a 27 trillion organization so the fact that we did the audit is substantial the truth though is that the dod was dragged kicking and screaming to this audit by bipartisan frustration in congress and the result had this been a major corporation likely would have been a crashed stock    as republican senator charles grassley of iowa a frequent critic of the dods financial practices said on the senate floor in september 2017 the pentagons longstanding failure to conduct a proper audit reflects twentysix years of hardcore footdragging on the part of the dod where internal resistance to auditing the books runs deep in 1990 congress passed the chief financial officers act which required all departments and agencies of the federal government to develop auditable accounting systems and submit to annual audits since then every department and agency has come into complianceexcept the pentagon
now a nation investigation has uncovered an explanation for the pentagons footdragging for decades the dods leaders and accountants have been perpetrating a gigantic unconstitutional accounting fraud deliberately cooking the books to mislead the congress and drive the dods budgets ever higher regardless of military necessity dod has literally been making up numbers in its annual financial reports to congressrepresenting trillions of dollars worth of seemingly nonexistent transactionsknowing that congress would rely on those misleading reports when deciding how much money to give the dod the following year according to government records and interviews with current and former dod officials congressional sources and independent experts    if the dod were being honest they would go to congress and say all these proposed budgets weve been presenting to you are a bunch of garbage  said jack armstrong who spent more than five years in the defense departments office of inspector general as a supervisory director of audits before retiring in 2011    the fraud works like this when the dod submits its annual budget requests to congress it sends along the prior years financial reports which contain fabricated numbers the fabricated numbers disguise the fact that the dod does not always spend all of the money congress allocates in a given year however instead of returning such unspent funds to the us treasury as the law requires the pentagon sometimes launders and shifts such moneys to other parts of the dods budget    veteran pentagon staffers say that this practice violates article i section 9 of the us constitution which stipulates that    no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time    click the link fags cause i aint copying the rest
its news but is anyone really surprised
on september 10 2001 rumsfeld called a dramatic press conference at the pentagon to make a startling announcement referring to the huge military budget that was his official responsibility he said according to some estimates we cannot track 23 trillion in transactions this shocking news that an amount more than five times as large as the pentagons fy 2001 budget of an estimated 313 billion was lost or even just untrackable wasat least for one 24hour news cyclea big national story as was secretary rumsfelds comment that americas adversary was not china or russia but rather was closer to home its the pentagon bureaucracy equally stunning was rumsfelds warning that the tracking down of those missing transactions could bea matter of life and death no pentagon leader had ever before said such a thing nor has anyone done so since then but rumsfelds exposé died quickly as the following morning on september 11 four hijacked commercial jet planes plowed full speed into the two world trade center towers the pentagon and a field in pennsylvania since that time there has been no followup and no effort made to find the missing money either    reminder that the two largest winners of 9/11 were the pentagon/weapons manufacturers and saudi arabia the pentagon got a nice distraction from the news of their fraud and got everyone to support them mindlessly and also got two wars that lasted decades and allowed them to even further boost military spending which helps the weapons manufacturers who largely control them saudi arabia got rid of a rival expansionist military and economic power and installed the us military as a buffer between them and their arch enemy iran remember that the attackers were saudis and that the bushs have long had business ties with the saudi binladen group and in fact bush was meeting with osama bin ladens brother the very same day that rumsfeld made this announcement
its common knowledge that like 50 of the pentagons budget goes unaccounted for brass always explain it as the nature of the beast
  not really reuters had this story in 2013 and again in 2016      nothing is going to get done because theyre dod every other agency has to be careful with their money but not the department of defense theyre special snowflakes hell there have been /out/ gear threads where militaryfags have admitted that they used government money to buy their /out/ gear and its common practice theres all sorts of shenanigans going on over there
meanwhile trump and the republicans want to dump more money on the pentagon    we should just nationalize everything military related and cut out private contractors especially for services for the troops
most of it probably goes to black projects and the nsa
  great news  nothing will come of it      open secret       this worldwide wiretapping projects dont fund themselves
there are people who want to cut funding to medicare instead of to the dod
  how about both
    its not the money that goes to secret projects that gets lumped into a special designation on the books this is just massive incompetence in the general money pool
  91 according to the numbers they gave sanders during a hearing over how much of the military budget goes to fighting the war on terror
megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life but years later her mother told her he wanted to reconnect megumi began to see yamada regularly she thinks he is her father and that yamada is his real name  but this is a lie    ever since she was little shed ask me where he was says megumis mother asako all she knew was that he had gone soon after she was born so she blamed herself    for years it didnt appear to be a problem but when megumi was about 10 asako noticed a change in her daughters behaviour    she didnt talk to me and became very quiet and withdrawn asako says    it took a long while to find out about the bullying    asako discovered that megumi wasnt only blaming herself for her parents breakup her classmates were also ostracising her because she didnt have a dad  children of single parents are often stigmatised in japan    eventually she became so unhappy that she refused to go to school    shes my only child and it was breaking my heart to see her so sad asako says     she tried to get the teachers at school to help but when that failed another idea came into her head    all i could think about was what if i found a man who was nice and kind an ideal father someone who would make her feel better asako says    shed heard about relative rental agencies that could send an actor to play a guest at a wedding or go on a date  they are well established in japan so she contacted one to ask if they could also provide a fake dad after auditioning five hopefuls she settled on a man called mr takashi    i found him the easiest to talk to asako says hes very kind and sweet so i just followed my instincts    takashi runs a rental agency with about 20 staff and more than 1000 freelancers  men and women of different ages and backgrounds who can cater for almost any situation taking on fake names personalities and roles     
they often have to lie but they are very strict about not breaking the law    as an actor himself hes played boyfriends businessmen friends and fathers and been a bridegroom at five fake weddings    he prepares for his roles he confesses by watching hollywood movies like little miss sunshine the oscarwinning film about a dysfunctional family bonding on a road trip and the descendants in which george clooney plays an indifferent parent who suddenly has to embrace fatherhood after a family tragedy    i study these films and memorise phrases and lines takashi says i take notes on how different family members interact and communicate and what it takes to be a certain kind of father or husband they help me understand different family dynamics and relationships    asako met takashi several times to talk about the kind of father she wanted him to play to megumi    my requests were very simple she says firstly i wanted him to say how sorry he was that he couldnt be in megumis life until then secondly i wanted him to listen to whatever she wanted to tell him    asako then told megumi that her father had remarried and now had a new family but that he had recently been back in touch because he wanted to see them again    he was working she said as an actor    megumi was shocked but eventually agreed to meet him and so nearly 10 years ago takashi became yamada megumis father  his longestrunning and perhaps most ethically dubious role to date    takashi still remembers their first meeting    it was a very complex emotion that was there he says she asked me why i hadnt come to see her before and i felt her resentment    as yamada takashi began seeing megumi and her mother a couple of times a month  joining them on days out trips to the cinema and visiting for birthdays and asako says it didnt take long to see a real change in her daughter
after a while megumi became much happier and more outgoing she says she loved to talk she was lively  she even wanted to go back to school and thats when i thought this has all been worth it    one particular occasion sticks in asakos mind  when she and yamada were at megumis school parents day    we were standing at the back of the classroom asako says she saw us together and kept on turning around to look at us she had the biggest smile on her face and that made me really happy    takashis services are not cheap each time asako hires him to play yamada she pays about 10000 yen about 70 or 90 and although she earns a decent salary she has to make savings elsewhere to afford it but when she remembers how unhappy her daughter once was she thinks it is money well spent    takashi also sees a difference in megumi from the quiet hesitant girl that he first met    gradually she became happier and more confident he says i used to meet her with asako the three of us together but one day she said i want to go out with my father just the two of us so i took her out and she held my hand for the first time    over the last 10 years takashis character yamada has grown very close to megumi now a young adult hes become a part of the family he even tells megumi that he loves her in the way that any father might  but of course he doesnt really    how does he justify this act of deception    switching personalities and identities is very important in this job he says but im human and so of course it would be a lie if i said i dont feel any emotional conflict saying i love you to that child but this is a business i have to do it and i have to keep reminding myself of that    asako also understands that some might disagree with her choices    i know what im doing is drastic she says but i really really wanted to save my daughter
to complicate matters she has also become very attached to the fictional character she is paying takashi to portray    when the three of us are together i feel at peace she says    we talk we laugh and we are very kind to each other hes been in our lives for such a long time now i would like to marry him and become a real family    but asako has had to face the bittersweet reality that she is in love with someone who isnt real and who cannot love her back    i have told him how i feel but he told me to my face that hes with us because its his job its very complicated she says    im very aware that hes only with us because were paying him    i sort of fantasise about our relationship that maybe we can be a real family but the relationship as it is actually helps me emotionally and mentally as well it keeps me stable    in fact asako has no plans to end the arrangement with takashi and says she would like to carry on hiring him to play megumis dad indefinitely  even if that means sinking deeper and deeper into a world of fantasy and deception    the ideal situation is that she continues to think of him as her father she says so when she gets married id like him to be at her wedding ceremony and when she has her own child id like him to act as a grandfather as well the worst case scenario is that my daughter finds out    and if megumis real father were to ever turn up    thats not a possibility that asako has ever really considered as she hasnt had any contact with him since their divorce she feels it is unlikely  but if he did walk through the door one day she thinks megumi would choose yamada over her real dad because they have such a good fatherdaughter relationship he is the ideal father just as asako hoped he would be    takashi is also aware that the lie could continue to grow    this is one of the big issues of renting a family he says
megumi could get married in the future and then her husband would think im her father if she then has her own child that means shed believe im the grandfather of her child and the stakes get bigger and bigger    and he has thought about how megumi might feel if she finds out  though the plotlines he envisages might strike many as highly optimistic    in the best case scenario id like to think that she might thank me for taking care of her  that is 80 of my imagination he says    the other 20 thinks that she would be devastated she might say why did you come clean why couldnt you just keep lying to me until the end    i think ive been a big support in her life maybe asking her to thank me is a bit excessive but at least id like her to recognise our service    many might also find it hard to understand why asako has chosen to do something which could be so distressing for her daughter if she discovers the truth yet she stands by her decision    i know some people think its foolish to pay money to lie to my own daughter and to have a pretend father but i was desperate she says    anyone can understand that horrible feeling of desperation to see your child so hurt    she says she does worry about the potential impact on megumi but tries not to think about it    and she thinks this kind of thing happens more than you might imagine    my situation isnt unique im sure there are loads more surrogate fathers and mothers out there    all names have been changed to prevent megumi uncovering the deception before her mother is ready to tell her
  when i read about stuff like this i sometimes wonder why i continue to study japanese america is a terrible place but at least we raised from birth to be so passiveaggressive
she says she does worry about the potential impact on megumi but tries not to think about it  but why     i mean even if we ignore for the moment that japan has created a demand for this sort of thing the fact that the mother feels the need to lie is retarded if you want a father figure for the kid then seek out another partner or barring that just have a male family member do it dont fucking lie to make your kid feel better thats a pitfall of despair
i imagine a future where convincing ai might be used to support those in need of a parental or other important figure it isnt entirely honest maybe but the feelings would be real all the same
wouldnt it be easier if she just found a man surely japanese men arent that disgusting its a little heart breaking that she fell in love with the actor though
  you should probably be learning english too
  why     i think she hopes it blows over it did with my father   father has a genetic condition and ginger with no one in the family having them   father was adopted by my great nan saying my nan was his mother and there was no father  is told through his life that his father was a east london gangster nutjob   father followed him and had a relationship until he was in his 20s   auntie who has always resented my father lets it slip on the side that my father isnt my grandads   father realised his entire life hes been lied to about his family and who his parents where   now at age 50 he finds out he was a baby in arms passed about but my nan still says hes hers and the london man   father doesnt care anymore and just continues on in ignorance     sure they arent paying someone but considering i have 5 great aunts/uncles and 3 aunt / uncles its a crazy level of lying and conspiracy to hide something that long considering great nan raised father too its a murky issue and its so deep that father just wants to live in ignorance     i feel like cases like this are far more common than one expects the only remarkable thing is shes paying someone and theres an option for it this is probably still more safer than just trawling the bottom of the barrel market or doing the singlemumontinder thing    japanese have dating classes for cakes and most men are too deep in work /a/ of all places has had some good salary men threads talking about the culture if you want to do all archive trawl
  japanese have dating classes for cakes  what now

theres no way the daughter wouldnt figure it out after reading this report how did they get this story did the mother approach the news im inclined to think that someone in the pipeline fabricated the story      thanks
peak kino anime adaptation fucking when i mean lain did it but that was the whole family    they probably changed some details not only name but also how the mother found out the age when the kid started seeing the actor some of the anecdotes too
state republicans rushing through multiple unamerican antiworker antivoter laws before they lose power in several states after the blue wave swept them from power        republican lawmakers in several states are planning to push through lastminute conservative policies or stifle the power of incoming democratic governors  in michigan republicans plan to alter measures that would have raised the minimum wage and mandated paid sick leave during the lameduck session  in north carolina republican lawmakers have a vetoproof majority they intend to use to pass stricter photo id requirements before january when new democrats break the states house supermajority      democrats are replacing republicans in seven states governors mansions but before power changes hands in january republican lawmakers in several states are planning to push through lastminute conservative policies or take power from incoming democratic governors    in michigan republicans plan to alter measures that would have raised the minimum wage and mandated paid sick leave during the lameduck session between this months election and the swearing in of the states new democratic governor early next year    read more 2000 women are taking state legislatures by storm even as men hold on to the vast majority of seats    just days after wisconsin democrat tony evers won a razorthin victory over republican incumbent gov scott walker gop leaders in the state are discussing plans to limit evers ability to appoint officials to his government limit evers control of the rulemaking process make it harder for the democrat to stop a work requirement for those on medicaid and move the date of the 2020 presidential primary    democrats have already voiced outrage about the plans which include making it more difficult for democrats to change or overturn laws championed by walker
let me be clear the republicans and speaker vos should stop any and all attempts to play politics and weaken the powers of the governors office in wisconsin before i take the oath evers tweeted two days after the election calling the gop effort to reduce his power desperate antics to cling to power and violate the checks and balances of wisconsin government    the efforts in wisconsin mirror many of those made in north carolina two years ago after democratic gov roy cooper was elected to replace republican pat mccrory    wisconsin and michigan are two of four states where republicans are losing control of their governorships and both state legislative chambers    here are a few laws republican legislators hope to repeal or dilute in their states    voter id requirements   republican state legislators in north carolina are writing the details of a new voter photo id law that the state voted on this month    this comes after a previous voter id law passed by republicans in the state was struck down last year by a federal appeals court judge who found the law appeared to target africanamericans with almost surgical precision    the american civil liberties union which opposes the new measure has argued that nothing short of the future of voting rights in north carolina will be on the line in its negotiation    republicans in wisconsin are also planning to make the states gop voter id law harder to change     the minimum wage   republican lawmakers in michigan are planning to amend a minimum wage law before the midterms before democrat gretchen whitmer replaces outgoing gop gov rick snyder    in september the states republicancontrolled legislature passed a proposal to raise the midwestern states minimum wage but by voting on the measure the state prevented the law from being passed as a ballot referendum which can only be overturned with threefourths of the state legislature
so the path is now clear for gop lawmakers to alter the law they oppose which only requires a simple majority vote    its unclear exactly how the legislature wants to change the law  which was designed to raise the minimum wage to 12 per hour by 2022 and gradually raise the tipped worker minimum wage from 350  but the gop has acknowledged its plan is to fundamentally change the measure    im angry im really angry said tracy pease a 47yearold waitress and minimum wage advocate told the washington post in september its not just that i had a vested interest in this but the point was to go to the people and now they have circumvented our vote they have taken away our vote    one fair wage a group that backed the wage hike pledged to sue the legislature if it attempts to water down or repeal the law     paid sick leave  he republicancontrolled legislature in michigan also passed a law mandating that employees qualify for somewhere between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave  a measure republicans oppose  in order to alter it with a simple majority during the lameduck session    its also unclear exactly how republicans will change the law but michigans chamber of commerce has warned that the requirements would put severe compliance burdens on employers

  fucking republicucks
  how does raising the minimum wage make your work more valuable  the guy pushing a broom hasnt become more efficient in the last 20 years so why would raising the minimum wage help the government declaring his work is worth 12 an hour doesnt make it so in the same way the government declaring iphones a right doesnt make one appear in everyones stockings at christmas
  because its the workers and people who spend money who really fuel the economy giving money to the rich has never lead to proper economic growth give money to those who use spend it and put it into the economy and youll see actual growth
  bc libtrolls are at it again so republicans counteract
  how does raising the minimum wage make your work more valuable  it doesnt      because its the workers and people who spend money who really fuel the economy  that doesnt mean you can artificially increase the value of their labor and expect it to carry out without consequence if you increase the cost of labor that cost inevitably gets passed onto the consumer
  mum cost gets passed onto the consumer  then they lose business because its to expensive and the free market will fix it
  the free market will fix it    by putting the business out of business and making everyone lose their job
  you have to be treated like a slave otherwise you wont have a job  lol corporate whores like you make me laugh
  because its the workers and people who spend money who really fuel the economy  in your own life whats more important earning money or spending money  and secondly who is giving rich people money how is a tax cut giving away money isnt that based off of the presumption that any dollar you earn is actually owned by the government and theyre giving it to you what if i dont agree with that premise
democrats are crooks op all they do is raise taxes and spend until they bankrupt states
  minimum wage hasnt kept up with rising inflation nor rising productivity wages are artificially low even the 15/hour meme doesnt even bring wages up to the level of inflation or productivity
  is productivity heterogenous or homogenous  when someone like pewdiepie can make entertainment for tens of millions of people by himself and is massively productive how does that make the guy pushing a broom more productive the total worker productivity has gone up but a lot of the jobs in the economy havent become more productive in the last 40 years
  in 1949 the minimum wage was 040 thats 397 in 2015 dollars  in what way has minimum wage not kept up with rising inflation or do only specific years count when it comes to that
  if you earn more money you spend more money thus raising the wages of workers inevitably lead to more earning and spending   just because youre an apologist for the billionaires doesnt mean that matters for the average workers      in what way has minimum wage not kept up with rising inflation  no it hasnt democrats should have nuked the filibuster to force it through
  free market  government price controls    wut
  okay so how does raising the minimum wage make their work more valauble  if i measure my kids temperature and it shows he has a fever and i cross it out and write a lower number have i solved the fact he has a fever  no it doesnt  so how does crossing out work thats generating less than 15 dollars an hour and say its actually worth 15 dollars an hour make it more valuable
  the problem is that minimum wage actually fails to solve any problems long term and simply causes runaway inflation as its forced to continue to rise while playing cat and mouse with the increasing price of goods if you want to benefit the poor instead focus on decreasing the price of staples food gas electricity etc so that their dollar stretches further which can be done with subsidies    if you double minimum wage its eventually going to lead to double the price of goods when it catches up creating a viscous cycle
  or rent
  so how does crossing out work thats generating less than 15 dollars an hour  not who youre speaking to but how do you determine the value in the first place regarding a job that isnt directly involved with generating cash flow the value of the job is related to what an employer is willing to pay but employers are willing to pay as little as possible if they think they can get away with it
  this     also minimum wage hikes both dont jack up prices or kill jobs it just means share holders dont get gold plated toilets with all their pay  
    minimum wage is a misnomer because the actual minimum wage is 0  workers compete against other workers not employers to find jobs and get the highest wages employers compete against other employers to find the best workers in other words lowskilled workers compete against highskilled workers in the labor market lowskilled workers who would be employable at a low wage become unemployable at an artificially higher wage and that explains the perverse cruelty of minimum wage laws it inflicts the greatest harm on the very workers it is allegedly designed to help
  funny how the most prosperous time in american history was defined by liberal policies like minimum wages and greater emphasis on worker rights while the recent years where americas prosperity appears to be waning are defined by lower taxes but lower wages too
  jobs that do not pay enough for someone to live on should not exist in our country those employers can rightly fuck off and your claim that workers are being harmed because the government isnt allowing them to be taken advantage of is laughable if you cared about the workers youd support social services but conservatives arent in favor of that theyre just looking for slave laborers
  aei  corporate think tank trying to justify paying workers chump change       this as long as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer america will never be great   strong unions and strong pays are what make america truly great
  are those strong unions also corrupt as shit and strong arm people into joining them and paying dues
  and that has what to do with the minimum wage exactly
  not inherently  but strong arming people into paying their dues sounds like a typical way to villianize workers who want to protect their wages and benefits and dont want to be undermined by scabs and freeriders
  why  why must the distinction be 0 an hour or 15 an hour  theres roles like articling students internships apprenticeships things like that which arent worth 15 an hour so the only option is they work for free instead  why should the government step in between what 2 consenting adults are doing how are they being taken advantage of if they are working at a rate the market says their labor is worth and a rate they consent to work at
    we need strong unions protecting the pedophiles working in our public schools
  really  1920s seemed prosperous to me and the 30s were only awful because of liberal policies and central planning     seems to me like the good times are only ruined by liberal policies
  the majority of the world was also blown to bits or under commie rule and relied on american industries to get back on its feet    isolating a few drops in the water doesnt mean shit when there are an ocean of variables
  project fraud  into the trash it goes
    if we free slaves the economy will collapse  if we allow unions the economy will collapse  if we create environmental regulations the economy will collapse  if we create safety regulations the economy will collapse  if we create minimum wage the economy will collapse  you are here  if we raise the minimum wage the economy will collapse
  top kek this is like how a 6th grader would argue learn about basic economics before you attempt to make an argument
  i never personally endorsed 15/hr but i wouldnt be opposed to it either    theres roles like articling students internships apprenticeships things like that which arent worth 15 an hour  says who if those things arent worth paying someone a living wage for then the work is bullshit notice how were not complaining that the current minimum wage which starts at 725/hr is making people work for free    why should the government step in between what 2 consenting adults are doing  because that is what the government does when theres an inherent power balance there are laws and regulations to help even things out an employer can get by with fewer workers but your average citizen cannot get by without a job desperation can force workers to accept jobs that are less than ideal and fear and uncertainty can force workers to stay at those jobs and accept the poor working conditions and meager wages
  you talk like a retard
  because that is what the government does when theres an inherent power balance there are laws and regulations to help even things out  please tell me where the hell you got this idea from are you a us citizen because thats nowhere in the law     also please define living wage
  pardon 5th grade
  the government declaring his work is worth 12 an hour doesnt make it so  it literally does all value is an illusion we might as well make that illusion resemble a modicum of fairness
  literally the opposite blue states are net contributors to the federal budget while red states are net drains the republicans have an awful economic track record on average
  it seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country by business i mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry by workers i mean all workers the white collar class as well as the men in overalls and by living wages i mean more than a bare subsistence level  i mean the wages of decent living   franklin d roosevelt
  that doesnt change the fact that the rich have been constantly whining that if they arent allowed to exploit the poor the economy would collapse     whenever someone brings up republican economic policy all you need to do is say kansas and it invalidates everything they claim  
  describe a decent living please this must vary from person to person no and changes with geography family situation etc right
  so youre saying theres not covering up of pedophillia by teachers unions  or are you saying that because you dislike the youtube channel it is somehow illegitimate that a union representative is talking about protecting pedophiles
  that doesnt change the fact that the rich have been constantly whining that if they arent allowed to exploit the poor the economy would collapse  which rich person said this    what do you make per year did your taxes go up or down in the past year
  have you looked up the history of who resists changes that benefit workers protip the rich
  did you miss the 20th century and the collapse of the soviet union and every centrally planned economy    freeing slaves and removing the restrictions of women entering the work force was a recognition of the fact they were made in gods image  unions were useful for a time and most poeple dont find them useful and so when given the choice dont unionize except public sector unions which are obviously a problem because they negotiate against the tax payer and so you have unions giving millions to politicians and politicians giving millions to unions in contracts and salaries    environmental regulations were useful to the point that they were able to accurately capture externalities but have clearly gone too far in many areas including the expansion of regulations without passing new laws such as the clean water act the clean water act says that the epa can regulate navigable waters meaning waters that truly affect interstate commerce but a few years ago the epa decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmers land or any place else that they decide  as for safety regulations the us can improve on them    theyre not based off of outcomes but are perscriptive meaning all kind of products the consumers want they are prevented from getting and you get not useful labels that are a mile long  
  thats a lot different than what you said and you still havent named anyone its easy to generalize
  have you looked up the effects of the policies you propose  
  you know what the minimum wage is in utah 750 you know how many businesses on the wasatch front pay that not many there are signs out here advertising burger king jobs at 11/hr because the economy is booming and labors being priced by the market i moved from arkansas to utah this year got an entrylevel job at amazon that literally doubled my wages from higher ar minimum wage    meanwhile my old job in arkansas just had to give everyone raises and they were in trouble already
  being able to own a house and pay the utility bills without assistance be able to purchase groceries so you arent starving have a reliable source of transportation be able to start a family have access to some form of higher education have enough money to own personal property to occupy your free time have a way to retire so your lifestyle isnt completely flipped upsidedown when youre too frail to work personally i dont even believe healthcare should be left to the free market public healthcare is a must    i dont think 15/hr is going to be a living wage but it but it would still be a significant step up for a lot of people
  fuck unions or at least fuck their leadership    fucking teamsters is pushing through with the new ups contract agreement despite members voting no     whats the point of a union if it does what it wants and ignores the wishes of its members
  lemme quote thomas sowell    virtually anything can be made more affordable in isolation simply by transferring resources to it from elsewhere in the economy and having most of the costs absorbed by the u s treasury    the federal government could make a rolls royce affordable for every american but we would not be a richer country as a result we would in fact be a much poorer country because of all the vast resources transferred from other economic activities to subsidize an extravagant luxury    of course it might be nice to be sitting at the wheel of a rolls royce but we might be sitting there in rags and tatters and gaunt with hunger after having squandered enormous amounts of labor capital and costly materials that could have been put to better use elsewhere that doesnt happen in a market economy because most of us take one look at the price tag on a rolls royce and decide that it is time for another toyota    the very notion of making things affordable misses the key point of a market economy an economy exists to make tradeoffs and a market economy makes the terms of those tradeoffs plain with price tags representing the relative costs of producing different things to have politicians arbitrarily change the price tags so that prices no longer represent the real costs is to defeat the whole purpose    reality doesnt change when the government changes price tags talk about bringing down health care costs is not aimed at the costly legal environment in which medical science operates or other sources of needless medical costs it is aimed at price control which hides costs rather than reducing them
hidden costs continue to take their toll and it is often a higher toll than when these costs are freely transmitted through the marketplace less supply poorer quality and longer waits have been the consequences of price controls for all sorts of goods and services in all sorts of societies and for thousands of years of human history    why would anyone think that price controls on medical care would be any different except for being more deadly in their consequences    one of the political excuses for making things affordable is that a particular product or service is a right but this is only explaining one questionbegging word with another    although it has been proclaimed that health care is a right not a privilege this neat dichotomy ignores the vast territory in between where most decisions are made as tradeoffs    if health insurance is a right and not a privilege and not even a subject of incremental tradeoffs then the same should be even more true of food history in fact shows all too many instances of governments trying to keep food affordable usually with disastrous consequences    whether in france during the 1790s the soviet union after the bolshevik revolution or in newly independent african nations during the past generation governments have imposed artificially low prices on food in each case this led to artificially low supplies of food and artificially high levels of hunger  for society as a whole nothing comes as a right to which we are entitled even bare subsistence has to be produced and produced at a cost of heavy toil for much of human history    the only way anyone can have a right to something that has to be produced is to force someone else to produce it for him the more things are provided as rights the less the recipients have to work and the more others have to carry their load
  no one is asking for rolls royces for everyone    being able to own your own shelter afford food water and electricity have some way to get to and from places have some kind of assurance that you wont die from a preventable disease and be able to retire in relative comfort is not a lot to ask
  thats nice these things are achievable if you make the right decisions in your life a government mandated minimum wage increase wont guarantee half of this however in fact it could end up fueling inequality and raise local prices     my source     do you work
  you completely missed his point and continue to fail to grasp how costs in a market work   so tell me how do we make sure we get all of those nice things you listed for everyone
  okay so how do you think best to accomplish those things  evidence seems to show that letting the market provide those goods is the best way to deliver them to people  shelter food and healthcare are important i agree and people will compete to supply them to people   and some people would rather get to places on a bike others on foot so they can splurge on a nice computer and others by car and cutting back on other expenses wouldnt people themselves be the best equipped to measure what kind of trade offs they would like to have in order to live their life in the way they choose
  raise the minimum wage implement a public healthcare system social security already exists but increasing the taxes on high income individuals to help fund it well into the future
  this this this    more money for the poor means a stronger economy since they actually spend their money and dont hide it in off shore bank accounts   a public healthcare system would be the best thing every for the private sector  and lifting the cap on social security would keep the system solvent for almost forever
  so what about the people whos work isnt worth 15 an hour    are they just locked out of the labour market  and what about the tradeoffs of government mandated health insurance  in every system there is scarcity  in government run healthcare its a bureaucrat who decides whether you live or die because they decide your spot on the waiting list only through corruption can you get ahead on the waiting list  in private market run healthcare its whether or not you can get the money that decides whether you live or die you can avoid this by getting health insurance but you can also appeal to your community you can get ahead by providing goods or services to other people and helping other people to get ahead
  i never got this line of argumentation  how is it that there is more importance on people spending money in your own life what is easier saving money or spending money  why would this not apply to the economy as a whole
  more money for the poor means a stronger economy since they actually spend their money and dont hide it in off shore bank accounts  where the hell did you get that from people making over 200k pay nearly 60 of the total income taxes filed which goes to funding our social safety net inversely people making less than 30k pay less than 15 what would you have the people who are already contributing the most pay and how do you think that would effect the economy hint poor tax environments incentivise people to stash their money like youre alleging     my source     do you work whats your tax rate roughly
  more money for the poor means a stronger economy since they actually spend their money    this is a stupid thing to say the top earners spend way more than the lower earners in this country i dont know why this is even difficult to postulate but ill post a source because you seem very misinformed     
  more money for the poor  the poor cant get money if nobody can afford to pay them we all know walmart can and thats who everyone thinks about raising minimum wage for but a lot of our jobs and probably most of our job growth come from smalltime entrepreneurs starting local businesses when theyre allowed to flourish labor prices tend to rise as long as theyre not allowed to lock their workers in camps at night theyre not and minimum wage is irrelevant    pricing newcomers out of the labor market is exactly what walmart wants
  so what about the people whos work isnt worth 15 an hour  the increase would not happen instantly it would increase by like 1/hr each year for a few years the last few times the minimum wage was increased it didnt seem to have much of an effect on unemployment the market is able to keep up as long as its done gradually no one wants for it to suddenly shift to 15/hr
      comparing income tax to general spending  youre a retard        rich spend more because theyre hoarding all the money its why they pay the taxes because they have all the money why do you think income inequality is at its worst since before the great depression
    
  you know more money gets printed right you know a midsized town can generate value well enough on its own without le monocled fatman participating the sun shines the rain falls plants grow iron gets mined it doesnt all wind up in a caribbean vault i dont give a crap about income inequality i just care about everyone having a shot and everyone has more of a shot when they can start their own businesses and hire people
  but it does in specific areas  the history of black workers in the united states illustrates the point from the late nineteenthcentury on through the middle of the twentieth century the labor force participation rate of american blacks was slightly higher than that of american whites in other words blacks were just as employable as the wages they received as whites were at their very different wages the minimum wage law changed that before federal minimum wage laws were instituted in the 1930s the black unemployment rate was slightly lower than the white unemployment rate in 1930 but then followed the davisbacon act of 1931 the national industrial recovery act nira of 1933 and the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938  all of which imposed governmentmandated minimum wages either on a particular sector or more broadly    the national labor relations act of 1935 which promoted unionization also tended to price black workers out of jobs in addition to union rules that kept blacks from jobs by barring them from union membership the nira raised wages in the southern textile industry by 70 percent in just five months and its impact nationwide was estimated to have cost blacks half a million jobs while this act was later declared unconstitutional by the supreme court the flsa was upheld by the high court and became the major force establishing a national minimum wage    by 1954 black unemployment rates were double those of whites and have continued to be at that level or higher those particularly hard hit by the resulting unemployment have been black teenage males    unemployment among 16 and 17yearold black males was no higher than among white males of the same age in 1948 it was only after a series of minimum wage escalations began that black male teenage unemployment rates not only skyrocketed but became more than double the unemployment rates among white male teenagers    what youre suggesting is pushing blacks out of the workforce
  the articles you posted didnt support anything youre saying in this thread i suggest you reread them the second one is about the imf working in developing counties which has been ruining local economies for years youre not going yourself any favors also try looking for actual studies or think tank research not news articles
  they pay more into the system because they have more money than like the bottom 90 combined but they pay less proportionately because taxes and contributions to social security are capped at a fairly low level and rich people also get special tax exemptions that most people simply do not have access to
  these things are achievable if you make the right decisions in your life  imagine actually believing this they are not achievable for everybody even if you make perfect decisions every time which nobody does you can become sick for example or education costs a lot of money and your parents dont have money to pay for your education because your premise is wrong so are your conclusions which is always the problem with these economic theories pulled out of ass they make a faulty usually black and white premise and then logically the conclusions are wrong as well see trickledown invisible hand lowering taxes means more tax revenue etc  it doesnt mean they cant work sometime or in theory but if they dont work in the long run or in practice they are shitty or even not valid theories
    do you work and whats your effective tax rate
  what youre suggesting is pushing blacks out of the workforce  based
    most people dont have access to them because most people arent paying shit in terms of taxes
  no evidence youve given suggests a correlation try again       think tanks  you mean right wing organizations that come up with conclusions and pay people to find data to fit that conclusion      have a billion dollars  compered to a guy with 10k  why am i paying more in taxes
reminder that kansas went all in on republican economic policies and it was so disastrous for the state they voted for the democrat for their governor     hand all the money to the rich is perfect for destroying your economy
  because theyre not being paid shit the money is all trickling up not down
  if we have a flat tax the guy making 100k will pay 10 times as much as the guy paying 10k  would that make you happy
  this is why i ask of theyre even getting taxed its people who pay 0 taxes but want shit for themselves that make these child like arguments because they cannot imagine having to budget their actual own taxed income to pay for the things they demand like hes seriously linking the guardian articles talking about the imfs recommendations to support no strings attached free money for poor people top kek
  those who imagine that profits first benefit business ownersand that benefits only belatedly trickle down to workershave the sequence completely backwards when an investment is made whether to build a railroad or to open a newrestaurant the first money is spent hiring people to do thework without that nothing happens money goes out first topay expenses and then comes back as profits laterif at allthe high rate of failure of new businesses makes painfullyclear that there is nothing inevitable about the money comingbackeven with successful businesses years can elapse betweenthe initial investment and the return of earnings from thetime when an oil company begins spending money to explorefor petroleum to the time when the first gasoline resultingfrom that exploration comes out of a pump at a filling stationa decade may have passed in the meantime all sorts of employeeshave been paidgeologists engineers refinery workerstruck driversnor is the oil industry unique no one who begins publishinga newspaper expects to break evenmuch less make aprofitduring the first year or two but reporters and othermembers of the newspaper staff expect to be paid every paydayeven while the paper shows only red ink on the bottomlinein short the sequence of payments is directly the oppositeof what is assumed by those who talk about a trickledowntheory
  consolidate a vast majority of the wealth into the hands of a tiny group of people  act like its unfair when the owners of the majority of the wealth have to pay the majority of the taxes
  it was so disastrous for the state  business in wichita is booming what are you talking about
  flat tax would fuck over the poor even more and allow the rich to hoard even more money  youll pulling the same intellectually dishonest argument bush did when he pushed his tax scam of 100 vs 5 ignoring how much money the percentages were
          
  what percentage are you taxed at what should i be taxed at
  the issue is businesses not expanding not branching out if big finance and big data werent so profitable and investors had to invest in companies that made things it would trickle down in a hurry      oh sorry sir i didnt know you had a youtube video i guess my experience must be wrong
  the very phrase income distribution is tendentious it starts the economic story in the middle with a body of income or wealth existing somehow leaving only the question as to how that income or wealth is to be distributed or apportioned as koukoulas puts it in the real world the situation is quite different in a market economy most people receive income as a result of what they produce supplying other people with some goods or services that those people want even if that service is only labor each recipient of these goods and services pays according to the value which that particular recipient puts on what is received choosing among alternative suppliers to find the best combination of price and qualityboth as judged by the individual who is paying  this mundane utilitarian process is quite different from the vision of income distribution projected by those among the intelligentsia who invest that vision with moral angst if there really were some preexisting body of income or wealth produced somehowmanna from heaven as it werethen there would of course be a moral question as to how large a share each member of society should receive but wealth is produced it does not just exist somehow where millions of individuals are paid according to how much what they produce is valued subjectively by millions of other individuals it is not at all clear on what basis third parties could say that some goods or services are overvalued or undervalued that cooking should be valued more or carpentry should be valued less for example much less that not working at all is not rewarded enough compared to working  nor is there anything mysterious in the fact that at least a thousand times as many people would pay to hear taylor swift sing as would pay to hear the average person sing
  i agree that helping the poor is the best way to spur economic growth and that would be by removing barriers that prevent them from developing their human capital and the removal of occupational licensing that prevents them from doing work that would be a more efficient use of their time  
i didnt know this board was such a lefty hellhole with poor arguments and impotent rage its like r/politics on 4channel im definitely going to stick around to continue pointing out why you losers who dont pay taxes are wrong and need to grow up its incredibly easy and a good say way to get some practice dismantling arguments but please come more prepared than reeing about the rich and false claims that the poor pay most in taxes
  no evidence youve given suggests a correlation try again  black workers had lower skills because there is less of a focus on education within the black community lower skilled work is paid less when there was no minimum wage blacks worked more after minimum wage blacks worked less  this logically follows  do you have any countering theory to explain the evidence i have presented
  again quoting thomas sowell  the rich have seen far greater income gains than have the poor according to washington post columnist eugene robinson3 a writer in the los angeles times likewise declared the gap between rich and poor is growing4 according to professor andrew hacker in his book money while all segments of the population enjoyed an increase in income the top fifth did twentyfour times better than the bottom fifth and measured by their shares of the aggregate not just the bottom fifth but the three above it all ended up losing ground5 ej dionne of the washington post described the wealthy as people who have made almost all the income gains in recent years and added that they are undertaxed6  although such discussions have been phrased in terms of people the actual empirical evidence cited has been about what has been happening over time to statistical categoriesand that turns out to be the direct opposite of what has happened over time to fleshandblood human beings most of whom move from one income category to another over time in terms of statistical categories it is indeed true that both the amount of income and the proportion of all income received by those in the top 20 percent bracket have risen over the years widening the gap between the top and bottom quintiles7 but us treasury department data following specific individuals over time from their tax returns to the internal revenue service show that in terms of people the incomes of those particular taxpayers who were in the bottom 20 percent in income in 1996 rose 91 percent by 2005 while the incomes of those particular taxpayers who were in the top 20 percent in 1996 rose by only 10 percent by 2005and the incomes of those in the top 5 percent and top one percent actually declined8
  theres no universal tax rate that should be applied to everyone taxes should be graduated with rates that increase at set brackets a higher tax rate does not apply to income below that tax bracket to ensures that youre never paying so much in taxes that youre effectively making less than if you were at a lower tax bracket
  again quoting thomas sowell  once again the confusion is between what is happening to statistical categories over time and what is happening to fleshandblood individuals over time as they move from one statistical category to another  despite the rise in the income of the top 01 percent of taxpayers as a statistical category both absolutely and relative to the incomes in other categories as fleshandblood human beings those individuals who were in that category initially had their incomes actually fall by a whopping 50 percent between 1996 and 200510 it is hardly surprising when people whose incomes are cut in half drop out of the top 01 percent   as with other data data on those who were among the top 400 income earners from 1992 to 2000 were not data on the same 400 people throughout the span of time covered during that span there were thousands of people in the top 400which is to say turnover was high fewer than onefourth of all the people in that category during that span of years were in that category more than one year and fewer than 13 percent were in that category more than two years12  behind many of those numbers and the accompanying alarmist rhetoric is a very mundane fact most people begin their working careers at the bottom earning entrylevel salaries over time as they acquire more skills and experience their rising productivity leads to rising pay putting them in successively higher income brackets these are not rare these are common patterns among millions of people in the united states and in some other countries more than threequarters of those working americans whose incomes were in the bottom 20 percent in 1975 were also in the top 40 percent of income earners at some point by 1991 only 5 percent of those who were initially in the bottom quintile were still there in 1991 while 29 percent of those who were initially at the bottom quintile had risen to the top quintile
  if you follow flesh and blood people as opposed to statistical group you would see that a majority of poor people do achieve this  
  what should someone making 50k be taxed at 100k 500k  1m
  no right wing economist has posited trickle down theory and evidence makes it clear that money is spent long before any kind of profit is earned
    and the incomes of those in the top 5 percent and top one percent actually declined  into the trash everything he says go if hes going to brazenly lie
  what do you mean by hoard  is saving your money a bad thing  if you consider spending money virtuous and saving money to be sinful do you have any idea what type of message you are sending to the poor and if you are poor did you consider that your language of hoarding vs spending may be a cause
  every right wing economist shills the trickle down theory its why it never dies even after every time its tried it crashes the economy
    find attached the source to said statement
  source
  the fact republicans keep pushing trickle down even after it does nothing but destroys economies
  i am still not seeing any quotations  like paul ryan or trump or reagan saying trickle down economics will save america or some such statement  if republicans keep saying it and shilling it you could find a single quotation
    2007  paywall  fuck out of here
  explain the income inequality then              
  he means a document proving your allegation
    post evidence for these posts please or any of your posts
    no one said these right wing think tanks worked with facts
  whats that got to do with anything im not talking about me but these shitty halfassed theories on the whole my the other posters or your individual situation is not proof for one way or another on a larger scale
  i dont see the word trickle anywhere here
  that may be true but youre still unemployed
                    
  im curious about who im talking to do you work whats your salary and whats your tax rate its an anonymous board so the worse i can do is call you a liar or faggot
  they dont call it trickle down which it is they gussy up that turd by calling it supplyside economics
  
  all of the links i try to post to get around the paywall 4chan blocks    use this
  still not seeing trickle down anywhere  i thought you said its all they talk about
  linking to reddit  its like you want to just scream youre from /pol/
  but i thought they all just talked about trickle down  no right wing economist has posited trickle down theory and evidence makes it clear that money is spent long before any kind of profit is earned  i guess i was right then
  youre not even reading what youre posting you look like a real moron right now bud
  so if i post a paywalled link you complain and if i post a way to get around the paywall you complain  and you still dont address the ideas in the article that if you follow flesh and blood people their incomes declined
    you cant use world play to weasel out of the fact youre been refuted  tickle down  supply side      right wing think tanks dont shill tickle down  that video of a right wing think tank shilling trickle down doesnt count  terrible coordination by you people
    doesnt load    is talking about quintiles and not flesh and blood people    is talking about quintiles and not following people    is talking about quintiles and not following people  need i continue
  nothing to do with the conversation still
  trickle down supply side according to whom  i dont see any of these people positing trickle down economics  if you meant supply side why didnt you say it  i said   no right wing economist has posited trickle down theory and evidence makes it clear that money is spent long before any kind of profit is earned  and you said  every right wing economist shills the trickle down theory its why it never dies even after every time its tried it crashes the economy  you are wrong  none of your evidence has shown that right wing economists have supported trickle down economics
  youve done nothing to refute any of those links  please continue to embrace yourself
  the value of anything is determined by how much you pay for it  does that guy pushing the broom generate 12 per hour for your business  hes a running cost not a revenue stream
  hes not reading what hes posting its a bad faith tactic rather than making arguments for himself then posting a source for claims in the posts hes spouting off talking ponts that hes picked up then when asked for evidence hes scrambling to google links for you to read while he continues spouting bs
  how long have you been unemployed
  jesus dude what do you think quintiles are made of shopping trollies tshirts theres a point when you give up in a debate and youve reached it best to just stop posting
  trickle down supply side according to whom  wikipedia even if tickle down focuses on the worst aspects of supply side which is everything youre wrong because supply side economics have been proven to be a failure and well see the economy crash because of the trump tax cuts because thats what happens
  see      he asked me to explain the income inequality  i was talking about flesh and blood people he asked for a source and then for me to explain those articles  while it might seem as if both these radically different sets of statistics cannot be true at the same time what makes them mutually compatible is that fleshandblood human beings move from one statistical category to another over time when those taxpayers who were initially in the lowest income bracket had their incomes nearly double in a decade that moved many of them up and out of the bottom quintileand when those in the top one percent had their incomes cut by about onefourth that may well have dropped many if not most of them out of the top one percent internal revenue service data can follow particular individuals over time from their tax returns which have individual social security numbers as identification while data from the census bureau and most other sources follow what happens to statistical categories over time even though it is not the same individuals in the same categories over the years
  well see the economy crash because of the trump tax cuts because thats what happens  lol please explain this one
  well see the economy crash because of the trump tax cuts  dont hold your breath lol
    almost every major recession and depression was caused by republicans      trumps shitty policies all but confirmed were heading into a recession if not a depression
  using google links  real men use yahoo when posting factual links to refute right wing economic scams
  yet im seeing starting wages rise to 50 over minimum here riddle me that
  i have  theyre talking about groups not flesh and blood people  the reason for the large discrepancy between growth rate trends in household income and growth rate trends in individual income is very straightforward the number of persons per household has been declining over the years as early as 1966 the us bureau of the census reported that the number of households was increasing faster than the number of people and concluded the main reason for the more rapid rate of household formation is the increased tendency particularly among unrelated individuals to maintain their own homes or apartments rather than live with relatives or move into existing households as roomers lodgers and so forthincreasing individual incomes made this possible as late as 1970 21 percent of american households contained 5 or more people but by 2007 only 10 percent did  despite such obvious and mundane facts household or family income statistics continue to be widely cited in the media and in academiaand per capita income statistics widely ignored despite the fact that households are variable in size while per capita income always refers to the income of one person however the statistics that the intelligentsia keep citing are much more consistent with their vision of america than the statistics they keep ignoring  just as household statistics understate the rise in the american standard of living over time they overstate the degree of income inequality since lower income households tend to have fewer people than upper income households while there are 39 million people in households whose incomes are in the bottom 20 percent there are 64 million people in households whose incomes are in the top 20 percent this is not that surprising given the amount of single mothers    again    while there are 39 million people in households whose incomes are in the bottom 20 percent there are 64 million people in households whose incomes are in the top 20 percent
  if that article is accurate the poor economic situations start in republicans first terms following democratic policies how interesting you omitted that     also the economy is doing ok and were not expected go into a recession soon accoring to this article from this month not 2016 speulculatuon        womp womp try again
  radically different  not really if you think about the actual quantities of money earned in each quintile  low income household earns 20000pa in 1996 and 38200 pa in 2005  a 91 increase  high income household earns 300000pa in 1996 and 330000pa in 2005  a 10 increase  who made out better there is income more or less equal in 2005 compared to 1996  your reasoning is severely flawed
  and the worst recoveries have been caused by democrats     
  isnt it obvious that a 91 increase is better than a 10 increase
  is income more or less equal  who cares
  you are confusing upward mobility with income inequality
  so the poor get better massively and the high income get higher income slightly sounds like the system working in an ideal sense  everyone is winning
  wait are you claiming that incomes being inequal is a problem  i thought what you were claiming the problem was was a lack of upward mobility not that incomes are inequal
    and who is winning more here you claimed that the poor are winning but it looks to me like the rich got richer 30000 is larger than 18200 after all the gap became wider
  what is the problem you are having here  both sides are becoming better off
  fdr  double dip recession happened because conservative democrats join republicans and forced fdr to scale back on recovery programs before they were completed     obama  wasnt able to do everything he wanted because republicans were hellbent on stopping him and were willing to destroy the country in the process same problem with conservative democrats forcing any recovery program to be watered down  also republicans magically stopped sabotaging the economy when obama left      it doesnt change the fact that republicans excel at crashing economies
  cnbc  ah yes and all the other experts who said bushs policies werent going to cause a crash and then they did   an attempt was made    womp womp  whats this you going to pull a gun on me
  the recovery programs dont work  we saw those ideas realized in the soviet union  the soviet union failed the lesson of the 20th century was that central planning does not work  they have never worked and every time they have been tried it resulted in poor economic outcomes and massive famine and death  look at the development of africa 1870s france the soviet union the great leap forward  it does not work
  keynesian economics does work the problem is conservatives always sabotage it so its half implemented and then we have idiots like you then go its a failure let the market decide everything and ignore the fact that it was the market that caused the crash in the first place
  how to spot a small brain poster your wage means nothing if you can buy nothing with it the dollar amount isnt what matters the dollar value does and while wages have been stagnant for the lowest sector of unskilled workers what you can buy for a dollar has gone significantly up the life of a person in 2018 is a hundred fold better than even going back to the late 80s early 90s   the only thing that has continued to get more expensive in our economic is health care education and housing and all three are heavily regulated and interfered with by the government either guaranteeing money to people who cant repay it or incredibly burdensome regulation
    keynesian economics doesnt even make sense logically  how would spending peoples money on things they wouldnt buy as consumers and spending that money as tax payers instead solve the problem    it doesnt pass the sniff test
  im just pointing out why anon is wrong here  but if you do want to get into why inequality is a bad thing then i guess you could start by reading some of the links that other anon has already posted itt
  inflation doesnt exist brainlet  regulation bad
  i did    basically asians who do things like get an education and specialize do well because their work is more valuable  and asians who dont specialize and do things like run convenience stores dont get money because anyone can run a convenience store  it later talks about how many of the poor asians who enter the country end up doing unskilled labour and then proceed to use that money to get a better life for their children through putting an importance on education like earlier asian immigrants to the united states as well as jewish immigrants and how this led to asians being richer on average than white americans because of their over representation in academia despite being racially discriminated against    i dont see the problem with this inequality supply and demand says that the work of a brain surgeon is more valuable than that of a convenience store owner because people end up more urgently needing brain surgery as opposed to condoms and a gallon of soda at 2am
  john stossel      it doesnt make sense  thats because your logic was flawed and it worked to get america out of the great depression   but mum extenstion  because the policies were scaled back before the economy could stay upright by itself
  no  it extended the great depression    the source youre providing complains that he talks about a left wing media bias  this is obviously true    
  a cherry picked example affecting 54 of the population represents the entirety of an issue  maybe read more than one article
  how would spending peoples money on things they wouldnt buy as consumers  yeah individual people usually wouldnt buy roads hospitals schools etc    keynes argued that the solution to the great depression was to stimulate the country  incentive to invest through some combination of two approaches     a reduction in interest rates monetary policy and   government investment in infrastructure fiscal policy    if the interest rate at which businesses and consumers can borrow is decreased investments which were previously uneconomic become profitable and large consumer sales which are normally financed through debt such as houses automobiles and historically even appliances like refrigerators become more affordable a principal function of central banks in countries which have them is to influence this interest rate through a variety of mechanisms which are collectively called monetary policy this is how monetary policy which reduces interest rates is thought to stimulate economic activity ie grow the economy and why it is called expansionary monetary policy    expansionary fiscal policy consists of increasing net public spending which the government can effect by a taxing less b spending more or c both investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses products and for employment reversing the effects of the aforementioned imbalance    but  contrary to some critical characterizations of it  keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending since it recommends adjusting fiscal policies according to cyclical circumstances74 an example of a countercyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demandside growth and engaging in deficit spending on labourintensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturns     seems very logical to me
  does it take into account 1937 when he was forced to scale back the programs to balance the budget causing the double dip  also the republican way caused the depression to get worse otherwise hoover would have solved it amazing monday morning quarterbacking from the right    left wing bias  cites trump  runs a trainwreck of a campaign that banks on the worst instincts of america  be shocked that people report on it  theres a right wing bias because the media    lets see if stossel complains about sinclair ever
  why wouldnt consumers buy schools or roads through buying the services of teachers and doctors  the same way consumers buy walmarts by purchasing groceries from them  as for roads ill concede them its such a small part of the us budget 267 and thats all the department of transportation
  do the same things not apply to blacks and whites in america  does becoming a convenience store owner become more valuable than a brain surgeon if youre black
  defending trickle down
  wouldnt the strongest incentive to invest be a reduction in the capital gains tax  the government sucks at investing theres piles of pork unions drive up costs and they always end up over time and over budget  ill repeat sowell again  those who imagine that profits first benefit business owners  and that benefits only belatedly trickle down to workers  have the sequence completely backward when an investment is made whether to build a railroad or to open a new restaurant the first money is spent hiring people to do the work without that nothing happens    money goes out first to pay expenses and then comes back as profits later  if at all the high rate of failure of new businesses makes painfully clear that there is nothing inevitable about the money coming back    even with successful businesses years can elapse between the initial investment and the return of earnings from the time when an oil company begins spending money to explore for petroleum to the time when the first gasoline resulting from that exploration comes out of a pump at a filling station a decade may have passed in the meantime all sorts of employees have been paid  geologists engineers refinery workers truck drivers    nor is the oil industry unique no one who begins publishing a newspaper expects to break even  much less make a profit  during the first year or two but reporters and other members of the newspaper staff expect to be paid every payday even while the paper shows only red ink on the bottom line    in short the sequence of payments is directly the opposite of what is assumed by those who talk about a trickledown theory
  the problem with inequality isnt that some work is worth more than other work and nor would any rational person suggest that you should pay a brain surgeon and a convenience store clerk the same in fact your continued harping on about it suggests that you are in fact irrational and refuse to engage with the topic at all  inequality depresses economic growth and spurs crime read more
  what is wrong about what sowell said
  okay so whats the problem then  how do you want to change incentives to reduce income inequality
raising minimum wage just increase inflation the more you raise minimum wage the less people are getting paid above minimum wage this is even more proof that most leftist are procommunist state also republicans have more control right now than democrats because they have 2 out of 3 primary law making areas of the government the democrats are now unable to pass whatever laws they want and must work with republicans
  youre telling me that increasing the wages of employees without increasing the amount of products being produced or increasing the amount of services being provided would increase inflation  say it aint so
    increasing all wages by 10 would make everything cost 10 more actually less than 10 because labor is only one component of the labor/land/capital production cost but raising minimum wage by 10 certainly wouldnt cause make everything cost 10 more because the vast majority of people and an even vaster majority of wages/salary paid is not paid to minimum wage workers
  i kinda get the feeling that you havent actually read any more about the subject given your post but ill humour you all the same  increase minimum wage which as the world has seen over and over pushes up all wages  invest in education including ece  improve the eitc particularly around single income earning households  provide incentives for low earning households to save and invest  reform taxes so that the poor arent so slapped by sales tax and so that the hyper rich cant get away with paying laughably little tax
  also im not sure if you noticed but this is an article about state legislatures
  what do you mean by laughably little tax
  reminder that 100 level economic theories only work in a model economy with perfect information perfect competition and perfect consumers none of which exists in the real world
  effective tax rate
    weve been investing in education with very little to show for it  eitc is the least bad policy but i disagree its the role of government to be in the redistributionist game at all  i dont know that the government will be able to provide an incentive for low earning households to invest in such a way that doesnt get us into a situation like 2007s subprime loans when you put money on the table for some investments and not others you will have some major distorting effects on the economy you can see the education sector for ongoing examples of this  also come on    the rich pay a lot in taxes
  so whats the tradeoff in raising the minimum wage
  effective tax rate on the top 1 is 20 which is maybe not as high as the 50 or 80 you want it to be but is really not laughably little in any sense
  education is what affords people upward mobility its how you fill highly skilled roles in a modern and high tech economy  youre unlikely to see 17 year olds get smarter without a serious cultural shift and a greater importance placed on ones education  as to incentives for investment australia and new zealand both have government mandated superannuation plans with mandatory contributions by employers these sorts of schemes do exist im not saying they are perfect theres obviously a cost to employers involved but theres also a huge boost to the capital thats available for reinvestment into the economy talking to my friends in new zealand about it theirs is a recent thing its been a resounding success  and the other post isnt me but if you take washington state as an example the poorest quintile pay an effective tax rate of 18 while the richest 1 pay 3  with the high inequality of income of course 3 of the top 1s income is more than 18 of the bottom quintile    raising the minimum wage increases all wages at the expense of corporate profit    no its really not  
  no its really not  yeah this report ignores 100 of the federal tax system and is not useful for making conclusions about the tax system in general
  yes and were still paying 375 more per pupil with nothing to show for it in terms of test scores  
  everything              
  none of your articles address what hes saying they just straw man trickle down and dont acknowledge the point he is making
  wrong they actually show evidence of trickle down being used and failing to do anything except for destroy the economy stooles is great about spinning hypotheticals but never comes up with the real facts
  says blue wave ignoring how divided the turn out was for most elections  that was a blue puddle or a purple splash
  hold it    
  wrong youre still failing to prove him or basic economic models wrong and havent provided a tested workable solution
  you havent provided a testable workable solution  to fucking trickle down systems  what if uhhh we like uhhh stop giving tax cuts to the richest entities without mandating minimum employee investments
  prove this would work any evidence ill wait    btw tax cuts are for all earners not just rich people you only think that because youre unemployed ie dont earn an income to be taxed
  prove that not doing the statistically proven negative will result in a positive  this is how retarded you sound go take your disingenuous bullshit somewhere else
  you dont know what youre talking about in the slightest tell me how allowing people who earn income to keep their income harms the economy you are devoid of actual economic knowledge really pathetic but maybe one day youll earn a living and realize this
  its okay to hoard a collective trillion in liquid assets and remove it from national circulation in offshore accounts  youre a brainless faggot and im done spending my time on such a disgusting waste of life
  if you increase the cost of labor that cost inevitably gets passed onto the consumer  yeah the price of a big mac is increased by like 50 cents oh no
  how does raising the minimum wage make your work more valuable  because the government has declared it to be so if a business has to pay a worker 15/hr their work is worth 15/hr its as simple as that there is no intrinsic value
  why dont states with higher minimum wage have higher unemployment ill tell you because when the minimum wage is raised gradually businesses dont have to lay people off to any damaging extent
  this is pretty good bait
  minimum wage is slightly correlated with unemployment rate      if a workers work wasnt worth 15 dollars an hour nobody would pay him 15 dollars an hour everybody who makes the minimum wage whatever it is is doing work worth at least that much
  youre conflating the objective dollar value of the minimum wage with the value inherent to the expertise of a minimum wage worker if the minimum wage is 8 and we increase it to 15 this does not mean we value that person more only that we value the dollar less paper currency is only a proxy
  if the minimum wage is 8 and we increase it to 15 this does not mean we value that person more only that we value the dollar less paper currency is only a proxy  a price floor for labor is similar to a price floor for other goods if cigarettes are raised from 4 a pack to 8 a pack by government fiat everyone who buys cigarettes at the new higher price values the pack at least 8 dollars as opposed to deciding the dollar is only worth half as much
  theyre not acknowledging the employees being paid long before any revenue is generated theyre just complaining about tax deficits  not acknowledging what i said again you keep straw manning what i am saying and not acknowledging or refuting it
  see  
  look at what all the corporations said they do with the money they got from trumps tax cuts they either hoarded it off shore and just commenced with massive buy backs of stocks neither help the us economy
  antiworker antivoter laws  do you people really believe the shit you write  honest question
    michigan republicans say employers need protection from the states sick leave law    as the lameduck legislative session begins michigan republicans are working to kill the newly passed sick leave law and its all because business groups dont like it    a progressive group in michigan collected 380000 signatures to get a sick leave measure on the ballot in the 2018 election the gopcontrolled legislature took that choice away from the voters instead passing their own sick leave bill that they vowed to undermine immediately after the midterms    republican senate majority leader arlan meekhof complained we need to make it more acceptable to the business community so we keep our economy on track we dont want to put a roadblock or hindrance in their way    the existing sick leave law is modest requiring one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work for a total of 72 hours per year smaller businesses have to provide the same amount of hours but only 40 of those hours must be paid so the law already takes into account the challenges smaller employers may face    thats not good enough for republicans like michigan house speaker tom leonard in explaining why more accommodations for businesses need to be made leonards spokesperson gideon dassandro made an argument that willfully misunderstands how sick leave works lets say youve got a landscaping company with four employees and two of them call in sick youve got to shut down for the day    in the world of the michigan gop paid sick leave isnt an option they can even understand republicans want to make people work even when they are sick and they want to penalize people who take sick days by making those days unpaid both are designed to do nothing except punish workers particularly those at lowwage and parttime jobs
experts including doctors agree sick leave is a necessity not a frivolity it ensures a healthy workforce because people dont come to work while ill risking spreading illness it ensures healthy and strong families as parents are available to care for their children      business groups however have seen these basic rights as disruptions complaining about things like needing to change their payroll systems to accommodate sick leave payouts they also complain about the regulatory burden of the bill  a burden that seems to be limited to businesses being required to keep track of hours worked and sick leave granted  
    can someone ask the republicans to stop acting like cartoon villains
        during the 20172018 session of the michigan legislature gop senate majority leader arlan meekhof introduced a bill that would have allowed the creation of special police agencies  private police forces run by forprofit corporations    its a bill so poorly thought out that even law enforcement officials in michigan oppose it the head of the michigan association of chiefs of police noted that under the law even the kkk could create its own private police force the past president of the association called it a mercenary force to police in some of our communities    the measure died in committee but now law enforcement officials are worried that the gop majority may try to get it passed before december 31 in the lameduck session    supporters of the bill have argued that it would give greater security options to business groups but thats actually part of the problem it creates a twotier police system in the state  one for the rich and one for everyone else    private police would enjoy key privileges like governmental immunity but wouldnt have to follow the same rules as regular police for instance private police wouldnt have to provide information under the states freedom of information act and they wouldnt necessarily have to meet the same training standards as municipal forces do    the bill is also a giveaway to a rich conservative donor jc huizenga who has been very generous to meekhof huizenga donated over 250000 within the state of michigan for 20152016 and has given meekhof 20000 since 2013    huizenga also just happens to own three private police agencies in north carolina where about 10 percent of the force is private police
  just fucking kill me i cant take this anymore why am i still in this shithole country oh yeah because of freedom of speech im this close sacrificing that right and going to the netherlands or something
  im this close to  100 of people who ever said this were posers
  yeah i am a poser not denying that im not leaving my family
  employment really means nothing if its not supporting you can you provide meaningful evidence that these employed people could fully provide for themselves let alone their families if they could even afford them
  you actually should
  why would a company buy back its stocks  do you understand what the point of stocks are maybe why buying back stocks might make a company stronger
  why would a company buy back its stocks  
        
  can you provide evidence that the historically black unemployed population could fully provide for themselves with no income let alone their families
  unused cash is costly    each share of common stock represents a small stake in the ownership of the issuing company including the right to vote on company policy and financial decisions if a business has a managing owner and one million shareholders it actually has 1000001 owners companies issue shares to raise equity capital to fund expansion but if there are no potential growth opportunities in sight holding on to all that unused equity funding means sharing ownership for no good reason    businesses that have expanded to dominate their industries for example may find that there is little more growth to be had with so little headroom left to grow into carrying large amounts of equity capital on the balance sheet becomes more of a burden than a blessing    shareholders demand returns on their investments in the form of dividends which is a cost of equity  so the business is essentially paying for the privilege of accessing funds it isnt using buying back some or all of the outstanding shares can be a simple way to pay off investors and reduce the overall cost of capital for this reason walt disney dis reduced its number of outstanding shares in the market by buying back 738 million shares collectively valued at 75 billion back in 2016    so wait youre telling me that by buying back stocks a company doesnt have to pay dividends and so in fact its profits go up and it becomes stronger
  the concern is that companies especially in prioritizing buybacks are rewarding stockholders instead of investing in their workers research and development new facilities or other more productive arenas firms also sometimes use buybacks to prop up their stock prices and corporate executives reap the financial rewards    when you cut taxes on corporations under the pretense theyll use the money to invest in their workers research and development new facilities or other more productive arenas giving money to shareholders should be low priority instead it was the top priority and you saw little to no growth as a result the tax cuts were wasted especially since were in a boom cycle and tax cuts are normally better utilized during a bust to mitigate the damage     buying back stocks doesnt help the economy as a whole or the workers within it
also rewarding investors and shareholders doesnt help the economy since theres no solid proof theyll reinvest later      
also while its expected it doesnt help the little guy just the rich get richer which wasnt how the tax cuts were framed and both predicted and inevitably happened       
  okay so what are they doing with the increased revenue since they are no longer paying out dividends  is there evidence theyre not spending the increased revenue on more productive arenas after buying back stocks  like i understand their logic they are buying back liabilities its like paying off your credit card bill before putting money into the stock market
  the problem is that only profits the rich and not the workers which goes against how the tax cuts were sold
  why cant workers buy stocks in the company they work in
  why cant workers just have money for whatever they want  gosh its a mystery
  theyre in control of their finances they can spend money investing in their company instead of buying a house  they choose not to as a means of diversifying their assets at the cost of not getting the increased gains from the stock market
  sure just dont dont pay rent that month  they choose not to as a means of diversifying their assets  buddy they dont have assets in the first place your premise is wrong
stupid faggotyassed millennials     vancouver  as the famous village people song declares every man wants to be a macho macho man / to have the kind of body always in demand but are macho macho mindsets becoming a thing of the past a new study finds that male millennials are drifting away from stereotypical masculine values    the research led by the university of british columbia showed that younger men tend to value selflessness social engagement and health over traditional male ideals like physical strength and autonomy    of course physique and independence were still prominent values for the 630 canadian men aged 15 to 29 who took part in the survey just not as important to participants as selflessness in fact selflessness was by far the toprated male value nine in 10 respondents said that men should should help others and 88 percent of the respondents agreed that men should be open to new ideas new people and new experiences eight in 10 felt it imperative that a man gives back to his community    
altruism  and thats a bad thing how    meanwhile trump supporters are victims of fragile masculinity  
  putin and xi are laughing their asses off at the average pussyhatwearing cuckoldloving intouchwiththeirfeelings negroloving western man     get ready to have your lunches eaten
  you mean theyre laughing at the beta trump whos leading a bunch of omegas who are destroying america
    found the russian propaganda posters
behaving like a macho macho man is jeered at and sued against in an increasingly stupid and automatic fashion  why do men stop acting manly  fucking retards

  feminism helped this
  though in some ways this is good
millennial men are more likely to not be assholes  whats the problem here
    surveys are kind of horseshit if they just ask for your values straight out they need to trick people into giving more honest answers to be worth a fuck ranking values just measures what people think others want to hear
  looking up to an insectoid and kleptocrat who only care about themselves and their buddies  how scared are you of imprisonment or worse for not supporting them youd have to be to unironically think giving back to your countrymen is a bad thing
  guys who fit traditional masculine values in 2018 are either boomers niggers or knuckle draggers that ended up in tradeschool
  and thats a bad thing how  youre a bunch of spineless cowards incapable of standing up for yourselves because you lack the testosterone and think masculinity is evil  you are a born and bred slave class never standing up for yourself and always backing down when told to how is this a good thing altruism is great up until it affects your life
    also notice how these brainless lemmings also cant counter arguments without going muh blump or muh russia
  that they are still assholes just more vocal and selfcongratulatory
  dont knock trade school welders make some serious money
  im selfish and cant understand the difference between taking care of my fellow man and being a doormat that cant protect myself    im also a retard who cant follow a reply chain
  322252  there is no difference where theres a philanthropist theres either a narcissist or a doormat  and ill prove it right now whats your opinion on mass migration  how much have you given to charity in the past 12 months

chicks dont like femboisthey want some big beefy dude to hold them at night if you cant change a tire or do the right thing in a dire situation what good are you to them paying others to do for you wont get you farther then being her paypig
  not the guy you are talking to but  if they arent legal they arent welcome but zerging the gates until they become legal still wont make them welcome  about 40 20 to salvation army last year 20 again this year      are we really supposed to take the thoughts of leafs on masculinity seriously at this point in time i am starting to doubt that the mounties still retain their once jacked and commanding reputation
god damn canadians are pathetic
theyre destroying what little good we have left in this nation theyll stop at nothing before all of our rights are gone theyre authoritariancommunitarian opporessors and they want our guns our self defense our telecommunications our freedom of speech our critical goods like water plumbing and food they want our education system our minds they want our healthcare system our health they want our women our families and they want our tax dollars our remaining freedom they cant win straight up in every election thus far so theyre now demanding to count votes from felons and illegal immigrants theyre pure evil and theyll destroy what little good we have leftjust watch
i mean to say they even want our balls isnt even a joke they have villainized and criminalized masculinity while they also encourage estrogenproducing catalysts in our food and medicine at the schools they control they brainwash any semblance of masculinity from our children so yeah they taking our balls
  so true
   thats a bad thing how  it requires reciprocation for it to be a successful strategy  though i expect the millennial males altruism is far from universal is there much room in his heart for the chads and stacies of this world
  the title had me hoping that more guys were becoming qt traps and it turns out to just be talking about behavior i am somewhat disappoint being a nice person is great and all but being nice and cute is better    chicks dont like femboisthey want some big beefy dude to hold them at night  thats where youre wrong kiddo

    the shit is about some fucking random shithole treating other countries around it when using the connections to the jewbook and twitter owners i dont give a flying shit about if russians or hackers are right it is pretty obvious britbongs are about to instal new networks for extortion and money laundring from east europe they are literally stealing the wealth there by using own secret service and bankers what makes me angry is that those fucks even forbid east european the right to defend themselves and to right to call out that zhee west is stealing their money and is destroying their countries its fucking like give me your money and shut the fucking up or i will call the police and they will bar you for complains during the robbery

  yes same shit in different packages but both are very shit though    sort of like in the us republican and democratic parties are literally both sides of the same shitty coin
  uh no    one side works for all americans regardless of race gender sexual orientation or religion while the other only fulfills the needs of white men the latter also consists of traitors that are more loyal to russia than to the us
  white men boo hoo  if you have an issue with the wealthiest and most well armed demographic you should leave    i would gladly collaborate with russians to overthrow an illegitimate government that uses voter fraud to disenfranchise the demographic that is most deserving of privilege
  i would gladly collaborate with russians to overthrow an illegitimate government that uses voter fraud to disenfranchise the demographic that is most deserving of privilege  but over the last several decades republicans have been more responsible for voter fraud than democrats    also unless youre part of the top 1 of earners then being white isnt going to help you because republican regulations arent meant for you if you are wealthy in white then i have to wonder why youre on 4chan instead of living in the lap of luxury
     wtf when did conservatives all become traitors collaborate with the russians smfh nixon is rolling in his grave get the fuck out of here you commie scum     how you gonna make a ra ra white people comment and then immediately follow it up with support for russia of all places the country that single handedly killed and raped more of your aryan brothers and sisters then any other country in history    also that weak ass commie navy would never be able to invade america
  uh no  one side works for all americans regardless of race gender sexual orientation or religion while the other only fulfills the needs of white men the latter also consists of traitors that are more loyal to russia than to the us    hi shareblue i didnt figure you would have vanished after the midterms
shock all the intelligence agencies work with one another and support the absolute scum of the earth  if any of this is shocking to you then youre an underaged faggot
  you probably made that post yourself or someone in your discord shareblue
  one side works for all americans regardless of  imagine being this retarded the left is 100 antiwhite antimale antistraight and antichristian and you wonder while these exact same people then do everything to oppose you
  thinking minority groups shoukd have the same rights and be treated with the same respect is somehow encroaching on the liberty of the majority group  wew lad stop paying attention to the cunts yelling the loudest and look at the rest of the dem base
    a federal judge in chicago has ruled that the us law against female genital mutilation is unconstitutional dismissing charges against eight people including two doctors    district judge bernard friedman said congress overstepped its bounds by outlawing the practice known as female circumcision or cutting    friedman said it was up to states rather than congress to regulate the practice    the ruling dismissed mutilation and conspiracy charges against dr jumana nagarwala who performed the surgery and dr fakhruddin attar    the doctors were charged in the genital mutilation of nine girls at a suburban detroit clinic    in addition the same charges were dismissed against attars wife farida and tahera shafiq who assisted in the procedure as well as four women who took their daughters to the clinic    michigan was the 26th state to officially ban the practice    the state law was passed a few months after nagarwalas april 2017 arrest    female genital mutilation has been condemned by the united nations but is common for girls in some parts of asia africa and the middle east
fucking libertarians
  implying this isnt made possible by the progressive left
fucking liberals
i am so tired of liberal minded people who are supposed proud champions of womens rights bending the knee to shit like this because muh cultural diversity
      sure bud and it was also liberals who made the milk in your fridge go bad and you know that time your shoelace broke liberals did that too
  yeah too bad i still have liberal values and cant be disgusted by a present left mindset without assholes thinking every post is a samefag  but none of thatll matter when the muslims take over cut up our vaginas as they please and beat us all into bowing to allah amirite
  fucking classical liberals
  you do realize that female genital mutilation is illegal because of feminist activists right
  present left mindset  which is please show me the hordes of liberal voters and politicians clamoring for female genital mutilation to be legal the judge didnt make this decision because he loves islam he did it because hes a big states rights guy which last time i checked was a conservative value more than a liberal one    as laudable as the prohibition of a particular type of abuse of girls may be  federalism concerns deprive congress of the power to enact this statute friedman wrote in his 28page opinion noting congress overstepped its bounds by legislating to prohibit fgm  fgm is a local criminal activity which in keeping with longstanding tradition and our federal system of government is for the states to regulate not congress     
  did you just unironically post a freep link inb4 daily kos
  a federal judge in chicago has ruled that the us law against female genital mutilation is unconstitutional dismissing charges against eight people including two doctors charged in the genital mutilation of nine girls at a suburban detroit clinic  does anyone else just hate it that /pol/ was right again
republican judge ruling that women can be oppressed because of religious reasons  this is the future
dr jumana nagarwala  dr fakhruddin attar    what a surprise
all you niggers posting without understanding case fuck off to twitter
  i presume this is because male circumcision is still legal
    how about you fuck off back to the dunes ahmed
  who is it that screams racist when shit like this gets banned
why do people refuse to google something before getting mad about it
as long as circumcision without medical reason remains legal so should this
  i dont know because ive literally never seen it happen ever
  and people will still blame liberals for it the perfect crime
  why dont you google that
      damn reagan appointees and their states rights
fucking americans
  google doesnt have a quality source for that
  district judge bernard (((friedman)))    nuff said
  lol except liberals love islam and are ready to make excuses for it all day long
  the judge didnt make this decision because he loves islam he did it because hes a big states rights guy    judge friedman made this decision because of female genital mutilation is banned male genital mutilation aka circumcision will also be banned
  dont cut the girls vaginas   the man whos parents were convinced by the jews to cut his dick
  who fucking cares if they allow circumcision then make it gender equal so women can fucking stop being sluts
  wtf is the deal with the sewed shut one how do africans even fucking breed
(((friedman)))
  male genital mutilation aka circumcision will also be banned  it will not not related
  100 of liberals are against genital mutilations so you are a moron
    the libertarian position is that the children in question could not legally consent and the procedure was medically unnecessary therefore the rights of the child were violated libertarianism is against coercion of all but the very most necessary kind and believes that an individual permanently owns their own body but male or female circumcision without consent or urgent need both coerces children and permanently removes their property making the practice incompatible with libertarian core values
  oh boy those disgusting foreigners mutilating their daughters  slices skin off newborn sons penis
  murray rothbard essentially concedes the position that parents have total and utter control over their children which are their property     there is no unified libertarian position on the rights of minors
  sounds like actual equality to me a victory for the right side of history
    guys like him are one reason why i abandoned libertarianism you start off with a simple principle of noncoercion and then you get a dude somehow justifying child slavery economists make terrible philosophers
  thanks jews
  changing their minds in a hurry now that achmed is upset
youre a retard if you think this was the action of liberals this shit falls more on the bipartisan side of things
    in all likelihood this is probably the real reason being able to cut up the genitals of one sex for religious reasons but not the other is not logically consistent and the us has an unusual attitude toward male circumcision
  this both parties believe that its okay to mutilate male genitals but not female
          isnt the usual reason americans circumcise their babies because of supposed hygienic reasons not saying its right that they do it but searching circumcision yields medical website results citing this again not saying its necessarily right could just be the jews manipulating shit if you believe what /pol/ puts out   the only reason for female circumcision is to control sexual behavior  a guy can still enjoy sex if hes circumcised a girl whos gotten her clitoris cut off is screwed over for life in that regard   sure let there be consequences for a bitch being a whore  shell probably die of stds anyway but for fucks sake could we not have muhammed dictating american morals
  you only need circumcision if you suffer of severe phimosis there is no other reason doing it to undeveloped babies is medically and ethically unjustifiably its nice that this judgment sheds some light on the hippocrisy
  did you miss the part where the judge wasnt a fucking liberal
  and male genital mutilation is still legal because feminists keep shutting down attempts to talk about mens rights
  citing a literal lolbertarian that justify using owning nukes for fun and child slavery because babies start off unaware  youre not even trying conservatard
  isnt the usual reason americans circumcise their babies because of supposed hygienic reasons  was that the original reason or a posthoc justification for a practice already in place
  isnt the usual reason americans circumcise their babies because of supposed hygienic reasons    support for circumcision in the us originated with the belief that masturbation was directly related to insanity it was later whole heartedly embraced by certain evangelicals for being something from the bible now people defend it as a norm because they were circumcised and their parents were circumcised so theyre going to circumcise their children too goddamn it all the talk about hygiene is just to justify something they already want to do for irrational reasons they dont want to seriously consider and ignores the fact that it is medically unnecessary in all but the rarest of cases
how is this any different then male circumcision if that is not banned why would the female version be    obviously this is a religious issue and the jews want you to think only their genital mutilation practices should be legal    if you want to ban them then you would need to ban both of them     imho if your god/culture requires you to mutalate yourself then its probably not a religion worth following
  god designed me perfectly in every way  thats why i have to cut off part of my body
  how is this any different then male circumcision    if female circumcision were like male circumcision they would just cut off the clitoral hood leaving the clitoris exposed thickening the skin and making it less sensitive but still functional    if male circumcision was like female circumcision they would cut the head of the penis completely off leaving the penis a fleshy tube that could become erect but would give next to no pleasurable sensation during sex    they are both bad but one is definitely worse
  no it has utterly nothing to do with hygiene and is made purely on the basis of a cosmetic decision for 99 the gentiles in the us the fathers view being i want my sons penis to look like my penis and the mothers view being i want my son to be circumcised because i think uncircumcised is unattractive
  the clitoris extends inside the female the part on the surface is just the very tip a woman can absolutely feel sexual pleasure without the visible portion of the clitoris   also circumcision cuts out a huge amount of the overall nerve endings in the entire penis its way more impactful than you understand
  most women cant achieve an orgasm let alone enjoy sex without stimulation of the clitoris hence why muslims and africans use it as a way to control womens sexual behavior  is correct in that its equivalent to cutting off the head of the penis even in development of fetuses the head of the penis and clitoris look almost the same during early pregnancy  circumcision is bad for both males and females it should be illegal for any minor in america sans a medical necessity but religious people will likely reeee at the notion
  female genital mutilation  male one is totally fine they arent as important as females after all equality
   support for circumcision in the us originated with the belief that masturbation was directly related to insanity    this is propaganda after the fact the vast majority of american men were not circumcised until after wwii when jewish doctors in the us began to heavily promote the practice for hygienic reasons when in actuality it was to protect jews from pogroms like the one that had just happened in europe during the war    if every guys dick is snipped you cant tell the jew from the nonjew
  you got a source for that
  wtf is the deal with the sewed shut one how do africans even fucking breed    they just have the local witch doctor cut the purse strings after the wedding ceremony i guess its like a tamperproof seal on a soda bottle
  not quite the scar heals shut and the husband perforates a new hole on the wedding night it still of course doesnt stop menstruation or peeing but it makes it really really difficult and uncomfortable and could lead to severe infection it was common in muslim east africa i dont know if it still is
  hes right dude
  i didnt say he was wrong i just want to prove it in an argument ive plenty of anecdotal evidence of personal friends whove had their sex life destroyed by circumcision scars i just want ammo
chastity is literally my fetish but this is just sick
dont worry boys your useless foreskin is sold to be turned into something worthwhile  
  you only need circumcision if you suffer of severe phimosis    even then you dont need to be circumcised look up the phimosis journey wordpress that guy had the worst case of phimosis imaginable and he was able to stretch out the opening to his foreskin until he was normal
  fair enough most people say that because they want to be debunking dickheads thats all
  oh no no i think its a healthy practice to ask for a source for things you want to believe its good to try to debunk things you think are wrong too instead of blithely stating theyre bullshit too all good practice    from what ive so far is that it was supposedly started by an orthopedic surgeon named sayre in 1870 believing it to be some kind of irritation type feeling that caused muscle paralysis which sounds kinda retarded but then i think doctors didnt start washing their hands till after the turn of the century
  its not fda approved so i assume that doesnt apply to america
next thing you know sharia law is inflicted
  keep a look out on dearborn michigan  were getting damn close
  actually circumscicion was around before the hebrews egyptians did it and it was a symbolic act usually  however for most of history and prehistory it made sense to do it as diseases would likely get there
  however for most of history and prehistory it made sense to do it as diseases would likely get there    this is a modern rationalization with no basis in historical fact
   for most of history and prehistory it made sense to do it as diseases would likely get there  this is a modern rationalization with no basis in historical fact    indeed the foundation of male and female circumcision is purely religious / cultural and was adopted by the jewish religious leaders as a way to control jews and differentiate the nomadic sheep herders from the city slickers not for any medical reason same as for their taboo against pork and shellfish    fast forward to wwii and millions of jews get sent up the chimney by the nazis in part because they were easily identified by their circumcised dicks and after the war the american medical association which has a large percentage of members who are jewish suddenly begins promoting circumcision for dubious health reasons and this coinciding with the postwar baby boom results in millions of american boys getting circumcised who of course grow up and insist their sons also get snipped and so on    now its true that religious kook harvey kellogg the breakfast cereal guy latched on to this practice in the late 1800s as part of his crazy health regime he was promoting and _small number of_ americans bought into it but the overwhelming majority did not and doctors of the time quite rightly pointed out that this was stupid    but this has been propagandized over the years by jews as a cover story for the reason that outside of israel and muslim countries and skorea which adopted the practice from american doctors after the korean war the us is the only nation where most men are circumcised    
my understanding is that john harvey kellogg yes the cereal guy was ultimately responsible for the cultural implementation of male genital mutilation as a masturbatiom preventative he actually medically recommended all kinds of genital torture to curb sexual impulses including acid to the clitoris for example
  i really want a source for that because its juicy
  if the us allows male genital mutilation why shouldnt it allow the female version
    
i really wanna fug a circumcised pssy
