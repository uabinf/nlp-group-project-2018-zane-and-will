as a kid in 20012002 i had one of these it was already retro at the time i guess it could be from the 1980s    im getting nostalgic for it anyone know what they were called where i can see some pics i guess they werent ever very popular     steel tubing heavy af compared to the razor scooters that were blowing up at the time   two inline wheels in the front with rollerblade style wheels   skateboard truck with flat longboardstyle wheels on the back    it was fun for carving it felt like riding something between a longboard and a razor scooter
  do you recognise it as any of these 
good boy its prety small can be your 1st friend  and nobody will steal it unlike ur bike

im thinking about buying some cheap truing stand to start building some wheels for profit  i have never done it but i have some mechanical skills in general    im thinking about buying cheap rims and hubs off the internet and putting them into complete wheels and then selling them for a small profit     what do you think about this idea would it be viable obviously im not expecting anything big just some spare bucks
margins in the bicycle industry are smallif you are just looking for some spare money and have the tools then yes its not a bad side gig specializing in repair on the side can net you some extra money if you are in the right market    where i live its not a profitable endeavor the market demographic is mostly rich money conscience boomers or diy types the one full service bike shop here has the monopoly on the freds    not trying to discourage you just be aware its not going to be a get rich quick kind of thing bicycles are a low growth industry with a low market cap    bicycle mechanic trying to leave the industry for greener pastures
building wheels is very time consuming so your small profit divided across the time to build the wheel would be very small indeed     from lacing to truing i probably spent 4 hours on the first wheel i built my most recent was much faster but still took a while in order to save time on the truing part you need to count turns of the nipples as you are installing them a nipple driver makes this part easier    unless you are really good at it it is unlikely you will be able to sell higher priced wheels and for cheap wheels it is unlikely youll be able to beat the price of a mechanically built wheel    spokes are one of the things that screw you when building up wheels the length required varies with hub and rim selection lacing pattern drive / nondrive side and you only have a few mm of thread leeway on the nipples between it not engaging or running out of thread spokes quickly add to the cost too i dont think the same kind of deep discounts are available on them that you find on other components online
  yeah sadly people with money to spend on custom wheelsets arent going to be cruising around on craigslist for some random individual who claims to be able to build wheels out of his apartment even if theyre very skilled and competent theyre going to go to an established brickandmortar shop at the very least theyll go to some wellestablished company on the internet that has hundreds or thousands of positive reviews from past customers      op based on what i said above you might do better starting out providing an alternative bike repair service that undercuts shops local to you thatll get people in the door and the ones who might be interested in custom wheelsets once they see youre a real person and competent working on bikes might be willing to trust you to build wheels for them    heres another possible market for building wheelsets bike racers who need a powertap wheel powertap if youre not familiar with it is a rear hubbased ant power meter they sell it as a whole wheel but they mostly sell it as just the hub some racers would like a higherend rim for their powertap someone who has the money for a powertap is also going to have money for a custom wheel build just a thought
not op but any recommendations on decent truing stands for beginners also what was the name of that wheel building bible
  truing stands are expensive i bought mine used from a shop that didnt need a third or fourth extra besides the point i got a park tools brand for like 150 that needs a new base plate if you are going to get into wheel repair look into wheel fanatyks webpage or blog that guy has lots of useful info in wheel building in general
  you could do something like i did when i wanted to do some fat bike wheel truing use a dial indicator with a gauge holder and leave the wheel in the frame    in this case i use a clamp i had to hold a piece of square tubing and removed the gauge holder arm from its base and held it to the tube with a nut the clamp conveniently would thread into one side of a qr skewer but you could also find some other way to mount the gauge holder arm    the 2 bar style gauge holders are more rigid than single knob type in the pic which subsequently broke and cheaper    i always true with a dial indicator when truing much quicker and easier on the eyes

are buses ever preferable to streetcars
not really having a more defined set of stops makes it easier to read while traveling you dont have to be so paranoid about looking out of the window thus time on the bus is often wasted making sure you havent missed your stop yet while time on a tracked vehicle can be spent doing productive useful things
i dont know how often it actually comes up in city planning but rerouting or diversions are expensive or impossible respectively with trams and if you want buses to have priority for better speed and efficiency you can still give them dedicated lanes while using up no more space than a separated tram line does
  tfw city paved over our streetcar lines in the 50s because no one was using them  tfw demand for public transit skyrocketed not a decade later  replaced with garbage buses  just
  i was in chicago yesterday took over an hour to get to the airport from downtown due to traffic
  this could have been us
yes if they have to be in mixed traffic    a bus could go by this easily    there is no point in building a new streetcar system that will be almost entirely in mixed traffic
  there are 3 light rail projects going in australia at the moment and all of them are disasters
  this one in sydney   is a year overdue   200 million overspent   contractor currently suing the government for 1 billion dollars  caused numerous blackouts and burst water mains  resulted in economic ruin for tonnes of stores in the city 
  the big problem of mixed traffic in my hellhole isnt that cars collide with trams or themselves assorted trucks and other vehicles with cranes on routinely forget to lower them and tear the wires down this happened once a week at first now its only every other month
  be city  call for bids on construction projects with absolutely unrealistic conditions and time limits  pick the cheapest bastard you can find for the contracting  wonder why things keep being delayed and being over budget
    depends
  buses are for rural areas trolleybuses might be an acceptable alternative in some urban and suburban areas
  yes if one or several of the following conditions are fulfilled   low demand  steep road gradients   temporal rerouting/replacement of tram/train line   need for neighborhood service with short circular routes and short stop distance
  steep road gradients  take note flatlanders  you dont know how good you have it
  wtf your bus systems bus stop stop replacement and passenger information sounds bad thats it   to compensate sing a gps or checking the map with alerts doesnt waste attention or time   point cities using the stop buttonand hailandride system  also thats not inherent to buses you will get brtesque station arguments       its still somewhat paradoxical in developing cities installing the rails or setting up busways/brts will anchor development along the corridor chicken or egg        steep road gradients   inb4 rubbertyred tram meme
   bus stop stop reporting and passenger information        streetcar   i dont really like this word desu     to add on the mixed traffic point if you city has very modern rapidtype road infrastructure eg at least main avenues and ukmeaning dual carriageways use it express bus is nice   if your bus network is very branched reflecting relatively disperseddevelopment i dont mean low densuty a bus infrastructure corridor will allow all ordinary city buses to use it reducing transfers     some more scenarios     its possible for trams to handle shorterdistance local service and buses to provide longerdistance express services if only rapid bus is possible it will have more to do with the stop spacing of the light rail service     a niche example if only a legacy tram fleet can be used you may have to retain local buses to provide lowfloor service or more capacity for short trips
  100 million for a fucking right turn  you bloody fucking wot m8  im in the wrong industry
im partial to either system as long as they get dedicated and protected lanes if you run either in mixed traffic with minimal enforcement/protection you shouldnt bother at all in my city bus ridership is declining because the city doesnt care to run them efficiently its literally faster to walk then many buses which get stuck behind traffic that illegally uses bus lanes
  are buses ever preferable to  no
  are buses ever preferable to streetcars  in some conditions especially when frequency is low
  outside city centre and urban area    buses traveling around suburban neighbourhoods to/from commuter railway stations between stations between lines    coach buses in rural areas

  i dont understand why you would ever use streetcars
  they make sense if you have rails and canetary or large number of potential pax   trams are more efficient since trams can have less aerodynamic drag and less rolling resistance also electricity allows to give electricity back into the grid 20 or even more while in bus kinetic energy becomes heat   buses are preferable it you cant fill the street car and if there is no rails and shit
    are buses ever preferable to streetcars    yes when you want to provide the exact same service for a fifth of the cost
  also electricity allows to give electricity back into the grid 20 or even more while in bus kinetic energy becomes heat   there are electric buses and even diesel trams
  i guess if the rails are separate from road traffic it would be better than buses but then a light rail would have bigger capacity    pictured is catenaryless tram in taiwan pretty neat stuff
  that absolutely doesnt change anything
  buses are slower but much more flexible  trams are faster if they have systematic priority and trigger traffic lights to let them pass but much less flexible a combination of both is preferable
streetcars are fine if you have a lot of dedicated space for the tracks if youre just going to put cars and trams on the same lanes its not much worth it its why my city wont get them theyd rather put a few bus only lanes across the city and it gets the job done
  need a big if for the bus part too    a combination of both is preferable   this very much         also electricity allows to give electricity back into the grid 20 or even more while in bus kinetic energy becomes heat    at least it changes this sentence with hybrid buses if you prefer
literally the only thing trams are good for is development because hipsters and richfags are allergic to buses in terms of sheer operation if you give a bus a dedicated row itll be much better than a tram for reasons already described
  exact same service  how many urban bus services do 60/70mph as soon as they leave the city centre
  electric buses  they are heavy this will cause greater rolling resistance thus greater power consumption regen wont help much    what is the difference between lrt and tram   pictured is catenaryless tram in taiwan pretty neat stuff  canetaryless is a meme it is harder to service and potentially dangerous if power is supplied from ground driving rail transport on battery is a meme as well     at least it changes this sentence with hybrid buses if you prefer  this will work quite good considering that proper hybrid transmission meme is much more efficient than any automatic   but i dont see much hybrid buses
  pictured is a lrt malaysia runs elevated or separate from road traffic is something like a metro but doesnt have the capacity and speed of a metro trams are usually those up to three units sharing roads with traffic low capacity i guess by definition the taiwan tram is a form of lrt  batterypowered transport is a meme  why though
  the sydney one is at least arguably a disaster but not the others    adelaide doesnt need that right turn anyway the liberals in opposition tried to gain political milage from the governments cancellation of it now theyre in government its come back to bite them as they know its not worth doing    adelaides made some big mistakes the chief one being buying 24m wide trams which were selling cheap in europe at the time instead of 265m wide which has since become the australian standard but its hardly a disaster
    two thirds of the cost would be for modifying or replacing the trams to avoid the risk of derailment    however i have not been able to find the report the government commissioned so i dont think theyve published it it wouldnt surprise me at all if this were all a political fix to avoid spending the money its not worth spending tens of millions on it or even one million at least until we get some more tramways but they probably want to inflate the cost as much as possible to justify breaking their election promise
  libs breaking an election promise who could have seen that coming after the whole noncore promises debacle its a shame the lnp knows they can get away with promising everything and anything and not actually delivering a single thing
   what is the difference between lrt and tram   every time theres going to be a terminology time cant we all focus on the features   light rail lrt common name for lrt  light rail vs intermediate/medium capacity systems heavy rail lower capacity railway   lrt mostly exclusive rightofway and dedicated tracks some streetrunning possible more traffic signal priority less atgrade crossings note the heavier mainline rail has absolute traffic priority and fully segregated rightofway   tram mostly streetrunning on grooved rails less signal priority less exclusive rightofway mostly atgrade crossings   streetcar almost all streetrunning on grooved rails in mixed traffic sharing the lane all atgrade crossings      lrt is something like a metro   no thats a light metro of its own or light rapid transit    trams are usually those up to three units sharing roads with traffic   have you seen how long articulated trams can be   mixed traffic is a feature of the common definition of streetcar less so for trams modernly     to clear up   rapid transit fully gradeseparated high frequency equating it with metro causes definition issues to illustrate this example metro is an urbansuburban heavy rail rapid transit for comparison a people mover is usually an urbanonly railbased light rapid transit   we can have such a discussion for buses as well stupid transit brandings confuses discourses and waste everyones time like what ridesharing and brt did to roadbased transit
  theres no lnp in sa the nationals have no formal coalition with the liberals and have previously been in an impromptu coalition with labor
  tram mostly streetrunning on grooved rails less signal priority less exclusive rightofway mostly atgrade crossings  streetcar almost all streetrunning on grooved rails in mixed traffic sharing the lane all atgrade crossings  this is the first time im hearing someone use those words as two distinct terms as far as i know streetcar is more commonly used in the us and tram is more commonly used in the uk but both terms refer to the same thing
  i am talking about the modern connotation they are similar enough and can be treated as language differences   in the us what i see its either a good lrt or bad streetcar really need to make the middle ground better and learn from european systems
  in terms of lifetime costs streetcarsbusesmetro    in terms of convenience busesmetrostreetcars    in terms of speed metrostreetcarsbuses    so depends on what you need if you want to remove cars from the city center to clean up the air you can then use the freed up streets for an effective streetcar service since setting up electric trolley buses means you have to lay out ugly catenaries
   you can obviously distinguish between legacy and modern streetcar but so far us streetcar practices realized arent as good as european trams until then imagewise streetcar isnt going to be as good as tram subtle yet i feel this situation need to improve first
  runs elevated or separate from road traffic  good tram systems run on designated part of road as well   rams are usually those up to three units  technically it is unlimited i have seen 5 modernized tatras t3 being transported in one emu to other depot   why though  additional weight introduces more rolling resistance and unnecessary brake and rail wear  id understand this on bus but on tram it is just a meme since it doesnt travel outside rails except russia it would add up to cost compare gigawatthours of liion batteries to some shy nkm of 100 mm2 copper or even aluminium in lowtraffic areas cable and couple transformers     still i cant tell the difference   i think it is easier to differentiate by voltage supplied and weight  tram is 550750 vdc under 15 tons/meter  metro is 5501500v under 2 tons/meter  train is 150025000v under 25 tons/meter
   still i cant tell the difference  bet i can write a book on transit taxonomy    metro is 5501500v   delhi metro got the funny 25kv ac and we have tramtrains compatible with both the mainline and tramway system   theres a multitude of ways to classify them whats important is the features not randomly giving retarded lrt and brt names to systems where it doesnt make sense not even transit agencies may brand their services properly
  dheli then has interurban train under ground  weight per meter is more important then since diesel trains exist
  tram is 550750 vdc under 15 tons/meter  metro is 5501500v under 2 tons/meter  train is 150025000v under 25 tons/meter  now thats a stupid fucking idea if ive ever heard one   the truth is every system out there in the world is a hybrid of several of our prototype definitions it makes more sense to use terminology that fits the context and aptly describes the system at hand
london underground experience  recently went on a trip to london and frequently used the underground you americans probably think its insanely cool but i can tell you that it was cramped im 6ft 3 inches tall hot and crowded and i got haggled by a cocaine user outside victoria station to donate cash that was being held on family at the shop
  and i got haggled by a cocaine user outside victoria station to donate cash that was being held on family at the shop  what
  its a country known for its lack of air conditioning what did you expect anyways  its a tiny crowded train deep underground its not and shouldnt be considered a tourist attraction
  is it even an attraction anymore also i think a few lines will be getting aircon around 2030 this is why i cycle to work
  sub surface lines central/district etc already have aircon each deep level line has its own plan for force air circulation
    last thing i heard deep level lines wouldnt get ac because the tunnels have poor ventilation and the ac would just heat up tunnels what are the plans for improving ventilation
  no clue they claim theyll get ac into the deep level trains somehow in the near future sometime in the 20s  even though its less than a decade trying to comprehend how theyll do it is like a medieval peasant trying to comprehend electricity its all sorcery to me
  i was there in october first time  it was freaking hot inside there were not so much place for standing passengers between opposite seats i wonder how brit bongs tolerate each other in morning traffic on that tubes
  proper ventac  i know this from moscow
  bullshit that only works in a city where its winter for 9 months of the year and the stations are literal marble palaces
  are literal marble palaces  it doesnt matter also we have a lot of tiled boring stations   ventilation stops working being comfortable when it is hotter than 25 deg c outside london has quite similar summer temps sure it is not that cold there in winter but still    ac only heats up the tunnels it doesnt create needful oxygen it doesnt vent not needful carbon dioxide with smell of homeless
  it doesnt matter  yes it fucking matters because a the stations are huge so heat can easily dissipate upwards before escaping to the outside making it more comfortable for people and evacuating heat from the trains easily and b marble absorbs heat so its a natural way of cooling just like old wine cellars and the like in the south of europe which keep cool even when its hot as hell outside    ac only heats up the tunnels  you forgot the part where it keeps the trains nice and cool and the trains are usually the part of the metro which are most packed with people    it doesnt vent not needful carbon dioxide with smell of homeless  most ac systems work as an air filter so it does filter out a lot of pollutants and bad smell    tldr youre wrong
london tube is great  how the fuck can you not tolerate a literal few minutes of discomfort  fuck fatasses i swear  pampered faggots
  a the stations are huge so heat can easily dissipate upwards before escaping to the outside   it doesnt matter since they are crowded  and b marble absorbs heat so its a natural way of cooling just like old wine cellars and the like in the south of europe which keep cool even when its hot as hell outside  so does the ceramic tile  you forgot the part where it keeps the trains nice and cool and the trains are usually the part of the metro which are most packed with people  you need quite decent size ac setup moscow definitely doesnt have decent power ac since it is cool only when there are not much people in the train when train is filled with people ac cant keep up with heat generated by people ventilation will went full train quite easily   in london you dont have much place for ac so power is limited thus it will be even worse  in barcelona you have pantograph and rail on ceiling thus you can put decent capacity ac and keep train cool inside and it works quite good  most ac systems work as an air filter so it does filter out a lot of pollutants and bad smell  filters in all ac systems are just some plastic mesh to stop big particles of dust flying it doesnt filter anything  also it produces moisture and mold might grow on evaporator fins if not cleaned regularly  it doesnt vent co2 and doesnt allow much fresh air in    a/c is good when temps are higher than 25 degc when temps are below  open fucking windows
  it doesnt matter since they are crowded  yes it matters because theres actually space above the people for the heat to escape to  so does the ceramic tile  not to the same extent  you need quite decent size ac setup moscow definitely doesnt have decent power ac since it is cool only when there are not much people in the train when train is filled with people ac cant keep up with heat generated by people ventilation will went full train quite easily   aight but thats a specific problem of underpowered ac units  in london you dont have much place for ac so power is limited thus it will be even worse  in barcelona you have pantograph and rail on ceiling thus you can put decent capacity ac and keep train cool inside and it works quite good  i dont think it has much to do with space for the ac units but with them being powerful enough and the expense of that fyi in barcelona the ac is below the trains not on top theres little space on top bc of the clearance to the overhead rail on top are only the resistances which burn away excess energy when breaking and so on  filters in all ac systems are just some plastic mesh to stop big particles of dust flying it doesnt filter anything  also it produces moisture and mold might grow on evaporator fins if not cleaned regularly  again all about maintenance nothing to do with the idea in itself  it doesnt vent co2 and doesnt allow much fresh air in  usually the ac units take outside air and blow it into the train but filtered nothing amazing but still better than the air from the tunnel  a/c is good when temps are higher than 25 degc when temps are below  open fucking windows  one thing you didnt mention was the noise from opening windows in a fucking tunnel i remember the moscow metro being unbearably loud that shit makes you deaf just for the reduced noise i prefer ac and nonopening windows but i get your point about low temperatures making it unnecessary
  yes it matters because theres actually space above the people for the heat to escape to  yes this is why vent is more important in london  i dont think it has much to do with space for the ac units but with them being powerful enough and the expense of that  installing powerfull compressor is easy designing condenser and evaporator that will be able to cool the cabin is difficult   fyi in barcelona the ac is below the trains not on top  nope you can clearly see resistors 6 thicc cables going into box and you can clearly see ac   furthermore exactly in this spot there is an intake for ac in cabin   theres little space on top bc of the clearance to the overhead rail on top are only the resistances which burn away excess energy when breaking and so on  there is more space including 15kv clearances than in moscow subway  usually the ac units take outside air and blow it into the train but filtered nothing amazing but still better than the air from the tunnel  no all acs on train and buses circulate cabin air and allow only 1530 of fresh air otherwise they wont be able too cool it  i remember the moscow metro being unbearably loud   it is brushed motors combined with worn out gears  newer trains with 3phase motors are quieter even with opened windows just because they dont have couplings and brushes and gears arent that worn  only noise you can hear is inverter making autistic sounds on even newer they finally realized that igbts can work on 20 khz without any problems thus it is even quieter
  just to expand on the problem with ac for the deeplevel tube lines is that the tunnels have been heating up the earth around them continuously for the last hundred years without proper ventilation excess heat from ac simply doesnt have anywhere to go and will only exacerbate the problem
  forgot link related  
  this for proper ac action you have to redesign tunnels and shit  moscow didnt  it became worse
  i agree to a certain extent its quite cramped due to the small as fuck loading gauge but you generally dont ride the tube for more than a few minutes so i dont mind it that much the network is reasonably good so you can get from one place to another quite quickly
    this is why i doubt tfls claim that theyre just going to magically introduce a/c to the deep level lines  if they could do so they would have done so considering how abhorrent the conditions are during the summer
  england doesnt even get hot your heatwaves are a standard continental summer day in july or august ive ridden the tube in the summer and the only discomfort i experienced was from crowding
  tfl are not claiming to introduce a/c but forced air cooling its not the same thing
  everything is relative fucker i went to hong kong in february it was 18c and everyone was wearing scarves and beanies anyway its not about temperature alone and you know it humidity and oxygen levels also play into comfort levels
  okay why dont you come to my city where it gets to 30 high humidity every year and entire metro is deep tunnels with no ac on the platforms or the trains and complain this is in a city where it gets to 30 in the winter as well stop being a massive pussy and suck it up the worst heatwave the uk has ever experienced is a normal summer day here
  implying i live in the uk  implying your shitstain country is as developed or as rich as the uk    lol not their fault your people were forced out to live in some shitawful climate m80boi
  canada is richer than the pook
yes im back and i will back up my point about it being hot i live in cornwall which often hits 30 degrees 90 for you amerifags and consistently achieves about 20 during september so for me calling it bloody hot means its bloody hot
  well you see i went with family and didnt carry cash on me or my credit card and the 1 holding the money goes to a nearby shop im waiting outside victoria station to hop on a train suddenly this crazy woman who had black teeth and reeked of cocaine rocks up at warp 9 and puts a poppy in my pocket kind of a big thing because britain and ww1 and that crap and immediately demands money quick argument happens and she leaves us alone eventually then find out that there was a shop at the station
  this still doesnt make sense what has the ship got to do with it lrn2english
i was generally pleased with the underground 3 weeks ago off peak we never had problems regarding space or air quality on peak times the frequency of the trains was enough to not generate too much of waiting time before getting a car you could still comfortably fit into
  implying that 30c with maritime winds moderating the heat index isnt better than 30c in the middle of a continent    lrn2saskatchewan nancy boy
actually paying 5 a day to cram yourself inside a hot delayed sweaty cage full of perverts    top lel
nyc has a similar issue with a/c once the trains got it the exhaust from them dramatically heats up the stations theres some busy stations with express lines so more trains where the station reached 97 degrees last summer
the tube may have its flaws but its one of the best tube networks in the western world its not as crowded as people expect and is usualy quite clean and its loads faster than the bus or car
you americans haw haw    o nose it was too cramped     a person asked me to donate money he must have been gasp a drug user the horror    go back to your turnip farm bumpkin
  do you use london tube every day to commute to work if not then you dont know what you are talking about its a miracle its still running because its so shit if it rains or if its bit colder than usual expect delays the more you use it the more youll see delay after delay after delay they do the bare minimum to keep it running whole system is outdated and should be demolished but this would take decades so what they do is to just improve it bit by bit slowly when they get one part finished it is already obsolete in some way     if you want something well running look into japan
  the people who work at the stations dont even know how to do their jobs i asked about some refund and first went to information center from there the black lady was first ignoring me for quite a while and finally when i had a chat with her i saw she didnt have any idea what she was doing she pointed out that i should go to another still which was some tourist information im not a tourist after waiting for 15 minutes in line the woman there told me that i should call this phone number instead i told her that you suck and left i then had another talk with the staff standing next to the gates and got my stuff sorted out    generally people working there are lazy walk slowly and do not even care about their job but i cant blame them because this seems to be the general mentality concerning whole london people dont give a shit about other people or about the job they are doing

sup guys about to start as a conductor with bnsf soon just wanted to see if anyone has any general tips or insights or what have you for a fairly green rookie     if anyone can answer specifically as to the ease or difficulty of transferring from state to state since i do hope to move sometime in the future
  ask your coworkers not me i fucking hate these threads    t railroader
  okay
it depends on where you got hired on  you can transfer from former bn territory to sf territory but you lose any seniority and theres some other shit youve got to deal with
  dont you mean former gn territory i hired in on the bn side and moved to/from the atsf side without problems but i couldnt go to minneapolis or places in the pnw without resetting seniority
  maybe i was in the twin cities division and was told id lose seniority if i went to sf  that was a while ago though
youll be a student long enough to get you through the winter furlough season    then next winter youll move around chasing what ever board you can hold then furloughed     i hope you didnt take a hiring bonus you have to pay it all back if you dont last several years     youre going to be working in the yard mostly for few years
  complaining about working in a yard  i guess its different being under an hourly agreement but making 715 to come out and pull pins as a brakeman on a remote job by combining holiday and ot is way better than being on the road
  spend a winter in a wyoming rail yard on an extraboard that doesnt pay shit for guarantee no real whole day off ever you always have to fill in on the shit jobs in the middle of the night or service an industry plus the managers are lazy and use yard crews to fulfill their daily tests and observations    4 more years till i can safely be on the short pullpool extraboard working the one local and road trains 9 years till long pullpool conductor board 1300 a round trip and 7 round trips a month 12 hours one way 10 to 16 hours at the lofe 12 hours back then a couple days until the next trip only have to worry about pick ups and set outs at one end
  how much has shit changed in 4 years  back then i marked into and kept a brakeman job on a local while everyone on the conductor extra board was getting called to work as soon as their rest was up
  tfw guaranteed extraboard with rest days you bid on  
  its still like that in some places and boards    brakemen are only on locals around here you need a fair amount of seniority to hold that brakeman slot on a specific local lower seniority means your going to a local with more work     when im on the road as a conductor its usually 14 to 26 hours between trains at either end
ive got an interview with a local shortline for conductor but i got an owi a few years ago  its been expunged from my record but am i fucked anyway
  nah railroaders lay off for being drunk or stoned a lot you can get popped for being intoxicated at work and get paid to attend rehab
  its been expunged from my record  dont mention it and hope it doesnt come up on your cbc
    welp im off to the interview tomorrow  wish me luck
continued from     old thread hit image limit so post your airports thread 13 starting with hkg
another hkg because fav airport im sad that im flying to lhr via dxb this week instead
kbp ukbb kyiv borispil airport from 2014    probably one of the most improved airports ive ever been to in recent years
another image of kbp from the apron    as the hub for ukrainian international airlines theyre naturally the ones who have the largest presence that said turkish ba lufthansa air france and a few more all fly to kbp
anybody have some stl ones
this is the airport back where i grew up enov/hov  only commercial traffic is wideroe flying dash 8100s or q200s comfy little trip whenever i go back to visit my parents
  theres some pretty spectacular terrain around so there are some quite interesting approaches especially if the weather isnt optimal
    cute
dub eidw  my nearest international airport    heres a germanwings a319 an air canada rouge b767 and a ryanair b737 all in the same shot
  dub is the best airport in the country but i have a weird nostalgia for noc because as a child i would always land there on really rainy afternoons and it just felt super comfy and chill whereas dub obviously has a lot more stuff happening in it its a shame the govt seems hellbent on killing noc despite its constantly increasing traffic
  dub is the best airport on the island dub is pretty much the go to airport for anything long haul if youre from northern ireland    my picture was my own taken back in december 2016 i was actually flying on the germanwings flight to cologne bonn airport cgn eddk    instead we have belfast city bhd egac and belfast international bfs egaa both airports are nice but nothing really exciting flies out of either airport    bhd has lots of flybe dash 8s along with the a320 family aircraft of british airways and aer lingus plus theres the embraer e jets from flybe and klm    bfs is a hub for ryanair b737 and easyjet a319 flights norwegian air shuttle is now doing transatlantic flights in b737s though holiday airlines like thomas cook and thompson are using their a320s and b737s respectively virgin atlantic is running a new summer route from bfs to mco kmco orlando international airport using b747s and a330s united airlines used to fly b757s from bfs to newark international ewr kewr    still could be worse we could have no flights to anywhere
  ive been to bfs a few times as my familys mainly in donegal and ldy is a hole and its okay but yeah nothing interesting the rural airports are so pretty  cfns runway was voted second most scenic in the world but it only serves dub and gla and soon only gla so ive never had an opportunity to see it
    i cant wait till next january ill be flying to hkg via yvr not sure on the return yet but hoping for bos
  the view from the gates is truly incredible along with the view from the air of course the dragonflies mountains cable cars  its so peaceful i cant find my other photos but i know i have a stash of them somewhere because i usually land around the late afternoon when its all hazy and dreamy and really photogenic enjoy your trip
  nice was going to post this genuinely beautiful airport to fly into if you have a clear day if you get standard gweedore weather you are in for a wild ride though and there is no precision approach to the runway either only an ndb and a dme/localiser on one runway only pilots definitely earn their keep flying into cfn    its on my bucket list to land a plane there myself one day
        i too love hkg and especially cxs old livery
tpa   they just opened the new rental car facility i think theyre going to construct a new concourse next
  i just found out i cant take photos of the airport when im at dxb tomorrow so im just posting an old pic of it from the 70s instead
  why not
  its illegal and i could receive several months in prison for it also illegal to take photos of planes or take any photos including a person who did not give permission to be photographed even if its like the back of their head in the distance so basically no photos tomorrow
  based uae    dont forget not to talk about qatar while youre there
  im going to spend my entire layover thinking dont mention qatar dont mention qatar so if anyone tries to talk to me ill probably just blurt out qatar and flee
  wow im going to avoid flying through dxb then

an airport has no business having a restaurant this good atl
  why dont more airports in america have those glass jetways
  one flew south i live in atl but still havent tried it
  yessir its legitimately better than most restaurants in my flyover city      there are two reasons i can think of off the top of my head one the airport was completed in 2015 so most older airports probably cant justify the cost of replacing their jetways although they are fucking snazzy two its probably a nightmare keeping the thing cool the jetways at ict need 2 large a/c units to keep them cool
  or warm in the winter for that matter even so i suspect that many airports in the us especially major ones will slowly adopt them as their old jetways reach end of life will probably start on international terminals first
anyone got any pictures of stl lambert
  redbellies used to be my favorite next to the aa silverbirds as a kid  theyre both being replaced  sad at least southwests new livery is still pretty good unlike american
  its fantastic the cocktails are super inventive and the bartender is friendly youll pay like 15 for one but do it anyways this is their one night in oaxaca its mezcal tequila vermouth and orange bitters goes great with their potato leek soup
dab why there is a random rocking chair here at the terminal is beyond me
  dumbfuck a321 with a dead battery gotta drive one up from mco rip my schedule
  i love the a321 enhanced its such a nice plane to fly on and the high capacity for a single aisle is fantastic plus the enhanced has got the sharklets which make the a320 family look really aesthetic  id love to see some a320neo aircraft though the combination of those massive engines with the looks of the enhanced make the a320 a wonderful aircraft to see
  true it is a great aircraft pleasantly surprised that it replaced whatever crj they used to run this route with much quieter and larger than what i usually get to fly
when your airport is so large it has bad neighbirhoods

  wheres the roof

  what ba are planning to do makes ryanair look spacious

txl
  i was there in 2016 great airport
  so much better than the other joke of an airport  well both of them ber and sxf  in the south 
  ive flown through sxf about 5 times and txl once  sxf has the benefit of having a regionalbahn and sbahn station while txl is just a nicer airport to fly though  honestly i think ber could be a fantastic airport to use since its brand new and has both a long distance rail station and an sbahn station as well as a freight rail station to allow for air freight and jet fuel to be transported  however fire safety regulations are constantly holding ber back that and the fact that only one runway is legally allowed to be used for sxf the other runway cannot be used for sxf due to noise abatement i lived for a 9 months in a village under the approach for sxf and i can tell you that if ber were to come close to opening the residents would sue the fuck out of ber one runway is already loud for residents two runways with simultaneous landings would be near hell especially in the summer since most people dont have air conditioning there and just open windows

i fly in and out of hargeisa hga picture quite a lot for work mostly two dubai or mogadishu    as a traveller seasoned in third world airports hargeisa without a doubt is the worst of them all few other places are so bad they make mogadishu look like europe    best part is the complete lack of security between air and land side as long as you are white and/or know the guards you dont even have to bribe    also on arrival your checked luggage will always be xrayed for bottles alcohol is illegal and there is no way you can bribe your way through this what you can do however is to go to the airport police station the next day and buy back your duty free vodka
  lcg summer 2017  i fly to here from mia via mad
mad december 2017    mad has been my preferred airport in europe for connections for the past 20 years
mxp quite a nice airport old and dated but still feels roomy
zrh
  best thing about hga is the minefields surrounding it overshoot your landing and you will explode    few other capital city international airports have that feature
  yeah airports work great when they get more funding than one with more passengers bcn just because theyre in the capital of the realm and even better when you use government regulation to make direct flights unfeasible and force everyone coming from the airport with the most passengers to change over at the capital of the realms glorious airport  i hate mad with a passion and i hate you for liking it cunt
  yeah airports work great when they get more funding than one with more passengers bcn just because theyre in the capital of the realm  so youre barcelona anon and you are one of the viva independencía people no
  so if you think its bad that a country wastes its resources to stint the growth of places that have potential to favour others that dont that makes you a separatist i thought that makes you a good citizen you must be one of those arriba españa una grande y libre people no
  theres more international business in madrid thats why its the focus
    also madrid had 6 million more people pass through it last year
  do you have to go through security again when you get to another airport seems like a huge flaw in the worldwide security system
  comforting thought if you are in a bad weather landing approaching minimums 
needs a little bump

  you clearly havent memorized the weather patterns of hargeisa apart from bullets and bombs it doesnt rain more than a few times a year
  you dont you fly straight into dubai terminal 3
/n/ has got a little busy  what happened 
enjoy some ground level glasswalled jetways at the new sbp terminal
  those look so out of place connecting to ground level i dont like it
  looks very odd for sure
  i was there in 2016 great airport    do the jetways go high enough for taller aircraft like the a320 i can imagine those jetways were designed to work with the 737 dash8 crj ejet or other regional airliners just looks like the a320 or cseries is incompatible thanks to their height
  that airport doesnt have 737 a320 or c series service its all crjs and e175s
lex hardly gets much large traffic its unbelievably expensive to fly out of since its mostly a tourist airport and mostly a luxury to fly out locally for most    however sometimes we get the uae vice president flying in who has some land here    this shot is from the private section of the airport

  theres one for lax except its not livestream but some guy simulates lax traffic and matches it with liveatc
  cant think of one that looks at a runway sfo has a couple up showing the construction of the new terminal 1
  lanzarote airport in the canary islands decently busy but sees mostly narrowbodies and props occasionally 767s/a330s the cam is good and has sound and overlooks the runway and taxiway towards the ocean

  still dont really get why lufthansa hasnt replaced them faster with a350s or 787s
    heathrow airport
heres some phl for this 4th of july
phl from the air
  those are some loooooong jetbridges
  a340600 is a fantastic plane to fly on especially with lufthansa    love walking downstairs to go to the bathroom
  unless you are in economy class they can be a bit on the tight side  lh use them on some very long haul routes out of mainly muc so not the most comfy in the dusty end
bump i think
  lufthansa is moving a340s to frankfurt and having the a350 take over their spot in munich
an older pic i like of stl back during the twa days now the airport is mostly dead since american left it around 2012
  thats a good start  even better would be if the old birds were removed from the fleet

im on a f100 on sunday 
  stl has 225 million more passengers per year now than in 2012 far below its 2000 peak of 30 million but it cant be described as dead since 2012
  sit as far upfront as you can its one of the quietest planes i ever flown
still one of my favourite planes to fly on 
  i guess im just going there at the wrong times then how much is it on average this year
  twas bankruptcy was a mistake
  wasnt it all a ploy for aa to buy a load of new 757s
  pretty much they could have recovered but poor management and aa putting a ton of pressure on them kind of got to them and it technically should have violated trust laws but thats not exactly clear

  there is an alternate timeline where twa survived and still uses 747s on long haul flights  we got this one instead  we live in the worst fucking timeline
seatac here
  i know there have been several airline brand revivals that have failed frontier being the only real exception but i still think that if one of these old brands pan am twa etc came back as an international longhaulonly airline with a modern efficient fleet that it could succeed theyre talking about bringing back world airways using this sort of model interested to see how it plays out
  i really do hope someone buys the rights to twa and does something with it they were great all the way to the end i also hope that plan involves them buying 747s but beggers cant be choosers
  eastern is apparently getting a 3rd try gonna be interesting to see how that goes

  back to airports then 
  fun fact i prematurely killed off one of the earlier airport threads a few years back when someone flooded out all the bike threads an eye for an eye the cagers have been quiet lately so there has been no need for that    ive also posted dozens of my own images in the airport threads over the years so its not like i have anything against airplanes

which euro country has the best train system pic related schweiz   inb4 its so small so its easier   irish and portuguese fags are small too
probably switzerland
poland has been improving
switzerland even tiny villages in the mountains have frequent commuter service to cities
  french here my vote goes to switzerland
switzerland has pretty damn sure the best system in many aspects like frequency punctuality density comfort ticketing system and so on however in one thing it is definitely not the best and that is the prices as the whole country also the train services are expensive as hell
  france nothing in europe beats the tgv
1 switzerland  2 netherlands      when it comes to hsr sure but a train system is far more than just hsr
  1 switzerland  2 switzerland  3 switzerland    not only are they one of the few nonburger countries to get freight trains right they also get passenger trains right theres practically zero other developed countries that do both well  its either/or
    who in gods name is saying that ireland has the best train system even if the rail network is small its still shite     ive inter railed around all of the eu member states id say for high speed it probably is the french that get it for me especially with the their connection to the uk however in general terms i found spain to be the best believe it or not germany is meme tier and switzerland was fine
    well they kind of have to get it right dont they other than air freight theyd have fuck all ways to import goods into their country that isnt selfsustainable no sea access and an awful national road system if they didnt have rail theyd be screwed
  russia  hsr  check  retro emu  check
price must be considered in the question of course a expensive system like danish or switz will be better but taking everything in consideration i stay with the french system cheap tons of trains lot of high speed trains big ass train stations for the times ive been in europe travelling as a mothafucka they worked best than other trains swizz dutch denmark sweden trains are great but fuck my wallet
  1 switzerland  2 germany  3 netherlands
  10/10 joke
    spain is seriously underrated i guess most people just make the whole south europe  lazy and inefficient correlation but the train system there is among the best ive experienced
  thier conventional rail system is supposed to be horrible tho
    ive lived most of my life in either the uk or greece so for me even their conventional rail system felt like japan tier 2bh
1 switzerland  2 austria the far better germany  3 netherlands
  austria    you know that or you think that austria is imho the worst out of the german countries in terms of trains
  price must be considered in the question of course a expensive system like danish or switz will be better  the uk has the most expensive trains and their train system is mediocre on a good day and shocking on a bad one
    i know that it beats germany in every aspect from state of the rolling stock price to punctuality and running intervalls just look at the per capita investment
  your reading comprehension is bad
  austria is currently in the state of construction of huge tunnels and new lines however that does not mean anything about the real everyday situation    the density of railway lines is much lower than in germany commuter railways near cities are definitely less developed than in germany or switzerland there are no real hsr lines etc etc
    no shit the population density is also more than twice as high in switzerland and germany    hsr is a meme that says nothing about the overall network quality switzerland has no hsr at all no trains running because its too hot or cold are no headlines in austria but germany exclusively    with regards to commuters austrian cities are much smaller than their german counterparts and still all of the midsized cities innsbruck linz salzburg graz have their own sbahn network cannot say the same about germany a city like ingolstadt would definitely have a sbahn network in austria    so what remains rolling stock is newer and more reliable in austria tickets are cheaper network is newer and denser 170 stations per 1 mio to germanys 81 and expands at a greater pace    there is a reason why the average austrian is traveling 2250 km per year on rail and the average german   1335 km
  the average german also likes driving at between 150160km/h on the autobahn in their audi  its a mentality thing too for the most part trains are just faster than driving especially on some of the more popular routes not hsr per se but rather lzb corridors enabling trains to travel faster than 160 km/h but the average german would probably rather drive the distance from hamburg to berlin because its their car its them in control and its them thats responsible for themselves  take the train and youre riding with other people and the train could be delayed or something out of your control could happen    i also think there might be an eastwest divide when it comes to rail ridership differences i noticed that every single train i saw going from berlin to leipzig was packed full of passengers to the point where the train was full of people standing yet a similar train from berlin to hannover is basically halfempty you notice this too with how east german sbahn systems are overall longer and more packed than their west german counterparts when travellings outside of the city
  because its their car its them in control and its them thats responsible for themselves  unless you enjoy the drive whats the point to save time maybe or you could enjoy a book on the train what about the fuel costs of driving that fast  youre riding with other people  end of the world for cagers i know  and the train could be delayed or something out of your control could happen  i think a cager would make this argument but i also think its a very poor argument because the unexpected delays can happen to them on the highways as well    in the end it just shows that we make decisions based on our feelings more than the facts and cars make people feel better than their reality is until the roads slow to a crawl for drivers at least
  i mean if im honest ive only driven long distances a handful of times and that was out of necessity  i dont own a car although i do have a driving licence i would say that if i was to own a car i would probably get an electric car and just drive it from my house to a park and ride facility or to the supermarket because buses suck  the cost of driving fast is variable it depends a lot on a lot of factors but in general european cars tend to get to about 5060 miles per gallon im not familiar with the metric equivalent of litres per kilometre but some diesel cars with turbo or even superchargers can get up to about 70 or even 80 mpg on a highway at a high speed of 120km/h  but with all of that said the white collar professional in germany doesnt need to concern themselves with the cost of fuel or indeed the cost of the car and insurance the bigger issue in germany is that a large number of companies give their employees company cars and will pay for the fuel costs as expenses while a lot of companies also get bahncard 100s at discount rates from db those companies tend to be in places with low car ownership levels such as berlin or east germany its a much bigger incentive to get people to work for you if you basically pay for and subsidise their car journeys rather than paying for their train journeys  i think the bigger change up will be if/when cars become highly taxed and fuel costs become astronomical i doubt many companies want to move to tesla as its not a german made car and i doubt the german car companies have kept up fully with the trend of electric cars except maybe vw which has the egolf with a large range of about 90 miles and the eup with a range of about 70 miles
  easterners are more pragmatic than westerner while westerners care far more about appearence and prestige look at afd they want to support everything mobility related
  in the end it just shows that we make decisions based on our feelings more than the facts  those feelings are in turn caused in large part by our subjective perception some countries/societies treat driving around in your car like the most normal thing to do and taking the train like something extraordinary for poor people old people etc while in others its like the most normal thing this would also tie in with that eastwest divide in germany where in the east train travel during socialist times was assimilated as more normal while in the west aggressive procar marketing procar state propaganda and procar planning have created a different environment
  the average german also likes driving at between 150160km/h on the autobahn      make that a 160220km/h
    its switzerland
  2 austria the far better germany  far better  yeah no   this certainly helps but austrias rail system has loads of issues  take hsr  there is none the salzburgvienna stretch is close though so thats good enough but what about the rest  im often on salzburggraz and viennagraz and those are just terrible  takes forever to get anywhere in the ennstal there are way too many stops for an intercity and yeah austrians have a weird perspective on what makes a hamlet a city so i give them that but still the three stops selzthal liezen and stainachirdning in 15 minutes are just idiotic especially when in stainach you have a connection to a regional train that ends/starts there so you could easily extend that fucker so that you just have to stop in selztal and people change to that or go there with that 210 minutes more for the 10 people that use this stops but 10 saved for the 100 folks in the train for the long distance  and a lot of it is single track with no indication of that changing  and all of it has narrow curves but theres neither tunnel projects nor a tilting train in sight  and graz vienna  you sit in the railjet the fastest nonemu train there is makes 250kph i think and it crawls over the semering and along the mur and mürz valleys at 50kph though they are now building a tunnel after years and years of delays  and the railjet itself looks absolutely fantastic seriously one of the best looking passenger trains right now but the seats are terrible  but the 50 off vorteilscard is cheap though  now im not saying its bad but it could be so much better
  he said the average german
  take hsr  there is none  jfc get over the hsr meme already hsr is in no way a prerequisite for a good rail system ffs spain has the largest hsr system in europe and overall its rail network is still shite
  hsr is in no way a prerequisite for a good rail system  if you have all the time in the world sure but if you actually wanna go places you need to go fast  for fucks sake even fucking flixbus is faster than the trains in austria

  sbb and dsb are the only operators in their countries  you are quite wrong at least on the sbb count switzerland is full of publicly and privately owned rail operators over 20 in total see  not even the tracks are uniformly owned and operated bls owns 10 of the standard gauge tracks while the rhaetian railways also private run a whole separate narrowgauge network and yet it all works like clockwork  meanwhile spain has one national operator and they dont even manage to set up properly timed transfers    proper railway organization has fuck all to do with whether its one company or twenty generally even private operators are subjected to timetables decided by public administration even in britain iirc it all comes down to do with the political will to impose a proper rail system which wont happen if the government is the automobile lobbys bitch rail service in europe almost never fails because of incompetence it fails because its designed to do so
    there are decent ways to run both railway networks controlled by a single entity and to run networks where many competitors fight with each other    both systems have their advantages and their disadvantages and when a realworld implementation of either goes bellyup its not the concepts mistake but the sheer incompetence of the people at management level
  the brits fucked up their rail system through privatisation
  this but unironically 90s and 00s were the years when more than 25 of polish railways got closed or physically disassembled and the rest wasnt properly maintained also number of passengers started to drop drastically when communism ended and suddenly everyone could afford a used car imported from germany train system was left in ruins but last years we started to fix it all up newag impuls pic related my favorite polish train pesa elf and stadler flirt are slowly replacing the old en57 series neglected railways are being fixed or modernized and every year more people are starting to use trains for longer and shorter travels we even have one hsr line max speed is 200km/h so far but in a few years it should be raised to 230 and more are planned theres a lot of work to do but were catching up    so far the best train system in new eu countries has czech republic regular connections to even the smallest towns cheap tickets comfy trains even if some of them are old motoraks they didnt neglect their train system like poland did theyve been slowly but successfully developing it czech may not have a hsr but their country is relatively small and they dont need it at all though for all europe its basically like this 
what percentage of switzerlands rail network has perfect timed trsansfers i heard it was all public transport in the country but that seems overstated please provide a source
  poland main lines are getting fastly refubrished on what i really like is the modernisation program of the beautiful train stations also lots of new train units    however what i dislike is the organisation of the train transportation which is stuck somewhere in 90s long distance trains capacity is heavily low the demand is much higher than what capacity can offer and we are talking about passangers that for some reason must take the train  taking over the car drivers to ride the trains as western countries are trying to do is basically impossible in poland with current service  ticketing system is awful each region has its own regional operator and each has its own ticketing system not accepting other tickets long distance trains are expensive etc
well its official within the eu it is austria germany pretty much btfo    source 
  germans are never satisfied
  im glad finland is that high up since i actually work for finnish national railway company at least until the end of this year means were doing something right i wouldnt have expected us to be that high given that finnish trains being late for stupid reasons is pretty much a meme in finland
  ireland second  feckin what    iarnród éireann and northern ireland railways are so under equipped with rolling stock that they only have multiple units and the odd pushpull setup if ié or nir have to do any engineering works with heavy trains they have to hire the preservation societys steam locomotives because neither ié nor nir has anything powerful enough to haul ballast trains
  passanger datisfaction index    next time we will ask people how satisfied they are with their size of penis and we will make conclusions about who has the biggest penises based on that
  its bullshit irish railway is basically non existant the same goes to tiny luxembourg i do not know about portugal but i think they are also not really much into railway network as any other nontransit country slovakia has officialy the worst railway system in visegrad4 countries but for some reason the locals are satisfied with that
  why doesnt ireland switch to standard gauge
  luxembourg railways expand far beyond the boundaries of the grand duchy
  predominantly because there is absolutely no reason to switch  the top speed on any irish railway is 100 mph and 90 mph on any northern irish railway    any switch to standard gauge would impact the entire island which means great cost for both ireland and northern ireland theres also a couple of reasons behind the old gauge    irish gauge came about thanks to steeper gradiants requiring a wider wheel base to fit in larger steam cylinders this gave the locomotives the higher tractive effort for the hills irish railways were never built for speed though and this is the main issue behind a lot of the upgrade options  the other reason behind the gauge selection was down to the fact that a number of the old railway companies wanted a broader gauge and this was down to the whole gauge wars thing i think the primary reason behind the selection of irish gauge came down to how there was already a lot of 5 foot 3 inch railway down and much like in britian where they standardised around 4 foot 8 and a half inch railways that was due to how much rail was already down  a number of narrow gauge railways did exist in ireland as well but 53 was already called standard gauge at that time in comparison    the main reason right now behind switching is cost much like spain/portugal and the iberian gauge theres not really any justification to the costs involved in digging up all the track and laying it back down again only narrower plus theres the added difficulty in regauging all the trains and rolling stock a lot of rolling stock in ireland is built so bespokely around irish gauge that if a regauging was to occur they would be scrap thats before we talk about the preserved steam locomotives which still can run on the mainlines which would also become worthless scrap if ireland were to regauge    the only option for standard gauge ever being adopted would be if there was a high speed line built similar to spain and japan
  most people dont even use the trains  only the ones who find it practical do  proceed to ask those about their satisfaction  sidesorbit
    you clearly havent read the report
    how old were you when you were diagnosed with this major retardation
  im not going to bother with some report saying that spain and portugal have more passenger satisfaction that germany even if it were true which i doubt it would only go to show that passenger satisfaction bears no relation to actual service quality

  over here in spain before all the money was diverted into useless meme hsr they had plans to make some mainlines dual gauge i think theres a dual gauge track that runs from france to barcelona ive also noticed some dual gauge track sections in madrid though i do not know what that is about as most railway info in spain is distributed via magazines and im not subscribed to any
  what do you mean about useless meme hsr  i thought the high speed network was pretty good connecting madrid with barcelona and france  then again the whole deal in spain is confusing as fuck  theres the ave which i believe is the high speed line but then theres the avant which looks like its not high speed but its standard gauge anyway then theres the alvia which looks like its higher speed than the avant but ive seen it run on iberian gauge lines such as those of the barcelona rodalies and then theres the altaria which confuses me more because it just looks like an normal intercity while running on standard gauge except for when it doesnt but then what on earth is the alaris for is theres the altaria doing the same job but    help a rarted anon out what does each of these renfe services do and what makes them different  and why on earth is there such a mess between 3 gauges standard iberian and metre
  you need to privatise your asshole that way you could be getting it fucked up everyday but seriously at the end of the day it gets dark
  thats a thumb nail you tard your opinion is discarded as youre thick as fuck
  i thought the high speed network was pretty good connecting madrid with barcelona and france  and it is the issue with it is the fact that it doesnt generate much revenue at all and all the costs which go to hsr are taken away from the plain old rail network which means its falling into quite a terrible state the whole extremadura region for example has nonelectrified single track this used to be good enough for the traffic that passed through that part of the network however thanks to money being derived to hsr all the emus and some of the locos get less maintenance causing constant breakdowns which leave the single track lines inoperable for hours on end  then again the whole deal in spain is confusing as fuck  its all artificial market segmentation to try and squeeze some revenue out of the whole hsr ordeal   ave is straight up hsr  avant is hsr but slowed down to create a cheaper market segment  alvia is a service that runs at the max speed allowed by the track it runs on and it can change gauges to give better coverage  altaria is just a name for talgo trains pulled by a loco doing intercity and mediumlong distance duty this name was created back when there was a service called arco which were intercities with more mundane coaches  alaris was the name given to intercity services done by emus as opposed to talgos or arcos doesnt make much sense anymore since now all intercity services are done by emus or dmus and pretty much the only loco hauled passenger services we have are the talgos altaria  then we have media distancia and larga distancia which used to be called regionales which is the name for medium and long distance services done by emus and dmus  tldr makes no fucking sense and its designed to artificially segment the market and confuse the customer into buying tickets for the most expensive option usually not even hsr  to be cont
  money being derived to hsr all the emus and some  meant dmus there brainfart    and why on earth is there such a mess between 3 gauges standard iberian and metre  well for starters we had the iberian gauge which was implemented so the french couldnt use our rail network for military purposes and because some dumbfuck engineer decided that wider tracks would make it easier to maintain stability on steep gradients which we have a lot of  then theres the metre gauge back in the day spain used to have tons of mines and most mines created their own private railways and the gauge choice was almost always metre probably because by doing so they could just grab the hoppers straight from the mine and take them to any part of their networks with no need for transfers of course they started running passenger services on the side villages expanded and became dependant on the metre railways which meant that when the mines closed down 60s 70s and 80s the metre railways were still being used for passenger services of course at that point they had to be kept as some villages had literally no other way of communication with the outside world this caused the lines to be expanded in some cases so they could meet with standard gauge railways at big stations  as for standard gauge it was decided in the 1980s that building the new hsr network on iberian standards would be absolutely stupid for obvious reasons and so our hsr runs on standard gauge track  as a fun fact all of our iberian gauge network could be converted to standard gauge in a matter of months and very cheaply as it was decided sometime in the 90s that all the sleepers and catenary equipment should have fittings for easy adaptation to standard gauge so all of our sleepers have anchor points for both gauges and converting the track would just be a matter of moving the rail some cm and changing the anchor points
  theres partly dual gauge track between barcelona and france for freight operations for the other part of the stretch freight trains use the hs line which is what made that line so extremely expensive it had to have very wide curves as usual for hs but also very light grades for freight while usually hs can deal with pretty steep grades      what do you mean about useless meme hsr  i thought the high speed network was pretty good connecting madrid with barcelona and france  almost any hsr anywhere will work out reasonably well the question is wether its huge costs are justified spain is probably one of the least suitable places for hsr  bulk of demand is endtoend between cities with very little in between between madrid and barcelona the largest city is zaragoza with pop 1m  terrain is extremely mountainous little known fact spain is one of the most mountainous countries in europe  because of that railway gauge and the poor economy in the 19th century conventional railways can hardly be upgraded for 250 km/h or more so hsr have to be completely new lines  spain has the most extensive highway system in europe more extensive than germanys despite having more area with half the population ie very low density it also has the most extensive tollfree system with 75 being tollfree  spain has a metric fuckton of airports even smaller cities like alicante have an airport regional air travel was firmly established before hsr  basically if you have two cities with nothing but mountains in between and travel demand isnt ridiculously huge its much cheaper to just have an airport at each end and run a few regional planes instead of a fuckexpensive hsr doing the same thing   hsr has been the single largest public expense in the history of postfranco spain it has been an essential part in ruining spains economy
  back in the day spain used to have tons of mines and most mines created their own private railways and the gauge choice was almost always metre  i think in the 19th there was a law that established that rail lines had to either use iberian gauge or meter gauge
  because there are no rail links to anywhere outside of the island  everything needs to be transhipped anyway so why bother with ripping up the old and putting down new track    i do think that 53 should have been made the standard gauge outside ireland though
  well that depends on if theres going to be that bridge to scotland  in a more realistic scenario i could see standard gauge be used for a high speed line being built there are a couple of options but i think such a line would likely focus on connecting dublin and dublin airport with the other irish cities such as cork galway limerick and probably also belfast if the bridge to scotland ever materialised then extending the line north from belfast to the bridge could be an option    that kind of a plan would be out of reach though i do believe though that the upcoming dublin metro will be a standard gauge line as they plan to reuse some of the luas tram lines on the green line south of the city
  irish and portuguese fags are small too  talking about that i took a ride on the bus in lisbon and i swear to god i couldnt fit in the damn seat without manspreading like a mad man otherwise my knees would be fucked im only 1m81 tall for fucks sake
  i think theres a dual gauge track that runs from france to barcelona  correct ive taken the tgv from barcelonasants a couple times once to parisausterlitz and the other to toulousematabiau    the fact that tgvs from barcelona go from sants instead of estació de frança awakes the tism in me though      hsr in spain is good if you do it in madrid barcelona valencia zaragoza seville and bilbao and connect it to france and portugal unfortunately they wanted to have the ave reach every province capital and as you can guess no one cares about trains in albacete ciudad real or lugo
  why doesnt everyone else switch to 1600 mm gauge

dutch internet friend meeting up with me next year  going to go give tour round uk  the primary means of travelling together i have planned is by train  anons how much embarrassment am i in for
  depends what part of the uk you live in
  why it is actually terrible  shitty unreliable commuter trains  commuter trains either have terrible frequencies further out or run on saturated lines forcing them to make all or almost all stops only one 4track line in the whole country  badly maintained nonhsr infrastructure see recent barcelona derailment  terrible frequencies large parts of the spanish railway network have fewer than 4 trains per day  no coordination between trains despite low frequencies  no cadencebased schedules as in a train ever x minutes/hours  mostly ancient rolling stock on regional trains with constant breakdowns would be ok if they were properly maintained at least  retarded pricing system with a gorillion different pricing levels instead of just hsr and nonhsr pricing    obsession to put everything underground / below ground leve  its a lot of factors the root of this is actually politicians wanting to speculate and create work for construction companies construction is big business in spain its tied to urbanistic speculation which is also big business example  have rail tracks in a city  politician makes a ruckus bc muh unsafe muh nuisance muh dangerous  gets support to bury rail line  this creates work for construction co buddies politician obv gets bribe  new terrain freed up for building stuff  land value around the tracks rise taxpayer is paying for land value increase for a select few  this scheme turned out to work very well because a it creates construction work b it creates opportunities for speculation and c it gets popular support this scheme turned out so well that it created a mentality that rail tracks must be underground in a city because its the normal thing and its not normal to have above ground tracks so now this retardation simply perpetuates itself the citizens are basically asking politicians to shut up and take their money sad
  south will be going into london but also to bath
  southern is a total mess but with that said great western are pretty good tfl is pretty much the best rail in the uk not just the underground and dlr but also the overground and tfl rail/crossrail and the likes of thameslink and so on are pretty good as well  just avoid southern and youll be grand

  agreed i dont think theyre mandatory or anything either plenty of imported buses like early dennises dont have them its just namade ones that do

  as someone who lives beside the dennis factory that hurts my brain

  when did wrightbus start making bendybuses
    which one of these had the transmission whine when accelerating from 15 to 25ish mph i remember from childhood school journeys hearing that same sound over and over from single decker buses around london actually pretty sad i will never hear it again pic related brings me back to being a 4 year old
    not a bus    the hell you smokin trd dresden operated it as a proper bus
the only bus ive actually regularly ridden for two years in middle school and therefore the only bus i have any sort of attachment to
honk honk
  i think its generally any bus with voith gearboxes   the old enviro 400 models are the best sounding
  since the wright fusion around 1998
  ive never seen one of those on the roads here i constantly see wrightbuses on the roads here and even a few new routemasters theyre mostly either double deckers or single deck buses they pretty much hold a monopoly here though but the buses they make for use here is a fraction of their total buses some do go to dublin but the rest go to britain ive seen some hong kong buses and ive seen the las vegas buses as well
by this logic   i actually liked the nr 12 better nr 100 was the express buss but nr 12 had comfier departure times and was only 10 minutes slower
  hong kong and singapore all use uk bus models from alexander dennis and wrightbus only exception is that they use the enviro 500 apparently ireland dublin i think uses e500s but not the uk even though its built here    wrightbus pretty much had a monopoly during the 2000s with firsts fleet mostly consisting of geminis and solars since the streetshite and the streetwreck first have started to move back towards alexander dennis
      those are coaches not buses
  theyre busses where i live
  where i live coaches are considered private hire while the ones in the images you replied to are what are called long distance buses
  i thought a coach is the guy who trains a sports team
        okay okay whos the bristol lad  also the new bristol lynx service is shockingly shit though the metro sees okay
  wrightbus still dominate london though  there are still a few alexander dennis buses in ni but again wrightbus pretty much have a monopoly on their home market only optare really come into use when small buses are needed plus the long distance buses are usually irizars or something similar
  bristol lad    im from bath
    cheers drive
  ive not used either i mostly use the 49 and x39
  alright babber
  wrightbus build quality is shocking streetlites and streetdecks were terrible when new they were loud and rattled like a 20 year old dart i even saw a 63 plate streetlite with a rusty engine cover    london bus specs are terrible too no wifi cloth/moquette seating which looks like its from the 90s
  we have no streetlites in wrightbuss native northern ireland optares buses are the ones that dominate this market which is probably a sign that the streetlite is so bad that its not even popular in its own homeland    streetdecks are used by metro in belfast ive been on them and theyre comfortable enough for a bus i hate buses overall so i cant really say much theyre better than the alexander dennis buses translink bought in the 1990s but i cant say if i think theyre bad though that said more and more of the translink spec buses for both the metro and some ulsterbus services do have wifi though its the cloth seating you see elsewhere in the uk    belfast has inplemented a brt system and its one of those lets pretend its like a tram but its not the wrightbus streetcar like the one they sold to las vegas but translink bought the van hool product instead whatever
  frequency and reliability nothing else
  also what city is that if you can do a ton of buses you can usually do at least lrt
  lets pretend its like a tram  thats all brt ever i can imagine the boomer politicians beside themselves convincing themselves and each other you can get a rolls royce for toyata money
  thats because the old e400s have trident engines in them  your picture however does not      what      i always preferred the look of the alexander alx200 makes it look like a mini trident plus i know theres no actual link but plaxton pointer 2 bodied dennis darts always had standard dart engines im talking about going at 50 on country lanes with those real old knackers with the transmission whines
    what is wessex like
  doesnt exist anymore they used to run the park and ride in bath and a couple of unibuses never used them myself but apparently they were terrible just look up wessex bus on youtube
     isnt a true trident e400 but it has the cummins engine which is the same engine and the same chassis as a trident e400 the only difference is that older model chassis was badged as trident apart from that they are exactly the same
  streetdecks are used by metro in belfast ive been on them and theyre comfortable enough for a bus    that was a gemini 3 not a streetdeck the gemini 3 is volvo engined and uses the b5lh chassis the streetdeck is an integral and uses the daimler engines which are way too underpowered and it has the jerkiest gearbox ive ever seen and no kickdown either and a top speed of just 45
  no i mean the streetdeck  the ones translink bought locally from wrightbus are volvo engined perhaps for comonality with the existing gemini models  you can tell theyre streetdecks by the front illuminated logo of the operating company and the rear of the bus being this weird curved shape  translink tried to buy varients of the new routemaster from wrightbus but with only one door at the front wrightbus were unable to provide translink with the kind of bus they wanted and they resorted to volvo engined streetdecks
  translink also operates the same model of streetdeck with some interior modifications like usb charging ports at seats and free wifi on the ulsterbus service to belfast international airport that too is a volvo engined streetdeck
  the gemini 3  metro does operate the gemini 3 and i will admit that it is a much nicer bus than the streetdeck but as far as i can tell wrightbus are pushing entirely for a move to the streetdeck with some limited exceptions
  im certain that all streetdecks are daimler engined  says that the daimler om934 is the only engine option    ukbuses states that the translink metro buses are gemini 3s and that only ulsterbus urby have streetdecks 
  the gemini 3 has 2 different body styles  is the old gemini 3 the new gemini 3s have the same body as the streetdeck but a different chassis and engine

      not him but in australia if a bus has cargo storage and is meant to travel a long distance its a coach whether its public or privately operated      thats not a translink bus this is a translink bus
   in australia if a bus has cargo storage and is meant to travel a long distance its a coach whether its public or privately operated    same in the uk this would be a coach
  this is a coach
  this is a real coach
        in northern ireland translinks services get confusing for express routes from belfast or derrylondonderry to major towns or smaller cities in northern ireland as well as services to dublin translink operates the ulsterbus goldline unlike regular ulsterbus services these are all express buses usually take between 12 hours to get to their destination and they also have leather seats unlike the normal ulsterbus and metro buses which use moquette    these buses do have a luggage door which can open but it is typically only opened for certain services usually the longer distance bus station to bus station type services
  the main difference is that goldline buses serve more remote towns as well providing at least some kind of connection with belfast or a bus and rail centre like antrim ballymena coleraine etc
  the service started up in the 1980s branded as ulsterbus goldliner they were typically just normal high floor buses with nicer seats and interiors serving express routes through northern ireland
  there is another service ulsterbus tours which are associated with national express and scottish citylink ulsterbus tours owns a number of their own ni registered buses in national express and scottish citylink liveries as well  these are the services which leave belfast and connect belfast with glasgow edinburgh birmingham and london they are outside of translinks normal fare system and most tickets for ulsterbus tours are actually sold by national express instead yes these coaches do go onto ferries though sometimes ulsterbus tours just drops passengers off at a ferry terminal and another ulsterbus liveried coach will pick them up at the other end
  ulsterbus tours also operates some holiday tours these are typically grouped into a number of options sometimes the coach will depart belfast load onto the ferry to britain and then drive to another ferry to france or the netherlands and will continue through to holiday destinations  ulsterbus tours will also sometimes sell plane tickets where the coach will pick up passengers at european airports there is also one coach in the us which will also do road tours across the continental us

  but we have steering wheel on correct side  no you dont  even citaros with the steering wheel on the wrong side catch fire 
  no you dont  you dont ride on correct side i dont care about some island shitholes like uk and japan
  is this dublinbus
  no its on hong kong plates
  you dont ride on correct side    wrong people have been keeping to the left far longer than they have been keeping to the right ancient greek egyptian and roman troops kept to the left when marching
can we all agree that tfl bus regulations are shit
  yeah too much over regulation they may as well take over all the operators as they all have to conform to the same standards
  thanks based anon
these buses are literally everywhere in jakartas bus network with 4 different bodies exist most of which adapted from coach bodies
bump
  lmao
  faggot
  drivers unions say the buses suffer from a lack of maintenance a series of internal investigations have failed to stop the fires  last month a bus that was just five years old caught fire the local reported  the transport authority said the mercedes citaro bus that caught fire in via del tritone dated from 2003 and said its fleet unfortunately has a very high average age    thats what you get for lazy maintenance
  not really given the option of taking a national express service from belfast to a scottish or english city by coach and ferry and going by ryanair easyjet or flybe from belfast international or belfast city airport well you can see that most coach services are not profitable  some people get sail and rail but that only covers the coach to the ferry terminal the ferry and then onward journey by rail usually on the wcml by virgin    i would say that its more common for getting to certain scottish locations since ulsterbus tours/national express at least serves more places in scotland than easyjet or flybe serve
  because diamond bus is known for being complete shit using unsafe and unsuitable buses    
not my favorite exactly but i have more memories in the gm new look buses this might have been the workhorse or many city public transports
  did the lack of maintenance specifically concern the citaros think not  maybe next time mercedes wont go for a design with a potential oil leak right on top of the turbo
  complete shit using unsafe and unsuitable buses  thats why i fucking love them  i know when i come back to birmingham in 2030 theyll still be running the same shite darts i used to get to school on
    if thats what the darts are like then imagine how bad the streetlites are going to be like
  i know when i come back to birmingham in 2030  there wont be any whites left
  kek
  then imagine how bad the streetlites are going to be like  ive never actually been on a streetlite but ive heard theyre really really shit      feelsbadman
  streetshites make a 25 year old dennis dart look reliable                          plenty more where those came from
  yeeeess    based mercedesbox
  so based that it sets itself on fire during operation
  this thing is extremely based even russian roads and service wasnt able to kill them for like 25 years i bet they were driving in germany for like 10 or so years based
  it is not citario rubbish it was quality it was simple and extremely comfortable
    oh thats so hot right now
          german quality
f
steam buses are nice
  wrightbus cant keep getting away with making shit
    thats not a translink bus this is a translink bus  no
  i bet they were driving in germany for like 10 or so years  atleast    average service time for a lot of first owners was somewhere around 1315 years although i know of several places where they came close to 1920 years before getting sold    never forget the sound of merc boxes  
    theres a translink in canada  theres a translink in northern ireland  theres a translink in australia    what_hath_god_wroughtjpg
  what happened
  pr installation of some kind of exhibition
  that is golaz assembled in russia they were quite shit   im speaking about real mercedes we had former spurbuses and they were pretty reliable
  ive checked they were built in 1987 and last one i saw in service was in 2011 24 fucking years with 15 years of abuse by russian drivers russian service and russian roads  pure quality   not every russian bus lasts more than 810 years
  wrightbus cant keep getting away with making shit    wrightbus have always been making shit their products have always been worse than alexander dennis
     here  that is golaz assembled in russia  im speaking about real mercedes    no it is a real mercedes its an o405n2 built in 1997 by evobus merc subsidiary for busses and delivered to stadtwerke bonn germany it was in service as part of the 97xx series before it got retired and sold in 2012    pic related is a golaz admittingly i had to google that since ive never heard of that company before but licensed copies or different bodyworks of o405 built by local industries arent uncommon at all    we had former spurbuses and they were pretty reliable  do you remember what kind of livery they had low floor or high floor id be interested where they were originally from maybe essen or mannheim
i love the gillig low floor
  ugly as fuck
  yeah but they keep getting away with it  theyve been rehashing the gemini design for over 15 years now
  has there ever been an american bus not ugly as fuck
  boxy 10/10 look
  whats with the anime girl plush on the bike rack
  i suppose you can partly blame first who still keep buying their streetshites
  of all the busses ive driven orion gillig temsa mci i enjoyed driving the rts the most the fucker can move and could turn exceptionally well i drifted one once during a rainstorm when i took a hairpin corner a little too fast good times
  it doesnt love you it fogs up substantially in cold/wet weather the sunshades break as if theyre made of balsa and no two vehicles drive the same
  most american buses are so
  american build quality
  hey the rts turned into a sauna when the heater was on and ive ridden on new flyers that handled weather much better its more that gillig is hot garbage yet my system keeps buying them we had a bus get delivered from the factory and immediately break down with a problem that required four weeks to fix
  do first have a link to wrightbus like stagecoach do with adl
  a busor train that doesnt smell like piss rotten flesh or some other bs
  not that i know of reason why stagecoach use adl products is because the chairman owns a majority stake in adl    thankfully where i live first are no longer ordering any wrightbus products and havent since 2015 when they ordered their first batch of streetdecks apparently their so bad theyve had to had multiple engine replacements every year
  bluestar    well theyre not lying when they it literally is a star thats blue
  rotten flesh    unless youre from the third world ive never heard of a bus or train smelling like that
im surprised no one has posted an alx400 yet these are great buses

any love for chinese buses here
  i hate this shit   zhongtong cant make suspension at all i always get sick in this shit  i better take a lo916 bus that this chinkshit
  oh theyre greatly loved across china ask any chinese funeral parlor
  id give my love to them if they arent suicidal
  trusting chinese vehicles with your life    
  no
  that piece of shit looks even worse than chink buses
  it is a chinkdesigned bus just built by a canadian company
i have fond memories riding this fucker from uni its old and worn seats were maximum comfy plenty of leg room made it easily possible to lie on my side and fall asleep driving back home
  pks oława is still using them few days ago i saw one of their h9s it had black plates which means it was registered before 2000 still on duty autosan never dies
  chink design  north american build quality    its the worst of both worlds
  im from moscow we had ikaruses in large numbers but now there are none left as they want only lowfloor buses even if there are still many highfloor trams and trolleybuses
  north american build quality isnt too bad just new flyer and american companies that cant build buses  that being said riding in an enviro400 for the first time made me realise how shit new flyers are
  enviro 400s in na i thought they used enviro 500s
  sorry yeah meant 500  though 400s are used in na but only for tour buses so it doesnt really count
  what a beautiful bus fuck me
  something only an amerilard would say
  i think that guy is stealing this busno way is he the route driver
  is that a road or a really wide sidewalk
  he meant get on our bullshit level
  thats a demonstrator bus
  new looks are based  especially the artics  t not amerifat
  that thing looks like an americanized van hool
  my favorite got to ride one a couple of years ago brought back a lot of memories from the 90s when they were still in regular service
  think some were converted into trains in the 80s
love second gen dennis darts they were introduced when i was 5 and some are still in service around where i live
  still looks ugly
  pacers were trains built using bus components the busses themselves were not converted
enviro 500s are set to be used in berlin    
some more based new look
  is that you michel
  瀬戸内海交通 58mc1979  its a reliable old bitch
  quite an unusual design why is the windscreen so strange
  to be honest im not sure i think its just because that was the kind of style going around in the 50s and 60s      hnnnnngggg
    it looks like the dutch jumped on the windshield bandwagon too in the 60s
  reminds me of
not exactly a favourite but posting more bus

are there any known late 19thearly/mid 20th century intact examples of tramp steamers left in existence not counting shipwrecks/abandoned ones any still in revenue service i imagine some obscure freighter line in a third world shithole might still have one or two up and running on duct tape
  
    last imperial german navy ship still afloat  one of a handful of ww1 surface combatants still afloat    well speak of the devil any others
    german engineering aint a meme
    no shit    found another steamer in kenya thats the same age as liemba and still in service    
  the ship was scuttled then brought back to service
  panzer breaks down in the middle of the road
    kek
    do liberty ships count because we still have one here in alaska being used as a floating cannery    
  probably some in south pacific
  theres a bunch of those still operating in switzerland in revenue service theyre kept for heritage purposes but they run the regular ferry lines on some occasions  some of them have been converted to diesel but some are still true steamers
  the earnslaw still sails daily on lake wakatipu in the south island of nz
  those are comfy and serve as regular ferry lines on leman lake cheap as hell as well
  the new york maritime college training ship empire state vi is an old breakbulk steam freighter
        do they ever carry freight or just passengers
  i think the earnslaw was primarily used for carrying stock and building materials down the lake but yeah its tourists now
    in belfast you can tour the beautifully restored hms caroline    the ss nomadic too
its really not duct tape its original name was duck tape designed in ww2 needed waterproof sticky tape american designed i thought about this seeing it called duck tape thought this to be in error then checked into it fact is stranger than fiction
this thread is now steamer general post em with gordon lightfoot as background music
    obligatory f    
  f yesterday was the anniversary of its sinking
    speaking of steamers the great lakes still has a lot of them in service until about four years ago the st marys challenger built in 1907 was still running under it own power and its still in service as a barge
bump
this is from the 50s runs in worse weather than any of the modern boats in the area
  its not like tanzania could build its own steamer
technically breaking the rules of op but heres the ps ryde a paddle steamer owned by southern railway that used to be a floating nightclub and been sitting abandoned on the isle of wight since the 1980s scrapping started in 2010 but halted the ship now exists in a legal limbo of sorts as the harbor authority is trying to hold off on scrapping it if they can find someone to buy the ship and restore it
  nice not as classic as the maguerite but pretty reliable  i think safer than the roros plying the straights to the lower mainland
this german steamer was build in 1904 and served as a tugboat today its a heritage vessel
    do they just use it for excursions
  for three hour tours
  how amazing must it be to own a ship buokt in 1904 probably paid itself off in 1905 and has just been shitting money for the owners ever since
  ships pay themselves off in a single year    thats adorable
  well it was built in 1907 probably only cost a dozen wheat pennies to build
  both the challenger and st marys conquest periodically dock near my house in milwaukee its nice to walk by in the dead of night and see them partially lit up with machinery running
  dies it have a toilet or do you have to shit into the water
  technically breaking the rules of op    i dont mind at all cool find shame its been left to rot
oh yeah and bumping with art because i love paintings of old boats
  sailed the courier around the world in 1980 she was a true tramp was new 3rd engineer us flag ships dont have many tramps left though was an adventure i miss it in my dotage
  i graduated 1980 sailed the tses v engineer thanks for the suny mc reference
  the john brown still in service in baltimore only 2 left that actually run amazing
    this one
    bump
  german engineering  i have a 40 year old super 8 film camera made in germany and it still runs perfectly with just minimal maintenance were talking precision machinery where a few micrometers of imprecision would make the whole thing useless    that said nowadays german engineering aint what it used to be german cars have become a total meme japs are way superior
  this is a lot less to do with the engineers themselves and a lot more to do with the parameters they are told to meet if you told japanese american or german engineers to make a long lasting vehicle and they could use any materials and costs necessary then they could all make near equally skookum machines that would all last for fucking ever
    everything looks better with invasion stripes
    post a photo from the camera
  get one from 1912 that is not in ruins preserved in spain canarian islands    
    entered service in 1912  left service in 1976 only because of a busted boiler    holy shit thats 64 years have they considered returning the ship to service as a tourist attraction and having it run on the remaining boiler
    i think not but i will be just happy that they only dont let it rot
    thats a beauty
  similarly you can also ride some oldscool paddle steamers from dresden  
  and theres a similar one in operation on the bodensee between switzerland and germany
  whats the draft on those things

  lee a tregurtha has a battle ribbon from surviving a uboat attack in ww2 and it is going to stay operating on the lakes for the foreseeable future

  lee a tregurtha now runs on diesel power but still an amazing ship

  lakes steamers are one of the coolest littleknown things that the us has going for it in terms of /n/tier excitement    if i was interested in doing the merchant marine thing working a lake steamer seems like its about as /comfy/ as it could get doublyso if youre on one of the really big boats that cant get through the welland and youre basically sailing a landlocked panamax for a living
  /pol/ meme about hiroshima and detroit in 1945 vs hiroshima and detroit today
  tell me how much do you know about the civil war and its relation to the possibility of young anne frank getting pregnant
  working a lake steamer seems like its about as /comfy/ as it could get  until its not beware the witch of november
ironic that the racemixed faggot ops thread would be poisoned by his own bizarre hyperautistic fetish
  tell me more  theres nothing to tell its an alternate history that /his/ cooked up   its like blimptrain its not a thing except on /n/  im sort of surprised that you have a degree in us history and browse 4chan but dont go on /his/ where you would have surely already encountered that meme
  theres nothing to tell its an alternate history that /his/ cooked up    yes but how the american civil war ended decades before anne franks parents were even born there were barely any veterans of it still alive at the time of her birth let alone when she wrote the diary and died    im sort of surprised that you have a degree in us history and browse 4chan but dont go on /his/ where you would have surely already encountered that meme    i avoid anne frank and the holocaust in general and civil war/us history threads on /his/ like the plague they always devolve in /pol/tier shitflinging fests no ones interested in a genuine discussion they just want to shill their political views
would the liemba count it was a german gunboat not a tramp steamer
this thread does not deserve to die on its 200th day anniversary
i just wanted to post this  built during 18541856 at motala  worlds oldest wheel steamer with a active route  only sunk 2 times salvaged and restored quickly  only given cultural heritage status after 150 years of operation meaning its rather well maintained  just go there  its a awesome tourist trap with some sexy jazz band and a nice summer lake
  i avoid anne frank and civil war/us history threads on /his/ they always devolve in /pol/tier shitflinging fests    so like threads about every other subject on the board since it stopped being a slow board
this one is only about 65 years old but i like it because any normie who looks at it would think its at least 100 or more years old
this one is a patrol boat still in service of the argentine navy built in 1936 havent got any modern pictures of it unfortunately
   sunk 2 times
  this is what happens when your transport route is a shallow lake  salvage and repair is possible because its possible to get a diver down to less than 100 meter with hooks or a tube with air
  i will never book passage on the ns savannah why even live
  hows that project coming along oh it isnt delayed thrice and abandoned to shreds you say oh dear
    whats the red white and blue band running around the funnel
  blimptrains were actually a thing tho some guy in the weimar republic designed them as a form of rapid rail transport issue was that you couldnt couple them to other trains making the capacity rather horrible
  ship companies have unique colors symbols or lettering on their stacks to identify their ships not really necessary today but its a tradition that ship ran under two organizations american export lines and military sealift command civilian organization for carrying military supplies and replenishing ships underway     american export lines had a big white e on a red field on their stacks so im guessing that the redwhite and blue is an older version of mscs stack paint today it is from top black gray blue and yellow
    sad
    howd it sink
  pretty sure most people want two boilers in case one breaks down and its usually pretty hard to add another boiler to a ship not too sure about this one but i assume its too inaccessible its just easier to buy a new ship instead
  how about replacing the busted boiler with a diesel engine
  you hit stuff in the lake  cant patch it or get it to shore fast enough  have to save what you can of cargo get the crew on lifeboats go to shore  acquire divers and gear in a world without telephones or really cars    have to come back with divers ping pong balls like some donald duck cartoon and raise it get it to shore and repair it they did it a little different but thats still the essence
  theyre nice looking vessels
  that wooden bridge though that is beautiful dont see that on boats anymore
  lol is that a real thing i cant help but think it will have as much luck as the original with that name
  couldnt that thing be named like olympic ii or something after the one ship in the batch that didnt sink
  youll be the first to regret not listening  always kill a traitor before an enemy
    hi codreanu
    think i found the pissed kraut
mh1a or formerly the liberty ship uss sturgis was converted into a mobile nuclear power plant for the panama canal zone during the 60s and 70s and has been sitting in the reserve fleet awaiting disposal scrapyards willing to take radioactive hulks are in short supply
this beautiful steamer got an interesting history   
  so which one is the wheelhouse
  hows that project coming along    its not        it was they were planning to have it built in china too        on an unrelated note    
bump
bumping this with a local ship that couldve been saved if only people had cared enough to do so the ss wampa built in 1915 she was the last of the 200 wooden steam schooners that once served the pacific coasts lumber trade     withdrawn from service in 1948 she was bought by a group of enthusiasts and saw a second life as museum ship during the 1950s and 1960s but was cut short after significant deterioration rendered her a hazard the ship was laid up in drydock in richmond california pending repairs that never took place by the 2010s the ship had more or less rotted beyond repair and surrounding richmond itself had degenerated into a blighted shithole overrun with savage subhuman niggers who would sooner huff the paint off the hull for a quick high than treat it with anything resembling respect so naturally no one was interested in paying for its upkeep let alone restoring it    wampa was dismantled by the national park service in 2013 to little fanfare
    sad 
my bitch just came home with repaired boiler after almost three years under her own power
  tell us more steamanon i would love to own a classic steamer even if it was repowered with diesel
  it i not mine i am merely in love with her i am yet lowest of the deckscrubs quite literally    she is the oldest seaworthy sailing steamer in the world due to failed processes she is only half iron but the iron will last longer than the newer steel plates she was built in 1867 in oslo and is called sds hansteen seildampskip  sailing steam ship    since her restoration in 80s and 90s we found out that the whole rigg was not restored to the original state so our upcoming project for the next two years will be rebuilding it until we can sail the fjords both on steam and sails     my part revolves around blacksmithing parts we essentially aim towards bolted everything and no electrical welding there was none back then last week i made steam whistle holders that are going to be bolted screwed and camouflaged as bolted since noone wants to go down the chimney with heavy bolting equipement and noone wants to pay for it
  and believe me yesterday everyone was happy as a child as she mildly vibrated as the double expansion steam engine purred pic is the overhauled boiler     funny is two years ago we were convinced that the boiler is done for both amateurs and old experienced sailors further inspection revealed that the materials on the boiler were so overdimensioned that the inspector said that this boiler will be operational when new would rust away this boiler is from 1917    fun fact i like to think about when being onboard is fram 20 years younger is sitting in a house in oslo and that master and commander took place just 65 years before she was built
        s t e a m b o i
military sealift command still has eight steampowered vehicle cargo ships kept on ready reserve status
  its sad to see her collecting dust every time i drive over the key bridge but at least shes still afloat
  the algols are dickhardeningly awesome theyre basically kitty hawk or forrestalera carriers built without the flight deck to carry cargo and they have similar flank speeds coincidentally two of them are parked in ready reserve right across the harbor from the liberty ship and the ns savannah
  (((coincidentally)))    i think not
    
  i bet it can get a bit harder today we took her out of the city canals to get past those unreliable bridges and be ready for tomorrows departure    sorry for the vertical video i am not used to take them 
1860s ironclad huascar    one of the first ones ever built has seen way to much action

happy birthday boat thread
   the holocaust happened
ww2 liberty ships design was based on the standard british tramp steamer i believe there is only one remaining saw a program or news report few years ago it was purchased believe in eu somewhere old timer said it was barely seaworthy barely capable for a crossing believe through the atlantic ocean  
grumman g65 tadpole little known act designed end of ww2 thurston redesigned so engine not enclosed final ownership was a company called lake amphibian or that was name of their only design called the lake this is fairly recent image someone purchased it but because of injured shoulder cannot fly it so it was shoved into the community  hanger i was told
let my try taking off screen lock on my apple air ipad2
lake also made a version turbo 250hp thinks this is the more standard lower hp engine smokes when it starts up probably due for an overhaul lake amphibian i have the three views of the grumman g65 tadpole discovered design flaw of cowled in engine while designing a radio control model did not finish it needs a propeller shaft extension to be 100 scale would be easy design fix to make it like the lake maybe in my next life
        wrong thread nigger
not in use anymore but heres the ss palo alto one of a series of cargo ships built from ferrocement for the emergency fleet corporation during wwi due to a shortage of steel    most of the ships wound up being abandoned because they being made from concrete were unsuitable for scrapping

  didnt anne frank die when she was 15    dont remind me     tfw anne will never be a married mother of three taking her children on their first big train trip aboard the empire builder    not a long lifespan id imagine    now she lives forever in our hearts    tfw anne will never come across a battalion of confederate soldiers and join them in prayer for the souls of their dead    iit hurts

  theyre too busy fucking with baconrider i guess  not other anon and i know who baconrider is but why are mods fucking with me  hes nuts but hes /n/ as fuck
the golden star
the holocoaster
  its been nearly 4 months since this gem from /his/ was posted
northwestern pacific railway diesels
  this is a wholesome thread stop trying to get it deleted you nigger
  are you shitting me its been over a month since i posted that one comment
  you stupid ass that comment was posted oply 4 days agaago a
bump
  dont need to bump it like that my friend threads like these will last an eternity
  i meant the is been nearly 3 months one
  hours  i cant believe this shit is still up after all this time
  do mods even browse /n/
  they have started banning bacon and deleting his posts the absolute state of this boards moderation
  why do they ban bacon  what does he do
  what did bacon post
    his usual poetry
  this makes me sad     freebaconrider
75 months later  this thread had a good run lads
mods finally fucking did their job
  the op was completely sfw though
    teheheh breaking the rules is cool amirite guise le normie frog
cant really expect any faster response when the mods are so busy chasing bacon
  t janny bootlicker
  stopjannies  freebaconrider
  no nudity was featured in what was the op prove me wrong bootlicker
forget how slow this board is
  there was some pubes
  pubic hair is not nudity though
  you could see her bits though too
  you cannot as the pubes blocked it
  there was a clear valley
  you admitted that pubes were the reason why the op image was removed it would be contradictory to say that the vaginal line was clearly visible
lets get this thread back on track guys    tfw no anne frank to sit alongside you and watch the shuntybois roll by
  45 months  dont blame you though the amerifat date system can be confusing
  are those pubic hairs covering the photograph
  this was an active and fun thread before the op got deleted thanks jannies
rip anne frank
  active  /n/
  relatively speaking it was far more active when the op pic wasnt deleted thanks jannies
op posting from an amtrak train
  keep her safe
  blessed
  its been nearly 6 months since this gem from /his/ was posted  too bad its not the same since the op pic was deleted
toasting in a based thread
blocks your path
  looks pretty slow tbdesu probably just ride around it
every single plane they have made is either a flying coffin like the 737 or a money pit like with the 787 or in the 747s case both    why cant they make a good plane
  nice shit thread faggot do us a favor and shove a steak knife into your jugular
  are you denying reality or are you just angry that i insulted your favorite flying meme
  shouldnt you be out crashing perfectly good a330s into the ocean from cruising altitude
  shouldnt you be plummeting into the sea because your plane has a flawed design
  why cant airbus make a good plane
  thread is about how boeing planes always break apart  mmuh airbus is the only response boeing fags can muster  literally any other aircraft manufacturer from northrop to sukohi can make a good plane
what about 757 767 777 absolutely based planes aluminium no cabon meme is used there
  why have so fucking many airbus planes crashed then why
  not near as many as boeing planes have crashed  also  muh airbus
  pretty sure the max doesnt have a composite body
  757 and 767  under maintained ancient deathtraps i wouldnt set foot in one without my affairs in order  777  did you not see mh370 the plane literally disappears and breaks up for no reason that thing would have never passed faa certification if not for boeing lobbyists
  airbus is just newer and it doesnt include 1960 failures  boeing 737 ngs same ara as 320s have similar n of accidents
  iif i change the numbers the plane is good  ahahahahahaha  remember the british midlands crash where an ng crashed into a hill because both of its engines shut down for no reason good times
  under maintained ancient deathtraps i wouldnt set foot in one without my affairs in order  they are based planes hydraulic no electric meme chad gliders   near 0 fatality due to tech failure  777  shitworld service pilots   there is minimal amount of crashed in white countries
  airbus literally wasnt a real competitive threat until the late 1980s
    compare it urself  b737 ng and a320 family  same late 1980 shit   looks like 737 has less epic endings
  near 0 fatality due to tech failure  wrong stop believing boeing lies they are ancient deathtraps that havnt been properly maintained since they left the hangars   also the 777s first crash was in britain and was due to a design flaw
  now compare those with the 200 and 100s  you dont get to take off the numbers just because you changed the design a little
  that isnt a fair comparing  it should be compared with trash like ty154 or similar 1960 shitbox
  great thread youre truly a credit to our species
  also the 777s first crash was in britain and was due to a design flaw  of rr engines not plane
  yes it is it is still the same plane thus its a fair comparison
  it is like saying that 1980 golf is the same as 2018 golf really
  are they not the same plane
  yes a lot of stuff changed some stuff is kept the same just to keep the same type rating  air frame was redesigned to make it longer wings were changed extremely obvious in max more computahs
  new engines a lot of stuff to make it safer and more kosher to fly
  they are still the same plane so the numbers still count    daily reminder that 1020 of the flying population has been killed in 737s
  how bored must you be to shit up a whole board so badly
  there are no 737  there are only 737100 737200 737300737400 737500 737ng600 737ng700 737ng800 737ng900 737max7 737max8 737max9
  with a board that takes stupid shit like people movers this fucking seriously its not hard at all
  there is no room for error in this sort of buses so only extremely serious/autistic people are into planes
  go on board dedicated to things that move people  complain that these things exist
  are you joking todays planes are more retard proof than even a cager couldnt fuck it up
  none of this has ever happened in any of the boeings i have flown in nice bait though i guess
its a seething amerifats and brown arabs in europe competing to show whos most loyal to their aerospace corporation of choice episode     /n/ this gets old
  mcdonnell douglass is the white mans choice
  it designing not in driving
  yes i much prefer the jaundiced paupers angrily denounce bikes with more than 1 gear or that weigh less than 499 pounds whilst fat middle aged men overexplain why they have a 7500 bicycle that wont shift gears without an icloud account
buy tupolev please
  imagine being one of the guys who has to extract the dead bodies from inside that thing what does it even look like in there
  the ride never ends  _
  imagine being one of the guys who has to extract the dead bodie  wow free cellphones  i guess they dont think much otherwise they will just loose their minds   from inside that thing  it looks like plane crashed pretty badly and everything is in pieces   what does it even look like in there  interesting question why mass media never takes a photo of disturbing things
  you wouldnt have to for op pic thats the one that crashed at bali and nobody died
  because they decided to trust the nontrustable more
  what should you trust in case all instruments fail
        this is better than the corvette vs gtr threads on /o/ lmao
  religion  and those trips
  but really id take my phone that has mems gyro and it can be used to some extend as attitude indicator
  what should you trust in case all instruments fail  you shouldnt fly the plane
747 crash rate isnt even that high you dick
  but what if they fail mid flight
  then no one can control the plane in some extremely fortunate cases we have seen some flights that can avert their worse fate by using all manual observation and control but thats not just a rarity and require at least some other system remain functional but also saved much less life than automation would have saved
  dunno soviet pilots were able to fly soviet aluminum buckets like ty154 with complete instruments failure  they used glass of water to mimic attitude indicator
  but yeah that was a proper plane hydraulic everything michal minimal electronics
lets play guess if mad yuro or thirdie    didnt mention muh a380 so probably a thirdo
nonwhites should not be allowed to fly planes or serve as air traffic controllers
  also non whites shouldnt be allowed to design software for planes
  and they shouldnt be allowed to fly in first class
  they should not be allowed outside of their shitholes
  how many crew you need to fly the tu154
  4 people navigator or how it is called in english flight enginigger and 2 pilots
  and 6 people to post propaganda about it online 
  honestly ty154 is pretty shit plane noisy af handling is tricky  i guess russians are just fearless they never use shields on angle grinders ride trains outside cabin rcd/gfci is western lie and so on
  what about the 737max10
  i guess russians are just drunk    ftfy
  yeah hydraulic systems in they use alcohol
      no theyre just suicidal
after lion air crash boeing reportedly will warn that the 737 max can abruptly dive by mistake    according to bloomberg the safety warning is linked to the crash of a lion air aircraft last week off the coast of indonesia killing an estimated 189 people the news agency wrote that existing procedure can be used to compensate for the issue which appears to be the result of a serious problem with systems designed to prevent the jets from stalling at dangerously high speeds    on 7 november the national transportation safety committee confirmed that there were problems with flight 610s angle of attack sensors initially the aircraft suffered an airspeed indicator problem for its last 4 flights the last flight was the bali to jakarta flight thinking that it would fix the problem the engineers in bali then replaced the aoas sensor of the aircraft however the problem persisted a 20 degree difference between the aoas left sensor and right sensor was recorded the ntsc confirmed that flight 610 suffered the same problem with the bali to jakarta flight just minutes after take off the aircraft abruptly dived the crew of the bali to jakarta flight however managed to control the aircraft and decided to fly at a lower than normal altitude the aircraft then managed to land safely knkt chief soerjanto tjahjono told the press that future reporting or actions enacted to prevent similar problems on similar planes will be up to boeing and us aviation authorities    so in summation boeing 737 max aircrafts can just randomly nosedive into the ground its happened several times before and has only now caused a crash boeings response is well other pilots were able to figure it out so just deal with it what a disgrace flying coffin indeed
  going to check every flight i go on and if its a 737 remind the captain when i get on about it
  why airbus is shit why boeing is shit  why there are no more planes with manual
  the airbus systems have a failsafe to prevent this from happening  if something causes the aircraft to have weird instrument readings instead of going into a nosedive the airbus will instead go into alternate law and inform the pilots on the ecam and also recommend to land asap
what do you know some ppl fly cessnas
  cessnas are reliable af but pilots in cessnas arent
  that is interesting   so why pilot cant override too smart coputah i thought you can do this on boeing without reaching pulling fuses  if it is boeing  im not going lol
  couldnt possibly be shitty maintenance  it has to be the plane itself  youre an idiot kill yourself
  cessnas are reliable af  single piston engine  more reliable than airliner
  you cant just fuck up plane in less than one year only if it was fucked up by design or at factory
  kek
  t local news channel  its reliability comes from its simplicity those piston engines unless extremely poorly maintained or flown excessively outside of operating limits will never just completely die you wont have to worry about asymmetric thrust either if the engine does decide to just quit right after takeoff you can literally just plop it back on the runway and still have thousands of feet of concrete to spare as opposed to a jet where on takeoff you have a nokidding speed at which you cannot stop the aircraft without going off the end the whole reliability argument isnt even that relevant when more than 90 of aircraft accidents occur due to some kind of pilot error think for ga its like 95 of fatalities are caused by flying vfr into imc
  ga its like 95 of fatalities are caused by flying vfr into imc  sounds cool how can i do it if weather in my area is always clear no clouds nothing just blue sky winds are strong tho even on ground
  assuming proper maintenance you could theoretically fly 5000 hours in piston ga aircraft before youd have an enginefailurerelated accident    t ntsb report    the whole reliability argument isnt even that relevant when more than 90 of aircraft accidents occur due to some kind of pilot error  it is relevant when youre a pilot the fact that most of the crashes on the type were caused by some dumbass flying into a pile rocks in the cloud does not make you more safe because you know youre not a dumbass    if the engine does decide to just quit right after takeoff you can literally just plop it back on the runway and still have thousands of feet of concrete to spare  thats because youre taking of from the runway which was designed for airliners try doing the same on some back country strip surrounded by trees  the chance to survive an allengines failure in a ga plane is higher than on an airliner does it make cessna more reliable than an airliner no even if you survive the crash landing its still an a/c failure
boing makes nicedrones
       great thread
  boeing has no need and intention to build good planes since theres airbus  thats why boeing is shitty as fuck  its like american cars they look good but are chink shit inside because europeans make better cars  there are no american products that can keep up with european products
  from the thumbnail i thought this was an aircraft
  practically flies itself
whoa and here i thought cager entitlement was strictly an american phenomenon cagerism is truly a mental disease     
the protest was made by cager complaining about high fuel price not knowing how international politics work  thats their own internal struggle
  its a cager eat cager world it seems  meanwhile the french person who lives in a city is slowly being killed by cagers poisoning them
chad london fossil fuel era over  virgin paris blocage novembre 17  stuck in your cages
imagine being so entitled you think a railed vehicle should get out of your way
maybe dont stand in the fucking road
  i choose to live 50km away from my job and complain that i cant pay the gas  somehow its the governments fault  cagers being cagers
  strictly an american phenomenon  kek        english tldr cyclist on a cycle road similar to dutch fietsstraaten where motor vehicles are guests blocks a truck for more than 40 mins because she had rightofway police arrives to tell cyclist to move because its easier for her than for the truck driver
  share  the  road
  honestly neither ones fault  cagers should be required to keep their vehicles on private property instead of allowing them to block half to 2/3rds of every street for parking    cant afford a 15m2 shack unlikely you can afford to properly maintain a road safe car
  cagerism is truly a mental disease  only ineffectual impotent cucks take buses and trains everywhere even paying for uber is just a substitute for asking mommy to drive you somewhere actual responsible adults own cars and drive themselves where they need to go taking responsiblity is a sign of leaving childhood behind and becoming an adult you should try it op
  as a responsible i value my time time spent driving a cage is time wasted that could be put to use in a myriad of other ways
  cagerism isnt owning a car for a reasonable purpose cagerism is refusing to walk or bike less than a mile because your car is in the shop  cagerism is being an asshole nimby who makes caging the only option in most of our country which is based around car travel because its profitable for those with a stake in it    i have a car for my job and i love it but most days when im not working she just sits there as i walk and bike around or take a train because im not a fat lazy retard
  i agree  for me the only time i would really only be happy with owning a car would be owning some small electric car and just use it to drive to a parkride and then take the train to the city centre or drive to the supermarket and not have to carry several bags of heaving shopping a long distance  driving can be stressful and tiring i have a driving licence and if im honest its more a nessecity rather than a want
i dont think anyone over 20 actually likes driving the novelty wears off after youre a teen and it just turns into a huge annoyance    i still renew my license when its up for renewal but most of the time i just use it for id ive used a car once in the last year and that was when i was on vacation in an unpopulated part of europe
  responsibility is realizing that an americanized lifestyle will wreck the planet
  thankfully i live in an old trolley part of the city which was built without cars in mind so i dont have to make a trip out of grocery shopping i just walk over when i run out of something  its nice to be able to get popcicles home in 95f weather without worry on foot      wrong i love driving so god damned much even automatics frequently i drive out with the intention of getting myself lost and finding my way back
  the incident doesnt seems to be about parking
  point is that cagers dont realize how catered to they are  your in muh way  muh road  fuck off really
  unnecessarily creating source of congestion on public road  yet you claims responsibility  learn to be responsible to the city you live in
  the incident only occured because parking cars blocked one side of the road bike and truck could have just passed peacefully
  muh road  sorry about that ill just get out of my car and walk dont mind me parking my car on muh sidewalk
  dpnt mind me keying the shit out of it before getting it towed
  honey bear theres no real reason why cars should have precedence over everyone else
i hear the frog cagers are still at it
almost 2019  presumably at least 18  still uses babby words like cager  lol you do realize youll never get a girlfriend so long as you talk and act like a babby right or do you plan on becoming a wizard and only ever having 2d waifus you going to get your waifu on a pillow and hug it tight at night lol  still acting and talking like underage b  never going to make it
  fucking hipsters
  ok now this made me want to drive more
  we dont need girlfriends you stupid normie now go get a wife 2 kids 2 cars some mtbs nice ones or bsos a home loan on a house in the middle of nowhere suburbia and enjoy the mainstream media buy everything from walmart while youre at it
  babby  lol   muh waifu loser  lol  you need to be at least 18 to post in this side no im talking about your iq not your age
        cope
  i dont think you understand how much females love feeling oppressed and will immediately hop on any activism bandwagon i bet you actually have to try to get laid pathetic
  keying the shit out of it  and yet youll scream if we put so much as a scratch on some moron standing in the middle of the road
  both are crimes and should be punished accordingly
  has never seen an actual vagina except in free internet porn  cope harder

cage wagies on suicide watch
wagie cagies are protesting live and lighting shit on fire i havent paid this much attention to news in france since their race riots     
thank you based manu for standing up to entitled cager scum
  imagine being such a wagecuck that youre only willing to protest on the weekends because youre worried mr noseberg will fire you
  this i am soon buying a car but mostly for enthusiast reasons and even then mostly cosmetic reasons i dont need it nor does anyone else in my city but they insist on clogging up open space with then anyway parking garages are the only place id park in a city
  what can we do to support him ride tgv while wearing camouflage
notice to all frog cagers    blood is on your hands now   
  i thought cager entitlement was strictly an american phenomenon  where do you live that youve never seen cager autism i want to live there badly
please read my story on my website 
nobody gives a fuck you gigantic faggot kys
lets lol at retarded aviation concepts
airbus
  every retarded concept mockup you see nowadays features fields and windmills in the background
  its after the elites cull the global population down to 500 million
they should make the disc spin so planes can take off vertically you could have a dozen planes taking off at once
  nice troll
  kek
  hmmmm this actually made me think
  hey you know that notoriously stressful and difficult job of controlling air traffic  yeah lets make it a hundred times more stressful and difficult lmao
  im not a pilot but dont you have to take off into the wind also in a straight line did whoever came up with that not have even a basic understanding of aircraft im awestruck
  more or less you can do a slight curvature and you can compensate for crosswind by letting the wing pointing in the wind hang down a little and countering yaw with the rudder    glider pilots are famous for doing that since their airbrakes are often weak as fuck and flying with your nose pointing 30 from your course kills speed rather fast
cleared to land runway360
  that would be runway 00
  that was the whole point behind this concept some nonflyer watched a bunch of crazy crosswind landings videos on youtube and came up with the circle runway for the sole purpose of somehow elminating crosswind factor dude probably thought he would become a multibillionaire aviation demigod but instead the concept got ridiculed right out the gate and rightly became a joke
  is atc job really stressful
  salty
  as an actual pilot this would never work  it takes no thought to figure out why that is
    dead on heres a concept image used to promote a second san francisco bay bridge notice how the unbranded tgv train solar panels and windmills are badly photoshopped in to make it seem green selfdriving cars get four lanes while the train itself gets stuck on the bridge because it lacks overhead wires
kansas city international airport airport code mci direct international flights to toronto mexico city punta cana and reykjavik iceland     built with a unique 3 terminal circular concept that was way too large for the city it serviced never became a regional hub like they envisioned great surface parking and incredibly convenient curbside dropoff to pick someone up you just circle    they are tearing it down because it is allegedly a security risk/too expensive because the airport lacks one main choke point where they can do security theater     they are replacing it with a 2 billion replacement that is inferior in every way except the amount of bathrooms
  except its not those circular terminals are fucking trash on so many levels including from a flow and service perspective the new one will be better and more appropriately sized in every way
  it has a high turnover and suicide rate for a reason
  t mayor sly james
  can someone eggslpain why circle runway wont work
  i guess taking off while cornering doesnt feel great
  you have to land against the wind  wind doesnt blow in a circle it still blows in one direction meaning you can only use 2 tiny bits of that runway which are against the wind
    the circular terminals made sense when it was built right before the era of security checkpoints it was obsolete very quickly and it sucks to use b/c essentially every 2 or so gates has its own security checkpoint you get corralled into a little waiting area and if you want to leave to use the restroom or eat or whatever you have to leave the secured areas and then go back through security to get to your gate again the security lines get backed up when everyone shows up at once to go through them and will back out into the concourse because there are only 1 or 2 scanners per gate area the gate seating can be crowded if you connect there you have to go through security unless you luck out and your connection is at the other gate in the same secured area    but before security theater it was great you parked close to your gate and walked right in it needed a replacement/overhaul badly for the current era    i will say this the time i flew out/in of mci it was clean and seemed well run despite the obvious drawbacks of its design another nice thing was if someone was meeting you to pick you up or see you off they could stand in the concourse right next to the gate there is a glass partition between them
  obstacle clearance is the big one you couldnt possibly put something like this in a big city without having odps in certain directions that require something stupid like a 2000 ft/nm climb gradient after taking off in order to not slam into a building i imagine taking off and landing on a banked runway would also be pretty stressful considering that if you blow a tire or lose an engine the subsequent loss of directional control could send you over the side a lot easier and wing strikes would be pretty common it would definitely require a shit ton of extra training instrument approaches would also be a complete wash an ils is expensive and there would be no way in hell an airport could maintain 36 of them at once and if they only have an ils in each direction the wind is most likely to come from whats the point of the circular runway in the first place id almost think atc at a meme airfield would be less stressful since no company in their right mind would ever send planes there
easa atpl theoretical knowledge syllabus  if you are an european you know what im talking about
  suicide rate  why
  circular runway
all of you smart asses who are saying a circular runway wouldnt work obviously didnt take physics i at uni like i did because then you would know centrifugal force would make the plane go faster take off how do you think a helicopter works einsteins circular motion
problem solved retards    
   i at uni like i did because then you would know centrifugal force would make the plane go faster take off  yes but you dont want it planes are not designed to fly sideways   off how do you think a helicopter works einsteins circular motion  pic related giant prop or how it is called generating lift and small prop on tail is something similar to rudder on plane
  approaching runway  deploy harpoon  tower you have control
  wind doesnt blow in a circle  wrong
  are germans born naturally autistic or do they have to learn it
  kek
  i dont understand how he does loopdeloops without tangling the ropes
  actualy not all germans are like this only about 510 are mildly autistic  however most germans in engineering and posting here are from these 510
  not enough airflow
  u got trolled
  the mains of each plane would be set in chocks so that they would move with the disc and simply take off at the proper speed   the way i see it working is the airport would set maybe 2 or 3 dozen jets up at once and the disc would spin up with the jets fixed to it at vr15 or something each jet would go to full static thrust and simply lift off when the disc got them to the proper speed obviously sids would have to change to enable proper separation but with proper routing this could solve alot of problems associated with weather and delays
    ok ok ok    so the runway moving makes no difference but what if they put a massive fan in front of the flight deck on an aircraft carrier vertical takeoff for every craft
  its a high pressure video game that in a busy airport runs you at the edge of your skill all the time and you can never lose  but some people have fun like that one lady controller at san diego who will send incoming aircraft a heading out into the pacific to see if theyre paying attention to atc
  mate what if theyd put them fans in front of the aircrafts but attached to the aircrafts  instantaneous and completely vertical take off for everyone irregardless of weather or space    give me the nobel price already holy frick
  yeah but now you have to wait for the disc to spin up the planes take off then despin move three new planes on chock them spin it up again    massive amounts of inertia its not going to spin up or down quickly at all     just fuckin terrible throughput
  you mean like this
  no you fool the air from the fan needs to flow over the wings  see this simplified mockup i attached dumbass
  sounds like berlintegel airport
  retarded prediction rising fuel costs will bring back ether the ocean liner or zeppelins   or possibly atomic aircraft
  atomic aircraft wont take off nuclear power is heavy  they will invent turboprop again slower but cheaper
  so like this
  how do you think a helicopter works einsteins    they dont they are just so ugly that the earth repels them
  wasnt this part of the futurama expo
  dont worry anon all that grid nav crp5 twisting you are doing now will pay off no airline or small operator are using ipads anyway so you are just preparing for the future
  i dont get whats wrong    t brainlet
  atc is being a glorified crossing guard and all your customers are atypes who think theyre top gun usually it is orderly and calm but then somebody comes in with an emergency or strange requests that gum everything up    hey i know youve got to land another airplane on this runway every thirty seconds but let me go ahead and make a big mess that makes you have to divert everyone for the next fifteen or more minutes
  whats this a runway for ants
  how many dinosaurs would you have to burn to produce that kind of energy
  hi
  isnt it part of your job to be able to handle emergencies and abnormal flight schedules like that if it wasnt then atc would be completely automated by now god forbid someone says the dreaded e word when they actually should
  shit aviation is full of glorified people  glorified bus drivers glorified crossing guards  but who are flight attendants
  glorified whores
  isnt it obvious glorified waiters
  or possibly atomic aircraft  plane crashes  mini chernobyl
  also  hijack a plane  fucking nuclear bomb      more like glorified train attendants
  thats rediculous
  ya but with an additional fan on the very short runway they could add power to any aircraft and it could take off much more quickly
  and when it gets out of the fan airflow then what
  it flies under its own power just 20 ft off the ground you could launch a jet from a helicopter pad
  i cant find it but i saw a vid of a very small airplane taking off in 0 feet due to a strong head wind
  picturing this post in my head is giving me nightmares
  get on flight sim  find helicopter pad on top of 381 ft tall building  take off during free fall
  fucking nuclear bomb  thats not how reactors work
  at least it will leak radioactive water and shit everywhere
  not if we made it gas cooled
  turboprop  already doing that on shorter routes    anyway im still hoping for suborbital spaceflights for intercontinental flights
    stop playing dumb you two  pushing props posed in front of the wings so it pushes the air to flow over the wings and not pulling props the plane would still need something to speed it up another set of props maybe hence why my mock up graphic included it  is /n/ the dumbo central of 4chan or what
  i know youre just shitposting but a c130 legitimately generates almost half of its lift from prop wash over the wings
  why wouldnt this work
  well radioactive gas will be everywhere    why there are no planes that use hydrogen as fuel can be generated via solar panel lightweight contains a lot of energy slightly explosive but it is not an issue
  radioactive gas will be everywhere  thats not how radiation works a reactor with a core built solid enough should be able to absorb impact and passively cool itself without releasing any of its internal contents
  hydrogen needs to be store either at cryogenic temperatures or ridiculous pressure to achieve adequate storage density at 12000 psi or as a cryogenic liquid hydrogen still takes up 3x the volume of gasoline for the same energy
   radioactive gas   please educate yourself on closedcycle vs opencycle nuclear turbojet    why there are no planes that use hydrogen as fuel   because you dont know about reaction engines or planes and hydrogen    lightweight contains a lot of energy  thx cadet obvious plz do your homework
    oh reactors see  that just means you dont know about gascooled reactors and cooling loops in general
  pulling props are already pushing props from the wings point of view
  stabilators
  a reactor with a core built solid enough should be able to absorb impact and passively cool itself without releasing any of its internal contents  and weight a lot     okay didnt know that it cant be compressed i thought it would be like cng    please educate yourself on closedcycle vs opencycle nuclear turbojet  in case accident reactor might crack and it will be fukushima in air you dont want it jet fuel at least doesnt cause cancer   because you dont know about reaction engines or planes and hydrogen   reaction engine  throws some mass and accelerates   planes  weird aluminium thing with hydraulics and shit  hydrogen  a gas that is quite explosive
felixstowe porte baby with a bristol scout mounted on the upper wing
  no and no both those thing just make it much easier to take off there just needs to be enough airflow over the wings to generate the required lift that counteracts the force of gravity
  the weight of it all should be the same as two engines plus a full load of fuel
  thats a design from before jet engines back then with props you didnt need long runways typically so the idea was that you could turn around from the gate and after receiving clearance just take straight off with no taxing     however factoring in other landing planes and newer jets killed those old airport deisgns
  i dont think so
  what was even the idea here
  in the uk the felixstowe porte baby/bristol scout composite flew in may 1916 the idea was to intercept german zeppelin airships far out to sea beyond the normal range of a land or shore based craft the successful first flight was not followed up due to the ungainliness of the composite in takeoff and its vulnerability in flight from 1921 a series of types were adapted as carriers for gliders used as aerial targets  i dont really understand how the interceptor idea makes sense though
  thats what drop tanks are for
  i dont know how well youd do trying to get a bristol scout carrying drop tanks airborn
  i love tegel youre through checkin and security and at the gate in like 10 minutes and when you land it takes like 5 minutes from the plane to the parking lot with taxis ill miss it
  now this is pod racing
  what id like to know is how the train cars can flex like that
cargo airships  neat idea but itll never find any investors or really any support  its too slow to beat road or rail freight and its just too awkward to make it viable as some sort of remote area access thing  its better to just dump the idea or if necessary make it some military concept like some sort of ampibious landing resupply craft
  it would be cool to have rockets being launched from cargo airships
  gas cooled mean jack shit when an reactor get cracked open due to external force of collision
  full service carriers
  i know these arent that worthwhile economically but they are so fucking gangster
  i want these to be real so bad
  aircraft suspension is really not cut out for taking turns at high speeds
  airplanes do have suspension
  pic related      no they just slam 400 t into the ground with only the tyres to cushion it lol  
  the train cars are curving to the shape of the bridge
  one moment you have a headwind  the next you have a tailwind
  atomic aircraft wont take off nuclear power is heavy  murica couldve hypothetically done it in the fifties but the costs and benefits were full retard especially when nuclear subs were so relatively easy
  murica couldve hypothetically done it in the fifties  no they couldnt have it just doesnt work
  yes we could the convair nb36h is proof a reactor could be placed in an aircraft even if that example didnt power the engines it definitely could then you have something like project pluto while it is a missile and not an aircraft its proof nuclear powered ramjet propulsion is possible its all very possible that is if you dont mind the trail of fallout nuclear engines produce
  what is that man wearing
  
  i still dont know what hes wearing
  imagine the amount of noise that would be caused by aircagers sounds like we dodged a bullet
  
    turbo props are still very much alive and kicking and still receiving refinements theyre just relegated to light aircraft and cargo planes i for one embrace our turboprop overlords and long for a renaissance in supersonic turbo props like the xf84h make tinnitus great again
    on the ground run ups the prototypes could reportedly be heard 25 miles 40 km away unlike standard propellers that turn at subsonic speeds the outer 2430 inches 6176 cm of the blades on the xf84hs propeller traveled faster than the speed of sound even at idle thrust producing a continuous visible sonic boom that radiated laterally from the propellers for hundreds of yards the shock wave was actually powerful enough to knock a man down an unfortunate crew chief who was inside a nearby c47 was severely incapacitated during a 30minute ground run coupled with the already considerable noise from the subsonic aspect of the propeller and the t40s dual turbine sections the aircraft was notorious for inducing severe nausea and headaches among ground crews in one report a republic engineer suffered a seizure after close range exposure to the shock waves emanating from a poweredup xf84h    what the actual fuck
  thunderscreech wasnt supersonic you grapefruit
  the propeller was
  this is like the conventional version of nuclear propulsion could probably kill people by just flying overhead
  why wouldnt this work
  on short final  sudden gusting crosswind  runway 15 just became runway 24  fug go arou  crash
  what about a rotating cross then
  lol
  doesnt really matter it might only swivel 30 degrees then and youd still be screwed regardless if i see my entire runway start moving while im on final im not going to try to land on it
  i dont think anyone is seriously suggesting it would _freely_ rotate in the wind you could mechanically rotate it to match prevailing wind while aircraft arent trying to land on it    the more obvious answer is actually building that thing large enough to work for modern aircraft plus the whole you know planes flying towards a building problem
  autistic screeching  the plane
  biggest problem would be how you would get passenger jets up and down to and from the runway
      the russians allegedly flew nuclear powered planes but left out heavy but essential shielding the pilots got the cancer
  also you can fuel turboprops with natural gas with synthetic fuels or even electric fed by a hydrogen fuel cell with very little impact on the vehicle weight if aviation survives the era of environmentalism itll be through one of these principles
  project pluto was fucking satanic prove me wrong
  commercial pilot here youve got one job and its easy a fastfood team leader could do it the shit i have to listen to from these imbalances is just astounding its a good job we have to remind these clots how to do their job because if not planes would be colliding constantly
  the russians flew a functioning reactor some shielding  
  the train itself gets stuck on the bridge because it lacks overhead wires  electric trains dont need overhead wires thats just the best choice not the only one
  bart runs off the third rail too mind
  electric fed turboprop  what did he mean by this
  electric motor powering the prop with a hydrogen fuel cell providing the charge instead of a traditional battery
  where is the turbo then
  imagine these things using hydrogen fuel in like 60 years when weve figured out how to do that    an airship full of hydrogen     thats never gone wrong
  use a big circular wind tunnel instead
  you have to land against the wind  thats stupid if that was the case you could only land on a given airport on very specific days of the year when the wind just happens to coincide with the orientation of the runway
  to be fair using hydrogen as fuel instead of for lift means that itd be pressurized in a special tank rather than consisting of the bulk of the craft
  if only we could pressurize hydrogen efficiently or there was a nice durable catalyst to use alcohol in a fuel cell
the energy density of batteries is ten times less than hydrocarbons and braking is not as muhc of an energy waste in the sky and biofuels are carbon neutral anyway hahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahaha faggots ahahhahaha
  muh lithium ion city hopper has been posted here like a thousand times /n/ is full of libtard bootlicker tesla elon dickriders hahahahhahahaha why is it efags always want to use the government to force people to use what htey think is cool but really gay    a small trainer makes more sense but is still gay and you might as well have a generator bruning ffuel to power distributed thrust apps
  biofuels arent carbon neutral though thats why theyre an utter failure they require that you replace highly productive in the biological sense of the term woodland with low productive intensive agriculture which requires shittons of petroleumbased fertilizers
  he doesnt know about algae derived biofuels     ayy m8 aigh don u giv it a google aigh don ya    why do the authoritarian crony corporate socialists hate algae biofeul because it can be made decentralized by poor people with a few two liter bottles and is much harder to patent unlike batteries which rely on minerals from military occupied zones and which rely on centralized production and can be patented     
  any proofs it looks a bit dodgy  fertilizers are mostly nitrogenbased no carbon there plants/algae consume carbon from air to grow almost all carbon in biomass is coming from co2 in the air lye and methanol or substitutes are in closed cycle  so all carbon in the biofuel is coming from the air
  fertilizers are mostly nitrogenbased  how do you think the transportation and processing of said nitrogen compounds is realized modern agriculture is absolutely not carbonneutral  if youre old enough to post on this board surely youll remember how colza production was the hot shit in the mid 00s        algae fuel is great in theory but for now its just amateurs producing small quantities at loss call me when its viable
  call me when its viable  it already is the tech is being suppressed
  algae fuel is great in theory    ok so you conceded that the apex of energy storage is biofuel it just needs more research and the reason it hasnt got it is because of a political conspiracy
  the tech is being suppressed  how would that even work theres a bunch of different countries who would benefit greatly from not needing to import as much oil why would they collaborate to harm themselves  do you have any evidence at all for that
    all oecd countries have an enormous interest in such a technology why would they try to suppress it at all
      look at the lies elon propagates about it and they invest shit tons into solar wind and batteries without investing much into alage fuels    maybe the corn lobby is to blame as well they dont want anyone else producing biofuels and the palm oil farmers     its speculation but its also likely and totally reasonable to be suspicious when they shill for wind energy and carbon taxes and shit and if im not mistaken biofuel would be penalized in some of the carbon taxes which is just fucking utter batshit
  no shit he means you should always try to land on the runway that provides a headwind component even if its 30/60/80 degrees off runway heading the circle runway was designed with the idea of always providing headwind on landing but that anon said how pointless it is when youll just end facing away from the wind as you go around the circle
  look at the lies elon propagates about it  elon says dumb shit all the time but hes in no position to suppress anything    they invest shit tons into solar wind and batteries without investing much into alage fuels  because investments in wind solar and batteries pay themselves off very quickly algae is much more speculative    maybe the corn lobby is to blame as well they dont want anyone else producing biofuels and the palm oil farmers  how again do you have any evidence at all    its speculation but its also likely and totally reasonable  youre claiming theres vast international conspiracy to suppress biofuel development that requires more support than seems reasonable to me    if im not mistaken biofuel would be penalized in some of the carbon taxes which is just fucking utter batshit  only if the power used comes from fossil fuels under an ets it could potentially generate credits
  and women in atc are the fucking worst nothings worse than having some overwhelmed cunt get defensive and snippy because her sad woman brain cant into spatial/abstract thinking and attention to detail
  youll just end facing away from the wind as you go around the circle  should not matter much as you will be decelerating rapidly as soon as the nose wheel touches down wind is not going to be a huge factor anymore
  come on and slam and welcome to the jam
  back to r/incel with you
  lin hendrix one of the republic test pilots assigned to the program flew the aircraft once and refused to ever fly it again   hendrix also told the formidable republic project engineer you arent big enough and there arent enough of you to get me in that thing again  this makes me giggle every time
  how would this be kept in the air that looks way too heavy to be buoyant
  they either would use the lightest gas hydrogen or no gas pure vacuum which is the most boyant thing you can fill a ballon with only issue is our atmosphere is too high in pressure to support a vacuum ballon mars though can
  vacuum     what the fuck
    nasa is considering using vacuum airships for a future mission to mars this vacuum airship will fly through the martian atmosphere collecting data and also photographing large parts of the martian surface from much closer than any previous satellite has managed it  vacuum airships are theoretically possible on earth however the main issue here is that the 100kpa air pressure at sea level will crush the vacuum airship unless it was incredibly strong
guys
    are there any actual recordings of how it sounded or did it blast all the audio recording equipment to shreds as well
  to maximize the effect what you need is semi circular wings the prop position doesnt matter that much            personally despite the drag disadvantage this concept makes way more sense than the osprey ever did
  turbo props are still very much alive and kicking  there are no new commercial turboprops and havent been for years all they do it make old 8s and atrs when production of those stops which will be soon the end of turboprop will begin
  you really think a tape recording could give you even a glimpse of an idea of how it possibly sounded approximately
  you guys do not want your cum bottles exposed to direct sunlight
  approximately  yes very approximately but still or at least a footage of windows cracking and people rolling on the ground in agony clutching their ears would be nice  i imagine it sounded like very fucking loud brrrrrrrrrt from hell except it never goes out of ammo
   the end of turboprop will begin  beginning of hybridelectric turboprop and allelectric propellers
  will it have priuslike cvt and energy recuperation
    probably on the fuelcell as you can use a fuelcell as combustor/topping cycle for a gas turbine
    safran is back to doing open rotor research recently though it depends on whether you want to count that in the same way there was ukranian research into ducted turboprops not a turbofan but literally a retrofitted duct around a turboprop very wide duct and in some ways one could say geared turbofans are awfully close to ducted turboprops
    nope good electric motors and high design rpm means no cvt needed regen on a plane is just not worth it    will will see innovation in turboshaft engines which are turboprop cousins as generators honeywell had a prototype recently of a turboshaft with a compact 1mw generator for darpa lightning strike demo turboshafts/oversize apus in tailcones will become a thing to use exhaust to fill in fuselage wakes for drag reduction while powering distributed propulsion
  then what do you use the forced induction from the turbo for if the motor is electric
  i mean prius cvt which is two motors and planetary gearset
  turboprops will never die as long as the military exists
    pressurizing the fuelcell run that fucker hot and hard
  as a a320 rated i find this post to be offensive sir please check your privilege
    arent these just straight vectors of wind with suction pulling them into a vortex
  tegel is one of my favorite airports in the world so cozy such awesome a e s t h e t i c sill be really heartbroken when its gone
  literal aerospace engineer it would work but how do you get the aircraft out of the airstream of the fan where its motionless relative to the fan and into the free air where it suddenly has to be moving fast you cant you could accelerate the fan down a track and keep the aircraft in the fan stream while it accelerates but then why not just let the aircraft take off normally
just my bad luck
im not very happy when i have to drive either
  put the phone down you inbred retard
  what language is that
  norwegian
  man up center line is not solid and they are keeping sensible distance
  i dont understand are there not usually other vehicles on the road
  the amount of hate learner drivers cop from fully licensed drivers and the amount of pressure on them to perform exactly perfectly from the get go is part of the reason why im not that interested in learning to drive thanks for helping me become a cyclist and public transport user
  you cant learn to drive in like an elementary school parking lot on the weekend or something do you live on taris
  lol nice kotor reference driving requires a lot of concentration especially before driving becomes second nature  was learning in a manual which adds to the complexity now these last three years ive lived in melbourne and brisbane and i havent bothered to ask anyone to teach me how to drive now its been so long since ive driven i feel like id hardly remember how to do it i dont think the nsw speed restrictions on learners helped me in any way if anything rolling like a snail doing 90 km/h on a 110 km/h freeway just made me feel anxious all the time  i feel like other people dont have the same sense of danger but i could never feel comfortable behind the wheel i cant imagine what its like in america just casually getting behind the wheel of a car by yourself aged 15 like in some american states  lastly i despise the fact that getting a drivers licence is a rite of passage but teenagers will make a big deal about these things i guess just think about it getting your provisional/whatever licence is order for congratulations and not to diminish the effort ti does take but nobodys there congratulating you on figuring ou how to ride your bike safely on the road more like many of them think youre weird or concerned for your safety nor have i really met anyone who says gee i really think its great how much you know about how our public transport system works

  no i prefer incity coaching pay less than for city bus seats are comfier 10/10
sleeper coach
  ew just open air sleeping with a bunch of people disgusting
  theyre targeting the lower end demography in china during the chinese new year period they can even put additional passenger on those corridor in between not really that bad consider the space in between and compares to regular coach however this arrangement have poor safety record and its production have been terminated 5 years ago with many operators retiring them prematurely too
  wwwridecabincom/  america does it better
  looks more comfortable but also theres only half the people there so the price is probably over twice as large
  being a niche thing it would be a lot more than double
    its near double the price of flight ride cabin is closer to proper accomodation that theres more service and attendants than normal sleeper buses more of a literal moving luxury hotel with capsules i bet if the attendant can be cut and drinks change to self service the cost can go down to more comparable levels   for a closer but still off instance of quality highend service japans more luxurious overnight bus market has at most only recliner seats in enclosed individual compartments its like 50 more expensive than shinkansen
   theres an amenity kit its more of a premium businessclass service downstairs of the cabin bus is a lounge and other nonrevenue space thats a big profin margin needed to be compensated
  paying more than in a plane so that you complete the journey in 1/9th of the time
  in 9 times the time oops
  those more expensive japanese buses are almost all failed trials why would one choose to take them instead of plane/train even there are some that want to do so the demand would also be very small that it would be hard to sustain

do you guys collect     /train/ related items    been eyeing this jr east pin on ebay for that autism flex    
  45 american dollars  anon no  i saw these for 500 yen in a gacha machine at tamtam a few months ago 45 dollars is beyond gouging
  its still cheaper than the us1000 roundtrip ticket to tokyo to drop 500 into the gacha machine c
  its still cheaper than the us1000 roundtrip ticket to tokyo to drop 500 into the gacha machine c  i bet you dont know how to search for cheap flights unless you live in somewhere like saint helena theres no way it would cost that much for round trip to tokyo
  show me a 45 plane ticket retard
  you bet  i have a jnr police dagger a tobu railway driver briefcase and a bunch of various maps and train schedule charts not to mention all those gucci railroad pocketwatches i have

  nope all seikos i have jnr jgr tokyu eidan and jr east     the jnr dagger is a part of the uniform that the rail police that guard the emperor in imperial transportation functions pretty neat thing i picked up for 70
  post pics daggerbro
i think its finally time we discuss this franchise
/tv/
  ah there she is the face that smashed a thousand boners
    obligatory
  this is the most autistic thing ive seen all week
  why do you people insist on sharing that link
i unironically like the railway series books and the early tv episodes that are faithful to the source material i enjoy rereading them every so often i guess that makes me autistic  but something i really like about the books is for the most part the illustrations are realistic barring the engines having faces of course theyre made to look accurate i guess i like that even though the content is aimed at children theres no dumbingdown of the presentation as if kids are retards who wont comprehend anything but basic shapes
  are you me i reread the books about once a year the railway series is probably why i like uk trains more than us ones honestly    also theres an officialbooks lore book for the series that goes into beyond crazy detail
  listing locomotives in alphabetic instead of numeral order  what the fuck  also heres the pdf of the lore book  
  i havent watched in years but from what ive seen theyve moved to their moviestyle cgi for their television series as well cant say i like the choice i grew up on that model railway style and will always remember it as such    whats worse are the toys i went to toys r us back when it wasnt yet kill because i wanted to get my little stepbrother a wooden thomas train for his birthday i figured that not too much had changed since when i had stopped playing with them besides some new engines or more complex features i was wrong theyve seemed to have gone for a chunky minimalist look for the new generation i have a whole box of my old thomas trains stored away in a room in my mothers basement and seeing that convinced me to never let them go if i ever do get around to starting a family they aint playing with the shit i saw in that toys r us
  the new thomas wood stuff feels like a one step forward two steps back kind of deal on one hand i like some of the added detailssplashers and painted buffers on the other hand most of the new cuts are obvious downgradesno domes shortening the big engines tenders are literal blocks on wheels stephen it got so bad that mattel is ditching the unpainted wood aesthetic and reverting to the original painted wood
  from your post i assume you are not native to the uk i am and thats another appeal of the series to me  the earlier books kind of capture that feeling of british rural life of the 40s and 50s its nostalgic even though i wasnt alive back then just wondering what your opinion is if any on that    i also love that the rev w awdry went into such minute detail and all of it again barring talking engines pretty realistic and grounded
  from your post i assume you are not native to the uk  im from the us to me its like a history book and it definitely helped to shape my interest in british railways and locos i find it much more interesting than us railways
  i grew up in the uk as well and i suppose that a lot of the childrens books which were introduced to me were those books though i must admit that i dont remember all that much from them there were more unusual aspects i remember more the fables to try and teach something about morals to kids and whatever  i also remember the much older television series which used a mix of the eyes moving around and the model trains moving on some sort of model railway system i think it was on itv or something dunno at any rate i think that made me interested in model railways as a kid though i did grow out of it my father on the other hand kept being interested in model railways throughout his life and in retirement started looking into modelling narrow gauge railways which were around in the 1950s not far from where he grew up i dont think hes interested in the actual setup of it but rather having the models  eh i find it somewhat ironic that of all things im actually far more interested in modern and high speed rail than steam trains while they are quaint hsr is the future and perhaps we will see another albeit different golden age of rail we might only see it in europe and asia but im excited for it    a lot of the british railways are shit now one of the big reasons is the fact that many railways failed to upgrade from their victorian construction i much prefer modern european railways over british ones but that said a lot of the germanic steam locomotives were much more impressive at least for their size and power as long distance locomotives  ultimately britain has one man to blame for this beeching
  i see i also prefer uk railways but thats probably home bias as its naturally the one i grew up learning about   is there any sort of american equivalent to thomas a series of stories about us locomotives as far as i can recall theres only one american loco in the whole of the railway series and he only appears in a flashback as a rude reckless asshole who gets turned into a pumping engine as punishment doesnt exactly leave the best impression on a kid as to what us engines are like
  cant you americans accept anything we make without dumbing it down and begging for diversity
  is there any sort of american equivalent to thomas a series of stories about us locomotives  as far as the realism/historic side of things goes nope thomas was pretty unique in that respect    as far as i can recall theres only one american loco in the whole of the railway series and he only appears in a flashback as a rude reckless asshole who gets turned into a pumping engine as punishment  id like to think he gets the last laugh in the end
  alec baldwin is not my conductor
the model series was great
  im just gonna leave this here     the new series is something specially stupid the only upside is spillover interest into ho scale trains and classic thomas on amazon prime my 4 year old likes new 16 month old like old starts yelling excitedly when i select prime on the roku
  the model series was much better than the weird cgi stuff these days  ill admit that it wasnt the greatest but at least it had a certain charm to it which the cgi doesnt have
tesla fag site wants to know why you dont own a tesla what does 4chan think    
  where is the i need to drive more than 300 km per day occasionaly option
  ideologically left out
  i dont trust tesla  its a mix of them violating right to repair their use of a proprietary charging adaptor and them also being way more expensive than they should be    if i were to get an electric car it would mostly likely be a nissan volkswagen bmw or mitsubishi at least they have normal car waranty and other policies i can go to a normal car dealership and i can only buy the car and rent out the battery plus they all use standard charging connectors
  i agree i think tesla is overrated i dont trust them either
  because it is electric and my electricity is way as expensive as gasoline considering price of tesla  i better buy gasenwagen with tdi
  interesting my electricity is cheaper than gas but that doesnt make tesla affordable
  in my shithole any ev will cost in fuel nearly as much as gas i hate it considering amount of sun we have
i am opposed to individual motorized traffic
  hi fellow spaniard
  more like earthquake spic but close enough
does the rest of the world have the ability to buy the chevy volt thats a real nice electric car test drove it last month and id buy it if i wasnt fundamentally opposed to buying new cars    i dont know how to buy an lectric car used ive become pretty good at spending my money on the gasoline powered used market id probably just get fleeced
  they call it ampera here due to the metric system
  actually the name has nothing to do with the metric system as both volts and amperes are metric units  in the us canada japan china and brazil it is sold as either the chevrolet volt or the buick velite 5  in the united kingdom is it called the vauxhall ampera and in the rest of europe it is the opel amepera  in australia and new zealand it is called the holden volt    different gm brands different names
how can you even use volts in nonmetric system  1 volt is a derived unit which is equal to the potential difference between two points in space which makes you spend 1 joule of energy to move 1 coulomb of charge between those two points does it make any sense in imperial units whats 1 joule 073757 footpound force wtf
  this poll assumes youre actually interested in driving a car at all
  preferably on the train station
  no need for having my own car
    they are holding back the technology for lightweight batteries as they dont want people building flying cars
they left out cages should be banned
  why would i when i already have a bike
  the hip point is too low triggers back pain on long drives
i dont have to drive meaning cars to me are for fun and arent appliances would never personally want a tesla because you will never be able to run through the gears even in 30 or 40 years when most cars are electric and automated the top car companies will still make ice sports cars
  wena culiao xd
  tesla model 3  long drive
  if i ever bought a car it would be a tesla but i dont intend to ever get a car     
everyone in this thread is clinically retarded
  wow you sure told everyone
unpopular opinion but im god  lets see some memes
  sleeper trains are the future of long distance travel when aeroplanes become economically unviable due to fuel costs and no alternative fuel types like hydrogen can be used
i think sleeper busses are way more into the future till of course one has an accident
    that one eye open sleep you have to do on sleeper cars whose doors dont lock    or you just tie a shoelace to your arm and the shoelace to the door    either way it is difficult to punch gypsies effectively when one arm is tied up or you are groggy
airbus makes best buses
british rail was alright
  when i was a kid in the earlymid 00s my mom took me on a trip to the alps from paris to go skiing that was the first and last time i took a night train nowadays when i try to visit my family in paris i live 1 200 km from there i either change trains twice for a total of 12 hours of travel or i take the flying cage theres barely any night train service anymore
  wait what theres like 50 trains a day to lyon and then about 6 departures an hour to grenoble
boeing is weird company that would modify outdated 1960 aircraft 737 when they had 1980 aircraft 757 that could be modified much more easily to fill same niche as 737 ng and max
  lrn2supplychain broham
  does it matter same companies still supply parts for 767 and 787 and probably 777 unification is much more important
  most sleeper trains have keycards for the door now much like a hotel    the intercités du nuit is not in a great place from what i understand theyre all trains from gare dausterlitz to all the parts of france and the only decent sleeper service in france is the open access operator thello which is a sleeper train from gare de lyon to venice  the third sleeper train which is out of the price range of most people is the rzd service from gare de lest through düsseldorf hauptbahnhof berlin hauptbahnhof warsaw minsk and then finally to moscow belorussky station    not great but at least you can get from paris to berlin overnight
  not sure where the post author was from but he have stated the distance was  1200km
how would /n/ feel about /simg/ relocating here     /vg/ moves to fast on the account of the 50 loli rape simulator threads shilled every second our thread moves way to slowly to keep up     would /n/ mods allow it same basic things are discussed might even get new people interested in sims
  simulators are alright there is simulator thread on /o/ all the time i think this belongs here
  there is no way the person who has that has regular sex
  im a /bike/ but i like all the styles of /n/  we have permanent threads for model trains and train sims i dont see how another thread like them would hurt anything  but i am unfamiliar with the /v/ culture if they treat us like over there and start fagging up our board ima be pissed
im ok with this experience has shown that mods on /n/ can be really inconsistent though so who knows what they think
  /simg/ isnt really /v/ we are probably the least /v/ gaming subset on the site there are more people that play japanese waifu diaper play games than sims
  no i doubt anyone would allow it not that id be against it pics related
  at least it isnt a train

  sitting that close to a big ol tv  do you have terrible eyesight already so you just say fuck it
  not knowing that in combat flight sims you will be straining your eyes looking for specks
  id have no problem with /simg/ being here our mods are kinda weird though and sometimes delete threads for no real reason so idk how theyd react
  i think theyre both equally repellent to pussy
  tfw they deleted a thread about howard hughes  let shitty threads about bicycles seats stay around instead
how about a different kind of flightsim    simpleplanes lets you build your own planes and then fly them

       should ets be counted as an /o/ simulator or /n/ simulator
   ppl is 3k  yeah right
  more like 6k or 7k but the point is if youre going to be putting out that much money why not fly for real
  more like 89  he probably didnt bought all at once  and maybe hell never have this much money ever again
  because a pilots license alone is this costly and then youre still short a plane nevermind flying anything other than a dinky two seater prop or in any place other than your dinky nowheretown air strip
  i think all /o/ is welcome in /simg/
  i think it counts as being /n/ enough and certainly has the autism required to flourish here

    you can make a lot more than just cessna clones
  with the recent update with trailer ownership and theyre slowly improving the cargo market economy i think ets2/ats has taken steps towards being more /n/
  i think the f14 has to be my favourite fighter ever it just looks so damn sexy
redpill me on the a6  can load a shitload of ordinance  reasonably fast  carrier based  e version can self lase and track via pic related    it sound very nice but it also was ass raped in nam  is it a meme or does it deserve some respect
  if they have the money to buy a setup like that they likely have a good job which means they likely are married could even be an airliner pilot    of course it could also just be an autistic hermit with tons of money but still
  maybe he sexes his own persona
  zibo 737    its even free
why the thread is so active what has happened did animu save /simg/ if so nenecchi is happy uguu1
why the fuck /simg/ is on /n/ this should be on /vg/ as its fucking computer games doesnt make any sense you retard
transportation     tank simulators  submarine simulators  fighter planes    sure they transport but they also encompass whole spectrum of various military doctrines     person who made this thread is a fucking retard and this should be deleted
/simg/ is computer games and thus it belongs to videogame generals proper thread here     fuck off op retard
  
  no one on v gives a shit about sims theyre braindead babbies    at least here the average poster is actually above 18 years of age
  it actually did save /simg/    so what happenes now were split on two boards
    example of welcome games  flight sims  falcon bms dcs world rise of flight il2 combat helo microsoft flight simulator xplane enemy engaged comanche vs hokum strike fighters x  driving games  assetto corsa rfactor 2 live for speed euro truck sim train simulator farming simulator 201x dirt rally omsi 2  most if not all carfags are at   ground sims  sam simulator steel beasts pro steel armor blaze of war graviteam tactics combat mission  submarine sims  silent hunter ship simulator cold waters dangerous waters  misc sims  command x swat 4    this thread doesnt belong here you see these these are videogames simulations about various subjects /simg/ is about these  to put it under transportation is retarded and doesnt make any sense i reported this thread as offtopic already
i hate it here    but i brought the sabre
  no bike simulator
  what do you think spin machines are
  what if i want to play bike sim with controller
  were split on two boards    this wasnt a /simg/ thread it was a thread only asking the population of /n/ what they thought about us moving here
  intruder and prowler deserve mucho respect on account of being extremely underrated while doing a ton of heavy lifting  lets hope heatblur gets to make their a6 module instead of the other mouthbreathers
  au contraire
  it sound very nice but it also was ass raped in nam  this has more to do with the escorts than the plane itself that era in nam was the era of guns who the fuck needs those when we have guided missiles in an era where rearaspect missiles had a 77 hit rate if they even fired off at all
  sitting real close doesnt actually damage your vision though
  lol i want ebike simulator now
  all sims are military sims    full retard
  some sims arent games though
  word on the street is that the ai intruder to be released with the tomcat has a lot of work put in to make it possible to transition to the full model
  show me an air superiority cessna
  how about a ground strike cessna
  where the fuck did he find an actual usaf fighter helmet and mask ive been looking everywhere and all i find are shitty russian ones
  actually buying the flying triangle  why
  f4 phantom master race
one thread for /n/ related sims should be ok
  speak for yourself
      samefage have a bump
  one need only sit on a knife edge wearing lycra while masturbating and venting on 4chan
  try it and see
  yeah been wanting that for years
delete based pregnant anne frank thread  let this shit live  wtf mods
im impressed at how much less ded this is than its counterpart on /vg/
  lol what majority of people who build things like that are middle aged married men with children a term simdads exists for a reason  theres one british dude who has a call attendant switch in his boeing cockpit connected to the bell at the kitchen to call his wife
  lol what majority of people who build things like that are middle aged married men with children    so no regular sex then
  are you retarded or something
  are you
  married couple cant have sex just because they have kids  you are either retarded or underage
  can means do  wew lad
  its not less dead the whole board is dead so the thread looks less dead
  the board is dead because summer is over and the bike fags have stopped larping and gone back to caging
this thread is offtopic and doesnt belong to transportation do you not understand simulator games are not about driving from a to b but lot of other things  real thread here   
report this thread it is offtopic and doesnt belong to /n/ op is too retarded to understand this fact and also op is too stupid to even use the official /simg/ info text your thread doesnt have anything to do with simulators    unless you want to make your own truck simulator thread for /n/ thats your call but you cant put arma cold waters and so on under transportation as this doesnt have anything to do with computer simulator games or military    why do you keep insisting this stupid move i hope mods would do their work for once    this is the proper thread  
  make your own truck simulator thread for /n/ thats your call  mods deleted it when i tried that im still bitter about it
  driving from a to b  youre right ill make a car thread
  my local surplus store gets them on occasion theyre outrageously expensive though its also one of the beststocked surplus stores in the country because they supply a ton of stuff to the movie industry and so they can afford to outbid everybody when shit comes up for surplus auction
  majority of people who build things like that are middle aged married men with children    if you are middle aged  married  kids you are seldom if ever fucking and thats a fact idiot
/simg/ on /n/  just fucking die already /n/ can die too the most useless board on the whole site even /ck/ is less shit than this dead city
  holy shit go make another thread about bike seats you fucking autismo
we already have train simulators here i am ok with this move       big rigs are joint custody with /o/ having primary custody ets should probably be the same
/simg/ dead for days on /vg/  this thread is still up after 2 weeks on /n/    yet faggots complain about a move here because of cold waters and shit considering nobody ever fucking talks about cold waters or any sim other than flight sims i think we should make this permanent fuck /vg/
  i think a big problem with having /simg/ in /n/ is that the majority of posters will be discussing transportation machines equipped/operated as weapons i dont think there are weapon systems anywhere else on this board
  given how slow /n/ is i really dont think its going to matter if one mostly dead general has posters talking about weapons on their vehicles and hopefully wed get more talk about civs sims anyway
in other news are there any fight sim addon developers that arent drama causing scum bags fucking orbx and their not so required requirements
    civsim welcome milsim can fuck off to 
  lol i saw that i think the answer is no  ive been having a lot of fun with freeware lately    no hud  cant see shit at night  all safety systems on  went to wikipedia and copied the mp of the stations onto a piece of paper so i could know when to stop  holy shit max comfy
   i approve of this we sure could use the help whenever the entire page is taken up with bikefags  trainfags heck a bunch of our guys here already post screenshots of their simming anyway
well no one has posted a new /simg/ in about six days at this point so is the move official
  pretty much but then again no one is posting
on a scale from 0 to bush pilot how hyped are you for deadstick    am a computer gaming and sim fan but still only learnt about it from a written plane magazine yesterday    
  never heard of it before but it looks nice
  apparently its gonna be super realistic and not just a indie game    weight distribution of cargo affects plane handling  maintenance and preflight checks need to be done  parts wear differently according to how you treat the plane eg full throttle or hard landings  plane can be modified in a variety of ways all of which affect the starting flying and landing behavior and versatility  will include severe weather effects
  apparently its gonna be super realistic and not just a indie game  yeah yeah heard it all before    frankly i dont care about realism so much as i care about immersivness that means a living breathing world outside the cockpit that gives me a reason to fly     and preflight checks need to be done  parts wear differently according to how you treat the plane eg full throttle or hard landings  that sounds cool and all but unless they make the game airplane mechanic and not jus filling in forms that sounds boring
  im crashing my shitbox into a pine tree while trying to drink my coffee/10
how should i tell people on the ed forums that theyre worthless slavs and should suck my dick i try to submit a bug report and people literally start misquoting studies to show that its not a bug it is and its working as intended its not
  personally 0  but i hope its good and i hope others get enjoyment out of it      apparently its gonna be super realistic and not just a indie game  dynamic maintenance is fun
im enjoying xplane 11 i tried to enjoy fsx but the graphics killed the immersion for me
  jus b urself dood
  im enjoying fsx i tried xplane but it offered me nothing i didnt already have with fsx and i will stick to p3d when i upgrade my sim
  like shadows
  i think modern graphics in sims has spoiled me a little im not saying its a bad sim by any means but xplane just looks a little more pleasing to the eye for me its partly this reason why i doubt i could ever go back to playing il246 in any prolonged way again
  its a great plane mane
release new features and bug fixes for hornet  new features broken  bugs not fixed  only 5 more years of early access
  masturbating will give you hairy palms too
  what was your complaint about i know ed forums are pretty bad when it comes to worshipping the devs but ive seen some pretty stupid complaints before i remember one kid was bitching about the mig21 fm being broken and although it does have a lot of flaws the thing he was complaining about was retarded think he was trying to hold something like 80 km/h at a level attitude clean and complained that the jet wouldnt fly straight and instead fall out of the sky like a normal jet would do under such conditions
  i wish i saved the webm spoilerbecause it was hilarious/spoiler but when the hornet first dropped some anon was on here fuming because it was impossible to land on the carrier  he came in way to fast too low and bounced the hook on the bolter he never applied any power and the jet sinks into the water  halfway until hes swimming he decides to add some power and retract the gear while still descending to davey jones    shit was hilarious
lol
  that pic  into orbit my sides go
  kerbal space program is better
ats has volvo trucks when did this happen
    added them a couple days ago when they released the special transport dlc
we dont need no stinking steering wheel
cant keep a thread alive in /vg/  select /n/ one of the slowest boards ever  victoryjpg  no not being able to keep a thread alive in your board means youre not popular enough    btw how hasnt anyone talked about bve mostly asian content /openbve mostly western content its a great simulator openbve is good too if you also have great content to go with it
omsi der omnibussimulator  is this good
to the anon who was doing a day by day rise of flight career are you here how did your career go did you make it to today
  still the best bus sim out there omsi 2 i mean it does have some serious performance and stability problems but when it works its great
m must rtb back to /vg/
  why tf would someone want to build something like that that probably costs close to 10k    i sit in that particular type of a cockpit tens of hours a week cannot fathom someone would like to do it as a hobby
  would love it i drift a lot and have never even bothered with /vg/ please do relocate here yall    mods please let it happen we have a 5 year old thread here we can have a vidya general
  cargo is /n/ though just not for passengers why would freight boats be allowed for so long if it wasnt
  people never get to do it as a job so they wanted to try to get as close to that as possible    but seems like they have been back to /vg/ now after this brief trial
  my 3d and i just got a puppy and we arent having regular sex anymore so at least this dude isnt cleaning up piss and shit in addition to not getting laid
  holy fuck is that the average total ordnance a plane like so carries never read about the munitions fighters and cas jets carry and thats quite impressive
  thats all the ordnance it is capable of carrying but not at once    hardpoints 5 hardpoints with a capacity of 3600 lb 1600 kg each 4 under wings 1 under fuselage 18000 lb 8200 kg totalwith provisions to carry combinations of  what you see in the photo
the virgin group claims another victim    
  virgin trains east coast gets resurrected i guess just in another east coast    ultimately im not really fussed i dont live in florida or nevada and i think virgin america is already a respected airline i dont know the reputation virgin atlantic has in the us virgin galactic has resorted to using a former virgin atlantic 747400 for high altitude smallsat launches since spaceshiptwo is a dying project    virgin trains in britain at least is functioning ok and virgin media owns all the cable tv and broadband in the uk too but i mean richard branson isnt going to take over the world is he
the virgin brightline   the chad virgin
i really liked the brightline branding hard to think they are going to have to change all of that mere months after theyve launched
  im honestly gonna miss it i might try and buy some brightline merch while theyre still selling it who knows might be a collectors item one day
  virgin trains pulled but siemens locamotives powered by cummins engine  i swear this is nothing but an elaborate sex joke
  inb4 all the trains get renamed to sexual innuendos to complete the circle  gonna miss the colornaming scheme they have right now but if it means that brightblue becomes the minuteman thats fine with me
  the virgin trains usa vs the chad brightline
  fuck now im trying to think of good names to rename all 5 sets anyone got anything good
    theyre also going to do an ipo and they confirmed that their q3 ridership was 50 higher than q2    yes they announced an ipo on the same day they rebranded    jesus fuck i give up trying to predict this wild ride anymore
  50 higher than q2  well it remain hopeful however in the absolute term thats still too less passengers
  so are they gonna change the warping/designs of the train to something similar to the ones in the uk
  maybe but maybe not virgin group dont have much control over series branded in its name in fact see for example livery of different virgin brand airlines
  i think theyll probably just repaint everything yellow with red swap out the logos and call it a day
  theres so much empty space on that train why not put advertising on it are they just plain stupid or has the state prohibited lowering train fares
  fares are set at the outset of a tco contract and are controlled by the state also things like number of carriages to run on each service are set by the state and not the tco    its state run services but the profit goes to private companies
  so they outsourced the operation while keeping the management right  what is the profit sharing agreement
  profit sharing  kek    the state pays a subsidy and the private company keeps the profit  they do hand over a percentage but the state lost out on all but 2 of the franchises last year thameslink and vtec which not so coincidentally were/are both up against the wall
  thats even worse than fully nationalized/privatized service as the one who manage the thing doesnt need to be financially accountable
  it really is the worst of both worlds for the passengers the government loves it because the train companies compete to charge the lowest price to use their infrastructure but they just make up the difference by gouging on fares
  outsourcing can still work in some cases like the bus network of kyoto however thats different from this in the sense that the government keep the ticket revenue while paying operators to operate buses according to requirements this way at least the financial accountability is on the sane on the one whos managing the schedule the government and thus they have the responsibility to make a financially sustainable operation and then because things like bus driver are finite resources so companies cant make absurd low price offer either else they wont be able to recruit drivers
  tfw they just bring over the class 800s to replace the scb40s and say they brought back there east coast line
  because it would look fucking horrible
  they also bought hyperloop one didnt they this is kind of like amazon buying whole foods it shows that hsr still has a future even if hyperloop conquers everything as likely or unlikely as that may be
  if you mean virgin theyre simply throwing small amount of money around everywhere to stick their name on everything theyre even investing in supersonic aircraft
  the virgin group claims another victim  i commute to work on virgin trains everyday and i love it fast frequent 125mph trains
  why not put advertising on it  you fucking american   1 the train travels at 125mph nobodys reading ads  2 why does everything have to have ads on it why cant you just enjoy things
  american  actually the indian railways already does this  but it just looks trashy to me
    tell me this just doesnt look really cheap and substandard
  american  nah just a bong with an entrepreneurial mindset  1 the train travels at 125mph nobodys reading ads  except when its stopped at stations with bored people waiting for their transport bored people are considerably more likely to read ads  2 why does everything have to have ads on it  money companies bid to put their ads on the trains this can be used to lower prices and keep customers happy essential for big businesses to thrive or it can be used to pay off debt    it doesnt have to be something tacky like that it can be a full body ad like on some of the busses here
  id be fine with ads on trains but on buses theyre horrible if you have to while waiting for the bus keep looking into the street at every large vehicle because you dont know if its a fully adpainted bus or not it sucks
  advertising is pernicious all forms of public advertising should be forbidden
90s rigid mtb with track bars and fat supple gumwall slicks edition     please post your requirements in a bike and also your budget and height anons and someone will more likely be able to help you    im looking at buying something with drop bars briftees and very big tire clearance 45mm for very comfy cruising commuting and some gravel and cargo hauling day trips
looking for a 26er suitable for winter riding 510 average proportions 500

tfw no px10
  thx but wheres the link
  opinions on these            
  i attempted to link to the fisher tassajara
  ah okay it looks nice ty
  im looking at buying something with drop bars briftees and very big tire clearance 45mm for very comfy cruising commuting and some gravel and cargo hauling day trips    well so whats your budget   assuming new and sub 2k maybe breezer radar pro
should i buy this        whats the difference between a 20 chain and a 60 chain
  second hand is best lad spent enough on bikes this year already
  yea
  out of those 3 choices id go for the trek too bad that ross is such a frankenbike or it would be first pick
  as long as its a reputable brand and its the right width for your driveline youre good  kmc sunrace and shimano hg are my go to chains but far more important is keeping the grit out of it and oiling it often enough
  right width for your driveline youre good  how can i tell
  what brand is your rear derailleur and how many sprockets does it have i think theres a guide to chain widths on sheldon browns site if i remember correctly
  shimano slx and its 10 speed
    way to overcomplicate things you absolute fucking faggot
  4chan
  10 speed chain     its 10 speed     yep anon u better go and look at a guide on sheldon brown do you have calipers you can measure your current chain width with i know you said your rd is shimano slx but which generation of slx is that what is the part number by 10 what number in letters did you mean is that ten can you post a picture of your drivetrain on the second solstice of the month
  sram apex equiped with dura ace tires for 400 euro usedit is going to be my first road bike is this a good deal
  i went ahead and bought it does titanium nitrate rust
what do you think of buying this for riding in the city and on not very difficult trails
  a little slower than it could be but it will be more comfortable
  if the headshock is in good condition go for it
   a little slower  why    wont the hydraulic vbrake go bad
  suspension will take a little bit out of your stride and the bike isnt tight like a real road bike    on the bright side you will kill any gravel you might want to ride on
  i dont want really a road bike as the conditions wont be favourable to it but im thinking of buying either an mtb or a hybrid one  i hope that bike will be good for street rides on the pavement there are almost no bike lanes in my place and i dont want to ride among all these crazy cagers
  sounds like the bike for you then id stay away from hybrids in fact the bike you posted will probably be just as good as a hybrid
  do you think its all ok with the equipment of that bike   id stay away from hybrids  why
  hybrids are the worst of both worlds too heavy to ride efficiently on the road and too flimsy for anything but a smooth single track
   too heavy to ride efficiently on the road  like riding it on the road among the cars at almost car speed   too flimsy for anything but a smooth single track  im not going to go down on a bike from a mountain or do some xc my new bike should be comfortable to ride either around the city and not heavy offroad
im new to cycling i saw this       hows the price is within my budget and send like a good deal to me
  its not a good deal its bad old sora on a basic aluminum framehes also lying about the price when new it was 800 when new
  well i dont need the kit you think if i can get them down to 300 itll be worth it not sure what you mean by old sora or how that affects it do you mind elaborating
  lel
    thats p sick     i wouldnt personally pay that much tho
  its only 650 anon  dont be such a poor fag
  but i have a cooler rigid mtb than that already that i paid 100 for so
    can anyone help find really good mountain bike deals budget is not very limited i would just want a quality mountain bike that is a great deal but i do not know what to look for    59 190 lbs but dropping
  actual offroad mtb if so what kind of trails
  honestly nothing too crazy but i still would like a nice full suspension or hardtail bike i currently ride a rigid mtb but i like the idea of riding around on a cloud
  the purpose of suspension is to keep traction not to be comfy if you want to be comfy just get some expensive supple tires as wide as will fit
  but i have a cooler rigid mtb than that already that i paid 100 for so  pics
  im rebuilding it not finished yet
and what about buying this for commuting
  solid
  definitely a bike
  sorry what did you mean by this english is not my native language
  solid reliable good choice so long as the price is decent
  first i wanted to buy a new mtb but they look too sporty in the city then i looked at hybrid bikes but at the same price of a new mtb they had worse equipment so i decided to take a look at 90s mtbs now they seem most suitable for me
  pretty good commuter is you add a rack and fenders those are some of the best 90s rigids
  now i should know better its condition are there any frequent problems of stumpjumpers to encounter and what are they
  nothing specific to stumpjumpers  just make sure everything works right the frame isnt cracked and nothing has play
  the seller says only the chain should be changed
  sellers say lots of crap best not to believe sellers
  do you want to say that that bike will all go bad
  if you need to change the chain its likely youll at least need to change the freewheel / cassette  the gears tend to wear with the chain so if you throw a brand new chain on an old cassette it will skip unless its one of those old ass 5/6 speed boys with the deep grooves between the teeth those fuckers go forever
  i dont know better see the photo
  is this worth 240 itll be my first road bike
  you will have to replace it if you replace the chain    probably depending on your market maybe offer 200 sora is a lower end group but if it all works its a decent entry level bike
  shiiiiit man if im spending 240 it better be headtotoe chrysler desert turquoise not this halfassed shit
   you will have to replace it if you replace the chain  maybe should i buy another bike or is it worth replacing these parts
  italian racing teal is so fucking played tho    its definitely worth it for an old 7 speed cassette and a new chain the parts will probably cost under 40 as for labour i guess it depends where you are id do it myself if it was me but youd need a few tools good long term investments tho imo    whats the asking price for the bike again
   whats the asking price for the bike again  about 250 i converted the price from rubles but i think i can bargain with the seller about the price
  well its hard to say because it depends largely on the market but id say thats a bit too much it was a relatively high end bike in its time but given the work that needs doing i personally wouldnt want to pay more than 150 maybe 200 if its a sellers market in your area
  in russia these bikes are quite hard to find now i should see it in person what its condition is and so on if the seller is ready to make a discount on it because of its state maybe ill take it otherwise i think of buying a modern mtb or hybrid but i dont know what better take
  i dunno once this is fixed up itd probably have more longevity than a modern bike for anywhere near the same price
is this reasonably priced at 1400  
2014 trek domane 53 775    its in practically new condition i want it for riding on rough city roads and for touring  it seems very capable for touring even as a carbonframe bike in reality this bike resembles my stolen and beloved alpha 12 so much that i could never be dissuaded from pulling the trigger
do you guys think you could give me an estimate on how much i should sell this for its an rlt 9 2star 105 from 2015 it was bought at 800 from a holiday discount im seeing on bluebook that it would be priced at 700 if its in excellent condition its barely used should i sell it for that price
  bluebook is meaningless   500600 in a good market imo     asking almost what you paid new is insane
    its sicilian aquamarine seafoam 43 you niggers
  bluebook is meaningless  if anything blue book undervalues bikes pretty routinely       if youre in a big city start at 950 and see where it goes ive had bikes sell for 3x their memebook value
  so can you advice some good bike to ride in the city and not hard trails i think ill find it in my place im ready to spend about 500 for a new one
  i wouldnt advise you to buy a new bike for less than 1000
  why as for me thats too much for a bike
  because it would be shit  if thats your budget buy used
   because it would be shit  are you saying this about an mtb or a road bike   if thats your budget buy used  i also consider this option
  either
  but what would you say about this 
anyone know of any good deals going for around 3000 currently considering a supersix evo but the cannondale carbon wheels are putting me off im sure they are ok but they would not be my choice or probably anyones choice for a 1000 wheelset maybe better to buy a canyon for 2k and the wheelset of my choice
  i already told you what i think about it
  sorry i thought you were the other  ok prove me why a good bike should cost more than 1000 and what technical specifications should a good bike have
  if youre not going to listen to what i say dont ask for my advice senpai
  why do you think im not going to listen to what you say i just need advice as i dont want to buy shit
  because i already told you to buy the spesh
  sorry thats my not very good english
  can someone help me with this does 1400 seem reasonable for this type of bike
    the site doesnt work
  fair verging on expensive
  damn ok ill keep looking for used bikes
  bike seems good but i cant vouch for the reputability of that vendor
  what does this mean i never even thought about that being a factor their yelp reviews seem ok not sure if thats trustworthy though
i know the frame is too fucking small but for the 20 frame it makes a great beater/around town bike
  god fucking damn it line the tire label up with the valve hole
      hydro disc brakes  sram rival 1x with half decent bb  wheels that can fit tyres all the way up to 50mm  decent finishing components all round  i would unironically trade in my dura ace tcr for it
  how exactly would that frame clear 50mm tires
  ok i might get it then
  whats the difference between that marin gestalt 3 and this bike that makes it 400 more     
  thru axles probably nicer frame but maybe not better put together
  ok ty internal cable routing seems nicer too
dualsport fag here interested in trying out a full suspension mountain bike for the first time on some of the god tier single track in my neighborhood trying to stay below 500 for my first bike seeing as i live in bc where the supply of used mountain bikes is nearly infinite it looks to me like you can get a pretty decent first rig for cheap    im currently looking at a 2008 specialized pitch for 500 and have some questions       as a lifelong enginefag im assuming my leg muscles are nowhere near ready for a 1x drivetrain would it be wise to filter for 2x or 3x drive trains on a first mtb i plan on doing as much uphill riding as downhill     in an intermediate single track environment what requires more frequent maintenance air shocks or coil shocks     should i be considering hard tails at all for intermediate single track use     for a beginner does having lockout suspension make a big difference when riding uphill     should i be considering vbrakes or mechanical disc brakes in an environment that is humid wet and muddy for the majority of the year bike will also be stored outside tent all year     are xc geometry bikes with full suspension a meme or are they genuinely a good compromise between uphill and downhill performance
just got my tin chain in the mail    question isnt that great
2000usd for a 2015 supersix evo with sram red and mavic kysriums 63kg/139lb    would this be a smart move take in notice bikes in my country are a bit higher than usa or europe watcha think
  thats great trayvon
  thanks d
  bumpin for help thankssssss
    is this a good deal 450 euro aprox    also i want a mtb to use it kinda of like i use my road bike long hard ride and going to cool places but now an road that i cant do with my road bike would this be a good bike i kinda considered gravel bikes but they seem more expensive and not adding that much compared to a good hard tail
  ask the seller about its equipment and state
lads    i want a road bike i can use for touring and club rides already got a commuter student and deliveroo bike just want a good audax/touring friendly roadie    london uk wc1e 6bt    im 60 so typically looking at 56cm frame bikes    i am interested in  worth a go
    ride it and see how the shifting holds up  if it was some freds fairweather whip it could be cool  but sram bits that have been regularly ridden for the last 3 years might be a bit clapped out for that price point
  that thing has no fender or rack eyelets not very appropriate for touring probably has very narrow tire clearance too
any thoughts on this bike or recs from my cl      im 58 so i figure 5254cm is where i wanna be need a bike for commuting kinda rainy where i am to i do like the look of old touring bikes but they seem to have some inconvenient quirks
  seem to have some inconvenient quirks  how so   old touring rigs make great bulletproof commuters imho if youre concerned about old tech just go for something branded thats late 80s or more recent  that will give you indexed shifters and 700 not 27 rims
looking for the lightest bike possible at about 2000 dollars give or take i am 167cm tall with a 77cm inseam i dont have many requirements i just want it to be light and not ride like a pos
what is my best option for a cheap bike that is suited for suburban sidewalks
  you cant really go wrong with a road bike in that price range theyre all much the same   you can penny pinch for slightly higher spec or get a brand with more prestige which may or may not have a more modern frame with more money into rd which rides better     i would just get whatever bike appeals to you for arbitrary aesthetic reasons and something which fits you well ideally from a competent local shop which can help you with fit
  if you want post your local craigslist and height ill make some recs
a slightly used panther cx bike for everyday riding around town and on some easy trails for eur 250 yay or nay
  90s mtb with slicks    modern mtb with slicks    shitheap hybrid that resembles the 90s mtb as much as feasible    in that order      a 1400 bike with a climbing wheelset
  6 foot is getting into at least 58cm frame territory depending on your proportions  if youre heavier like 85kg plus and want something for touring id suggest a gravel or randonneur bike 2nd hand for comfort and handling on rough surfaces but still having good speed and feel on the road 3842mm tyres would be a good all around way to go  if youre around 100kg give or take 42mm is what you should be looking at    the only trouble is that 2nd hand rando and gravel bikes are a bit harder to find but well worth it and 1x can result in less maintenance if its dialled in right    another anon mentioned the lack of lugs but fenders can fit a few different ways lugs are ideal of course and also frame stem and handlebar bags can very easily do a great job for all but the heaviest touring when you dont have lugs for panniers and such    if you want to buy new theres many great steel rando bikes around but try and see if you can find a decent used bike first tire clearance is arguably king here for your needs
  scour every square inch of that frame for damage with a good light before you buy it and check where the tubes join for dead spots that may indicate voids or stress fractures  that or send it off for testing used carbon time bombs are a very real thing anon  if the frame is sound thats a good deal modern carbon ksyriums are just gorgeous wheels unless youre a heavier rider
  lugs  bosses lad
  sorry m8 i kinda flagrantly use the two terms interchangeably  youre not gonna go all si prefix guy on me are you
  yes
  giant tcr advanced 2 is msrp 1900 usd it is one of about 2 or 3 bikes under 2000 usd ridden in the pro peloton     giant always has bettter bang for the buck than specialized or cannondale or trek
  their carbon wheels that they come with are supposed to be very good as well theyre twitchy and prone to death wobbles if you run a stem shorter than around 105mm be warned
  i should have figured
looking for something as cheap as possible solely to use for commuting to work im literally 100lbs and not athletic at all
  post your local craigslist budget and height
  its because everyone else is reselling shit made by giant in the first place
  i dont think that weighs 63kg with those heavy wheels around 7kg i would say anyway i would not buy it because i dont think it is a good deal    you can always find brand new cannondales on sale somewhere
should i get the aventon kijote seems like a good buy and i talked to this guy today on campus who had the nicer orange color the only problem i can think of is the brifters are they that hard to service if not what would you guy recommend for a (((gravel))) bike
  you dont really service integrated levers you just replace them but you really dont have to worry about that unless you crash really hard
can someone recommend a monstercross type frame that has the following im aware of black mountain cycles already but theyre out of stock of most frame sizes  disc  clearance for wider tires   threaded bb  frame less than 800  basically im looking for something to replace pic related  which is a fun cheapo cx bike cobbled together from random parts on a frame i got for practically free but its very limited on tire clearance      look up reviews and youll hear exactly what youd expect from a bike in this price point the downsides are that its heavy the components are basic the wheels are heavy and need final truing out of the box and the quality control on the frame may be iffy    if you understand those downsides and okay fixing minor issues and doing the assembly yourself then its a pretty good deal
  cadales online  yurop detected
  you can service them to an extent its called spraying wd40 into them when they get gummy
    ive been wanting a fixie this guy is desparate to sell what do you think i cant tell if its a walmart bike or not he says it might be made by se any ideas
  se was a cheap brand from the height of the fixie fad days its pretty much a walmart bike     caveat emptor
  darn
  this bike is about 250 brand new  if hes desperate to sell see if hell go lower
  he did say hed take 100 cash
  ive ridden xc bikes on some pretty rough terrain if youre not a fatass they can usually handle it lockout doesnt matter that much to me but i understand why people like it its usually the first thing to fail anyway if you ride hard     also disc brakes should be a given at the 500 price range unless youre going for some ridiculous top of the line early 2000s bike id go mechanical disc ideally avid bb7 some niggas swear by hydraulic brakes but bleeding them is a pain in the ass and ive personally had one fail catastrophically during a ride and lost my rear brake completely
  what should i offer on this 2006 bianchi san jose looks like its in decent condition besides a dent on the downtube
  se is primarily a bmx brand look up their website to see the info for that model
        same guy here would this work for the same purpose as the kijote i trust this guy because i bought a nice bridgestone rb2 from him this summer it also looks to be in good condition and it fits me is the geometry that different on a cyclocross bike
  the only thing i see wrong with it is that he removed the smaller chainring so one of the brifters is kinda useless will the lack of a small chainring be a problem for acceleration
be heavy and tall boi 105kg who likes to sprint  for on road and off would the canyon gravel be better in carbon or alloy the alloy seems good to me as it doesnt have the memebars and still has a 105 groupset  anyone ridden these puppies itd be nice to have some fat slicks on there and ride it around country roads and for light gravel trail bikepacking with some frame bags and such
  100
  id go for it only if he still has the original 2x crankset and front deailleur around somewhere thats definitely a ghetto 1x setup chainring doesnt seem to be narrow wide and that cassette is awful small for 1x  looks more like a gravel bike than a cyclocross bike in any case geometry is relaxed and compact more like an endurance road bike with wider tire clearance
  nice bike would love one as a commuter no idea what its worth id pay 200
thinking of grabbing this for my first road bike      is the older sora set fine or should i really shell out more for the newer version
  he bought the bike like that from the previous owner he doesnt have the original crank but he says he can dig around for another ring which is nice but a little worrying im going to test ride it sunday to see how it is also i did a little bit of research and apparently its the womens model will the geometry be that different
the parent company that makes fuji kestrel breezer bikes and performancebike filed for bankruptcy chapter 11 so id keep an eye out for deep discounts through online sellers    black friday is usually the cheapest day all year to buy a bike
  you should really pass on this bike
  also keep an eye out for performance bicycle storeclosing sales bunch of locations were a sucking chestwound on the companys finances apparently
  i wish i had one nearby we have regional fauxlbs stores and lbs no big box ones like performancebike or decathalon    didnt that bankrupt company also own either wiggle or nashbar
is this a good deal i always wanted a lanceera trek        575 he claims its a 62cm which doesnt sound right     i normally ride a 61cm at 64 so 62 should be no problem
  thats a fine deal if the seller is correct about condition assuming the bike is in great shape with some life left in all the consumables
heres my rigid mtb touring conversion in progress needs longer seatpost and less hideous/reachy stem probably should have not gotten drop bars with so much reach nor am i a fan of wide drops on this frame however it is a comfy ride and im a big fan of mid90s mtb geo    this will hopefully get a rack soon too and get to go out on some dirt excursions not pictured are new 15 slicks since this will mostly be a commuter for the time being and i didnt want to throw down for schwable touring tires right now if i like it enough it will go on a longer intl tour someday though
  nashbar    no wonder ive been seeing their category selection get thinner and thinner    i was about to order a set of their alpe dhuez pedals
1200 2018 bike got stolen today  what are the odds i can buy/build a cheap fixie that rides at lest well enough for me to not want to kms
  not just slapping an engine kid on a 90s rigid and calling it good  asked for it
  that doesnt answer my question or make me feel any better anon
  try a threadless adapter  velo orange cigne friend
  im around 510 or 11 and i have never used craigslist in my life
  depends on if you are more solitary or group ride focused and how hard your group goes    probably high
  my friend    after many frustrations today i learned i have a 1 stem and and 1 1/8 threadless steerer so the 222mm nitto stem i purchased will not work and no quill stem with the reach i need is easily had in both 254 diameter and 26mm clamp diameter     so i am abandoning the idea of a true retro build and going threadless adapter route i still need the 1 1/8 to 26mm clamp threadless stem with short reach which i had trouble finding as well i settled for 75mm     im not sure if im retarded or just fighting an uphill battle with this bike and the parts ive already purchased 20/20 is hindsight
thots on this blue boi 
  looks like pig disgusting h2 fit
if im looking for an entrylevel fixie would i be better off buying new during black friday or buying used off craigslist  i live in chicago
  cl all day every day
  black friday stopped actually having good deals years ago
ayudame por favor        
  few more i found          also disregard that 53 cm fuji im about 61
im a complete newbie and i need some help  i posted in i think the last thread about finding a nice looking bike in a tiny store run by a nice old man for surprisingly cheap compared to similar looking bike front suspensions disc breaks 20 something gears 275 wheels stuff like that  i asked what i should look for in a bike and what i should check before buying a bike for a price that seems too good to be true  i didnt get a chance to stop by that store again until today it was closed but i managed to look through the window and catch a glimpse of the bike he recommended me on the frame it said active on the bottom tube and limited on the top tube or the other way around  i tried looking it up online and i couldnt find anything from that brand only bikes from cube like in pic related  it looks similar to my untrained eye except green and black but i doubt its the same company    are fake bikes a thing i should be worried about what about nonbrands so to speak  does anyone recognize that brand active limited  im fairly certain he said the gears are from shimano i think i remember that right which are considered a reliable brand right    im no cyclist by any means i just want a bike for commuting but i also want to be limited by myself and not by the bike if that makes sense so i dont mind cheaper but i do mind cheapest
  if its a small lbs selling a cube for a few hundred less its probably merely a model from last year unless you live in a 3rd world shitter place no bike shop would sell a fake bike    shimano makes almost all gears for a lowmid mountainbike the lowest maker is microshift sram also makes mountainbike and road bike gears for the mid level market so saying it is shimano doesnt mean much    most entry level mountainbikes from an lbs are 3x8 for a total of 24 speeds you dont want a 3x7 for reasons i wont get into    however the new hotness because of ease of use isnt the 3x7 but rather a 1x11 people have really taken to the 1x11 for ease of use since most fixes/tweaks to the shifting are required for a front derailleur that has to move the 1x11 only has one big ring up front    if you want a mountain bike with a front spring shock suspension thats fine they are good cruisers and great for the winter     but also realize you could just as easily ride a bike that looks like a road bike but has tires that look like a mtb these are called gravel bikes and are the new hip things     if you go to a bike shop you should be able to pick out a front suspension mtb an entry claris road bike with skinny tires or an entry level gravel bike for around the same amount
  wrote     personally i would buy a road bike with shimano claris level shifters at least that has 25mm tires i would also buy an additional set of tires in 28 or 30 or 32mm width with a knobbier pattern on them so you can swap between wider knobbies in the winter and 25mm fast slicks in the summer    thats a vitus razor giant defy fuji sportif specialized allez etc
  if its a small lbs selling a cube  i should point out theres nothing indicating its cube it might be but i dont think so i just said thats all that comes up when i google active limited 275  so the bottom line is that i can believe what the bike/ the shop owner say about the bike and not worry about counterfeits assuming i dont live in the third world which i dont
  it seems that the seller of that bike disappeared having promised before to bring it to my city so id be able to have a look at it and if itd be in good state to buy it now i dont know what to take even if this seller reappears im not sure to take that bike
  san jose   im building one of these up for a winter work bike those components are quality if they will go 450 or below pull the trigger   pake rum runner   by far the best deal youre going to get for below 2 bills tange steel is far superior to what youll usually find
what do you do when you dont have a good used market near you local craiglist and facebook marketplaces are filled up with kids bikes when there is something decent its too small for me im 63
  flea market ebay pinkbike if mtb afaik
   is this a good buy for a first road bike am i pig retarded for not shopping used instead i dont know enough about bike mechanics yet to spot anything glaring on a used bike on my own
  that is a great bike for a good price i have the same model the wheels are pretty cheap but theyre okay until you decide to upgrade for your first road bike ultegra probably isnt really a selling point but that price is similar to 105 equipped 2019 models so i say go for it worst case it retains resale value better
  the cannondale caad has always been a great road bike if anything your first road bike is a 750 dollar claris not a 1600 dollar cannondale lol but you do you    for that 1600 price id probably go with a lesser brand and buy carbon     even the specialized tarmac comes in carbon for 1600 and its in bora team colors    
what are halo t2s like ive seen a set on ebay for 130 191 and debating buying them i live in a city thats full with cobblestone paths and stuff so its a pretty bumpy commute will they last long on stuff like that
anyone know the make / model of this bike    low quality photos taken from local listing very cheap    butted fork fuji saddle    doesnt appear to be a fuji feather or a chrome kilo tt based off chainring and geometry     any ideas
  
  if those townie bars are original fuji it would narrow it down a bit     kind of lookds loke a gross frankenbike but the frame is pristine and it has a moden streerer     how much they asking for the shiny frankenbike
    theyre asking 40 im only interested in the frame anyways not sure what size it is 58cm maybe based off the length of the head tube
what do you guys think about this delta v500   looks good to me based on the pictures the owner didnt put any info about it it seems to have a full deore group  anything specific i should check about it     how much should i pay for it

well at least their last paint scheme looked good    i wonder what it was like for workers in the final days they knew their jobs would be gone and all the seniority theyd acquired would be wiped out overnight i wonder what it was like to tie your train down step off the engine and walk into the office to get your pink slip probably involved a lot of drinking in those days
  bankruptcy blue was a godtier paint scheme especially when fresh
  tfw you will never experience a string of mixedbuilder 4 axle diesels pulling a graffitifree manifest
saw a rock island gp38 in atlanta many years ago probably a leased unit
  railroading in general involved a lot of drinking back then  god knows how much it intensified though  i seem to remember a post about how there used to be a job of second brakeman on some crews where nothing was expected of them and theyd just drink the whole trip  here have a rock slug
  everyone drank or was on drugs the exkorean war guys were heavy drinkers vietnam vets smoked weed people did coke amphetamines and pills on duty if you didnt drink with your crew they would think youre a narc    there were a lot of head end brakemen who became proficient engineers because the engineer would get too fucked up to operate then the fireman would so it was up to him to run the train    if you talk to old heads they miss those days one told me it was great because the party started when you went on duty when trainmasters and road foremen would climb up on a locomotive it was customary to share a beer with him
  not to mention four different paint schemes from the same railroad in one consist
  i posted that story was originally from trainorders     fiveman crews standard on every freight train those were the days      a small percentage of the road freight jobs carried a third brakeman the middle man     our normal crews were five men engineer fireman and head brakeman up fron conductor and flagman back in the caboose     on those few occasions i worked a train with a middle man the middle man rode the second or third unit and was expected to do nothing at all one middle man spent the trip between binghamton and mechanicville polishing off a full case of beer all by himself a beer can flying out the cab unit every few minutes things were different back in those prericky gates days i can assure you
  thats great thanks for sharing railroading lost its character and human interest somewhere around the 70s all the old timers who remember that twilight period have all retired and are dying off now this guy has some interesting stories        i hope some folklorists/humanities folks are getting these guys interviewed and transcribed for oral histories before theyre all gone
      i can just imagine staring through the tiny windshield of a gp9 watching searchlights pass as i chug a cold one the more i hear about old school railroading the comfier it sounds
heres an odd looking loco
best paintjob
  tfw you will never watch the prairies roll by with a beer in your hand  tfw you will never watch the sun set over the mountains while burning a fat blunt  tfw you will never share a cold one with your crew while waiting in the hole at a siding    why live
  no one smoked blunts back then anon     also remember that there were virtually no women in railroading back then so you could say whatever you wanted and no one would report you and try to get you fired
  no one smoked blunts back then anon    gates and his brakeman edward butch cromwell were also smoking a marijuana cigarette4       you can thank ricky gates for the modern zero tolerance bullshit on the railroads
  the method is besides the point the important thing is getting baked in the cab of a geep
  in my brief career im glad i got to piss off the side of a moving geep on a calm summer night  hell it mightve even been on former rock island row
                drinking and smoking weed on the job  5 man crews and other complete wastes of labor   union cucks will literally defend this and cry about the end of the good old days where they could be intoxicated lazy wasteful degenerates    and you people wonder why no one cares about you anymore good riddance
i didnt think any trainmasters browsed /n/
  ywn see consists like this again

  theyre garbage to run like that it takes forfuckingever for the independent to apply and release       not all of them theres an awesome engineer thats been with the company for 44 years he has some great stories about the old days
  theyre garbage to run like that it takes forfuckingever for the independent to apply and release  perhaps the real problem is youre just a bad hogger
  im not even an engineer bruh after three engines in a consist the time to apply and release the independent becomes so fucking irritating anyone with even a little experience will realize it
  i never had that problem

bike theft is probably the most epidemic contemporary crime   could / should we end bike theft by making it a terminal or at the very least mortal offense with active security mechanismsie bike bombs
this is what i want i want all the punks to take to the streets  playin their guitars
  this has got to be one of the stupidest shitpost threads anyone could make    what if it goes off accidentally and an innocent dies even if some thief gets killed its still murder and you go to prison for that matter what if you fuck up and kill yourself with it sound like fun to you    delete this thread if you can its stupid and youre a moron
  id have a thousand innocent people get blown up if it meant even one bike thief did as well
  damn holy best watch out this guys a fuckinn badass
  blast could be designed to shoot straight up so no bystanders get hurt   they could be placed in bait bikes and not actual commuter bikes so that only bike thieves get their balls blown off
are these videos fake 
low power shaped charge in the tube under the seat  if youre sitting on the bike your pelvis gets turned into mush  if youre an innocent bystander you get a few bruises at worst  now tell me why wouldnt this work
no it could negatively affect the families of janitors removing bikes locked where they are in the way    snipers is what we need
  not sure if you know what a shaped charge is but bruising innocents is actually not cool
  but fucking over bike thieves is extremely cool
    there are no innocents in a society that tacitly condones bike theft
  in kkkapitalist ociety we are all criminals and traitors to humanity
  like this
shit posts so far but bike theft is a crime that unfortunately is considered a routine violation and requires a response that is outside the law if you want anything done about it if youve ever had a bike stolen youll know that the police wont do anything about it and if you track down the thief they usually arent arrested or charged now a lot of these bike thieves are repeat offenders find a way to identify them video camera or gps tracker and then disseminate that information on like a central hub or website there are a lot of bicycle chop shops near where i live but i doubt theyre identified in any sort of database maybe create one on a map so you know where theyre located and cross reference with known thieves also there are some bicycle registries out there spread awareness about those etch all parts on your bike and maybe go to town halls and lobby to make it a crime to be in possession of scratched out or stolen serial numbered parts with all this information you could try shaming thieves around town and ask businesses not to do business with them even though a lot of pawn shops are complacent and falsify records to buy from known thieves but shame them too by all means or if youve successfully identified and tracked these people get some like minded people together and fuck their shit up most of them are homeless or junkies and are unlikely to go to the police just do like antifa and wear masks if you want to be on the safe side
    there are no innocents in a society that tacitly condones shitposting
  niggas the meme is totally right
extremist punishments solves crime    imprisoning non violent offenders is ok     i guess you love the dea then       prohibitionists  this is not real prohibition we just need to be more radical    socialists  that wasnt real socialism  real socialism is more radical     how does it feel knowing no matter how brutally the state tries to oppress people human nature and freedom will always persevere why are the triads and russian mafia so powerful commie black markets      were infamous due to the sensationalized war on drugs by our government with around 4000 deaths as of april 2018 since 2016 from police and phildea operations oplan tokhang albeit the increased attention drugs are still rampant and prices just increased  albeit the increased attention drugs are still rampant and prices just increased  drugs are still rampant and prices just increased  drugs are still rampant  drugs are still rampant    at least the brave heroes that deal these substance make more money and because of darwinism the community of hero drug dealers just gets more adapted     good job making drugs more expensive and creating and incentive for poor addicts to spread their addiction so they have people to middle man to and they always need new ones when they actually find real dealers     soon the addict master race will prevail       study after study shows that high intelligence is more commonly linked to addiction than low intelligence    hmm why are all the best artists and musicians and scientists degenerate drug addicts hmm makes your almonds bitter
id be down for bait bikes surrounded by hidden ninjas with poison dart blowguns throwing stars and occasional sword beheadings bombs are noise pollution
  why are you comparing drug use to bike theft using drugs is victimless so it should not be a crime stealing a bike victimizes the owner and thus should be punished
  harsher punishments dont reduce crime in a meaningful way so no
  tell me op can you get more hyperbolic than this im sure we can push it even farther why not just nuke every country that has bike thieves thatll be a great deterrent
  using drugs is victimless  that is up to debate recently  depending on your use your family and loved ones would probably have something to say
this is why you lock the bike up      i got the bike back
i live in a bit of a bad area and a fair few hijes get robbed from the neighboring towns and shit im lucky in the sense that if my bike gets robbed ill find out who robbed it pretty quick my last bike got stolen outside a shop but i had it back by the next morning simply because people i live with know other people whk steal bikes or do drugs etc
should we make an /n/ club on strava it would be pretty fun we could have bantz and maybe ride bikes together
being a newfag
  /drt/ is so slow i wonder if anyone actually rides here id have to put a privacy zone around my house to keep you maniacs away though
  not knowing about /n/s strava club  you keep exposing the absolute state of your newfagginess
i see one with 15 people on it called transportation is that it
  no from memory it was named after the 100000th get
    i havent been there in ages
  i check it every week and then weep because i only average about 100kms a week and some of you guys get upwards of 300400kms   i just ride to work and to the city to get comic books every week and i work on weekends so my free time is almost nonexistent still its good to have a baseline for what others are doing and to help keep me motivated to keep riding
  look at member list  guy i used to follow has no rides since 2014
my car battery died and for a little bit i was among the top riders for distance not including those that race professionally or are a part of teams please ride so i can admire all your bikes and nonus countries and your funny curvy roads
  i know that feel have a few years of 34000miles plus almost 100k of climbing last 2 years struggle to get 500miles and basically no climbing    kinda hate how lifes responsibilities takes priority over my hobbies
  i keep riding but i seldom use strava on rides anymore it was fun for a while but who cares anymore i pretty much only do the challenges where you get an irl patch
  i use strava but i use it as a way to log my rides and autoupload to trainerroad out of 7600 km on strava this year ive probably got less than 5 public ones on top of that ive got 4000 km of commuting thats not logged anywhere
  why not just get a tattoo on your forehead that says i am a huge faggot please rape my face and be done with it people who dont know what /n/ is wont understand and people who do are just as likely to wreck you in some way as not just stay anonymous and enjoy riding your bike kid
  tfw when i was on tour in october i was 1 on all the leaderboards 4 weeks straight but now i am couch potato
our strava club seems to actually knows how to bike and hues that infect all the other clubs arent there yet    why are there so many fat brazillians on front susp mtbs trying to be my friend on strava fuck
tfw i ride mountain and my mileage looks puny compared to these roadies
tfw theres someone else with my name in fs and hes right behind me on a lot of zwift segments
i saw theres actually a few pros on there subscribed i saw someone from jelly belly p/b maxxis
      man i remember that groupuused to regularly be in the top 10 every week just with my commute riding shit was depressing yall need to ride more
daily reminder building railroads to all villages that have under 500 inhabitants is in fact not unrealistic the french had such lines in the middle of the mountains in the early 20th century    daily reminder cagers started ruining everything starting in the 1920s when fascists and later nazis built highways because le epin keynesianism mandated that tons of asphalt be layered everywhere to create jobs
boondoggle folly 19th century technology write your congressman edition    starting with dc streetcar the most hopeless streetcar project in the entire western hemisphere
  most of the us streetcar systems are hopeless  build a useless short line or loop with no actual purpose  buy outdated and overpriced technology  spend huge ammounts of money because the exaggerated technical standards require it  spend years on actually bulding it most possibly with a long delay  hope it will atract people to your empty downtown    most of the local politicians have actually no idea how streetcar should work and how the system should look like streetcar isnt a toy like in some theme park that attracts people its a service in places where are already bigger ammounts of people that want to use the public transportation if you want to move people from cars to streetcars first you need to get them out of the cars by regulations or whatever and then give them an actual useful system not some toycar loop
  most of the us public transport systems are hopeless    ftfy
more trams on grass which always looks nice construction on this whole area starts tomorrow    
  commercial aviation is public transport  mass transit
  thanks captain autismo you knew perfectly well what i meant you fucking sperg    let me clarify for you in case you really are that thick    most of the us light heavy tram trolleybus bus cycle and any other form of mass light transit systems are hopeless
  lol i just missed the most part no need to get triggered
  dc streetcar the most hopeless streetcar project    ha you have never seen our pathetic streetcar system in tampa florida its a single line just under 3 miles long like dc and is used by less than a 1000 people per day dc is about 3000 per day it doesnt even connect directly to the local amtrak station unlike the dc one one article i read described it as an aticket ride for tourists and its currently doing a program until the end of the year where everyone can ride for free to test its viability definitively before they decide to approve a proposed expansion but hey it does have brandnew streetcars built to look like theyre 100 years old and as long as they look good in tourist ads everything will work out right well apparently not    the main problem is that this streetcar system was not started to provide a new mass transit alternative for the city it was started as an excuse to restore and run the last remaining heritage streetcar in tampa from the old system a century ago all of the infrastructure from the old system has been gone for ages and the current line was built this century which they incidentally rarely run its a shame because i like old timey rail transport and the execution of this streetcar has been terrible
  at least it has a dedicated lane
  stand back guys here comes a real american streetcar system
  there will still be pantograph wires for the trams right im guessing the artist just decided to not bother rendering them i hope they have a plan to make the redevelopment a bit less dreary than how docklands turned out
if you can get the land for relatively cheap how expensive would it then be to make to build a line or two  what drives up the costs besides land
reading this thread on a ttc streetcar
  mbta is doing everything in their power to terminate the e line at brigham circle  streetcar system    i love the t as much as the next guy but get real nigga
    can someone give me a quick rundown on modern american streetcar systems do any of them actually work what purpose are they supposed to serve    from what ive seen the trams that are branded streetcar arent planned to be extended to suburbs / futher than a few kilometres so theyre meant really only for short trips downtown do people use something like that what is those cities endgame to ban cars / buses from the tram streets eventually ive been told that streetcars are a mistake thats being made because modern day america doesnt fully understand trams yet but most of the us lightrails seem pretty succesful if not commercially at least they do a good job actually bringing people somewhere are streetcars gonna make it eventually or will they all be gone in 15 years
  its literally just to bring upper middle class white people to downtown areas without existing public transit because upper middle class white people like using public transit but refuse to ride a bus
  based streetcarposter  giv pics
  do any of them actually work  in order to understand the american streetcar boom and if any of the new streetcars being installed actually work you have to look at the one place they do portland most of the streetcars in america were dreamed up by planners and local politicians who visited portland after the recession to look for ways to revitalize their cities and downtown cores after the real estate crash many of those planners came back to their cities and were convinced if they just built a short streetcar line through a small gentrified part of town they could become the next portland what many of those people never realized or understood is what makes portland the city it is today portland was moving in the direction it is today by and large before the idea of the streetcar was ever penned many politicians and planners just want easy solutions to fix their vast array of problems their cities face with the least amount of backlash the fact of the matter is what portland did in the 70s and 80s was revolutionary for north american cities at that particular time and to some extent still today to implement these policies in the stereotypical midsize city in a deep red state which tried to emulate portland via streetcar construction is very politically explosive in these places and not worth risking their careers over it
  best case theyre often built to be downtown circulators to move tourists between the major attractions and to move suburbanites around downtown on weekends/evenings whenever they dare to venture into town for a show or dinner    worst case the same as above but the tourists and suburbanites refuse to ride it becausegasppoor people or even worse homeless people use it as well      there are successful systems in the us but those are usually called light rail systems rather than streetcars systems like portland seattle salt lake city boston have decent and useful streetcar systems that actually have a real use
      based thanks      lmao so portland is basically to america what karlsruhe is to europe never knew what a nice city portland was btw so much for the desert country downtowns are hard to keep lively meme
  what drives up the costs besides land  one thing can be hefty insurance fees from crossings with other rail lines such as those owned by freight railroads the one in tampa for instance crosses once over a csx line and they have to pay 500k each year to csx because of it
  the main issue is that most us politicians and most normal citizens dont know where to begin when it comes to passenger rail transport in general passenger rail hasnt been a thing for the majority of americans since about the time amtrak formed in 1971 cars and airplanes are all most of them know and things like streetcars are exotic novelties because of that its because of that novelty factor that initial phases of streetcars are made but because they screw it up most of the time its ineffective and everyone becomes reluctant to spend more money to enhance it or expand it    the trick is to create some sort of passenger rail for dummies guideline that any us politician across the country can use as a reference when considering building light rail systems in their cities what would such a guideline look like /n/
  the tourists and suburbanites refuse to ride it becausegasppoor people or even worse homeless people use it    this is the bane of all us mass transit people that are middle class and higher dont like the idea of sharing a vehicle with a poor person because poor people statistically cause the vast majority of violent crime if you have kids with you this aversion increases my solution bring back the 1st2nd3rd class system to passenger rail or something similar charge nothing for 3rd class streetcars and charge a modest fee for each progressive class of streetcar under this scheme 999999999 of homeless people will use the 3rd class streetcars and everyone else will use the 2nd and 1st class streetcars everybodys happy
      here you go
  i honestly think this is much more of a complex issue since you cant just write a book on it you need to actually show us politicians examples to emulate and people with the knowhow    first thing consult with manufacturers talk to siemens talk to alstom talk to bombardier all 3 will go into detail about systems which can be implemented in us cities    second go on field trips im not joking about this though take us politicians and take them on trips to look at places where light rail is in use take them to toronto to see the ttc as a north american system take them to vienna berlin and prague to see large european systems take them to hiroshima to see how the japanese do it take them to melbourne to see how the australians manage it in their climate    third dont cheap out the biggest issue i have with the us systems particularly with systems like in dc is the fact that they put it on a short stretch of line in a relatively poor neighbourhood the result is that these neighbourhoods become gentrified quickly but expand it out to several areas and you end up with an interconnected place oh and make sure you do something about moronic car drivers who have no idea how to drive around trams/streetcars
  poor people statistically cause the vast majority of violent crime  thats the problem of poverty gap
  second go on field trips im not joking about this  funny how this apperantly would sound like a joke to american politicians its really not like new european tram systems automatically work because there are already more of them on the same continent its common practice here for local governments to go on a lot of trips to existing tram cities when they are considering building their own and fly over teams from other systems to set things up if they go for it for example in the nineties almost every dutch province town sent a group of people to karlsruhe to see if a tram/train would work for them most of them finding out that buses that run every hour being slightly crowded is in fact not a valid excuse to build an extensive lightrail system they learned that its viable only if you already have a tram system and thus rotterdam and den haag went for it and their new interurban lines became very succesful theres no valid reason for american systems to fail theres not even something wrong with building a tram for le prestige they just have to do their fucking research
am i wrong in presuming that street running tram systems are just generally bad    you have most of the cost of light rail but with none of the speed benefits you still get stuck in traffic
one of the most infuriating things about american politics its often a choice between bad spending and no spending
  am i wrong in presuming that street running tram systems are just generally bad  yes although mixed traffic is always bad public transport no matter if its a bus or a tram needs its own lane trams are better because  more capacity vehicles can be longer because theyre guided  more comfortable buses shake a lot while trams are a smooth ride  tram lanes take less pace than bus lanes  trams can make smaller curves  trams are cheaper to operate because rubber tires give significantly more fraction that rails  trams can easily be extended onto railroads or with metro sections in tunnels  trams have more prestige than buses so they actually add something to your city  trams are bidirectional  zero pollution electric buses are partly taking away this advantage but still require a lot more electricity
  my assumption was    if its mixed traffic use a bus  if its an exclusive right of way use a train    and that both brt and streetcars were a waste of time
   trams can make smaller curves  wtf    trams are cheaper to operate because rubber tires give significantly more fraction that rails   inb4 rubbertyred trams this point with a correct conclusion is incomplete the mere fact of more friction does not directly conclude a higher cost    trams are bidirectional  how is this an advantage    trams can easily be extended onto railroads or with metro sections in tunnels   an incentive not really strong considering a bus route can more easily extend to any road
  really depends on whats brt    if its an exclusive right of way use a train   if demand or density is not there yet a median bus lane will do     my position is if the corridor/area branches a lot or demand is less linearly distributed  use bus as a trunk option
  needs its own lane  this may only be necessary at peak times see eg melbournes tramclearways with a peak tram lane outside of peak many routes have no need for a lane  trams can make smaller curves  not really and you really dont want sharp curves due to excessive wear  trams are cheaper because friction  its more complicated trams are cheaper because of their power source and their longevity in addition to rolling resistance  trams can easily be extended onto other rails  not where the track gauge is different providing quick connections may be all that is necessary or even useful consider also platform height for large bogied trains vs lowfloor trams  trams are bidirectional  not all trams nor do buses have trouble uturning if the street isnt too narrow besides you need a set of points for the tram to turn back with if you want/need to do that  zero pollution  at the place where the vehicle is used not elsewhere if the power system runs on combustion    im kind of sick of this meme that thou shalt have a 24/7 dedicated lane thats not a rule that always makes sense im tlaking about branching suburban routes rather than trunk routes of course      its just not that black and white its a lot easier to set up a tram route in a city centre than an underground heavy rail cars dont really belong in the city centre anyway and buses pollute too much but trams are just right      did you mean brt as a trunk option  brisbanes bus/rapid bus system revolves around trunk brt rights of way and suburban routes that connect to the brt trunk which works until the point where your trunk chokes with buses    friendly reminder that trolleybus is best bus
stockholm sweden tram tracks over sergels torg only five years behind schedule thanks to a street renovation job being twenty years behind
  if its mixed traffic use a bus  if its an exclusive right of way use a train  this would be true if all routes were either exclusively mixed traffic or exclusively spacy right of way in reality in urban areas its always a mix of both thats were trams come in trams are just trains made smaller so they fit in the streets and can run in mixed traffic where necessary urban planners nowadays are putting a ton of labels on it and distinguish between streetcar and light rail and light train and whatever more but its really all just trains coming in different sizes pick the size that fits your area and youre good to go      your points are valid but i was just quickly summing up some advantages of trams more than going into detail about all the except for whens generally taking any statement about urban transportation as an absolute fact is a recipe for disaster because every situation is different all those failed light rail systems and brts built as a copy of a working system elsewhere can elaborate about the tram lanes ofcourse theres nothing wrong with trams running in mixed traffic per se pretty sure every based system that has been around for a while has at least a few sections but if theres room for it its alway best in amsterdam theres tram lanes almost everywhere and theyre nice even in quiet streets because trams can rush past cars at 70km/h cars are limited to 50km/h in urban areas for obvious reasons also tram lanes are intimidating to other traffic people always look twice before crossing one while most drivers dont give a shit about blocking a tram in mixed traffic    posted from a siemens combino
  i didnt even notice that yeah they would have to be there part of the development is a massive art gallery precinct and its near the botanical gardens/shrine so its not going to be bleak or at least you wouldnt think so
theres a 5 km stretch in my city of 300k people which i think you greatly benefit from a light rail line     how do i get around to actually finding out if this is the case to present to the mayor
  do the rough maths the tram has to connect people with places they want to go city planners consider people be willing to walk 500m or so to a light rail stop usual suspects are airports railroad stations hospitals colleges clusters of commieblocks and clusters of supermarkets   then wait for elections pitch the light rail idea to whoever is the most likely to go with it if it gains traction his opponents will try to steal the idea
so i did some rough googling and found out that both ends of the dc streetcar terminate at subway stations    im seriously considering taking a bus to the dc metro riding the metro to the streetcar riding the streetcar to the end of the line and then taking the metro back    i need you to talk me out of it
  sounds like a fun day desu
  one day i really wanna take the wuppertal suspension monorail to its western terminus and then change directly to the solingen trolleybus train rides there and back included the most /n/ experience i can think of
  not my photo but this is the exact car i was on
  that must be a really tiny camera that takes such tiny photos
  its a good omen if theres a bus line that operates constant 10 min at peak or more
  while most drivers dont give a shit about blocking a tram in mixed traffic  sigh that killed philadelphia system     would have been perfectly salvageable system
  it pains me greatly that i never got to see toronto full of clrvs and alrvs under trolleypoles must have been quite a sight to see im sure those new streetcars will work out great but the whole system will look more like all modern streetcars without those oldstyle a e s t h e t i c s
  tfw no trolley line 23  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  i warned you about street riding bro    i told you dog    t rode new orleans streetcars and now wonders constantly why more cities dont implement a new orleans style system
  btw phillys modern trolley cars are from 8182 almost 40 years old is there any plan for replacing or at least refurbishing them are they so well built that they could still last for many years like the pccs  also have you heard about any issues with the line 15 pccs or are they still working out fine
  the execution of this streetcar has been terrible  is there literally anything that tampa is good at aside from shit stuff like strip clubs i mean
  closing long tram lines in 1992  what the fuck were they thinking
so how many streetcar lines have been closed in your city assuming any have been here in toronto while we still have a great system it is a shadow of its former self you can see all the lines closed here 
  yeah i get lines closing decades ago during the car boom when trams and light rails were being abandoned left and right but 1992 aint that long ago
  boston did the same thing with the heathforest hills centre street branch of the green line the late 80s was the peak of urban violence in most american cities and most transit agencies had no interest in maintaining the headaches of street running on lines that most respectable people were afraid to ride
trams are fine if implemented properly  boondoggle  outdated technology  these are koch brother anti transit talking points as seen in the nashville ballot  sage goes in all fields
    dont the tracks still exist at least for the 23
  i dunno wont install chrome just for that    
  yes and they even have the catenary theyre essentially mothballed as far as i saw when i went there two years ago they havent even been paved over would require some refurbishing but nowhere near the expense of laying entirely new tracks thats also how they got line 15 back going it was one of the three lines temporarily suspended in 92    what would be interesting to know is if philly has more pccs still in storage line 15 was recovered partly bc they had the pccs lying around and rebuilding them was much cheaper than buying new units
  compares with existing transit lines if there are no make some bus lines first
  correction the tracks have actually been damaged or paved over at some points i only saw them around downtown    the damage nevertheless doesnt seem so bad that it would be extremely difficuly to recover them but obv septa seems to have absolutely no interest in extending streetcar service ive found some news items from last month when a study was published which recommends improving the bus network and turning line 15 back to bus operation this doesnt necessarily mean anything but it goes to show that theres no push whatsoever for more trolley service sad      walkers report also calls on septa to consider abandoning the route 15 trolley which mostly runs along girard avenue and replacing it with a highfrequency bus line citing the streetcars inability to get around doubleparked cars and other obstacles that frequently obstruct its path  literally the only reason to consider abanding it is   muh parked cars  its like the 1950s all over again jfc philly get your shit together
  if implemented properly  exactly op does not mean all trams are boondoggles he means the thread topic is about boondoggle trams      sounds like the real problem is as always entitled cagers
  sounds like the real problem is as always entitled cagers  indeed afaik the route 15 conversion to trolleys hasnt been a huge success in regards to ridership but i can imagine that the cost of operation can be economical if they last long and theyre already 13 years old since their rebuilding in 2005 and arent too expensive to maintain plus they are more spacious comfy and enticing to ride than some shitty bus  id love to see some numbers but id bet that since the conversion to streetcar operation route 15 would have had its passenger numbers grow slightly
  walkers report also calls on septa to consider abandoning the route 15 trolley which mostly runs along girard avenue and replacing it with a highfrequency bus line citing the streetcars inability to get around doubleparked cars and other obstacles that frequently obstruct its path  what kind of complete fucking retards is septa hiring to do a study there was a similar study where i live last year where parked cars also came out as a problem for the trams so parking spaces are being scrapped because no one would even consider it to be the trams problem      the city of philadelphia insisted that new route 23 trolley rails be installed on germantown avenue in mt airy when the street was reconstructed in 2008 septa took that opportunity to destroy a key component of the route 23 trolley mermaid loop  what kind of shitty fucking operator is septa fucking end the contract with them asap and give the concession to an operator who isnt doing everything they can to sabotage the network    seriously havent been this triggered in years
  septa is a public administration theyre sabotaging themselves if anything the point of this could be that septa doesnt want to make it possible to recover those streetcar services not necessarily because of an inherent hate toward public transport or streetcars but because theyre strapped for cash and dont want to be forced to divert funds to a trolley line which on paper wont do much to improve transit service which begs the question why it rebuilt the street with tracks in the first place though it could have been some formal requirement because otherwise it would have to change the lines status from temporarily suspended to scrapped or something like that fuck yeah bureaucracy    in any case phillyanons here have often remarked on the massive retardation and lack of funding of septa considering that philadelphia is a city with a reasonable level of infrastructure as in subways commuter light rail commuter trains streetcars and trolleybuses i think that the city is being incredibly retarded over this if they pulled a route 15 on route 23 as in recovering service with rebuilt pccs maybe some phillyanon could enlighten us on whether septa still has unrestored pccs lying around it would be a huge tourist attraction with classic streetcars running through the middle of downtown while also being a great boon to locals using said route
so ive been thinking    most municipalities in the us cant or wont spend the money to put lrvs on an exclusive right of way  because street running lrvs are slower and have all sorts of problems with parallel parking and traffic jams people dont want to build them because its a lot of infrastructure cost for a very marginal improvement over buses  in the us it is much much easier to get a highway project funded than a rail travel project funded    with all of these being the case why not ask for funding from the state dot or federal government to put hov lanes along the route that you want the light rail to go and then when the state and federal governments are done footing the bill install tracks    all youd need to do is add the physical tracks the stations i was thinking you build them as islands on the median and have pedestrian footbridges to the sidewalks on either side of the road the cables and the signal priority    youd be using the governments love of cages against them and if you cant get the lrt built you still have a nice hov and you can at least make bus service way more effective
  is it really that much easier to get an extensive new road network funded  where i live bus lanes are built with needless tracks on them because only tram lanes get funded but this is europe so we obviously have to deal with a different kind of autism than the us
  it wouldnt be a new road network it would be new lanes on existing roads and controlled entrances for tolling possibly with a concrete barrier and a widening of the road
sigh portland streetcar needs to expand maybe it will even adopt little bigger rolling stock which sadly i fear need to be imported from western europe or japan    also seattle has relatively sane plans then you would have a suitable made in america version of relatively low density urban rail which is nevertheless extensible if urban development turns out as desired
  septa/philly cares more about where the money is sadly so that means most of their profits go into expanding regional rail    they are working on switching some of the existing trolley routes over to light rail vehicles though starting with the 101 and 102 trolley routes  
  this might start happening in 2024 which is ambitious  wew
rate my new glass comfy/10
  thats the worst map i have ever seen a printed out page from some 90s looking digital maps or whatever poor basemap it is in a small scale overwritten with some lines with large marker pen and then again scanned  pc skills 10/10    btw doesnt bombardier produce in canada
  take your assburger pills assburger
  he cute
  portland  desert country    huh
  im generally a proponent of public transit but the nashville plan was a textbook example of how to do everything wrong the proponents werent able to show that it would have a positive impact on traffic that the lines would be wellutilized that the increased overhead would be selfsustaining by an increase in paying fares kids elderly and poor would all get big discounts or free passes and those are the people who would have used the new lines the most and that the project would be completed on time given that a big part of it was a big tunnel under downtown worse the proposal raised sales tax above 10 which is a big psychological threshold that voters will revolt against the proponents of it and of public transit in general got a big fucking reality check with that vote if their takeaway is that its because of evul billionaires theyre dumb as shit and will continue to fail    the streetcar here is kinda crap and i wish that max would be expanded to have a couple of short lines that serve neighborhoods rather than just being built along existing freight rail but instead were spending  on a fucking retarded expansion of i5 that wont accomplish a single fucking thing talk about a boondoggle
  so basically something like xiamen in china
anyone familiar with the san diego system that it seems like their system have other types of locomotives running in it
  lol seattles map isnt much better
      the new streetcars that seattle ordered to expand the downtown streetcar system are heavier and longer than the ones the city now operates and its unclear if theyll work on the current track and fit in the maintenance barn mayor jenny durkans office said tuesday  the seattle department of transportation sdot ordered 10 new streetcars in the fall at a cost of 52 million as it planned to link the two existing streetcar lines with a new line along first avenue through downtown  but durkan halted that work in march and ordered an independent review of the projects finances after a seattle times report said costs to operate the new system could be 50 percent higher than sdot had publicly stated     the streetcars the city now owns and operates are made by a different company inekon the city opted for a new manufacturer after inekon fell behind schedule on cars for the first hill streetcar line which opened two years late  the city asked for a fairly broad list of specifications in the new streetcars but almost all of the options are longer and heavier than the inekon cars currently in use  the citys contract with caf usa asks for streetcars between 65 and 755 feet long  the inekon streetcars are about 66 feet according to the company  the caf usa streetcars are supposed to have a maximum weight of 82000 pounds to about 95000 pounds according to the contract requirements  but the inekon streetcars are only about 60000 pounds according to the company    how can this even happen buying these lilliputian streetcars is one thing designing the infrastructure around them without provisions for expansion is another
  new streetcars will not fit on the line    news like this emerge everywhere around the world where they have trams it is just tabloid nonsense in 99 of the time  the lines are build with some standards and the first thing the producer does when producing a new vehicle is checking out those standards the worst that can happen is that there is some old track which already degraded during the time and it does not meet the standards it used to have however this should not happen in the new system such as seattle  the length does not mean anything if the tram stops are designed to fit them what is important is the ability to go through curves whichc is designed by the length between bogies their posibility to turn and many other criteria  the weight can be a problem but just in a long run because the heavier the vehicle is the more maintenance will the track require
  always be cautious of seattle times articles with the word may in the title especially when the topic is transit the mayoral and herbolds statements havent been fact checked
    american journalism    i actually cross checked various sources and opted for the local in the end the fox news version saw it necessary to mention like 5 times how the mayor is anti trump    the main news article with this were the budget overruns though    there may be a real problem that the first phase depot cant fit longer vehicles if the holding tracks have been sized in such a way that they hold like 34 current cars if theres space for 1 less per track they may need to modify or extend the facilities before intended     compatibility study for new rolling stock in itself is fairly standard affair some manufacturers even send a loading gauge maquette to check that the vehicle fits to the network
  dont get me wrong i wouldnt put it past sdot to completely fuck something like this up the first hill line was a lesson in government incompetence and youd think theyd have learned from it if only because every streetcar line going forward was bound to be under intense scrutiny seattle cannot help doing things their own way as if theyre the first ones to do anything    the mayor is just flexing her fiscally pragmatic muscles right now the line will get built eventually but she needs to act like shes reigning in the excess    fox news usually cant mention seattle without calling it a socialist hellhole so calling durken antitrump seems mild
  or just dont let blacks on the trains problem solved
why arent double decker trams more common  would a triple decker tram ever be possible
  loading gauge unless a system started with double deckers it has too low overhead wire
the new tram system of oran algeria  cagers really are the same everywhere lmao  
  in hong kong they cannot upgrade the tram line to a larger low platform one because of problem with loading gauge being too narrow and its also narrow gauge and the catenary network also make it hard to upgrade trams to an air conditioned one
  it is
so seeing my thread on page 9 already i decided to go on crawl on the uk situation and it seems relatively happy even    for starters the midland metro is extended and it is starting to form a solid mainline metrolink is also going strong    nothing has happened in nottingham sheffield has been dabbling with diesel tramtrains blackpool is getting a tiny tiny branch at least now they are operating more or less modern equipment    merseyrail and tyne and wear metro have hard time expanding culturally and because they run nonstandard electrification system 750 v third rail and 1500 v overhead
  and london is asleep
want to see this happening
its a small thing but the trolley polls are slowly starting to be phased out here in toronto i believe 2 lines have already been converted with another being done by the end of the year im not sure of the exact schedule for next year
taking my you thank you very much    as ive been bemoaning the brt vs lrt situation at my city turku at least the city officials have been doing what  said field trips    the transport board has already been to at least in nantes to see their system with three tram lines plus one superbus and in malmö to meet the volvo people they went to st petersburg in other business but had some time allocated for studying the infrastructure also they have sent requests for commentaries or whatever is their proper name to every even tangentially related party    no the if the schedule would have been as anticipated in february the cabinet would have had a vote on the future of the transit like last tuesday but that obviously didnt happen instead in a slight surprise the transport board announced its going to go to uk to see manchester nottingham and london systems later in this fall     all in all i find it worrisome that our transport board finds the british cities as the most relatable reference places    pic not related just found another map of an american memestreetcar
hong kong nwnt light rail system  i still dont understand why the system have such ridership and being overcrowded on average 490k passenger per day system length is 362km no info about average journey length yet theyre still losing money on it and thus not making any more significant investment into the system  the most mindblogging part is probably the line 506 line 506 was a route that run on the system however due to certain event that created rail car shortage they have to send buses onto the route instead afterwards they decided that bus are good enough and those rail cars have been redeployed elsewhere so they would just keep sending buses onto the route instead of buying extra rail cars for the route how would all those buses be more economical than light rail cars especially when all the tracks and stations are still operative regardless of this  indeed those buses are double deckers while those light rails are 12cars single deck but i am pretty sure the light rail still have better capacity those substitution buses come one after another at bus stop that once a bus finish loading the other bus come almost immediately and each of those buses are fully loaded with 100 passengers while still leaving behind a long queue at bus stop however that apparently still does not justify switching the service back to light rail service with infrastructures that are already there and operational  literally what went wrong
    this violates the civil rights act
  and your point is
  why even reply to such a post
  dont worry they still have antiquated switches and ridiculously tight turning radius some lines have literal street stops where one needs to deboard to automobile lane
  as an upper middle class white person who moved to be closer to a streetcar line in my midsize blue state city    fuck off it saves me money and it frees up my commute time to shitpost on /n/
  you missed a few big ones     contemporary streetcars can have additional cars attached to increase passenger capacity at peak times like rush hour and during sporting events beyond that of any existing buses and without needing to hire additional drivers     rail vehicles have far better fuel economy than a bus of similar size because metalonmetal has less rolling resistance than inflated rubber on asphalt     rail is dramatically less impaired by snow which is an enormous improvement in toronto chicago minneapolis etc    not to mention that the operating costs and maintenance downtime are far lower   steel wheels dont need to be serviced or replaced anywhere near as often as rubber tires  electric motors dont need to be serviced or rebuilt anywhere near as often as diesel engines because they have like 90 fewer moving parts
  shit is that one of the new cars
come on amerifats how are your meme streetcars doing    meanwhile in europe id say we arguably have maybe the london tram i just dont see any way how it could expand to form any relevant transport system in any possible way     in paris on the other hand they have seen over then circular routes that still dont form a network either of course when we a talking about france there are few translohr lines mixed in id say that if anything else is the european equivalent to the meme streetcar    at least id imagine theres a good track bed half made and ready overhead line infrastructure some maintenance buildings on lots with room to expand so its not all bad just expensive      are they really going to bound a monorail to kai tak
  generally europe has zero meme streetcars per country but spain is the big exception with several of them from the top of my head  barcelona the light metro has lots of useless oldskool tram curves even in the tunnels making it slow  madrid 2 halfs of the network were never connected  bilbao short partly single track line through the city center really an american style tram project  jaén system is finished since 2011 but never opened because of political bullshit  velezmalaga opened a few years ago closed again because of limited usefullness now they wanna reopen it but the line fell into disrepair and they dont have the money to fix it
   the light metro has lots of useless oldskool tram curves even in the tunnels making it slow   2 halfs of the network were never connected  are you confusing those two barcelona doesnt have particularly many curves
  are they really going to bound a monorail to kai tak  99 chance the kai tak will be built
  yes i think anon mixed those two up    barcelonanon regularly reeees about the two seperate networks not being connected via the diagonal alley
  are you confusing those two  i am actually  the tracks in barcelona are really pretty laid its a shame they dont connect the two halfs into a real network and expand it because it would be a lot cheaper than constructing more unnecessary metros that go to nowhere
  my man also barcelona tram isnt meme tram despite lacking connection it works fine as a local and feeder tram especially the southern system that connects many burbs lacking metro and train service     id also argue that bilbao though somewhat memey is still quite useful definitely not burgerlandmemetramtier it connects the bilbaoatxuri narrowgauge train station to the city center and is generally a useful link between heavy rail and central areas otherwise not well served by rail transport it runs through an area that used to be industrial but was redeveloped when the industry moved further outward a brtstyle bus system offering similar speed and capacity would be extremely clunky in those narrow streets while the singletrack sections are a decent spacesaving solution
  id also argue that bilbao though somewhat memey is still quite useful definitely not burgerlandmemetramtier  yeah i apologize for that one comparing anything to an american tram system is just too far    from the outside it looks like a very memey system though short lines like that havent been built anywhere in europe outside of spain and someone once told me that the horseshoe shape of the line makes it faster to walk from abando to la casilla than taking the tram the archaic looking singletrackonthesideoftheroad layout also smells like meme spirit but apparently you really shouldnt judge a book by its cover
  the horseshoe shape of the line makes it faster to walk from abando to la casilla  undoubtedly true but v u or horseshoe shaped lines are common and theyre simply not meant to go from one end to the other theyre rather like two lines joined up into one or in this case an incomplete circle line thats completed by the metro and commuter trains  think of it like one tram line from atxuri to the guggenheim area and another one from there to casilla  its not the most amazingly useful tram line ever and it was part of a meme redevelopment but its not entirely pointless either like right in the middle between meme and useful lrt    apparently theres plans to extend it on the atxuri side the idea is to build a tunnel for the narrow gauge trains so they can reach further into the city because god forbid there be a normal aboveground train terminus that isnt converted to something that looks like a metro the part of the rail line that wouldnt be used anymore would then be converted to tram operation adding about 2 km currently its 45 km
  but still a monorail
  official analysis compared a few different systems   cable cars  cannot provide sufficient capacity and low reliability with effect from weather and long downtime for repairs   cable liners like oakland airport  low reliability and low flexibility   personal rapid transit  cannot provide sufficient capacity   automated walkways  low efficiency and take long time to repair when needed   brt and tramway with dedicated row  efficiency not really different from regular cars/buses poor on time performance   brt and tramway with dedicated row  use up extra road space require overhaul to all the roads along the way and also removal of cables and infrastructure under the road and create congestion    actually the situation of the nwnt lrt i just mentioned is probably why they are wary about atgrade systems and roads in builtup part of east kowloon where the system will connect to would be even narrower than nwnt area the tram company current operating the tram on hong kong islands was trying to create some public pressure by arguing they are cheaper to built and can turn a profit with fare much less than a monorail however their opinion were pretty much ignored just like their other proposals to expand their system on the hong kong islands     and then among elevated system its either apmagt or monorail monorail seems to be favorable due to less road space being used so its being picked    more detailed analysis reports 
    actually from this report and the website seems like agt/apm system is now a possibility too as it doesnt make any judgement against it unlike earlier reports/advertisement materials so lets see what would come out of it and will they make a come back
   correction the reason that was used to favor monorail over apm was effect on landscape and size
      speaking of which the mtr company in hong kong will soon start operating the apm system in nearby macau i wonder will this experience turns out to be favorable to putting apm in the kai tak area but the macau apm system seems like a disaster even before operation start
  looks like a lego factory desu
  boondoggle edition  plenty of complaints about canberra metro  by the way canberra  your  light rail  is being  tested
  macau apm is more joke toyish childish naive than lego

when i was sleeping earlier today i suddenly had a dream that i was watching a color documentary about postwar showa era urban landscape in japan circa 1960s in the dream i recall seeing double deck trams on streets alongside with regular single deck trams  did such thing actually existed in history of japan
  come on amerifats how are your meme streetcars doing  well since you asked    kansas city has a little streetcar running along main street for no raisin rides are free and the line is financed by sales tax on nearby businesses the streetcar goes nowhere that cannot be reached by anybody going downtown which means people who either either have a car or take the bus the proposed southern extension would terminate near a university but all the students there either live in walking distance from the university take the bus or have cars as well so the streetcar doesnt give them much more mobility    the line is part of a new citywide brand for public transportation called ridekc with new buses and new bus stops added throughout the metro area
trams are good and youre a retard  your moms a slut    t aussie train guy
  in general yes in america no
what do you think about the gmunden stadtregiotram project in austria    the first test ride on the new section happened on 6 august  the whole project is about connecting an older short single tram line in the austrian town of gmunden 13000 ppl   to a local narrow gauge railway which had its terminus on the other side of the old town the result is creating a longer system where tramlike vehicles are operated and a new tram section which goes straight through the old town streets and over a bridge with 2 new stops
  unironically 11/10
  why  i am actually kinda worried about the whole purpose of this although it is definitely a great concept the whole ammount of money put into this reminds me of american streetcar projects i am affraid the passenger demand is not high enough to justify the project
  short tram is of little use but high cost  train line ends outside of city center  train line gets better coverage within the city  two systems combined into one meaning lower total operational cost  only a short section needs to be built is the old part getting double tracked btw  tram line gets new rolling stock  seems like a great project    i am affraid the passenger demand is not high enough to justify the project  but isnt that the point increasing passenger demand now you get an overlapping demand of both tram and train users onto one line that will make the whole thing much more efficient than having two different systems also like i said the total operational cost will be lower so thats an improvement even if demand is low
  train line ends outside of city center  it is hard of talking about city in this case it is a little town and the local narrow gauge train that got connected to the tram line had a terminus in the very centre just a few hundred metres away from the original tram terminus    tram line gets new rolling stock  which is super expensive initial costs and even more service costs during the time the capacity of the new trams is more than double of the original trams which was most of the times more than enough the number of passangers used to be very low    the lower operational costs is possibly the only benefit i see but on the other hand there will be increased service on the originally train line and also the new vehicles service costs increase much more so basically the operational costs will increase in total just they will be probably a little lower than if there would be two systems with the same frequency of service hard to say    the thing is the tram and the locla narrow gauge train both had very little demand before the project and now you connect them which is wise but you also increase dramatically the frequency of service and the capacity of the vehicles and you buy modern expensive vehicles the total costs skyrockets and the demand increase results are very hypothetical it is not a big city it is a town of 13000 with an agglomeration of few more thousand plus
  id rather have too much infrastructure for too few people than the american disease of places like phoenix    then again 13000 seems extremely marginal for rail transit in burgerland anything under 200000 is simply out of the question
  you think that if they extended it out to the university students might ride it into downtown to go to restaurants and bars and such might stimulate some growth
      not gonna lie this project is giving me a raging erection and i believe tramtrains even in rather rural areas are the future   i dream of a world where public transport is so good that no one even wants to use a car anymore let alone needs to this tram definitely isnt too much if everyone used it instead of a car
  holy shit i had no idea they were planning this tfw the alltime record holder for worlds smallest tram system gets an extension      i dunno from what ive been reading about it the last 30 minutes it seems like a very sane project stern  hafferl has started operating their local railroads with tram vehicles anyway so why not connect the tram to the traunseebahn making both a lot more useful only real con i can think of is the trams being pretty long 5 parts making the weird situation in which the trams are heavier and more expensive to operate than the trains they replace but theyre obviously expecting a lot of new passengers and as ive seen what tram operation has accomplished in the karlsruhe area where local railways going through absolute nowhere became succesful tram lines i think their decision to go allin with the project might very well turn out to be the right one      even though the amount of potential passengers required to justify a tram is ridiculously high in the us because of the cager culture and pretty much the lowest in the world in germany and austria considering the regional tram lines theyve been constructing in recent years you have to consider that in this case the lines are already there and operational the choice is leaving them as a tourist attraction further stripping down the schedule to keep it affordable or put in a little extra money to create something a region like that could normally never dream of if youre lucky enough to have a tram system and a regional rail line available for your 20000 people why not use them to their full potential
  it is hard of talking about city in this case it is a little town and the local narrow gauge train that got connected to the tram line had a terminus in the very centre just a few hundred metres away from the original tram terminus  right but now the local train will cross the whole city getting more catchment area and reach the mainline train station thats a better connection overall     line gets new rolling stock  which is super expensive initial costs and even more service costs during the time  you cant keep the old trains/trams running for ever or rather you can but eventually it will become really expensive as youre basically running heritage vehicles    the capacity of the new trams is more than double of the original trams which was most of the times more than enough the number of passangers used to be very low  how was the capacity/demand of the local train line i think you should see this whole project as the train line eating up the local tram not like the tram getting a bigass overhaul    the lower operational costs is possibly the only benefit i see but on the other hand there will be increased service on the originally train line and also the new vehicles service costs increase much more so basically the operational costs will increase in total  well yeah running public transit isnt free but its a useful service in the end its all part of a larger scheme of having the whole region or even country well connected theres no arguing on whether its good or bad to invest more for better public transit as it comes down to preference one can be against it and say that only the bare minimum should be spent then only people with no other choice will use transit or one can be in favour of spending more to make transit more attractive then more people will use it though it will still cost more otoh people will save money on cars which in turn will go to other spending which can be good for the economy
  the thing is the tram and the locla narrow gauge train both had very little demand before the project and now you connect them which is wise but you also increase dramatically the frequency of service and the capacity of the vehicles and you buy modern expensive vehicles the total costs skyrockets and the demand increase results are very hypothetical  they really arent tho the unusual thing would be for demand not to increase the project is a clear contender for some delicious induced demand also think of the tourist potential its not the same getting to gmunden taking the tram which runs prolly with a low frequency getting off walking to the local train station and taking the train than changing over at the very station from the train to the tramtrain im not talking a huge wave of tourism but certainly some hikers and day trippers   it all reminds me of what you see in switzerland they spend a lot of money on these sorts of small railways and in turn you can get around the whole country without a car its a useful service for the population it saves people money on cars which they can spend in more useful ways and it promotes day tourism without stinking the places up with cars    after all were not talking about some massive white elephant project just a couple hundred meters of tram line and some new rolling stock which will be good for both the tram and the train line like i said its complicated to have a line using the same rolling stock forever eventually maintenance costs will become very expensive and/or you need to rebuild the old trains which is also expensive so likely at some point theyd have gotten new rolling stock anyway  i mean if its really such an expense then why not get rid of both the tram and the train and replace it all with buses
  but theyre obviously expecting a lot of new passengers    the time will show however i am rather sceptical in this case yes it will probably increase the demand slightly but if you double the train capacity and increasethe frequency then to be justifiable the demand should increase at least in the same way not even considering the fact that both tram and local railway did not have a satisfiable demand even before   i have bee to austria many times they have one of the best public transports in the world of course at least in the cities the regional transportation is definitely not as good as in switzerland though but i also see that lots of people are used to take a car instead it is a rich country and having a car is so much more comfortable the demand for public transportation seemed to me and statistics tell i am right lower than in my homecountry czechia where people still use buses and trams and trains not because of comfort but because of the price   with this i want to say that i would be very surprised if this whole project would be a success and get big increase in passengers from cars to trams in a country where affording a car is pretty easy thing for majority of population and the tram tickets are definitely not the cheapest option
    yes the 23 and the 56 tracks and wires still mostly exist and even portions of the lines abandoned in the 80s not to mention that a lot of them are still under the pavement and could be rehabilitated easily like the mckinney ave streetcar in dallas the real issue isnt anything to do with technical details of the system the issue is actually that its philadelphia and this leads to total mismanagement if boston or new york had even a fraction of that network still in existence they would have it up and running in months     i think that longterm especially as north philly gentrifies were going to see more lines reopen like the girrard line
  this study made every transit advocate on the east coast reeeee with rage because this is how boston paved over the heath loop  forest hills portion of the e line in the mid 2000s and now that neighborhood is starting to realize it was a mistake     muh busses    doesnt mean shit in snowy environments those articulated busses arent as effective as a streetcar in any city that has snow       what kind of complete fucking retards is septa hiring to do a study    the sort of entitled cagers who live in the suburbs around philly and think they can run the city better than the people who live in it of course just like every other stupid transit study done by a firm located in an office park 30 miles outside downtown that hasnt seen a streetcar since they tore up the interurbans 100 years ago     what kind of shitty fucking operator is septa    youll notice a trend states where there is one major city which has a staterun rather than a city run transit system suffer while cities that run their own transit systems thrive compare boston and philly vs new orleans or san francisco the reason septa is garbage is because its funding demands are done through the state not the city of philly
  isnt this why the new york subway is such trash
new roundabout was just opened in my city  kosice slovakia  there are actually two roundabouts in there outer one for cars and inner one for trams
  also image of new trams city got  vario lf   they are quite comfy but lack ac they are based on old skoda/ckd t3 platform so by time they will be out of service the base will be over 100 years old
  the information that they are a modernisation of old tatras is just a meme sometimes they just keep the paperwork of old trams and make it bureaucratically a modernisation because of easier technical agreement process and some other business stuff however there is nothing left from the old trams nothing it is just a partly lowfloor tram with similar length and concept of tatra k2 that means it is a little outdated definitely not a type of a modernlooking lowfloor tram but whatever people are apparently ok with that  nice roundabout btw
    sexy how is it used by the various lines do they all just cross it do some use it to turn is it used as a loop for lines that end  also i love how the stop is always at the exiting direction of the roundabout that way i can catch any tram going in a certain direction from the same stop even if lines are rearranged  10/10
     tram tracks inside   yikes   the roundabout exit designs seems too high speed for the close crosswalk placement
  at the beggining of each direction there are 3 lanes each lane takes you to one exit
  oh i just realised you talk about tram lines each line crosses it and no line ends there however it can bed used as a loop if some direction is not usable for some reason
  yeah that is one of bad things about this tram crosswalk is not that much of problem because pedestrians do not have right of way in front of trams road crosswalk at exits should be moved
      is this at soš automobilová looking at this map  trams use 5 of the 6 possible routes through the roundabout in daily service which is pretty cool    also the yellow/blue livery looks really good does those tatras justice
  for my first point its against my philosophy to let tram tracks go into instead of around a roundabout this is nonstandard   worse still it appears to be unsignalized hence the stop lines in front of crossing tram tracks inside the circular roadways this does not favor prioritizing trams either
   nonstandard especially considering what seems to be sufficient land around
  tram crossings are signaled and trams are priorized
  yes it is at modlavska street at google street view / satelite you can see how old  roundabout looked liked
  thats funny because to me tracks on the outside of a roundabout sound completely alien as tram tracks are usually in the middle of the road so having tracks on the outside of the roundabout would require trams to cross paralel traffic twice for no reason    actually here in amsterdam tram roundabouts are a pretty common thing and theyre all inside the car roundabout pic related is the one at the former haarlemmermeerstation
just found this outdated but really cool map of the rheinruhr tram systems    for whos interested found it on a site called  which is basically an unfinished urbanrailnet that has been abandoned for years but it has some pretty cool stuff
  the ruhr area deserves a metro
  theyre all inside the car roundabout  most of them are kind of on top of the roundabout haarlemermeercircuit weteringschaans etc are all tram circuits that mostly share the row with other traffic
  how was the capacity/demand of the local train line  apparently they even ran double units during peak hours which makes me wonder how that is done from now on since 60m long trams certainly dont fit on the urban line
  iif it helps they have like 4 premetro systems      recreate the haarlemmermeerspoorlijnen please
  trams/streetcars are good  fuck you and your car congested hellhole
  its usually just a way for mobbed up contractors to scam the taxpayers
fuck trams i want my second level monorail already just build tracks that go above the road and those become the new buses people would just climb the stairs to get on
  10/10 comfy pic    iif it helps they have like 4 premetro systems  does not help actually makes it worse its such a mess of a place with a mess of a public transport system     what city are we talking about   elevators are important as well
  recreate the haarlemmermeerspoorlijnen please  many of the more important lines have already been reopened as a light rail or brt prepared for light rail conversion i think we will see most of the network restored for tram operation in 20 years or so    the haarlemmermeerlijnen were one of the biggest failures in dutch railway history being opened in an era when local railways were being replaced by buses serving areas with very little inhabitants some lines had passenger service for little more than 10 years before they ceased operation but in recent years many lines have been reopened for rail or bus  amsterdam willemspark  bovenkerk in use as a heritage tramway amsterdam light rail line 51 has a parallel route  bovenkerkish  legmeerpolder used by adam light rail line 51  legmeerpolder  uithoorn will be used by tram 51 extension opening 2022  uithoorn  mijdrecht used as brt bus lane prepared for lrt conversion  uithoorn  aalmeer used as brt bus lane see pic related at former de kwakel station prepared for lrt conversion  aalsmeer  hoofddorp  haarlem brt bus lane has been built on the entire route but mostly on new allignment prepared for lrt conversion  hoofddorp  nieuw vennep used as brt bus lane prepared for lrt conversion    bovenkerk  aasmeer has been mentioned in light rail plans before but nothing on the table currently  mijdrecht  loenen will probably be reopened as brt or lrt to breukelen someday  nieuw vennep  leiden already came back as the railway amsterdam  schiphol airport  nieuw vennep  leiden  uithoorn  alphen aan de rijn will probably never reopen because the former allignment is already in use as a provincial road and the towns it served still small and unimportant
  write your congressmen  dc
meanwhile in the old europe things run more or less as they always have run        a new depot should be established and the new refurbished in the near future there will be 122 trams 27 m long in hoping that another of the old inner city depots would remain in heritage use
  they eventually opened it after the municipal elections most parties want it extended further but as it stands 45/101 municipal council seats belong to parties that dont against 43/101 that do and 13/101 belonging to the communists who want to investigate first
  what would such a guideline look like /n/      explaining relations between factors like speed cost capacity popularity general advantages etc step by step
      roundabouts are cancer
foolproof new age trend chasing city streetcar how to guide  1 do not mix traffic american motorists are idiots and will crash their cars every other week by having a fixed route form of transport that cannot swerve or avoid any crashes and you are asking people to plow into it at all costs separate streetcar traffic from regular traffic at all costs with physical barriers and signage to prevent cars from even getting near streetcars  2 give streetcars right of way if streetcars have to wait in traffic with cars they are no better than glorified busses they are supposed to be expedient and can carry large numbers of people through large dense urban areas which brings me to my third point  3 give streetcars a place to go when building your very first streetcar in your decaying modern midwestern city give it places to go stadiums hospitals inner and outer downtown airports and popular tourist destinations   4 interchanges i cannot stress how important enough this is if you have even a rinky dink 2 line metro system in your city it is still important to have interchanges to other forms of public transport no one is going to want to catch a train then walk to a bus stop then catch a bus to a tram stop just to get to where they want to go people want to minimise the amount of times they have to change between forms of transport    the best example of a modern city setting up a streetcar system and i am cheating since this isnt america in recent years is the gold coasts glink and it hits all these spots  1 separated from traffic  2 has right of way   3 goes from the beach to the city to the hospital to the university  4 has an interchange right next to the heavy rail line  its really good and really convenient and theyre going to be expanding it to the airport in coming years
  american spoted
streetcars are whack a 10 million dollar bus that can only go on a track good job
  basic tram is like 1 milion dollars in shitholes at least
  it should give americans hope that even gold coast can implement a fantastic light rail
  10/10 post  tfw some random anon on /n/ understands transit planning better than 90 of professional planners
  it seems like if you want to have a really good transport service you need to get the buses and the rail under the same authority to make transfers easier and to make sure the system actually fits together
   passenger rail for dummies   pointed out general transit/transport principles is much needed they need a fordummies book for bus and urban planning as much as railway hell even roads aside from traffic management
commencing moscow mini dump
highfloor is still the norm but some lines like number 11 run exclusively lowfloor units
i counted as many as 4 different liveries the blue one
the orange one
the white and cream one
and the red white and blue one
  never seen this thing in msk is this new
      internet says they entered service in 2017so yeah brand spanking new    ive also been able to gather that some of the single section trams are actually quite recent as well they have a lowfloor area in the centre for wheelchair accessibility manufacturer rates capacity at around 200 pax which isnt really believable at 4 pax/m2 but i would believe 150160 which is still about as much as a large articulated bus so theyre still quite efficient over buses considering that operation and maintenance are likely cheaper     my impression is that the tram network in moscow has stabilised as a peripheral and feeder system and that further closures are unlikely except maybe following metro extensions that were to parallel tram lines unfortunately the same may not be true for trolleybuses public transport promotional imagery also seems to favour buses and trams while giving little to no consideration to trolleybuses
  is this orange ones or new bитязь
  orange ones you can hardly tell from my pic but if you look really close on the side windows theres two small yellow sticlers with a wheelchair symbol though i wouldnt know if some of them have gotten a blue livery which seems to be the current one
our new tram was revealed today what do you think about the appearance
  personally i like the simplicity
  all modern trams look the same nothing will replace boxy and round tatras
  its ugly you should have bought crotram
  blame safety standards and basically no more possible inovation in the tram body design  it was a whole different story back in the 90s when lots of producers tried to introduce their own unique solution of lowfloor trams ulf eurotram breda transpole socimi s350 etc  those times were far more exciting
  fuck safety regulation i want my square boxes back
  apparently the bumper on their previous model is made as it is to make people bounce off it rather than fall under    whats more with modern trams is that the low floor requirement essentially forces the same internal layout to every model as well
  the old trams had this cow catcher thing that also applied the brakes i havent seen any mention that the bumper in the new cars would do the same    those albert couplers were there purely for towing these werent multiple unit operation capable
commencing st petersburg electric transport museum mini dump see also     pic related is replica of 1907 tram
193334 unit some of these survived the war and were in service until 1979
elephant tram because of its rounded shape and large size  built right after the great patriotic war ww2 194647 using bits and pieces of earlier trams
dandytram from the late 50scalled like that because of its colors and streamlined shape has an aluminium body and comfy seats  its covered in christmas lights
i think this was the elephants interior
the museum is housed in a tram depot
the tram depot is operationalother than the museum area
regular tram passing in front of the museum    thats all
              st petersburg confirmed for most european city in russia
  possibly but theyve also removed most tram service from the city center only one line number 3 passes through the center and it lacks row at one point when i was on it it took about 5 minutes for just one stop because it was stuck in traffic sad
  it looks as russian as possible
  name 1 reason why regular intersections are better than roundabouts
  lmfao
  we have three planned in minnesota  first is one connecting st paul with the airport which is only being called a streetcar for political reason and for cheaper rolling stock other than that its pretty much an planned as a lrt    second is one on nicollet ave which is going no where will probably end up being an abrt and if made into a streetcar will be a meme    third is the midtown greenway streetcar which is the most promising the tldr of it goes as such  minneapolis purchased around 5 miles of old soo line row the row is special because its in a trench bellow street level in the heart of the city eliminating all but 2 grade crossings if built itll be faster end to end then driving even outside of rush hour and will connect 3 different metro lines
  better control over throughput priority especially in high traffic intersections
  you can use another type of roundabout still better than the equivalent regular intersection
  haaberstiring    well well thats honestly pretty efficient use of space with some at grade intersections i mean compared to cloverleaf intersection that has pretty mild footprint too bad that intersection put end to 6 and 7 trolleybuses 
it is a miracle how that middle section hangs there    i think there has not been a three section high floor tram of this type historically like if i recall correctly really early in some obscure eastern european or middle asian country
  whats so obscure about that lots of cities use trams with lowered parts helsinki being the closest to tallinn also these lowered units got renovated and they ride as smooth as the new caf ones
  this type    what type is kt8d5 close enough to your definition
  well that solution you guys have there does belong to pretty obscure club thee sections only two bogies usually there are at least three like those new cars in moscow or four with the most traditional jacobs bogie layout     but indeed that is the next trend in the low floor trams i think you know those kind of floating middle sections and mechanical newtonlinkages to maintain loading gauge im waiting someone to make 5section three bogie unit couldnt have worked for helsinki because the loading gauge doesnt allow long enough cars for both a centerbogie and double doors
  yeah i prefer pic related layout more seems more efficient
  fixed bogies are less comfy tho
like this
  they arent fixed tho but yeah fixed ones also cause more wear on the tracks
  hahaha insanity 3 try to cross this shit as a pedestrian as a cyclist you have to be afraid some idiotic cager asshole rolls over you just for fun
  there are tunnels for cyclists and pedestrians on that roundabout
going to milwaukee at the end of the month but will miss the opening of their new streetcar by 4 days so i will not get to experience yet another decaying midwestern city try and rebirth itself
  you should be more disappointed youre going to miss their eastwest brt line
i like the traditional aesthetics of the buffalo light rail nonarticulated single cars high floor and huge loading gauge    wouldnt have looked out of the place 60 years ago
  nice
main problem with tram systems being built in the us today is that the government is behind them so its bloated inefficient and doesnt have to turn a profit the trams of yesteryear were privately built often by power companies
  t lolbertarian
  nothing i said was untrue
  well you basically said your opinion so it is hard proving if it is true or not   claiming something is a main problem is not a fact but an opinion     for instance the fact that it is not profitable is something like saying the grass is green majority of public transport systems are nonprofitable for you it is a major problem for me it is just another nonimportant fact
  public transportation in the us is entirely run by the government and none of it recoups its cost    when streetcar lines were built it was done by private companies those companies made a profit or else they wouldnt exist for long    not really an opinion unless youre kind of slow
  you do what uk systems do like edinburgh  90 of the line is separated then the last mile or so is street running in the centre
i live in a city with transit corporation that has an extensive tram network toronto     the vehicles and lines have a reputation for being absurdly difficult to drive and work that destroys mens souls this is compared to downtown bus routes and subway lines     does anyone know why that is or might be i cant under stand how something on rails is more stressful to operate in the downtown core than a bus which is expected to make turns and frequently change lanes
  toronto trams dont have right off way so theyre in the streets in the middle of traffic literally sitting in a metal box while idiots with cars surround them
  from the perspective of someone whos used not driven melbournes trams  going off the amount of collisions between trams and cars turning across their path worldwide like the wham bam tram id say theyre always on the look out for things in their path when at speed theres frequently people walking across the tracks often without looking finally as a minor point cagers at intersections where the tram turns can sometimes fail to sit far enough back from the tram as a passenger its also quite frighting to think there might be some zombie cager probably from out of town that mows passengers down while theyre alighting onto the street    also trolleypoles falling off and dragging down the overhead in toronto lol  your low tech
ive been reading the usastreetsblogorg and how come your transit planning costs run in hundreds of millions and build costs in milliards for a typical light rail line thats like order of magnitude more than we have in the eu
  politicians have to make sure their friends especially minorityowned contractors get paid lots of graft and kickbacks plus the usual unnecessary red tape
  back to /p     oh wait this is actually interesting can you throw a breitbart link or something that could explain how these kinds of companies are used in corruption
  i also forgot that for the larger contractors all of their labor is typically unionized so naturally that will add to the price tag those companies are experts in rigging contracts working the bidding system to their advantage and milking the government for all it can get there is no way it should cost 100 million or more per mile for surface rail especially in cases like streetcars where the government already owns the row    there simply isnt much literature about it because if there was it would be from federal racketeering trials
heard you guys like light rail that goes no where over budget and dying for ridership  haha its the worst    it terminates in my neighborhood
  but why not separate the last 10 track too that way you can get a tram system thats more or less guaranteed to be on time when junction signaling are also properly handled
  because the space is finite and widening the streets in the city center may be out of the question because one would need to raze down too many buildings people rather would want to keep it is always a compromise between speed cost and access to places plus brits have it real easy they have so much mothballed railway right of way so they can go all in with barriers and everything    if trams must be on the main street where all the through going traffic also is the car party would protest if the number of lanes was reduced or too many parking spaces were taken away most likely trams and buses would have shared lane and stops    if on the other hand a narrower side street is used for the tram perhaps because it is the primary shopping street there still would be delivery vehicles and access to properties people navigating to perpendicular streets plus the odd lost hick but all in all not too much to disturb the tram traffic if they are given the priority which is easier to do when they are not on the main artery    priority at intersections anyway is the most important factor for journey time when the traffic levels are below jam formation

  imagine if the us had an anticorruption agency with teeth like the old hong kong one
  sounds like recepie for corruption
  the fbi does a lot of anticorruption work its just that there are a ton of municipal governments and not enough feds
  its just that there are a ton of municipal governments and not enough feds  implying im talking about the municipal level
  passenger rail hasnt been a thing for the majority of americans since about the time amtrak formed in 1971  a 25 year old colleague was planning a trip on amtrak he had never been on a train of any kind in his life

where would trams be optimal in this place
  looks like helsinki tram     post population density map    short answer  everywhere pacific electric
  just for reference  streetcar lines cost 520 million  per km in the eu        it depends where the lines are seperated from the normal lanes which is mostly the case on main roads and along urban motorways trams can operate at reasonable speeds it can get messy and much slower in the old quarters and city centers though especially during rush hours even then its still helpful that in europe trams and buses have general right of way over private vehicles
  your decaying modern midwestern city  my sides are in orbit
  technically there should be and there are rules against delaying trams victoria has a rule that its illegal to delay a tram for example by stopping while on the tracks to turn in practice cars sit on the tram tracks in the middle of bridge rd richmond all the time when turning from one side of the street to another people will also stop in front of trams on sydney rd because no rule is going to stop them from doing what they expect to be able to do with cars which is just stop traffic behind them while they wait to do a right turn    the fastest sections of melbournes tram network are the light rail sections since they have actual level crossing gates etc swanston st would also be fast in the middle of the night after most people are gone since its a bicycle and tram only corridor there are other issues like the drivers find it harder to close the doors than a train because all they can do is ring the bell to warn people off or if people are trying to flood a crowded tram then the driver has to use microphone/yell out of his compartment to tell people to get off because theyre not going to fit    id also say that streetrunning trams are usually legacy systems built before the rise of the automobile which are only now facing issues with traffic where once they probably ran a lot fater id differentiate these systems from a modern light rail quite a bit as light rail vehicles tend to be longer than the average tram so in terms of cost the rollingstock part is lower due to smaller units
the 105 is a literal boat anchor for a little bit more you could have the dura ace which weighs less     so people who use the 105 why
for me its shimano claris  the best groupset
  nice get clarisfag here too also aliviofag nice shit to pedal from casual to enthusiast
  because i can keep up with the strong lawyers on dura ace in my city just fine on 105
  its cheap  its comfy  its high quality   fits almost any bike  comes in most styles to fit ride touring racing commuting    whats not to like
  i could buy 420 thats four 105s for the same price as dura ache
  105 is the the stopping point for close duraace/ultegra trickledown
because im not delusional enough to think it matters     id rather a nicer wheelset
  ill bite i walked into the store wanted a entry level bike that wasnt too shitty ended up with a 105 bike that performs on par with dura ace equipped bikes
  its high quality   made out of plastic
aside from weight and lifespan is there much difference between shimano group sets   eg shift quality and ease of adjustment
  currently no not so long ago they used to hamstring anything under 105 but now its a high level of quality from claris on up with no major design or performance differences beyond number of cogs that the rear shifter can handle 11sp is a bit more difficult to adjust than 8sp because tolerances are tighter but thats not a big deal
  i have a 105 and atlas the atlas is fucking horrible
  does the current claris have internal cable routing yet      shift quality  theres a slight different in shift quality from sora to 105  not enough to really matter imo  higher end brakes are better though no discussion      atlas  altus is tourney tier mostly for bso shit
  does the current claris have internal cable routing yet    icr sucks tho side exit shift cables make least friction on the shift cable my 11 speed icr bike shifts worse then 10 speed side route
because a little bit more is actually a lot more
  you must have the longest rear derailleur cable in the world if the tightest bend in your shift cable is at your handlebars
  even the cable of  is too short
  yes  dayuuuuum claris looks like this now
  for a little bit more  what a bunch of fucking bullshit    nothing wrong with 105 and they regularly waterfall upgrades down to it like they always do    meanwhile if you want best bangforthebuck get ultegra the main difference between ultegra and duraace is weight and thats just a handful of grams nothing to worry about when you have to replace some component itll cost much less than duraace
i use it because vintage 105 is fucking great
i pee on raw steel frame like prollysnobcrust but desu haha you need to consider that this isnt everything that matters products for people that have lost their way consumption as hobby the whole the bike reduced to ancillary vector alalala la lala land  to be certain things are no good rotten to the core  a bike should not be light  a ride should not be about speed  but you slave  you suck the  you the maggit  crawl on your belly  claw  withe  your time comes  steal horse  for courses  and  big  divorces  between me and   you  and  them
  thanks doc
  it came on the bike and it just works well and the hoods fit my hands perfectly
  is this mr regular posting on /n/
i use tiagra and its fine probably because ive never ridden with anything better
  meanwhile if you want best bangforthebuck get ultegra  wrong sweaty
caring how heavy the derailer is    bruuh
  if you want the best bang for the buck get this points at crotch
    poorfags  thats okay i understand
  mor expens is better beng4buck  sure thing sweaty
  youve never actually held a 105 crank in your hands have you
  yes i has my sweaty friend
  ok then i have to agree with the boomer ya poor as fuck
  i dun anderstand wat bacg 4 buck meens yu poor    i get it ultegra looks nice next to your macbook air 
  dura ace which weighs less  who gives a shit go kill yourself
  for a little bit more you could have the dura ace  da is literally twice the cost of ultegra  fufufu
  explain me bacg 4 bok or whatever meme you are mad about
ultegra is the worst group price/performance wise
  dura ace 8 speed is the best
    if you want to build a good bike you get 105 cranks derailleurs shifters and brakes the cassette chain and cables are where the investment in ultegra/duraace makes most sense
    amen brother
  or you could just buy a complete ultegra group for less money
  i run super record 12sp on two bikes now get back on my dick you old bitch
    no duraace cassette makes absolutely no sense at all  due to the big cogs made in titanium its 3x more expensive than ultegra and the only difference is 50 grams of weight it might be a lot to someone but doesnt make sense for a budget build    chain should be duraace or kmc x11sl since there the price difference is only like 20 eurobux     duraace brakes are also exceptionally better than any other but for a budget build i guess it doesnt make sense to spend that much on goslow parts instead of gofast parts
because im not a fred that believes it matters have both new ultegra and new sora both perform amazingly only noticeable difference is the number of cogs weight and shift performance are things you wont care or notice unless your being a fred at this point the only selling factor of the tiers are the number of gears you get weight and shift performance are only a factor to pro riders 99 of riders are not and freds
hello /n/ /out/ here   last time i was out at yosemite i noticed a large amount of bicycle riders and that there is a lot of bike paths all over so it seems like a great way to get around and have some fun  problem is that i drive a toyota mr2 and i do not wish to mount a stupid rack system to haul a bicycle 200 miles and look like a stupid cock doing it     so how shit are folding bicycles if i can get one small enough i can just place it behind the passenger seat
folding bike shit levels are as low as youre willing to pay im running a khs f20h7 with carbon and xt/xtr slapped on where possible its plenty good for scooting in urban areas and it could likely take larger tires for more than gravel footpaths     if i didnt buy to much weebshit i would have bought local with a giant expressway for more upgradeability not sure about disc or carbon models seems excessive for the upper limits of folding bike designs
  oh it would be used on a paved path maybe gravel a 20in tire would be fine i think     i did more looking and it seems im pretty limited because im pretty tall and fat   i found one bike that seems to fold small enough to fit but its only good for 100kg and im about that if not 5kg over and theyre really not designed for 63 peoples ill have to see how much space i have to work with but im sure it isnt much
  problem is that i drive a toyota mr2 and i do not wish to mount a stupid rack system to haul a bicycle 200 miles and look like a stupid cock doing it      you can literally mount a trunk rack system the ones that are 30 at walmart to an mr2 and are pretty standard fit on any car onto the toyota     there are multiple pictures of this online you have no reason to buy a folding bike    in your hypothethical where do you put the folding bike do you just go alone out to the national park like some sort of antisocial person because your bikefu is riding shotgun
  if i bring the passenger seat forward about half way it will still fit most people and theres a lot of room behind it     do you just go alone out to the national park like some sort of antisocial person  the bicycle wouldnt change this _
  tall and fat  toyota mr2    i mean you obviously dont give a fuck about fitting your vehicles why should your bike be any different  anyway it is my understanding that the no1 failure point on a bike ridden by fat guys is the spokes and a small wheel  meaning shorter spokelengths  should be an advantage actually  this is just semieducated conjecture but if anyone with a source can chime in go for it
  i fit just fine but im definitely at the limit on height and close to it on weight but im losing weight anyway im at about 225lbs or so   i can always just upgrade the wheels or the spokes to a stronger one
  i drive a toyota mr2  what generation  i can fit a btwin tilt on the passenger seat of my 3rd gen but there is no chance to fit it in the frunk or behind the seats  so how shit are folding bicycles  i can only talk about my tilt 500 20 rigid steel fork aluminium frame 7speed freewhel vbrakes and it is actualy pretty ok especialy for the price  it is verry nimble and at speeds in excess of 50 km/h it gets rather twitchy not that this is a speed you would commonly reach on a bike as upright as that anyway  as long as you dont ride on something worse than gravel it is fine    you can literally mount a trunk rack system the ones that are 30 at walmart to an mr2 and are pretty standard fit on any car onto the toyota  im interested if that would actualy be possible since the rear hood of the mr2 isnt exactly large it is horizontal and can get hot  i will perform a test next friday have to transport two bike anyway and my parents have one of these racks laying around but no car to use it on
    folding bikes are meme you sacrifice a lot when you would have just a better ride with either a nice road bike or mountain bike unless you have a super nice folding bike
  3rd gen too thats bad to hear it wont fit   i really dont want to ruin my enjoyment of driving by having a poorly fitted bicycle on a rack strapped to the back of the car   i guess ill just stick to hiking or get one of those scooters that has 12in pneumatic tires on it in fact id probably look less autistic with that then with a folding bike
  since folding bikes have smaller wheels and those are the big limits in terms of size you probably want one with some sort of suspension the brompton is a classic but there are many others at more affordable levels
  folding bikes are for when you need to fit it on a train or bring it into an office for literally anything else get a real bike
not op but    how shit is this foldable bike exactly i would assume more movable parts  more potential problems    thing is i probably am going to use it twice before becoming bored so i want to pay as little as possible for this thing    
  buy a bike as cheap as possible because you know its going to suck  surprise it sucks  omg bikes are toys  whte people were a mistake
  would the following alternative be better     falsely convince yourself beforehand that youll like this thing and thus absolutely need it   surprise you dont like it   omg a 700 hole in my wallet
  i dont think you can fit a folding bike behind the seat of any mr2 depending on what generation you own you can find a variety of solutions for carrying bikes with an mr2 either a rack that uses a trailer hitch or a rack that straps to the engine cover or a rack that mounts to a luggage rack on the engine cover or a roof rack
just install a towbar dude   and then find a basic single/double hitch rack from the 90s
  i dont think you can fit a folding bike behind the seat of any mr2    harry managed to fit 2 folding bikes and his wife in a ferrari testarossa     protip wheel well     
  how about just stop being poor
  whats with the nonsequitor
    this looks pants on head retarded
  just thought about it  you could try to remove the plastic frunkliner to free up some space in there  maybe you can fit a 20 bike in there
  the word fashion is in the url  you should be able to guess the quality larry
asking cyclists advice  while calling cyclists stupid cocks    good luck with your pisspoor folding bike you dirt plebian bastard
  people who put bike racks on things like sportscars and roadsters are stupid cocks not you guys /n/ 3
bumping this thread because im also interested in getting a folding bike maybe  getting one that can be used in an urban environment would be easy enough but id like something that wouldnt split or would split me in half if ridden of gravel
i have a dahon visc 20 folding bike and it rides great but when i bought it i thought all 20 wheels were the same mine is 20 451 which is more a road bike tire and the biggest i found for it was 20 x 1 3/8 if i did this over again id get a khs soft tail my bike rides fine but a bit twitchy
  the brompton is affordable
  i always think theyre bros because having a rack on sports car means they dont care to own anything else more practical
  an mr2 with a proper rack would look sexy bad taste bad thread you could even /diy/ a horizontal mount over the engine bay that would look awesome you suck
like atlanta has to be one of the worst planned citys in the united states  peach tree/mlk streets 90 of the time  rebuilt in the 50s so no public transit  barely any grid pattern   buckhead is growing into atlanta causing the problems to grow worse   huge public housing problems   lets build a ever expanding/growing highway in the middle of the town  can build though the hospital causing a traffic jam that never goes away grady curve  and the big black biscuit all over marta
yeah atlanta sucks thats why i left after a year of living there
  youre being histrionic over nonproblems or problems other cities have as well
ive been there a few times for work its awful atlanteans think theyre sophisticated patricians because they have a few high rises amongst the meth swamps of confederate slaverland you cant even cross the street without waiting 45 minutes for a walk signal the marta is actually a perfectly decent train system but it only serves like 3 neighborhoods and everyone looks at you like youre crazy and says something that sounds kinda racist if you mention that you took it to get somewhere and yeah everything is named peachtree so its completely impossible to get directions without an exact street address and google maps and god forbid you typo or youll end up 45 minutes away about 2 miles in atlanta traffic time    sherman should have finished the job
  edgy
yet somehow atlanta is still one of the better cities in the south better than the likes of phoenix most texas cities any big city in dixie  not like there arent problems but theyre getting there
the worst thing happening to this city is all the west coast shitters moving in and shitting the place up pic related cost the city 196000 and theres a bunch more godawful publicart popping up all over the place which taxpayers dont even get to decide if they want to pay for bike lanes downtown and midtown are fairly decent and sidewalks are super wide where there arent any plus theres lots of paths to the outskirts so cycling isnt actually that bad other than that theres the crime and violence but its mainly concentrated in neighborhoods whos degenerate inhabitants nobody cares about    also im currently living in atlanta ama if you want
ive lived down here for well over fourteen years after i moved down from new york back in 20042005    my god it is slow as hell down here and i cannot stand it    as another said marta is pretty good or would be had they expended out much further    that aside fuck georgia and its bipolar ass weather    id move back to nyc if i could though nine times out of ten ill be stuck here for another four years if i go through with this computer programming course with atc
you can like move  choosing to live around fatasses meth addicts niggers rednecks and cagers  also most american cities have something to bitch about this whole country should be glassed     cost the city 196000  nigga hold up i can get paid five years of wages for painting some stripes on a crosswalk sign me up whose cock do i suck to get in on this scam
fuck you herman talmage   what could have been c
  no youre not a pedestrian safety crossing zone certified painting specialist    i mean yeah it costs money for paint n shit but damn do city governments shell out way too fucking much for projects
  that is pretty cool though  public art  oh no you poor baby
  they did this same thing in tucson gay pride crosswalk 6 months later its really faded
  literally none of that is true you shitdick i hate this city too but dont make shit up the only atlantans that think theyre sophisticated are the west coast refugees and dickheads here for work
yet the city have one of the largest public transportation hub in the world
convince me why njs track bikes arent the coolest
  because theyre fixies
what a fucking thread this is
  overpriced hipster trash just like your iphone
how about njs thread
how about a beautiful makino
soviet tarck bikes are the coolest
  the most boomer opinion desu
  doesnt know the difference between a fixie and an actual track bike  youre fired
  looks at pics in this thread  theyre fixies alright
  doesnt know what an njs bike is   theyre nippon autism lugged steel with quill stems actual track cyclists dont use them theyre for fashion kids
  what the fuck is going on with these handlebars
tfw no beautiful track waifu
  its not 2008    /thread
        thinking all njs is lugged steel from the 80s  frufrufru
  still cage pedals and square taper cranks    why are nips so backwards and autistic
  octalink
  i dont know if you were trying to prove something with that image with regards to the text of your post but i hope you were not
  tarck is whats going on buddy
  it is for men wymmyns were too slow so theyre allowed carbon
  still doesnt know what makes a bike a track bike  it has drop bars therefore its acceptable for use as a track bike even with the front brake which you easily disconnect  dummies who have never actually ridden track think they know everything
  still njs    njsexportcom/products/anchorphr7carbontrackframe
  i know we all saw that gcn video  i wonder why most male riders prefer octalink or square taper over hollowtech or other external bearing bbs though
  tfw no pudgy /n/ip gf
op here just got some dura ace 7600 hubs man these are so butter
  i suppose if youre gonna fill a stereotype you may as well do it right
  amen brother
old pybt is past 300 and kind of sucked r8/h8 my bike and post yours    who else /drilled/ here
enjoy this glamour shot of my japanese dutch shitbike drum brake gear hub edition
  comfy/10
  what the fuck
  dude i borrowed an atb for a weekend getting back on this it felt like a honda goldwing
  in a good way
  in the c o m f y way yeah    compared to that atb this thing rides like a cloud and yet i can lean it way over    i once lowsided it cause my shin tapped the front brake lever it turns like mad
i gotta get some chainrings delivered and find my split ring pliers first
  no cantis so early 80s right  nice clean bike  would look good with fenders  any clearance issues  i found it impossible on my continental even with 700s ended up going 650b
  7/10 get some king iris bottle cages fo yo bad self
/pyb/ chrome dusk edition    hey i found an 2007 ultegra short cage derailer at my parents place forgotten in a box for over a decade slapped that puppy on and went for a ride score 
dusk chrome
 lmao get a load of this faget
my recent winter beater/commute build actually really enjoying this bike kind of fun riding without power surprised myself with how differently i ride without that metric
  so i just found a picture of that exact ultegra derailer from 2005
    and a picture of me from 2005      u mad 
v cold
  2005  doing tricks on the chadwagen  2018  doing the aero tuck on the incelmobile  what went wrong with your life bro
recent singlespeed build
  poor frame
  ok ok we get it your sense of style has sucked since 2005 no need to rub it in
knobblies and plastic fenders for winter time      comfy af      c h r o m e lmao      nice double tail lights
everyday commuting and riding for fun helps me get around and happy  46 x 17 fixed gear with front brake so that both the antifixies and the profixies can hate me at the same time  i need to change that saddle tho
  hey everyone can you define what brand is that this bike of
  where is that
  or at least can you read the name on the steering gasket
  sorry m8 but dark components dont suit that color at all
  posting from pirated windows 10 pc    install gentoo
  love those tire o wise boomer
  fucking based setup only gripe would be the wheels but nice overall
  little red lighthouse near the george washington bridge manhattan
  the color and the lugs on the headtube are really nice  you were lucky to find it in such a tall size and in good shape
picked this up recently a week before my first cx race outrageously good fun using it for winter training bike too  switching out the cranks for a power meter with a 1x setup and might swap the bar tape to orange
rate my new front brake setup on my abominable shitty steel fixed gear conversion
  horrible modulation/100
  this bike looks really nice even set up bone stock   with some orange tape itll look maddeningly sexy
  how well does your dogmas carbon absorb road chatter    is that the point of the wavy seatstays and fork or is that purely aesthetic
  looks like great fun do you like the riding position offered by the pursuit bars it doesnt look like a particularly aggressive setup
  panasonic steel
  go faster than 30km/h  truck pulls into lane  oh shit oh shit oh shit   reach for brake lever  weight shifts forward  bike begins to flip  bake wheel has no traction to do shitty fixed gear braking  die on impact    sounds great are those shifters even rated to accept that much torque and the thicker cables
  absolutely not    i hope to die doing what i love
  massive kek
  braking with one hand on the bars is always a good idea
  you know they all say riding fixed takes a lot of skill above the threat of imminent death i wanna be skilled
  now i want to see somebody hook up brake levers to derailleurs so that you have to apply a constant pressure to stay in gear
  nice  what frame is that bb17
  i like  the snobs are wrong  behind the times
    this is just so you have a front brake to comply with the road laws rrrright 
  f
  its a raw frame pursuit model  i dont know if theyre still active  theyre a small framemaker from la if im not mistaken im not from murrica    i love this bike the pursuit bars make me feel comfortable while riding for fun but still enables me to grab at its ends and get into a more aggressive position for going faster or climbing hills with a more upstanding position  i wanna try drop bars someday  rode my friends bike once i liked how they felt
  its aesthetic but i must admit it holds up well on bumpy roads just comfortable enough i for one like the squiggle forks and despise the new forks on the f10
  i like it i would do some modifications to it like cutting the fork tube
time trial rig  scott plasma iii  lightweight autobahn disc wheel   walker bros 80mm front  ultegra/dura ace di2 on a 1x setup  62t front chainring  enve bars  vittoria g tyres  tririg omega front brake  modified di2 junction box to fit inside the stem
  are you in the uk
    nice pictures but this bike looks just stupid
  cut that steer tube m8
  god damn nice rig
  nah dont do it what if you want to change the geometry in 10 years when you have a weak back
  you flip the stem
    wrong
    dope but fuck you for converting it to single speed desu    fuck are you talking about
  same thing you are
  its a great frame though
  yes anon said poor frame which can be interpreted as what a shame that frame is being forced to be a ss/fixie turd
  fuck  im an idiot    i read poor as bad for some reason
  dope but fuck you for converting it to single speed desu  sorry man i bought only the frame without any of the original components on ebay wasnt feeling like restoring it to factory spec  too time and money consuming however i would never repaint it or flex off the shifter bosses or something like that im well aware of the fact that its a classic so someday it might receive the drivetrain it deserves
1985 centurion cinelli equippe  bike is comfy and my size so i put a 10spd ultegra groupset on to be able to ride it to work daily
  oh boy never seen a cinelli here before thats basically a grail bike to me i dont even care to nitpick your build i will just say that i am jealous and you are a gentleman
  needs some campagnolo to complement that beautiful frame
  beautiful bike but whats up with that giant half splash tape abortion of a bar
  yeah maybe someday all i had was a takeoff set lying around    really great quality and light for a steel bike amazingly comfortable and i highly recommend  i lucked into a partly complete bike for 80    boredom and tape scraps now has 3t compact drops and stem with some fresh leather fizik wrap same color as seat
  nice how tall are you anon how does the wheelbase feel looks very short
  i like it anon   single speeders rise up
im making a bracket for the basket to fix the angle
  the way i see it if youre not running fixed gear you might as well have the benefit of multiple gears
  now has 3t compact drops and stem with some fresh leather fizik wrap same color as seat  sheeeeeeeit negro thats all you had to say  post a pic when you can
  adjust them fenders buddy
  not him but i can accept this  fucking sweet frame
  why even have gears at that point they are all 11 basicly
  great pic of some shadows
  bout 65    will do gonna take some beauties on my next ride
  literally the same shitty pic you posted in the last pybt gtfo
  you see narrowly
  the only thing thats narrow are your rear dropouts
  lololol nah it u
much crew
  ill drop your rear out
  i cant bear the thought of scratching this    i want this so bad
  wtf is that stem
  hi fucktards i ride a 1989 bridgestone comp mb2  it was and still is the finest example of a mountain bike you will ever see disagree fuck you
  scratches are not a problem its the raw aluminium tubing all scratches just polish out by rubbing it with soapy steel wool pads i had some nasty ones from parking it at busy city bike rack the downside is oxidation caused by rain or condensation storing it outside got a give it a good rub once a month or the finish will turn to shit only takes me 15 minutes while i wax my chain
  whoa 17 years older than you and still working uh  hows school
  i wish companies like crew were around when i still thought fixies were cool
lookin cute outside the weed store
  suddenly his bike makes sense
  how is that not super easy to steal
  two cables in the wheels a padlock and a ulock its not impossible to steal but i wouldnt say easy exactly
  adjustable stem set in straightup position which makes you sit more straight and bicycle less maneuverable thats how grannies and retards use them    stem  saddle tilted up to crush your testicles  front light covered by black tape  if you fixed just that it would make it actually a nice bike  also are license plates on bicycles in japan obligatory
  there is a bicycle registration system in japan but its a suble thing  the sticker can be on the bottom bracket or the underside of the down tube i believe that there was a registration plate requirement many years ago but thats history
  is the registration still obligatory  in my country you can get your bike registered by the police they put a sticker sign with uv marker and engrave their own number on it and if it ever gets stolen and they find it it will be easier for them to find its owner though it doesnt scare thieves away and looks ugly since the sticker needs to be on top tube so not everybody is doing that
  its obligatorythe registration sticker should be visible and underside of downtube / bottom bracket is visible enough
  i approve of this bike
  no drillium here but in its element its cool    this was in an earlier /pybt/ but it has changed a bit since then the steerer has as indicated in earlier post been trimmed its been recabled more neatly than my last attempt and it has new levers and handlebars bike good weather good  reel in the miles
  oh god thats so gaudy
  this bike is like a skinny guy fieri
  top kek
  i want this so bad    its a mutt of a bike but i appreciates it finally
  the idea here itt is to post a pic of the bike not talk shit about a bike you may or may not have with a pic of something other than a bike  its fairly selfexplanatory if you arent retarded
  wrong side  r  o  n  g    s  i  d  e    but seriously the pic is actually bad due to low light  flash or daytime pick one
i guess ill just get new fenders for christmas
  magnificent but if it were mine i would rewrap the bars green and keep the red hoods
rigid ti mtb with road gearing  race me ill break your favorite road bike
  its not road gearing with 26 wheels you goofball
  it is with my campy record crank  and 1121 cassettefail
  what is metres of development
  i really hope youre not implying that the sole indicator of a bicycles speed is the gearing rather than the idiot in the saddle
  those handle bars will break you
  yeah those fenders are ok but do not fit that bike style if you dont care about that just keep them    im thinking of getting some fenders for my 95 giant rincon but good fenders cost too much where i live    im in the same
  trust me you and your little fixie will get wrecked
  ok mr flat bar road bike whats ur ftp
  are you santa claus plz put epicride in my stocking and no oranges or brazil nuts please
  no oranges or brazil nuts  never gonna make it
my home
  damn thats some heavy load nice
    yeah its barely manageable im always evolving the packing arrangement and reducing wherever possible but its everything i own and for the year round seasonal changes living mobile outdoors its not easy cutting loose of anything i consider it something of a self powered pack mule
  p cool  p cool
   when your dad is rich and you dont know anything about bikes
  most people hang a painting over the sofa in their home but i guess when your home is a bike you hang it over your front wheel huh
    ha indeed i sell folk art on the side of the road thats an unfinished cell
  youre cool man   is it wearing you down
    not under present circumstances but it might later im getting old too 40s
  how long have you been doing it for   i spent 4 months on the road a year ago and it was an incredible experience but i was shocked at just how draining it was at times     living nomadically is just not what were built for
    i got divorced almost 5 years ago and was nomadic for the first year the last almost 4 ive been keeping it local to stay around my son adopted when he was 2 bio father abandoned ill have to leave again once he graduates and gets college sorted next year i was originally supposed to leave but ex realized how badly and often i was needed and asked me to stay near which i am grateful for because i love my son very much
  looks like tissot velodrome
    that seatpost is begging to get stolen
my beater/commuter in its natural habitat
  ugh how can you stand the east side when the west side goes all the way down to battery park not to mention more pleasant to look at
  how can you stand a nice waterfront bike path that you commute on regularly    its pretty comf and takes me where i need to go not much to dislike
  i mean its pockmarked as fuck youve got cagers going by at 60mph and it ends at coogans bluff and you have to navigate angry drug dealers in suspiciously expensive cars until you reach central park or you can i guess take 2nd avenue down through the hellscape that is the un zone and the midtown tunnel shitfest and get pounced on by angry cops from staten island    vs the west side greenway where youre in forest all the way down to harlem and then youre decently separated from the roadway other than a few hundred meters no lights and no cager conflicts the whole way save for a brief gap above fairway the heliport the piers and some crossings down near the wtc
  youre assuming a lot about where im coming from i go north from ues to inwood also did you learn about nyc from an 80s cop movie
  comfy/10
  thats definitely an odd commute you work at tread or something how does a tread employee afford to live on the ues    most people go from inwood to somewhere south of central park me for instance i take the east side route every now and then to mix things up but objectively speaking its shit compared to the west side route    also clint eastwood is not why coogans bluff is called coogans bluff
    if thats a king headset i will alow it
not mine but i have this exact bike mainly riding it for excercise but i am also on the lookout for some retro steel frame bike for commuting to work
  i have never laughed this hard on /n/ in my fucking life
just picked this up on ebay for some off road riding
  looks gud anon what did you end up paying for it
  1300 was maybe ridden 3 times basically a new bike 
  it literally says derby arena right there you dum dum
    went to the west side and got u a pic since you were so upset
  stfu the east side has its own charm     east side for lyfe
  my new beater/commuter bike
  thank you
  calling a brompton a beater
ordered this years model after my last one was stolen f    soon
  fucked up my fit edition
  your seatpost is backwards
  go further indexed braking
commuter
  dymomo  igh  feels good man
  nah bromptons only come in one size  the orientation of the seatpost clamp is meant to be switched depending on the size of the rider
  intesresting didnt know
    nice    what frame is it
freshly built new commuter
  freshly built  slack brake wire  someone fucked up
  they call it a fixie because it needs a good fixin    have you ever seen a fixie with functional brakes
  ive got the 501 pinarello paris same frame lower grade carbon running 25mm conti gp4k and its very uncomfortable on the rough stuff desu my alu cross bike with 28s is far more comfortable on debris strewn british roads
  loosened it to put the tape there forgot to readjust for the pic
    whats the purpose of the tape and the thing taped
  wont scratch when i lean it/lock it on a rack
  it just works  nice dubs btw
  lock  leaving your bike unattended    i dont know how people can do this
  by using bicycles as a means of transport to school/job in addition to recreational riding
  i know why just not how you manage to do it  i commute 200km per week and am lucky enough to keep my bike beside me at work
why all the single speed/ fixie stuff   also fuck your common drivetrains   ti mountain bike   campy drivtrain   i thought i was being rediculous
  have derailleur   only run two cogs  basically a fixie as far as being ironically inefficient goes
  its a nimble steel touring frame    chris king headset   continental shitbox tires    im pissed
  windy city wire  ey winter came early this year no  stealin my top tube bell style  reee its ok i guess your bikes a lot better than mine anyways but now i know im not the only one in the area your bike deserves better tires though memeskins at the very least
  not a single out back
  yeah probibly need to get some new ones nothing wrong with those contys though damn near bullet proof since i have built that bike like six years ago i have only ever have got one flat
  rear light pointed directly at rack  lmao  your bike is also dirty as fuck it doesnt hurt to wipe things down once in a while
  that directly contradicts my motto for that bike  less maintenance more miles
  sometimes i come to this board thinking i might learn something useful and you gotta go and post dumb shit like that i hate this place
  does it bother you more if i told you i know what i need to do to tune it but i wont be bothered to until something fails   can you guess what is going to fail first
  fuck off cunt theres a lot of snow and salt here over winter so keeping the ride clean would be beyond autistic tier theres no point as long as the chain and sprockets are clean enough
  it most definitely is not the ti version sadly
  or maybe i just know how to use ebay over time to build my  u jelly bro
  bike
  dont knock it until you try it    htfu 
  my asshole gets smeared with shit sometimes   keeping it clean would be beyond autistic tier  this is what you sound like
  he doesnt age his crust  amateur
  i had campy once upon a time hell that bike use to have a campy veloce triple crankset then i cased it one day when i riding it was never the same again do yourself a favor and get some shimano hollowtec cranks doesent have to be durace and those things are bombproof
  univega rover 303
  im a weight weenie tho
  then why bother with a mountain bike
coaster brakes for life
  nice lightweight china bike got for 450 brand new
  alice in wonderland poster  most patrician of tastes sir i have an alice fetish and i approve of this
  didnt think that was in the frame
  so much weld
  its gonna take a bathtub to get that poop out
  i am not sure what that is supposed to mean
just got a integrated top crown and stem looks super clean just have to to the brakes now and i should be done 
  that saddle angle because random weird post presumably from a bike which had geometry that went with it  guy put a little effort in reusing is admirable but ramming the nose of your saddle up your ass just doesnt work pal
  absolutely based and totally redpilled a zerofucksgiven bike though i would go igh on that im building or rather rebuilding a bike with sturmey archer s2 hub shits gonna be fun ill post pictures when its done
  everything is set up in a practical and sensible way  nothing too expensive nothing too cheap  yeah clearly he gives zero fucks
  prewar bike   1930s era black beauty frame and fork   lucky seven seatpost   new departure coaster brake  trying to get the right fit on it i dont like it the way it is
  thanks and would love to see it
  practical and sensible  2x2  no
  everyone is in the same terrain and environment as me  you have no basis for guessing youre like those idiots who think all of nyc is like bushwick so everyone should have a single speed
  what makes you say that
  i dont understand your question  why do you think that 2x2 makes any kind of sense
  in my head why i have found it sensible stems from riding single speed/ fixed i loved having a next to no maintenance drivetrain being single speed hated having a full range of gears wanted something that held those attributes of single/ fixed with that thought process i wound up putting a triple crankset on singlespeed frame required rd for chain tension i rode that frame into the ground later found out about the dingle which i then pretty much built that bike around it mainly because i didnt want internal gear nonsense again going for less maintenance overall that one aspect is a major factor in why i believe it to more sensable
  why not just go for a gear hub
  well that explains it youre a fixiefag  theres just no getting through to you people
  i do have a geared hub i have two of them it works for every thing
      these bikes would have to weigh more than your mom
  they are actually lighter than the soma in debate
                i just got here and i ran 2x1 on a white miyata i turned into a single speed commuter in 2012 before i got the dropout length and chain tension correct    i just did 2x1 on a whim and it was objectively shit you still have all that shifter and cables and derailer ruining the aesthetic plus weight for just 2 gears that are very similar and have a narrow spacing between them doesnt fucking help with hills at all and the shifting is long and clunky you dont feel like doing it often i cant find a picture but i just ran my 52t after a week but yeah i can honestly say that soma is begging for igh make it a priority soma bro
  2012 was the year i built up that frame and wheelset  please read the earlier posts buttercup   also you are going to have to try harder to convince me to go igh
look 586 rsp roadfixed conversion can i get a rate
  chain tension too loose   go you for having a brake   cable is a skosh too long on said brake   bar tape is too loose on drive side  cant tell bout the other side though  also looks like an 18 tooth out back   is that a 10 or 11 speed crank
  what did you do for chain tension
     no way to adjust chain tension   double crankset set up single speed   absurdly aggressive ttstyle saddle position   interruptor style brake lever mounted at an awkward angle to destroy your wrists   brake is only accessible from the tops which is the only part of the bar that you can reach because the fit of the bike is so fucking aggressive   bar tape is folded over on itself and is sticking out from under the endcap   rear wheel not rideable in any crosswinds   threecross 32hole front wheel on a bike this light      is this bait please tell me the rear hub is 130mm spacing and you didnt just crush the rear triangle in to fit a track hub honestly im impressed it even has a brake at all fixie life
  and i was being modest
  good stuff i really like that metallic gloss that trek did in the late 90s
  yes its an 18t cog 52t chainring was originally 11speed the chainline isnt totally straight which is admittedly the fault of using those road cranks so i have more chain slack than usual    rear wheel is laced to an eno eccentric hub so chain tension is adjustable via the eccentricity i find the bike fit to be extremely comfortable because im 193cm and have good flexibility for posterity the frame is 60cm so i would consider it slightly undersized yes the hub is 130mm spacing its specifically designed for roadfixed conversions with vertical dropouts    i have no excuses for the bartape frankly i would never recommend brooks cambium bartape the motherfucker is so hard its impossible to fold it under the endcap    never change /n/
    just shove an angle grinder disk in the droppout and grind out a few millimetres back its all you need for the chain to tension up nicely its easy dont stress
  hhnnnng    whos that semen demon
beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
  this one makes me audibly awwwww
  thats the british rail class 802 operated by transpennine express    ever since they changed uk law on rail safety it is no longer required to paint the front of trains running on the rail network in britain yellow so long as the headlights fulfil certain requirements for daytime visibility
    these are cute as hell even without the nice badge you could tell theyre alpine just by the general design
      not quite thats the british rail class 397 rather than the 802 but theyre also operated by transpennine express unlike her bigger cousin shes fully electric and has those lovely openedged wheels as well as plug doors larger external info screens including on the front a smaller nose and larger windows including more unblocked windows on the front coaches the 802s still an absolute cutie but the 397s the single sexiest thing on rails right now in my opinion especially now tpes finally got the body to fit the lovely dress theyve been wearing for a while and caf figured out how to do noses      absolute chunder      the little airliner that could      those coaches look glorious peak aesthetic
  ive seen some of the most uninspiring liveries to come out of the uk scotrail southeastern every first livery but this transpennine express is top cute
  what do you think of my favourite train aesthetically speaking i know its german but its a mix of siemens bombardier and alstom technology
    just think one of those little guys does regular runs to jfk from lcy      cnt  teehee
  both me  i really hope to visit switzerland one day
  cant imagine being in one of those smol boys for seven hours    its a great place i went in 2015 and was really impressed with the rail system over there the place we stayed in was right next to tracks in a zurich suburb and there was a train flying past every three minutes the villages in the mountains also have good train or bus connections to major cities
  didnt know my voivodeship bought trams color scheme is identical
  cant imagine being in one of those smol boys for seven hours  its fine the transatlantic a320s that ba uses have an all business class layout with lieflat seats
  cant imagine being in one of those smol boys for seven hours    its fine the transatlantic a320s that ba uses have an all business class layout with lieflat seats
for me its the kamov ka226
  never seen this one before but thats definitely one of the nicest tram designs imo i like how curvy and solid it looks
  if only they would hide the underfloor electronics like on the class 333 itd be perfect    8/10
  if mazda made trains
more beautiful than cute but id slap her tender any daylight
  teehee  it stands for confederación nacional del trabajo national labor confederation it is a anarchosyndicalist union that helped organize catalonia and adjacent areas into a libertarian utopia for a few years     yellow and white isnt unique as a color scheme that tram runs in nordhausen thuringia the fun bit is it also uses some track of the harz narrow gauge railway so its one of the smallest interurban systems in the world
      modifiied/modernized tatra t3    t3 is a very common tram in former eastern block countries
  damn that actually looks good
  they look like bastardized pcc cars
      i think we should propose a nickname to the a318 we shall call it  the kawaiiliner
  well we did have very similar rvz6 trams before them
  tatras t3 are fucking based they offer smooth ride without any pneumatic gimmicks and they accelerate rapidly and drivers love them for pedals  also they are just unkillable
    
  huh wikipedia says they actually are pcc cars  tatra bought the patent licenses and built versions adapted to the eastern european market their products are the largest fleet of stilloperating pcc cars in the world
ive always quite liked cds pendolinos
    has to refuel westbound due to weight limits for hard climbout out of london city though
  ustio      cute
  if only i hadnt uninstalled ps a week ago
  peter witt hollywood car
  ustio  its an anarchist flag not an ustio flag
    technically its a tram livery
what do anons think of these emus  these trainsets are for the soontobeopened jakarta mrt
  theyre okay but not cuties
          that was just a popular design language in post ww2 europe
  has a cute smile
57 posts in but still no 747sp  here have the cutest widebody ever
  for what purpose
  because the baby 747 is so adorable
  too short to be aesthetic
  install gimp

  and its even cuter little brother who pulls the summer open air excursion car trains
i have a soft spot for the talgo 3
  ywn hear the horn of a talga again  hold me
    wtf it looks like a ship hull
the a310 is shorter than the a321
  this shattered my worldview but thankfully youre wrong    a310 length 4666m  a321 length 4451m
boop

  why dont trains have these balconies anymore
  they still do dont they im not sure about passenger locomotives but im pretty sure they exist on nearly all freight locomotives in north america
    murrican locomotives from that time arr look same to me
  only a matter of a few years until pic related will follow their brothers into the east
  into the east  if you mean the neue länder then im not so sure most tram systems are either metre gauge or have really modern trams berlin and strausberg especially only really has bombardier flexity trams now dresden also has flexity trams leipzig has a few weird bombardier trams as well as new solaris ones the older tatra trams now have modern bombardier tailers beiwagen chemnitz has these weird adtranz trams  dessau has bespoke bombardier trams  magdeburg has some weird alstom trams but still has the odd tatra tram in service still  erfurt has mostly siemens trams now with combinos entering service  potsdam is mostly just siemens combinos or stadler variobahns now  the rest are just metre gauge and wont take most of the old west german stock  the only tram network ive found in the east that actually has former west german trams as handmedowns is the görlitz tram system which has second hand trams from mannheim
  most eastern european countries can afford to buy new trams now with help from eu but maybe northkorea would still want them they also got old berlin ubahn trains for free
  haha why not just sell them to duisburg at this point
twoforone qt special
  nah ill pass
sup /n/
  what sort of shithole is this
  a temperate englishspeaking region in the northern hemisphere
  why do you call it a shithole    northern hemisphere  lolwut
  its currently winter/near winter in the northern hemisphere and there people have clothes for midlow temperatures its lower than 20 c but over 5 c or maybe its windy but its not raining it could be auckland but based on these data points its much more likely its actually a place in england or the northeastern us    is it actually auckland
    haha this is victoria park station in melbourne     gives a new meaning to park and ride innit
  el nino cycle is messing with temperatures in the north and south shifting them around
    its cold and raining in melbourne the victorian alps had a major snow storm the other day while california is having major fire storms  could something be changing in the environment
  well i didnt imagine that melbourne would look so cold in november
  el nino generally makes it warm in eastern australia though    it looks run down af but trust me its not
  oh let me tell you its not as bad when there was a spark on top of a diesel at franga
  on the evening of june 10 1975 the long island up goods train which had been hauling eight wagons of steel from lysaughts steel mill at hastings ran into the rear of a six carriage suburban standing in no2 platform  the onduty asm rang me to advise me when i arrived and saw the mangled steel i could hardly believe my eyes the rear hitachi carriage its back broken was lying atop b69 the diesel was derailed and its fuel tank ruptured the collision caused the derailment of most carriages and wagons and immense damage to the overhead wire and track  i was the first of many officials on the scene my first concern was for the injured but miraculously the only person to sustain injuries was the 20 year old fireman who was treated for cuts and shock normally the suburban guard would have been sitting in the guards compartment at the rear of the train but on this evening was in the station office having a cup of tea when the collision occurred  the enquiry revealed that as the steel train ran down the langwarrin bank the train brakes were applied too frequently draining the air from the reserviors on the wagons consequently when the brakes were applied to stop the train at frankston there was insufficient air in the system and the momentum carried the train into the rear of the hitachi     i found a discussion about this on railpages a poster who is/was a driver claims to know the bloke responsible and he wasnt fired or reprimanded in any manner and continued to work the same route without any extra training
  i dont thnk he ever fucked with the brakes again tho
al gore tesla dicksuckers btfo         advanced fiberreinforced bottles are comparable to the rechargeable leadacid battery in terms of energy density        funny how liberals will literally get behind whatever empowers communism the most ie conflict minerals too toxic to even recycle and draconian taxes against the gases we exhale
fuck off you dumbcunt
  having 3000psi tank right under nutsack  yeah no thanks ill keep my nuts also the energy required to compress air in the tank has inefficiencies and uses electric
  its called ballistic protection the same kind that is light enough to be worn by soldiers in iraq    also fly wheels    also lithium batteries exploding     also a bic lighter has ten times the energy of an iphone battery    also algae biofuel    also youre a queer that wants so badly to believe your leftist politicians have your best interest in mind when actually they are just trying to control you
    also the energy required to compress air in the tank has inefficiencies and uses electric    you can directly pressurize from a turbine motor and pneumatic motors have some of the best efficiency in the world that is why air tools are so lightweight and cheap and easy to use     also if compressed air is so dangerous then why arent there more accidents killing scuba divers most scuba deaths are from drowning or the bends tanks are sturdy as hell and the valve system specifically proteccs against catastrophic failure     uses electric    eletricc motors are gay     you dont have to use electricc     can use turboo     can be gayy t2     you can just use pneumatic motors or just use an electric one because theyre super light af so yoru argument is hella gay    why isnt this being funded oh thats right because they cant patent it      you are a fucking cuck  notice how algae biofuel could be grown and distilled in a third worlders favela rooftop but solar panels require patents and shittt
  leadacid
     320 j/g      180 kj/kg for an advanced fiberwound one    k so twice as good maybe 4 times with some super advanced super expensive super toxic prototype     what are fly wheels what is lower cost what are biofuels     all forms of energy storage are useless for transportation by themselves except for golf karts they are supposed to be paired with a renewable carbon neutral energy dense fuel like algae biodiesel     compressed air and fly wheels are a million times objectively better and more practical for that purpose    batteries are so toxic they cant even be recycled economically meanwhile you 3d print a tank or machine a fly wheel and thats as good or at least half as good and you dont have to invade afghanistan or do business with venezuela as a bonus     here is the real kicker    values greater than 400 wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials    whos derpin now faggot
    objectively superior    just admit you like batteries because you like elon musk and leftist authoritarian aesthetics
  try moving with a giant flywheel
  oh boy its another anon encourages others to make compressed air powered bikes thread  anon builds said bike  goes for ride feels powerful despite slight hissing sound thats probably nothing  stop at light canister explodes sending shards of aluminium through the saddle before becoming lodged in anons gooch and buttocks  anon sues moot  4chan shut down forever    is that really what you want op
  anon sues moot  literally who
  gyroscopic stabilization is bad    i guess thats why f1 doesnt use it right oh wait      see     also fuck this fucking cancer fucking hellhole       some guy before all the newfags like u showed up after gamergate
  is on 4chan  cant take some banter  yet calls other people casuals and newfags
  no u    literally you just fell for the hypocrisy meme    see you on reddit you faggot           ʖ ﾉ        
  quality shitpost anon you got me but good
  just use your legs to pedal you weak shit
  /n/ is only bicycles   luddite masochistic cuck not harnessing braking energy
  post a picture of a car next time if you want to talk about cars retard or just fuck off to /o/ where this thread probably belongs
        bicycles and cars are the only transportation vehicles  only talking about one form of transportation   trying that hard to win an argument     oh weird its almost like i posted pictures of cars   
  yes take your cars and your car technology to /o/ because nobody is working on a compressed air powered ship
  look in the archive where i argued with someone on here about lithium ion battery aircraft    then go fuck yourself in your log cabin with your wooden dildo
  find a stupid thread where i made an idiot of myself  ill just skip ahead to the part where i pleasure my asshole rather than waste my time reading more of your psychotic drivel
  and to be clear compressed air is used in volvos to spool the turbos and could be used to increase spool up times in any turbine engine     and also to be clear your hurr durr just pedal faggot argument is bullshit cause not everyone wants to be a sweaty mess when they show up to the office and storing energy makes you objectively faster even if you continue to pedal as hard as you can
  psychotic drivel  no u    i also won this argument just for the record cause u completely abandoned any kind of logical argument and just tried to change the subject and resorted to personal attacks like a leftist cuck    i win hahahahahaa suck my dick
  i also won this argument  ah yes clearly
  just shower at work you idiot
  he thinks that he can win an argument  wew lad  i bet youre a riot at parties and in general social situations
  op leadacid batteries have a very low energy density compared to li cells see pic related and see this page 
what a bizarre fucking thread holy shit
juniorlevel mechanical engineer trolling detected
  good luck carrying heavy tanks for everything
handy for applications where you need intrinsically safe propulsion such as coal mines    
op iq is lower than the average donkey iq
  its true though all that follows after my original assertion are leftist personal attacks      all works have showers  not wanting to go faster and have more fun even while exercising with pedalling plus electric motor power      he thinks that people always act like they do online in real life   this place is designed to let our shadows out and also to not waste time with pleasantries and get right to the fucking argument and find truth the truth in this case is that biofuel fly wheels and compressed air btfo toxic batteries and authoritarian totalitarian regulations and taxes on the gases we exhale ie carbon dioxide      see     lithium ion has half the energy of flywheel storage and is less practical and more expensive than compressed air which has about half of that if you look into the actual numbers you will see that compressed air is about the same as first gen lithium batteries which is half the newer stuff but still better than lead acid and that wiki article was talking about old tanks that had to adhere to bootlicker regulations    inb4 my exploding nutsack   see       we already computer the energy density ie read the fucking thread before typing your fucking leftist nonesense      yep 3      my iq is 149 thanks a lot i got put into advanced courses since i was in elementary school and had my iq tested officially every few years till age 18 and if you actually had a high iq you would know iq is a bullshit metric which at best gives a very obtuse general view of intelligence yet there are people with artistic intelligence who are bad at taking tests among other kinds of intelligence like social intelligence which women are superior at in general    inb4 capslock my pinky just does that sometimes if you are triggered by larger lettering then you are an irrational faggot and youre only going to bring that up if you have no other arguments ie ad hominem
  we already computer the energy density    i meant to say computed and what i meant to actually say is we already looked it up and those are the stats on wiki     compressed air has about half the energy density including the tank you faggot of latest gen of lithium batteries with better safety and much less cost and toxicity and fly wheel has the highest energy density of rechargable storage with 400wh/kg double that of the hyper expensive prototype lithium batteries     fuck off elons cuck dick you faggot
why not use the frame as the tank
  becaues its a prototype and you might want to keep the tank in a seperate enclosure to protecc from rupture
  canister explodes sending shards of aluminium through the saddle before becoming lodged in anons gooch and buttocks    this and this alone is why we dont power our bicycles with explosive devices    people fall on bikes you dumb dumb
  he thinks posting in all caps somehow makes him right even though the facts say hes wrong  youre utterly ridiculous
  actually it doesnt imply that at all and just because something is written in caps doesnt make it wrong keep using leftist logic though libtard       see     gas is flammable and batteries explode too and they are toxic
  the facts     how about the fact that flywheel energy has an energy density of 400wh/kg
  well if you consider accretion disk around a black hole as a flywheel the energy density is getting close to c2/3600 wh/kg can you easily use it as a battery in your bike
  nah but i can use a real flywheel that has 200400wh/kg
    pic related is the level of science of ops bait thread
  gas is flammable and batteries explode too and they are toxic  well then snowflake you should probably stay inside your little house wrapped in your security bubblewrap in your comfy chair and stay away from the big bad outdoors where anything can happen at any time for no particular reason seriously you can get a splinter in your finger and get an infection that will go to your heart and kill you dead slowly and painfully omfg wtf bbq11
  how about the fact that flywheel energy has an energy density of 400wh/kg  how about youre only looking at one aspect of a flywheel energy storage system and ignoring all the others and also unless you can show me on a graph authored by a credible source comparison of that to electric storage then youre just spouting baseless nonsense    anyone wishing to know the facts about flywheel energy storage should read this article which covers it very nicely    you should also note these two sections    this system is only viable under very specific conditions ie frictionless bearings and in a total vacuum not terribly practical in a common ground vehicle nor likely very costeffective    might not be practical physically for any ground car due to size and shape constraints and also centripedal force effects on the vehicles handling    also add to all of the above the fact that you have to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy to spin the flywheel up and you then also have to convert stored mechanical energy back to electric energy to supply electric drive motors with power the losses in such a system are enormous and cancel out any socalled advantage of flywheel storage furthermore the losses in a purely mechanical system would likewise be enormous even with frictionless bearings everywhere     people without an engineering background should probably not be advocating for technologies they do not understand without first educating themselves as much as they can lol on the realities of the aforementioned systems
flywheel storage  compressed air storage    heres a commonsense fact for you all  if these technologies were so wonderful dont you think all the big automobile manufacturers would be massproducing them and thered be one sitting in every driveway    randos on 4chan with littletono education clearly and objectively should not be secondguessing teams of research scientists and teams of seniorlevel design engineers employed by large corporations who have the resources to fund projects of this magnitude likewise trolls should restrict themselves to posting bait threads on subjects they are capable of understanding sufficiently such that they can successfully twist the facts enough to enrage people successfully asis i must judge this thread to be a dismal failure as bait since the op has failed to understand the subject sufficiently to have the ring of credibility on the subject
  k so if i take a measured risk id rather it be a non cuck technology and one that has a higher energy density relative safety and less cost        for energy storage materials with high strength and low density are desirable for this reason composite materials are frequently used in advanced flywheels the strengthtodensity ratio of a material can be expressed in wh/kg or nm/kg values greater than 400 wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials  the strengthtodensity ratio of a material can be expressed in wh/kg or nm/kg values greater than 400 wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials  values greater than 400 wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials  greater than 400 wh/kg   400 wh/kg   400 wh/kg   400 wh/kg   the best most expensive and toxic lithium battery sourced from the blood and sweat of niggers mining conflict minerals with their bear ass only are capable of 200wh/kg so flywheels btfo your cuck liberal bootlicking authoritarian dick sucking ass at 50 percent effeciency thats whats called a satisfactory margin    this system is only viable under very specific conditions ie frictionless bearings  not for short term energy storage thats why race cars use them and i said early on that fully rechargeable cars/bikes are gay af because carbon neutral biofuel has an energy density 510 times greater than anything fully rechargeable rechargeable energy storage is only useful for compensating for tubrine spool times and recouping braking energy unless youre a gay dicksucking liberal that complains about asthma even though particulates and even nox can be captured by catalysts or filters     you have to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy  electric motors have 90 percent efficiency
  the losses in such a system are enormous and cancel out any socalled advantage of flywheel storage  i guess thats why f1 doesnt uses them even though theyre one of the most weight conscious competitions ever oh wait they do and youre just a bias confirming cunt     also i thought of a way you can skip one of the energy conversions but im not going to tell a pathetic dog like you your pavlov ringabellandyougiveyourfreedomsaway ass doesnt deserve to know hahahahahahaha         randos on 4chan with littletono education  people without an engineering background   yeah of course a cuck like yourself gets pissed when a successful autodidact can btfo your stupid dogma and institutional inertia     how does it feel knowing that you wasted 60k on a shitty piece of paper that just taught you bad habits and locked your creativity in a box a prison that you helped construct for yourself     how does if feel knowing that youre always going to be working for someone else     how does it feel knowing that someone can learn to make millions in their spare time on the internet while you slave away for middle management in your cubicle prison    have fun fucking your fat wife and paying your bills you fucking slave mentality stupid mother fucker       randos on 4chan      you can vote for what you want to appear in the forum there and then you can curate your only little echo chamber hell hall of mirrors the strength of 4chan is seeing everything and finding the gems there and my posts are dropping knowledge on your closed minded ass but im banned on almost every subreddit i visit the mark of a good anon a powerful anon        dont you think all the big automobile manufacturers   you mean like ferrari and mclaren oh yeah they do already and they use it in their most competitive cars you know race cars     would be massproducing them
  would be massproducing them    the truth is that renewable energy doesnt fucking make sense at all for cheap vehicles meant for worker peasants like yourself a bic fucking lighter has ten times the energy in a iphone battery    the only reason there are ebikes at all is to get around the fucking ban on motorcycles riding on bicycle paths they are a fucking loophole meant to appeal to irrational liiberals like your fucking self and biodiesel is far superior to fucking batteries and can be produced by peasants like yourself while the batteries need expensive materials and patents and favor centralized producction the only fucking reason tesla exists that and they get corporate crony socialism
  also dont judge the punctuation and spelling in that last post i wrote it pretty hastily     and dont judge my use of ellipsis because i typed this whole thing fast and i want to waste as little brain energy and glucose on pathetic bootlicking dicksucking peasants like you faggots you literally arent worth the 0001 calories it takes for me to focus on moving my pinky to the right key
    coping this hard over a iq of 85  golf clap
  see     and   being so desperate for an argument you resort to personal attacks  spoken like a true leftist cuck fuck what did i expecc     also i forgot to add that hurr durr gyroscopic forces hurr durr is btfo because you can use active gyro stabilization like the sea keeper       that counterbalances against waves on boats and something like that could be used in a car or bike even just enough to counter balance the gyroscopic forces but it could be use to lean into turns or soemting creative    but you probably wont believe it till someone actually does it because its not written in your precious cuck text book this is the mind of a follower and you will always be riding the coattails of men who had the courage and creativity to try something first    also ferrari and mclaren uses flywheels on f1 cars so they cant affect maneuverability thattt much
i wounder why do i even need a battery in my laptop surely the energy of hdd spinning at 5000 rpm should be enough to power the whole thing like forever oh and if i find a way to plug my car via usb c i can also drive forever
  transportation
  active gyro stabilization like the sea keeper  this thing spends energy to keep the vessel steady you cant use it for storage well you can but its going to be extremely inefficient if you want to preserve the energy youll probably need to put the whole thing on a 2axis gimbals or something    flywheels can have different designs depending on your goals you can optimize one thing or the other but not all of them  yep you get 400 wh/kg but its a bit pointless if you can only store the energy for two minutes and the total energy turnaround is going to be 20  on the other hand gyros on gravity probe b have a velocity decay rate of 37 per 2300 years but its incredibly hard to spin them up or extract the stored energy also youll need to constantly supply power for cryogenics and electrostatic levitation but yeah anythings possible in anime world with no cuck liberal laws physics
  he thinks he has valid arguments  lol wut    people without engineering or science degrees blabbing about theoretical things like this is just pathetic and annoying you clearly and objectively dont understand the subject and are just parroting things you read on some website you may as well be a trained parrot for all the lack of deep thought and analysis meanwhile other anons have presented data that contradicts your emptyheaded crusade and all you do is repeat the same things over and over again in all caps which everyone knows is cruise control for cool lol acting like somehow youve won the argument and youre smarter than everyone else really truly honestly you need to just stop posting youre embarassing yourself more and more every time you do quit while youre behind  youre anonymous here no one but you needs to know what a shameful disgrace you are
    k thats why they dont use flywheels in f1 oh thats right they do     there shouldnt even be ebikes or pneu bikes because small motorcycles should be allowed on bike paths with the limiting factors being speed and size instead of what form the energy is in bureaucracy isnt rational     the point is that if you need a small energy reservoir to recoup braking energy and cover for turbine spool times then its best to use a combination with compressed air and flywheels being superior and more economical and less centralized    have fun using closed source patented designs and always working for someone else and making excuses for that piece of paper you paid 120k for while i make millions bye
    oh and if youre going to need a bike that can hop through the dumb loopholes then its better to have a small detachable generator than lugging 15 pounds of toxic patented cuck batteries
    alo the fact that you guys are so up your own ass just makes you seem less credible
  compressed air only makes sense as storage if its liquified and by that point the reasonable thing to do is to use lng instead
  he thinks anyone here uses ebikes  lol fag  we all pedal our bikes because were not lazy fatasses like you be sure to enjoy your obesity diabeetus heart disease and early death you hamplanet
compressed air is horribly inefficient so despite decent energy density its not quite like a battery  its also loud    on the other hand recharging is faster
this thread
  thats great here ill trade you
  if you could compress it to say almost the point of being degenerate matter and store it safely then it might make sense but otherwise its just ridiculous
  who doesnt wanna pedal and go faster with help from a motor only a leftist cuck like you would make excuses for having to go slow also getting to ride a motorcycle on a bike path is just fucking fun unless you are some kind of masochistic cuck that has to make excuses for your pathetic beta lifestyle bootlicker             but flywheels and algae biofuel though and leftism/statism is gay
  we all average at least 20mph for all our rides anon everyone knows that  maybe if you werent so fat and weak you wouldnt need mechanical assistance just to simply ride a bike lol
  so motorcycles are completely useless in your mind dont you wanna ride a motorcycle on bike paths so cars cant hit you     youre the one who is useless fucking troll go to reddit or /pol/
  the idea of regenerative braking on a bike is pretty good however this approach is rather heavy ineffient and can only store verry little energy  it would get more interesting to use a small compressor driven by one of your wheels to pressurise your frametubes and use the energy stored in your frametubes to power a pneumatic motor  the pneumatic motor and compressor could be the same unit if build as a pistoncompressor/expander with variable valvetiming    this would still be horribly inefficient but since it adds verry little weight and uses energy that would otherwise be wasted it could be usefull especialy in the mountains or cityriding
  you
  lets make everybodys bike weigh 100 pounds  brilliant idea
  how would a bike with a tiny compressor and valves weight 100 lbs  at maximum it would add like 500g for an early prototype
compressed air wont get any better through research due to physical limitations batteries continue to pull away in energy/efficiency and theres plenty more ground to be gained
  comparable to lead acid  you are fucking retarded jesus fucking christ are you even aware of what fucking century this is you godamned retard
  he has no idea how much that would all weigh or how much of a drag it all would be on pedaling  lol can you even screw in a lightbulb without a youtube video to show you how  faggots with precisely zero mechanical knowhow
  he has no idea how much that would all weigh or how much of a drag it all would be on pedaling  when decoupled from the rotating wheel via a clutch there would be no additional friction  lol can you even screw in a lightbulb without a youtube video to show you how  i was building my first electrical vehicle at the age of 8 youtube didnt exist back then   with precisely zero mechanical knowhow  says the guy who doesnt know how what a clutch is
  clutch  more excessive unnecessary weight  age 8  go scream at the neighborhood kids to get off your lawn grandpa and stay off 4chan youre not relevant anymore    dont you get it youre fat and weak and slow and old and are going to die soon which is why you fight so hard for a bicycle that does all the work for you you should just call the short bus that all the other senior citizens use and get around with that and leave the bikes to the young healthy strong people who can actually ride a real bike
  cool idea only non gay post in entire thread thnx
  wont get any better through research due to physical limitations    yeah materials will never get any stronger ever     also this   it would get more interesting to use a small compressor driven by one of your wheels to pressurise your frametubes and use the energy stored in your frametubes
  not reading the thread   not realizing were talking about flywheels now also   not realize that from a cost perspective compressed air is still valuable   not reading this 
  u mad
    more excessive unnecessary weight  like 500g in total for the whole mechanism   8  go scream at the neighborhood kids to get off your lawn grandpa and stay off 4chan youre not relevant anymore  dont you get it youre fat and weak and slow and old  fat  59 kg isnt fat  weak  i outlclimb ebikes and can sprint 60 km/h  slow  ok im slow in the flats i cant keep 40 km/h for more than 3 km in the flats without drafting  old  yea 20 is totaly old   and are going to die soon which is why you fight so hard for a bicycle that does all the work for you  technicly regenerative braking would still be energy produced by me   you should just call the short bus that all the other senior citizens use and get around with that and leave the bikes to the young healthy strong people who can actually ride a real bike  projecting much
  based and redpilled
  post body with timestamp faggot
so much samefagging in this thread
  who the fuck would ride this piece of shit deathtrap does it come with a mask to hide your face so no one knows youre this much of a stupid fucking autist  2018  being so desperate to not pedal an actual bike that you disgrace yourself by being seen on this piece of shit  my sides are exploding from laughing so hard
  omfg becky you should have seen this junkyard contraption anon was riding down the street today  it sounded like a continuous fart and his legs were bowed out so much it looked like he was trying to empty his bowels  i laughed so hard i almost peed myself becky  lol sally we always knew anon was kind of a weirdo but we never knew exactly how much until now thats hilarious i cant wait to tell the rest of the girls about this theyll just die laughing  i hope for anons sake hes actually gay hell never get a date with anyone around here once this gets around  lol youre totally right becky got to go now chad is picking me up in his convertible for lunch
    because prototypes represent the full utilization of a concept
      implying that there arent a shit ton of comic book reading convention going cosplaying steampunk chicks that would love this shit
  i laughed way harder than i should have anon
  girls into nerd shit will respect you even less for being such an autist
  deathtrap  prototype  pick one only  protip its the former of the two
  u dumb ass the vast majority of people cant even be bothered to figure out how to shift gears on a normal bike and u want them 2 having 2 figure out all that shit too lol ur an idiot
  just had dinner and a liter of water so my weight is slightly higher
  but think of the normies reee  what are digital control units
  comic book reading and convention going girls probably wouldnt like that kind of bike because it isnt aesthetic steampunk probably but better add more brass fittings to be sure    cyberpunk girls are the patricians choice and would prefer the ghetto diy ebike with exposed wires and uncovered circuits over a steamcuck bike
  arduino  kys
  cyberpunk girls  k so use digital control units 
  id buy it if it were more compact and sexy
  i outclimb ebikes on a rigid mtb with 800g slicks welcome to the club
  flywheels are great a pound or two of weight only hurts when accelerating but the stored energy easily negates that penalty  shoving air into a random frame tube would be suboptimal because thats really low volume and youre dealing with loss when converting between kinetic and pneumatic energy  the ability to put energy into the flywheel by pedaling while coasting the crankrear wheel drive would be pretty useful    most casual bicycles arent very engineered for weight optimization so a 2 pound flywheel could be offset by shaving weight elsewhere    im hoping battery technology follows the same curve cpus did with moores law and that well see extended ranges perhaps pneumatics could serve as an intermediary for a pedal assist drivetrain inverters are probably best for high torque applications which i believe should be steered away from due to how it can ravage the lifespan of batteries
im new here please explain like im dumb  what is the correct opinion to have about this stuff
  its as dumb as you are
  what is the correct opinion to have about this stuff  rolling your eyes closing the thread and ignoring it as the useless bait it actually is  nobody is producing anything like this for real nor will they

who here /koolstop/    just made the switch on my cross bike no longer feels like breaking on sand
im /alhonga/
what a thread
  t shameless shill  go advertise shit somewhere else faggot
  alhonga    gaypill me in chogbonga
  wut  its just some cheap taiwanese stuff but their more expensive stuff is alright
my pads keep filling up with metal shards  what should i get
  better pads lmao
  i prefer red hot brake rotors
  take it to the stupid questions thread retard
  looks like this guy  couldnt keep his koolstop      also srsly i needbetterrim brake pads but the stop isnt available here
  replacing rim brake pads is one of those things where any replacement set is going to be better than the stock ones
  can i get the 8 dollars per set of four pads they have on amazon  seems to get good review  will they be walmarts tier
  so are they any different/better than tektro      sauce t chubby chaser      order from some us seller on ebay
  some models yeah  both alhonga and tektro have a lineup that goes to shiettier to decenttier  my road bike was fitted with some better calipers of alhonga and it is largely the same as my tiagra calipers i had before
  any north american distributors
campag make the best pads ime
koolstop make pads whomst are shoe
  swissstop
  fuck those are kool but i just checked and they only comst in bmx thread
i prefer the more authenticity of the fixed gear bicycle
  you prefer a big cock rammed up your arse you pretty little faggot
  just bought a used bike that had these are they good or something
  1 the word is braking not breaking you fucking mook  2 why are you shilling for this company youre dumb so they cant be paying you so why  3 shit like this is almost literally a meme brand doesnt matter for something like this unless its cheapass chinese shit and even then itll get the job done for 99 of all of you  4 the one thing you do have to care about is whether or not you have carbon fiber rims you need different pads for that and for 99 of /n/ thats not even a consideration
  and for 99 of /n/ thats not even a consideration  sorry to have angered you mr 1 percenter
  stop shilling you faggot
  what am i shilling 
  being this mad over a typo and a break pad    fucking kek
  breakpads are important you moran  shit breakpads wear out yer rims too untill the brake one day  to many shitpads on the shelves too count
swissstop yellow master race ama
  bait
  yellow is ghey and looks bad on my bike 
  buy a better bike next time
  yellow bikes r ghey  blue ones too
  brand doesnt matter for something like this unless its cheapass chinese shit  ridelet detected
  tell us how many mountains you descend every week then anon that you need topoftheline cuttingedge brake pads be sure to post your strava for all of them
  i like them on some brakes and hate them on others    their metallic disc pads are my goto on any shimano hydraulics but man do i have shit luck with the salmon thinlines on any sort of canti or v brake
  rides shit wheels that cost less to replace than a set of kool stops  being poor
  they wont overheat considering that avg /an/ user does 20 km/h at best
  no strava showing 20000 feet of elevation gain and descending every week of the year  why are you even here
  elevation  ur country to poor too flatten out those muntains
  hello anon  you seem to be lost the utter stupidity boards are this way    
  are you really 53
  wouldnt you like to know xd
  disc brakes
  t hillfucker    i sure hope not
  implying you cant shitpost from the old folks home
  boomer must have found out his son is getting gay married in a tasteful vermont wedding hes been salty and mean recently
      stay mad it amuses me    on the other hand maybe just maybe if you have a normal conversation with me instead of dismissing me outofhand because i dont fit in with your limited worldview of 4chan i wont be so effing salty to you  tldr try being inclusive instead of bigoted
    anyone going to see it
  wow thats right by my home town
  go out and take some pictures its supposed to be a nearly 20 passenger car long train
  is this a funeral train or what
  yes his casket will be carried on it
make it a railway of death
  are they borrowing amtrak passenger cars or what are they doing  i cant think of any recent funeral trains around the world  if the queen dies in scotland there are plans to use a deutsche bahn schenker locomotive and the royal train carriages to bring her back to london though those are only plans  remind me what was h w bushs significance to rail transport if any  i doubt they would do the same for joe biden considering all he really did was attend the opening of the acs64 services and attend the thing where they showed off the avelia liberty as the replacement accela express
  are they borrowing amtrak passenger cars or what are they doing  absolutely not all freight railroads have their own fleets of passenger cars they use for special events and executives theyre normally really fancy but the up takes it to another level    
rip in peace
  all freight railroads have their own fleets of passenger cars they use for special events and executives  whats the point i mean if none of the class i freight lines actually do scheduled revenue service then surely these are just money sinks  i know the royal train in the uk is considered a money sink as well but the fact that its cheaper to transport the queen and the duke of edinburgh together on the same train since it saves on both transport and security costs is a benefit  ultimately though it makes no sence for something that never deals with passengers to have luxury passenger cars
  why  because these are multibillion dollar profiting companies and private railcars to shuttle big whigs around in an oppulent display isnt actually that big of an expense when you already own the rail and engines
  whats the point  you already have a railroad right of way employees and motive power might as well use them to tour the system periodically and people do turn out for steam specials even just to watch them come through town    what youll find on nearly every officers special are politiciansstate and national
  exactly its a very cheap yet effective public relations service these companies have plenty of space to store them when not in use the cars were bought 60 or 70 years ago so theres no big capital cost in retaining them and theyre not used very frequently so there isnt an appreciable amount spent maintaining them    the biggest cost is really the opportunity cost of running it and sequencing revenue service
  snow    when the snow is bad and trains are stopped they deadhead crews in passenger cars attached to manifest trains    though crew cars are amtrak cars and nothing fancy
  remind me what was h w bushs significance to rail transport if any  he used a train to campaign in 1992
  travelling to see a statist sham  yeah no
hey 4channel users my school is getting rid of ofos and we want to steal one as a meme and for memories eventually well repaint it but we need to figure out how to take off the tracker i wanna be like that guy that toured on it a couple a months ago any tips ofo doesnt care theyre probably all going to trash anyway thanks in advance 4channelers uwu
  you must be 18 years or older to post on this site    just use bolt cutters like a normal bike thief
  is this a /n/themed fedpost
why is there even an anti stall system    the whole point of the system is to save pilots when they themselves dont recognize they are in trouble so why the fuck would it have an off switch wouldnt the pilots be oblivious they are in a stall situation and just turn it off anyway and why isnt this system more integrated or have more fail safes like oh hey the plane is 1000 feet in altitude maybe we shouldnt force the plane to nosedive like a stuka or the pilots have yanked the stick back for 10 minutes straight and havent crashed maybe we really arent in a stall
  theres a mentour video on this now i dont have the link to hand but from what it appears the mcas system replaces a system the next generation had which was a stall protection system  this is because the use of the cfm leap engine means that it has to be placed higher and more forwards than the cfm56 engine of the ng this meant that the easily overridden system had to replaced with a new system which worked with the maxs different flight characteristics thats why mcas was made in the first place the main problem it seems was that the way mcas works and even the existence of mcas was not revealed to the pilots flying them  from the preliminary report it seems that the best course of action to take was to put the flaps to the first setting which disables the mcas and autotrimming and then turn back to the airport
  boeing is a fucking joke instead of shortening 757 which had much bigger engines originally they made this meme
  but thats what im asking why is a stall system easily overridden that makes it pointless
  it is easily overridden even in airbus
  737 was originally designed as a regional jet with minimal ground equipment requirements this is why the 737 is so low to the ground as a result most of the stuff which ground crews work with only need a small step ladder to access this includes the baggage hold which can be accessed with a ladder only the main reason why the 737 was never made taller until the max was because boeing wanted to keep the regional jet design of the 737 which is why many 737s have built in airstairs and why it has the ability to land within 750m on emergency settings  the 737 could theoretically land at many small airports like london city however it cannot do steep approaches the boeing engineers did not consider those as basically no commercial airports in north america have them and those which do are far too small to take the 737    the max had to raise the landing gear because they couldnt fit the cfm leap engines for the classic and the next gen they managed to modify the cfm56 engines which is why they look misshapen into the hamster pouch the a320 and a340 which also uses the same cfm56 engines are round and look normal in comparison  while the a320neo can fit the cfm leap with no issues whatsoever as the a320 was designed as a short haul jet instead serving european hubs which would have jetbridges the 737 max couldnt so even with making the cfm leap look like a hamster pouch again there was not enough room the landing gear was raised and there still wasnt enough room the nacelle pylons were shortened and the engine moved forwards this changed the aerodynamic qualities of the max but this still allowed the max to fit the cfm leap
  fuel economy
i cannot understand anti stall and nose pushers a stall warning siren is more than enough
  i see no reason why it couldnt be done they weight nearly identical tonn/meter so it is possible
  problem that everyone in aviation thinks that everyone else is retarded  engineers think that pilots are retarded pilots think that management is retarded
  automation is clearly and objectively better than human pilots  aircraft doesnt need human pilots at all we should just let an ai fly planes instead  what could possibly go wrong  remember things like this when theyre talking about selfdriving cars and not having engineers on trains
  what oew of 739 is something like 45t while 752 is something close to 60
  but what about 751 which didnt happen
  it will still be more heavy while carrying less passengers
  okay why the fuck it is heavier maybe engines weight more
  757 was originally designed for missions that require more capabilities than 737 which mean more structure to carry weight for fuel and such as 737 gained new wing and new engines we dont need to carry that much fuel to fly an aircraft across atlantic ocean by comparison the extra structure on the 757 aircraft for those extra fuel weight and volume become redundant of course you can still give 757 a more modern efficient wing and engine however the structure will still there unless you redesign the entire aircraft structure at which point it wouldnt be much different from designing a new aircraft from the ground up which would also have another advantage of further reducing structural weight by using composite materials and other advanced aerodynamic designs and is basically boeing is doing now with the proposed nma on their drawing board although somehow boeing seems to be thinking of a 2aisle aircraft    and then iirc the 757 design didnt match the boeing design target either
ugly strange and aesthetic trains threads are old news lets post some boring uninspiring and forgettable trains
these sbahn trains are the epitomy of boring theyre basically the manifestation of monotony
  i like them  the red db color scheme is pretty meh though
  i bet youre one of those niggers who still wants 40 year old hsts to keep running until the end of time
      im also sad to see the hsts go but the bigger loss is watching the a e s t h e t i c 373s in their og chunnel scheme get replaced by those boringass desiros and get repainted in that awful new livery the only time a 373 looked good in blue was in gner service
  these sbahn trains are the epitomy of boring theyre basically the manifestation of monotony    perfect for reuse later on the pyongyang subway they could be prepainted for delivery
  awful new livery  what is your very favorite livery
  i was literally waiting for someone to post these
combine bland neoutilitarian body with the dull liveries of greater londons commuter railroads and you have an electrostar the old slamdoors were slow and noisy but they looked somewhat edgy and cool
unpopular opinion but i think all japanese commuter and metro trains are boring and dull theyre blocky and just make me think that they were designed to be efficient with space  pic related is the only example on my hard drive i cant be bothered to find a different one because theyre so boring
dublins dart has tokyo car corporation rolling stock but theyre made at least bearable by their livery scheme theyre still blocky and dull
the flirt simply because theyre rapidly becoming so damn ubiquitous and have displaced so many interesting local designs now theyre starting to do it in na as well also they look like a damn light rail train doesnt help that their performance is nothing to write home about either
youre in the wrong neighborhood budd
  my sides are in the wrong neighborhood
  this desu    as a yuropfag they arr rook the same to me blocky breadbox design and pocket doors      the flirt simply because theyre rapidly becoming so damn ubiquitous and have displaced so many interesting local design now theyre starting to do it in na as well  i didnt even know they were expanding over there too although ive heard that a few stadler gtw were delivered over the pond before the flirt for texrail look more like a combination of de gtw and flirt theyre indeed like a plague and spreading all over europe and it wont stop anytime soon    also they look like a damn light rail train  thats a first taste of what commuting in europe is like almost every commuter train dmu/emu over here that has been built in recent times looks like this the differences became more blurry in the last couple of years     doesnt help that their performance is nothing to write home about either  theyre pretty okay compared to other products cough bombadier talent 2 if maintained decently if the latter doesnt apply you will quickly notice that as a passenger
  looks like an 80s train refurbished in the current year thats what japan is famous for using time tested designs for decades simply because theyre efficient and they save on the cost of design its not just their trains either you see the same buildings copy pasted hundreds of times all over the place    i actually like these theyve become a symbol of new york and most trains that came after them follow their design theme
  those sovietinspired carriages are unironically aesthetic though
  tokyo    tokyu
  the thing is that in china in order to promote the high speed train they have repainted all other trains in the country into same look
  a classic because all the nyc movies
the railbased equivalent of constant cold drizzle that doesnt actually become useful rain but still gets you soaked
  scotland is just a graveyard for london rolling stock at this point lmao
  a lot of these british emus are literally windshield  headlights  marker lights
  forgot pic
pacers are the worst two fixed axles per carriage  the squeak and grind on the corners  how the fuck are these still allowed to run in
  the bizarre bit is the 314 318s and 320/3 units were custom for strathclyde in the first place the 365s are london handmedowns but hey theyre at least alright in summer yet to see how the egml performs in the first bit of ice
  thats what you get for being filthy northerners even cornwall has better trains hsts and iet800s
  the northern shit house  soon they will cancel services because the bog is out of order  and that is quite often
south korea has some boringass trains
evillooking and boring nice interior though
had to take a nap halfway through searching for this image
    the livery is boring but the new hst is not
  a lot better than most metros
  if you compare them to the stock theyll eventually replace its a tragedy
  not really the sloped front which only exists on some of the old stock is the only thing about itt thats better than the new trains
  thats the best looking train on that godforsaken network what the fuck is the half window meemay for
  these fuckers   a 12 carriage long train meant that siemens didnt have to go with the design as seen on every british train ever looking at you class 158159 172375376377378379380387 and this is what they produced
  literally sat on basically one of those merseyrail 503 so third rail rather than overhead power as shit as they are ill be dissapointed cos theyre basically past of my memories of childhood trips
  
  for the 373s probably the original 90s one as for alltime favorite i wish i could pin it down to just one but some that i really like are   tgv sud est  tgv atlantique  jr 700 hikari railstar  burlington northern greenblack  tfl stock  central trains class 170  anything east midlands trains    and thats just some of them
  old bart trains are retro and distinctive take away the logo and transit enthusiasts would still be able to tell you where theyre from on top of the technical fuckups the new trains lack any character and look like they could be on any asian or european metro system
  the 30 year old boomer who reminisces about slam door cars in 2018
  ive seen this weird looking thing go to zaragoza from valencia
  ah yes the standard dmu for diesel regional services formerly trd
  distinctive//good
  the new trains are more technically sounds on every level than the old ones
  agreed
  will texrail be any good
  ive always thought those trains looked ugly
  this isnt the ugly train thread
  no
  asymmetry is very aesthetically pleasing in a lot of situations it adds character to these trains makes them stand out and helps create a futuristic impression
i think the class 230 has them all beat
  give it about ten more years kiddo then youll be reminiscing on things from your past too    this was literally made out of old london tube stock to be a cheap replacement for pacers so it makes sense
  unpopular opinion i kinda like them simply because theyre upcycled
  i know but somehow the removal of the front door turns them into the most boring things on the planet
  fake black paint window to make it look modern  just embrace the real aesthetics and stop pretending its something that it isnt
  yellow frontblack windshield is the staple of british train design for the last 20 years
  having a train painted yellow at the front of a train is actually a legal requirement which was abolished last year in preparation for the class 345 which is currently in use by tfl rail but will be later used for the elizabeth line/crossrail  however you will notice that trains which were ordered before the change in legislation still have the yellow paint including the class 374 siemens velaro for the eurostar the class 800 for lner and gwr class 801 for lner and the class 802 for transpennine hull trains and gwr  as far as i know all future emus will not have the yellow paint at the front thanks to the requirement having been lifted
  what was that requirement for visibility i get that its hard to spot a clanking buzzing 200 ton machine
  visibility  the legislation was introduced in the 1960s when more and more emus and dmus as well as diesel and electric locomotives started replacing steam locomotives  the concern at the time was that trains would be far too silent to hear so the alternative was to paint them bright yellow to make them very visible to anyone near train tracks  ireland adopted similar legislation around the same time but in the case of ireland they havent repealed this legislative requirement  now in the uk constantly bright daylight operation headlights must be in use for visibility as that is much more likely to get the attention of someone near the railway than just a yellow train
  id be worried more about night time visibility the dinky little marker lights and single headlight isnt enough to illuminate the tracks in front of the train at night
  my guess would be that more powerful headlights would be fitted onto the class 230 before entering service  night time visibility is usually improved by powerful xenon headlights on most trains with a 3rd light usually indicating that the train is actually a train avoiding confusion with cars/trucks
  here in the states all locomotives have collapsed suns for headlights and ive always wondered why trains abroad dont do the same i get that you can see signs and signals just fine with normal lights but if safety is really a priority it helps to be able to see far ahead of the train at night
this thread has turned into a shit on british trains thread
  i know but that whole black windshield paint thing is something you see everywhere even on planes looks tacky imo
  funny i always thought the other way interior is shit and so extremely 90s but on the outside the ic3/ir4/oresundstog look sleek af
  this might be because european rail infrastructure is probably well indicated im guessing that a major reason why us locomotives have horns that can deafen a city a bell and headlights to reflect off the moon is because a lot of railways in the us go over baren lands and theres not much that will destinguish the difference between a desert and a train track  i guess that in europe trainlines are usually fenced off and that the only peoples attention which really needs to be had would be the attention of people standing on train station platforms or perhaps people working on train tracks such as engineers or people performing maintenance on the signalling equipment    lets be honest here british trains are the most boring kinda reflects the country i guess and the people
    you can i believe retrofit brighter leds to any loco or mu and not have yellow painted ends    pic related new sheffield tramtrain has a tops number and runs on network rail tracks but no yellow ends
  as far as i know all future emus will not have the yellow paint at the front thanks to the requirement having been lifted  dont you have to meet more stringent headlight requirements if you dont have yellow ends
  sheffield  kys northern scum
  im not too sure about that but since most trains already adhere to these headlight regulations anyway because it just makes night time operations easier i would expect that for most trains the yellow front isnt needed
  it depends really ive seen houses between the rail and the street rail being seperated by artifical hills with a shit ton of greens the rail itself being on an artifical hill rails are also placed between small bumps and it can also stay unseperated     rail crossings have a seperate traffing sign anyway depends on the country and there are also traffic lights also the train has lights as well its pretty difficult to accidentally land on rail up to a point where fencing it off isnt really worth it
    make me
  whats it like living in a slum
  slum  pic related has a bmw 3 series and an mini cooper
  theyre nigga rich you dont have to have a lot of money to drive either of those cars because they can be bought used quite cheaply and/or you can make payments
  thicc
  looks like baltimore but without the niggers sounds cozy as fuck desu
amazed no one had posted the 400 series yet
  fuck me theyre awful    glad to see theres a good understanding that japanese trains are on the whole boring as fuck  mostly its because the engineers run the show there and the designers barely get a look in
  livery ripped straight from southeast trains  why
  looks like baltimore but without the niggers sounds cozy as fuck desu    thats what northern england is like there arent much niggers there but its full of pakis
  yes see 
  p sure thats an e46 compact
    a 3 series is still a 3 series i was at the very least accurate in my description of the car
the virgin civia  aerodynamic exterior even tho it only goes 120kph  needs a name to feel more important  few seats lots of room for standee cucks
vs the chad 447  doesnt need a name just a number  dgaf about aerodynamics  lots of seats
bonus the turbochad 450  doesnt have a name but an alias buque ship  goes up to 140 kph still dgaf about aerodynamics  6 cars long twice as many as 447 one more than the longest civia  even more seats than any other commuter unit two floors with savage 23 arrangement  will end you and everyone you love
  i always thought these look interesting compared to the boring red stog basically the sbahn but even more normielookinh alongside which they drive insides are nice when theyre almost empty too   they also make a hellish screeching noise that hurts all the unprepared normies waiting for their stog when they slow down in cities or before the headstation and that always made me kek as a kid
  e46 compact is the cheapest most bare bones bmw ever made in order to try and rival vw not the same as a normal 3 series
      447 and 450 look better but the 450 also sort of confuses me sbahnen never come with two floors in my country
  this is unironically goregous
  hey cuz  6 cars  meh like the railtearing acceleration of the 4 cars sets more
  british trains are the most boring kinda reflects the country i guess and the people  were not talking about ontario here
  i wish you fucks had declared independence so that we never had to deal with you ever again
sure am glad to des another québecois anon
  same desu
  this pepsis rot in hell
  yeah they do abit  the point is siemens had a change to make distinctive good looking trains that didnt look like every suburban train ever because they dont need carriage connectors and they fucked it
  i luv livin in the norf me
  dont get me wrong living in the north of england is a hellish experience i would never want to have but calling it a slum is pretty much false  t from northern ireland somewhere which is marginally better than the north of england
  pretty sure youre alone with that opinion japanese trains are some of the best looking in the world and thats not exactly hard to achieve when you look at the european abominations and the steel boxes from the us
  that anon isnt alone actually  im this  and this  anon  i think that most japanese trains are just brushed aluminium boxes i have no idea what you dislike about european trains but at least they have a designer whereas most japanese trains have gone far too utilitarian to look nice  pic related is a french design and alstom diesel branch line railcar i love the looks of it because it looks a bit like the shuttlecraft from star trek the next generation it looks sleek and like there has been some thought put into it
  yep gotta love the sausages or whales or suppository depends who you ask look too bad they ended up being such a reliability nightmare that couldnt even shunt track circuits properly
  at any rate even european high speed trains look nicer to me a lot of japanese shinkansen either looks alien or just plain weird  european trains at least have some kind of nice rounded noses which flow smoothly into the body unlike shinkansen which have sudden and sharp curves with low noses
  european high speed trains look boring as fuck compared to japanese
  the rubber anus of doom  forgettable
  i feel the same way about japanese urbanism and utilitarian architecture in general
  every japanese commuter train ever    slot doors  grey box with some bullshit novelty front end  boxes on the roof  boxes underneath  how the fuck do we style anything  no effort made whatsoever to present the vehicle as a cohesive whole
  minions the train
  oof
  bores you to death on your commute
  kek      i dont know about you lad but i certainly wouldnt describe this whole vivarail bullocks as forgettable
  thats a cool front end design either way euro trains often look unappealing and gimmicky the ice especially i cant stand the stubby front end with the bulbous windscreen  the classic tgv is awesome though i wish theyd go back to that badass chiseled look    i find that particular design philosophy and aesthetic appealing sure it could benefit from curvy plastic body panels and a pretty paint scheme but a slow commuter train doesnt need that the japs reserve the more pleasant designs for the shinkansen and such
  is that a repainted london underground district line train
  tgv  chiseled look  more like chisel look
  yes       what in the fuck possessed you to think that the og tgv is any of boring uninspiring and forgettable
  did you read his post
  how can i just tell that youre an american who has only ever seen the big steel choo choo    god they looks like shit
  i think that most japanese trains are just brushed aluminium boxes  i hope youre speaking primarily about the commuters japans previous and current intercity limited express sets are for the most part aesthetic as fuck and the only bullet i havent visually liked was the e3
  im a european who grew up in japan something about their railroad stuff captured by interest as a kid i guess i admired the serious attitude and efficiency of it all plus the spaceship looking bullet trains      i said the complete opposite its majestic and selfassured looking with a striking paintjob as a train should be
  it most definitely isnt it has the regular facelift lights
                    i like all these id like to tell you a common theme but i forgot half the stuff i clicked on generally i have absolutely no problem with utilitarian boxes with square fronts though its an honest trustworthy styling dont like it when simple metro trains pretend to be sleek high speed bullets for no reason
im surprised to see how many people dont like japans commuter boxes i find them absolutely lovely theyre cheap effective and dont look like shit and usually can reconize most of them through stuff like colours and contour at least except for the e233s that is those look good but are still samey and everything thats yellow and green is shonanshinjuku to me everything thats blue is jôban  honestly having curvy sleek fronts should be a crime for anything that goes under 150 km/h    also to answer the threads question and to tie in with my dislike for curves on slow doots heres what my city bought a couple of years ago you can find these same series 7000s in a dozen other places in the country and im already tired of them at least the air conditioning works and theyre generally faster still they never break 70 km/h in my city
  and heres what theyre replacing honestly the old emus looked a lot better and at least had some personality to it i much prefer to see it speeding by than the plastic toy that caf made specially since thhey now go in 8 car units side note sorry for potato pics but thats the best i could find
super voyagers
      this guy gets it
  looks a bit boring but i really like voyagers spent four hours on one and it was the best journey ive ever had the return by pendolino was garbage
oh hi
  why the fuck did they stop painting them orange
  en57 was produced in a few similar designs but they all have one thing in common  theyre ugly as fuck its the most popular train in poland theres over 900 left most of them still in service
  let me guess it was built by the soviets wasnt it
  pretty close theyre polish trains built by pafawag in wrocław they were designed in early 60s and produced until 1993 1452 total were made many of them were modernized recently this is one of new slightly less ugly versions
  thats one hell of a modernization doesnt even look like the same train
  we had some of them until a few years ago nicknamed gomulka after the leader of the polish communist party during time of delivery
  why is the front door hiding like that is it ashamed
  its the only doubledecker series in all of spain everyone unironically loves them because of how chad and awesome they are but theyll probably be retired in a not too distant future theyre from the late 1980s theyre getting old and there are no plans to buy new doubledecker trains _      we only have sixcar units and threecar units with half the power their weak acceleration is their biggest flaw however the operator is fucking retarded and they often use them on the local services instead of using them on the faster services which skip a few stations that way the higher top speed would make up for the weak acceleration    i wish they would convert them for regional services the regional lines reaching south from barcelona are constantly overloaded these large units would offer lots of seating a good top speed and the weak acceleration wouldnt be much of a problem giving them a good overhaul new seats and wheelchair accessibility could give those units easily 20 more years of useful life
  thats one hell of a modernization doesnt even look like the same train  thats nothing take a look at this one it was an ed72 which was basically longer version of en57 some of them were sent to yugoslavia in 60s and 70s like this one  although these modernizations are getting more and more expensive up to the point when it costs as much as completely new modern train but still has 0 low floor and cant go faster than 120km/h why polregio the biggest operator still using en57 is so stubborn about the old kibel thats what we call them literally a toilet i have no idea
exo formerly agencé métropolitain de transport is going through a terrible rebrand right now
    theyre ugly as fuck    their design reminds me of the old berlin sbahn id rather call it soulful than ugly
  yeah in paris we got 4 5 and 6 cars units all with a power car at each end most units ended up being an ungodly messy mix of first and second gen carriages with the occasional old as fuck refurbished carriage from a pushpull set thrown in for good measure 6 cars unit are only used on long distance suburban routes these days after fucking with the rer c flow for a couple decades because one of the branches lacked the power supply to run 8 cars sets and a single 4 cars unit was absolutely inadequate during rush hour  mind you none of them is as chad as the original french suburban double decker push pull
  shreded mi09  not the ultimate chad on french railways
  i guess its ok not a huge fan myself its only a mi2n with an edgy front end and a terrible paintjob from an aesthetic point of view  chadest bi level stock could have been the tgv duplex but they ended up not letting j cooper design it in the end
  then again we kinda got them in the end just with the wrong paintjob
    whoops sorry lad
  are voyagers being given work that no 4/5 carriage train should ever do yes   are they forgettable no
  hold up why is that tgv only running with one pantograph up  i know that the eurostar class 373 needed to run with only one pantograph up when on uk ac lines but that was because the class 373 could suck the power out of the entire overhead line section because it was that powerful
  fuck you theyre wonderful
  short version because it doesnt need it    longer version  tgvs have 2 pantographs per power car one for ac french 25kv 50hz and on relevant sets germanic 16kv 167hz and one for dc french 15kv and again on relevant sets italian 3kv lets forget about running under foreign overhead for now  running dc first wave of electrification mainly in southern and eastern france your regular tgv réseaux first gen duplexes can draw up to 37 mw worth of continuous power 37mw under 15kv means youll end up with an amperage just a tad under 2500 a thats too much for a single pantograph so dc running is always with the dc pantograph raised on both power cars  under 25kv ac overhead second wave of electrification in eastern and northern france  brittany and high speed routes that continuous power jumps up to 88mw later tgv gens up that to 92mw 88mw / 25kv is about 350a and you can definitely channel that through a single pantograph and theres a high voltage line running along the roof of the set connecting both power cars  and on top of the electrical side of physics theres the issue of pantograph/overhead line interaction namely oscillation of the overhead wire due to the pantograph pushing on it running at high speed with both pantographs up would more or less double the stress applied to the whole wire/pantograph system and you dont really want that    and as a side note conventional loccarriages sets operating under 15kv dc will usually run with only one pantograph up the norm is to run with the back pantograph up on single voltage locs or whichever is the dc pantograph on dual voltage locs but many drivers tend to pop up the second pantograph upon leaving stations effectively doubling the contact patch area to help with the high amperage upon takeoff and usually dropping that second panto once they reach 510 km/h
  thanks anon i liked that  how come the class 373 and class 374 eurostar trainsets have both pantographs up then  i know that the class 373 has been in use on uk domestic routes before and has had to run with only one pantograph and power car since the british electrification system isnt powerful enough to supply enough amperage/watts without making the network unusable by other emus or electric locos but they have both pantographs up for the ctrl and on the french high speed networks  ive also noticed that the other comparable design the ice 1 has both power cars have their pantograph up as well
  well these really a special case a typical tgv set is 10 cars long 88mw and roughly 200m long  a class 373 is 20 cars and 387m long and has a maximum output of 122mw its pretty much twice as long and has about 50 more power than other tgvs and that additional power is located in the first and last carriages right next to the power cars with an additional powered bogie im not sure why they have to run with both pantographs up could be eurotunnel regulations theres a scharfenberg coupler right in the middle of the set to allow quick separation in case of an incident and each halfset is from a technical point of view a self sufficient emu  a bit sad to have such a brutal 50 power reduction on the main lines but you can try to fin comfort in the fact that they used to be limited to a quite pitiful three and a half mw when running third rail  not sure about ice 1 and 374 not nearly as knowledgeable on those
  thanks again anon pretty neato  from what i know the use of the class 373 for domestic services was shortlived and was not the greatest thing i think it was gner which operated them out of kings cross i think they also had to lock several carriages since the trains couldnt fit entirely within several platforms in the uk  i like the class 373 mostly as they remind my of another trainset which was purchased for a rail link close to where i live the idea was to get the same dedietrich coaches at least in terms of the body and the interior since this train was also going to be an international service that said the dedietrich stock close to where i live has been refurbished and now no longer looks like the way it did when i took a eurostar last year from brussels to london the old style interior reminded me of the way the trains close to me used to be that was a kind of weird nostalgia
  its an honest trustworthy styling  its fucking boring
  third rail  fuck southern railway the original ones
  same owner at the time stagecoach group
    373s dont have the high voltage running along the roof line since 1 british safety rules dont allow it 2 limited height would be tricky 3 theres no way to have an electrical connector that could safely disconnect 25kv just by pulling apart when separating the half sets    regarding pantograph/overhead oscillation its not a huge deal for something like the 373 or an ice 1 which also doesnt have the high voltage line on top since theyre so long pantograph to pantograph distance with both up is about the same as two tgv sets coupled together longer than a pair of ice 2 facing same direction or ice 3 sets which are also acceptable configurations    looking at old videos they did run both pantographs up on uk north of london with both power cars running  i suspect the power limit was just from substation capacity not the train
  nothing wrong with these they have inside bogies so you can see the wheels
  1 british safety rules dont allow it 2 limited height would be tricky  kinda what i expected thanks for the confirmation  3 theres no way to have an electrical connector that could safely disconnect 25kv just by pulling apart when separating the half sets  meh it is entirely possible to fit a 25kv switch on a carriage roof iirc its on the first carriage on french tgvs it is just a switch tho you need to open the main breaker to operate it    since theyre so long pantograph to pantograph distance with both up is about the same as two tgv sets coupled together  true as well the issue with tgvs is mainly the relative impossibility to run with both pantographs up on the coupling side running pantograph up on the lead power car is also not recommended from an aerodynamic point of view    i suspect the power limit was just from substation capacity not the train  definitely limiting individuals trains to lower power draw is exactly how you deal with that if you cant inject more power down the line were doing that on a daily basis in france when running the tgvs on secondary lines with a power limiter that can be set as low as 16 mw /set by the driver
  interestingly in the earliest days of the 450 they were also locomotive hauled pushpull compositions this lasted only for a few years the type of locomotive wasnt meant for those kinds of commuter services so fitting power cars were bought lets see if i can get the whole qrd on these units  initial order of 60 cars forming 12 branches with 4 cars plus one cab car entered service in 1990  in 1991 order of 30 power cars and 15 complete 6car trainsets each with a powered cab at each end entered service in 1994  18 power cars added to 9 of the older branches minus the cab car formed 9 more sixcar units  this leaves 3 complete branches each 4 cars  cab and 9 extra cab cars so 12 cars and 12 cabs  remaining 12 power cars 3 branches and 9 cabs form 12 threecar units with one power car and one cab car  total of 24 sixcar units with two power cars and 12 threecar units with one power car    the 80s and 90s were the only really good period for renfe formerly renfe the economy was doing ok so railways got some proper investment for the first time since the 50s and it was before the hsr madness took over so youd really notice the improvement new commuter units 446/447 and 450/451 older 440 commuter units converted for regional service and renumbered 470 many still in service built 197579 a whopping 40 years of service  new regional express units were procured like the 448 capable of 160 kmh the general speed limit on spanish railways was increased from 140 to 160 in the late 70s thanks to the asfa signalling system still in use a tad inefficient for todays standards but extremely safe   the first tilting talgo trainsets entered service in the late 70s nighttrain service saw its heyday with the improved and a/cd estrella trains and a great electrification plan was carried out   man those were the days
  also all those trains were surprisingly boring heres a 470 a 1970s unit remodeled early 90s pic is recent     these trains make me nostalgia hard theyve been the same trains since i was a wee lad in the 1990s i always liked them because of their comfy seats and strong air conditioning
 you  same one in the newest livery which one do you think is better    btw fun fact these units run the daily barcelonamadrid regional express the only nonhsr train between the two cities and possibly one of the longest regional lines ever it covers about 700 km 100 km more than the hs line in nine hours and stopping at 41 stations
  why the fuck did the 269s get decomissioned for fucks sake they were the most reliable pieces of railway equipment weve ever had and we had them replaced with goddamn traxx in freight services not even taurus but fucking traxx   splitting renfe was a fucking mistake  /autistic rant
  new is better because it looks older
  funny we pulled the exact same shit in france the emu trailers were ready long before the power cars and started their operational life sandwiched between bb8500 locs 3 trailers set on the rer c at least one 10 trailer set operating out of paris garedelyon on what would become the southern half of the rer d and ive heard about an 8 trailers set being used on the western suburban lines out of paris montparnasse as time went on sncf started to mix and match trailers all over the place culminating with the rer d special bidule loosely translatable to thingmajig consisting of 2 second gen z20500 power cars 2 first gen trailers salvaged from 5 cars set turned 4 cars for the rer c and a coach from loc hauled push pull sets rewired to fit the emu those being salvaged from stlazare area vb2n sets that lost a coach when the ageing small boxy locs they had been mated to since forever were replaced by absurdly oversized prima freight locs nigger rigged to work suburban trains    also all those trains were surprisingly boring  the railway autist in me is deeply conflicted over the z2n family theyve all proved decent suburban workhorses northern france regional services even purchased a handful of them and seasonal reinforcements saw them running services between lyon and the alps and along the mediterranean coast not so long ago theyll be what generations will remember as the suburban train its kinda amazing that they kept producing essentially the same design until 2004 especially as its a very flawed design for the intensive suburban services theyve been running basically not enough doors another fun fact at some point refurbishment programs were overlapping among the series the rer c roster ended up sporting 4 different paintjobs around 20142016  oh and looking for early trailer only operation practices i even found a shortened zr2n used for trials on the rer a theyve just been everywhere
i grew up on station road with this train going past my house twice an hour horrible loud drone when it pulls away clouds of black smoke and its slow as shit dont think theyve been changed in the 21 years i lived there all thats changed now when i go home is the colour scheme
  the switch is less of a problem than the wire connection its bolted together on tgvs
can there be a boring steam engine  not related
  yeah all of them
  tell me anon what kind of locomotives do you like then
  not steam
  the austerity 280s and others of their ilk like the s160 and the drb class 52 count i think
  rude
  station road  do
  the iep is generally another boring japanese design but the new lner livery makes it look really really good
  lner  nationalise it
  but railways dont make money under government control  pours billions of pounds into motorways without glancing an eye
  the thing is lner is now a government owned franchise  east coast was the old government owned franchise because no one wanted the ecml services even though east coast was profitable for the government they still killed the franchise and gave it to virgin who make it the virgin trains east coast franchise that lasted for a few years but vtec lost a large amount of money and the unprecedented level of complaints about the franchise forced the vtec franchise to end prematurely  now back in government ownership they revived the lner name and are basically going to operate it for as long as they can the only people i could imagine to be interested in the ecml services could be the french government owned keolis sncf the german government owned arriva db dutch government owned abellio ns or possibly even jr  keolis recently took over welsh trains from arriva abellio took over scottish trains from first and arriva is still looking good on running the london overground  its kinda weird that in privatising british rail it just got taken over by foreign nationalised rail companies
  or possibly even jr  there might be credence to this ive noticed that the jrs have become way more active internationally in the past decade what with the taiwan and possible texas hsr systems using their tech    wonder what caused them to turn their eyes outward theyve been pretty happy to just focus on their domestic operations until now
  jr east does already own a 15 stake in west midlands trains
    wonder what caused them to turn their eyes outward  stagnant japanese economy
  still no proper santandervalencia line  how will valencia have the spanish monopoly on car shipping
  hasnt stopped them from ignoring the outside world before    something seems to have changed in their behavior since the early 2000s seems like the taiwan hsr was the breaking point after getting underbid by the euros again the jrs and japan literally offered to pay the difference and then some if theyd use the shinkansen    since then theyve been using the same strategy in malaysia india texas etc with moderate success
i take this piece of shit to work every day zero soul and aesthetic the old leather seat czech made trains from the 70s were much comfier
  i feel that bdmtee coaches were the shit especially when hauled by a plechac tisnov here what about you
  olomouc commuting to prostejov every now and then i wait an hour and a half at the station to catch the 460 its a shame that it only rides about once or twice a day such a timeless classic
  the pantografi are a legend rusty buzzing and screeching like a banshee when they apply the brakes a true czech train
off topic but new 160km/h locomotive in china with passenger cars
  the iep and scotrails 385s are so close yet so far if caf had an answer for tpes nova 1 requirements i think it would just win cause the nova 2/397 is just the best damn looking thing ive seen in a while
  hoooooonk  bing bong  the train arriving on platform 1 is the gold coast train stopping all stations  please wait behind the yellow safety line until you kys from boredom  there is only good thing about qrs rolling stock theyre clean thats it
  fucking disgusting doesnt belong in this thread
  at this way its going to be the most common nonhighspeed train in china im next few years
   an ugly future awaits
riding on one of these is as depressing as it looks
  ngr trains that arent even disability compliant  cant even unfuck their brand new trains
  on the bright side we only have about five working ngrs actually had an opportunity to ride one the other night but just missed it
  bbut it looks cool this is cyberpunk as fuck also did you remember to check those digits 
  lmao
  tfw would probably be the girl
  can someone explain this post to me i feel needlessly attacked
  cant you guys simply kick them out
  you now remember the m6 toll  has there ever been a bigger fuckup
  the ecml is a cursed franchise theres too many open access operators leeching passengers and with first about to start services to edinburgh its just going to get worse
  its only grand central and hull trains which run on the ecml as open access operators though and both of them were tied for second most complained about rail service in great britain after vtec    grand central runs nonstop from london to hartlepool and to york and hull trains runs nonstop from london to well hull  i think theres some sort of other issue with the ecml if no one seems to be happy with service on it why is it that the wcml is all sunshine lolipops and rainbows and the ecml isnt
  why is it that the wcml is all sunshine lolipops and rainbows and the ecml isnt  it is worth noting that vt had double the passengers vtec did year on year
  which trains do have vtec yo
  i believe they just took over the class 43 hsts/intercity 125s with the mark 3 coaches and the class 90 and class 91 intercity 225s with mark 3 and mark 4 coaches and dvts    vtec were supposed to accept delivery of class 801s but then their franchise was ended early and was taken over by the government run lner these 801s are intended to replace some of the old stock which has been running from the 1980s or earlier
  pacers are in a horrible way a fantastic tribute to british ingenuity in the face of limited resources  uhhh lets take bus and uhh stick on some axels  its just one big way of saying yeah our rail system is aged beyond belief and sucks ah well
  its the axles the two fucking axles that make it a nightmare train    not only is it a nightmare to ride on its a maintenance nightmare as well it tears up the track on curves where the wheel flanges grind against the rails theres a reason everybody switched to bogies ages ago    if britians railways werent more fragmented than the former state of yugoslavia theyd have been pulled out of service ages ago for causing excess wear the only reason theyre not is because neither network rail or the tocs can make the decision to do so
  the main reason why the schienenzeppelin never entered service was down to two factors the first was because of the massive propeller which could have killed people waiting on platforms and the other was because of the axles which pretty much damaged the tracks it was tested on and also ruined the wheels on the axles even though the axles were unpowered
  heeyyy the turbo class trains which line do you live next to i commute on those all the time  whenever im travelling to london or something different train and line obviously im taken aback how quiet the train moves off cause im so used to the loud roar of the turbo
  absolutely disagree think the contrast of british livery on the japanese hst is lovely
    they are an actual disgrace a haa merrygoround coal wagon chassis with a bus body bolted on
  literally nothing wrong with it
  yeah but not much to say about it either way just sort of meh
  isnt that the point of this thread
  はっきり言うと今日も一日死にたい  oc
  anyone who hates foulberta as much as the quebecois has an ally in me
  exactly and thats why it gets a spot
  ah the official translation of this type of train model is this
should i buy a ninja 250 for 900
  its a good bike but dont expect to go over 50mph unless you are a manlet
  90s rigid mtb with slicks
    get one of these instead
  is this the install gentoo of /n/
  yes it fits the needs of most people who have no idea what they want in a bike
  when i first started frequenting /n/ they told me to get an ots
  90s rigids are better all rounders than otss
  will it be your first real motorcycle op and all you have is your learners permit if yes then thats the size you should start with its just powerful enough for normal street riding youre not allowed on freeways with a lerners permit but not so powerful that itll get away from you while youre getting experience riding stick with it for the first year or so and if you still want to ride motocycles after that then start thinking about getting something bigger like a 750
    about a decade or two ago the ots used to be the go to for high availability price to performance without being too antiquated nowadays its the 90s rigid mtb since all supply of trusty ots are gone too outdated rusted completely or hipster vintage taxed give it a few years and the 00s hybrid will be meme king
  there was a tripfag that invented the meme because during that time ots were expensive because of wanna be hipsters buying them for fixie conversions 90s rigid mtb with slicks was basically a way to get a cheap and high quality hybrid bike because rigid mtbs arent actually good for mtb now that decent suspension exists
  get a faggio
  i think mid level 90s road bikes still represent the ultimate value and are widely available in good condition in many places   6/7 speed indexed dt shifters aero brake levers maybe even dual pivot calipers a cassette hub     aside from missing the lowest hill gears with a nice set of tires  some clipless pedals its 90 as good as a modern road bike for only a couple of hundred dollars
  the 00s hybrid will be meme king  inferior to a 90s rigid mtb the frames dont ride as well and the components are generally lower quality
just post pics of train and stuff
sure is one big boy
  ok
excellent thread idea
  the powerful septic
the true lion
  aesthetic septa and their electrification
  alcos c636s were imo the most awesome six axle beasts to ever ride american rails if only they hadnt performed so poorly in their trial runs out west sp wp and santa fe may have ordered some that and the c630 reliability issues doomed the company
alco diesels looked better with high hoods
  its a shame really alcos s1 and s3 switchers were apparently very robust workhorses        alco diesels looked better with high hoods  i like both the same but i can understand where youre coming from
  based skytrain ill be sad when they retire the original cars they sound so good
  
    the fuck is this third rail in the loading gauge profile and a linear motor
didnt take this picture but i have seen the locomotive
  what the fuck is that
  more info
  those lrc cars tho
  train for ants    this is the stupidest train ive seen so far
  a class 111
  i believe its a class 141 actually
  they are essentially identical though  its still weird seeing someone else post irish trains
  i had a gf from dublin and visited many times    being me i learned everything about the trains there
whitehead railway museum
      where are you from anon  i live about 5 miles away from whitehead ive been to the railway museum several times in my lifetime from when i was a small kid to the most recent time being in march 2017 just before they started charging for admission to the museum  in 2016 i took the steam train from whitehead to dublin it took about 4 hours to do the journey since the train had to stop a number of times to fill up on water as well as wait for regular passenger trains to overtake at stations  i spent 3 years travelling frequently from whitehead to university up on the north coast and nir is probably the only railway system i know in detail
  i have a lot more of these pics
honk
  woah thats a lot of pics really nice ones too    im from toronto so theres really nothing like any of this stuff around where i live the irish railways are extra comfy even if a lot of them are just gone now i have a whole bunch of maps and pictures but it all kinda hurts now
test
  eh there were a large number of railways which covered a lot of northern ireland but they were dismantled after a report was commissioned in the 1960s parallelling the infamous beeching report in britain the railway which would have connected lisburn to omagh and to derry was dismantled and countless narrow gauge rail lines were also dismantled partly due to how few people were using them and how the bus and the car seemed to be far easier to go with than modernising narrow gauge lines    i must say though i prefer torontos public transport i was last there in 2013 so its been a while the streetcars or trams lets call them were pretty good and i understand a lot of the aging stock has been replaced with bombardier flexities they came into service after i was last there but i have used a lot of flexity trams in berlin  the subway was pretty good too especially the newer rolling stock which have connections throughout the whole of the train  i never used the go transit in the gta area or via rail but i did take a maple leaf train from nyc penn station to toronto union station i must say that i really did like that journey all except the part at the canadian border cbsa can go do a thing i find it hard to imagine that the people at pearson airport are somehow more reasonable than the people at niagra falls cbsa almost interrogated me because i flew back to dublin airport instead of a uk one  anyway i like toronto its a nice city with a lot of neat features like the path i after getting a souvenir i also decided to be weird and buy blue jays baseball caps i dont follow baseball much but if people wear yankees caps because its fashionable why cant i wear a blue jays cap
  took the enterprise train from dublin to belfast this past summer and it was nice im from toronto where everything costs more than it should so i payed for first class when i saw it was less than 100 dollars super comfy
  yeah torontos transit and north american cities in general are pretty good near the centre where all the tourists are coincidentally but as you get further away from downtown things quickly get really awful     once in some random tiny town we stopped in for lunch i saw a local dude in a maple leafs cap was pretty strange      good to see a fellow torontonian here i wish i had taken the enterprise to belfast
    r8 our rail systems
  looks easterneuropey
  i like that in the late 60s through the 80s all electric locos looked like the same box/toaster
buses need love too
  its disconcerting to see such a japanese design like that in notjapan
gtels for when you want to haul a 100 car train over steep mountain passes at 80 mph 
  the size of these things man
i will never let this thread die
taiwan railway accident preliminary report  if things werent broken then the accident wont happen  who are they trying to present the lie to
   i mean technically it is not wrong but they seems to be intentionally skipping the most important thing
hahahahahahahahaha
  yep morocco gets thetgv duplex meanwhile nimbys are trying to get california hsr to be stopped while antitax people are trying to also get california hsr scrapped because it wont affect them
hope status lost  why cant we have anything nice will it even ever get better fuck this makes me so mad and depressed at the same time
  already has rust stains on it
  maybe it is protective grease
  depending on the gubmint  start a company and do it yourself faggot
  have faith in texas central and jr central california fucked up hard but jr central can show us the way
  cahsr is well under construction texas central is nowhere close to that point
  why when even china and korea are just simply importing trains from other countries and then build on top of them
  texas central is nowhere close to that point  not true anon were essentially just waiting on the record of decision for the eis at this point    the only thing really still up to chance after that is investment  and both jr central and the japanese government have indicated a willingness to pitch in to that regard    so yeah they havent broken ground yet but theyre extremely close
  morocco is an african anomaly though theyre a developping country focusing on infrastructure and greatly expending their railway network theyre also helped by france in that regard which partly funded the hsr project they also were the only country out of the african union til recently and even tried to join the european union in the 80s
  cashr is tens of billions over budget and years behind
  but theyre extremely close  you have no understanding of planning processes in the us      you can thank watersucking almond farmers for that and its still cheaper than the alternative
    nimby niggers should be openly impaled on streetlights
  nimbys are trying to get california hsr to be stopped while antitax people are trying to also get california hsr scrapped  there is significant overlap between those groups
    california hsr brexit and the mexico city airport debacle are just ongoing proof that referendumbased systems are a disaster
        nnniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmbbbbbbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyssssssssss
  the hsr referendum has literally nothing to do with the problems and delays the project has had
  that looks more like a second hand tgv running on existent lines
fuck america
    oh please how fucking big is morocco    yeah that is what i thought
  give me a break faggot we have it better    why do you think muh train is such a big deal
  yeah fuck america for not blowing money on feel good projects like trains so poors can ride
  i was being dramatic i think muh trains matter because our country as much as i love it is cager hell the more nonautomobile options for transit there are the better
  poors dont ride hsr the anomalous cash maker of amtrak acela carries an insane proportion of business travelers poor people generally are not performing intercity commutes its for middle class/business people that being said when hsr prices come down as they have in china it enables poorer people to commute from further away into cities where the jobs are improving their wages
  even if its a second hand tgv whats wrong with that exactly if youre not already in the train business you might as well just consult the experts and use their stuff rather then reinvent the wheel to have your own special trains if i was in charge of building a new rail system in a country id literally just go to a japanese or european company and 100 adopt their standards dont bother doing anything original or that costs extra
  implying that releasing a deis isnt a big fucking deal  still no rod yet but well probably see one next year
  trains are white elephant feelgood projects
  is it coincidence that every country mainly some fucking third world latin americans usa and canada that screwrd passengers for freight are also the ones that is on a constant decline     i wonder
  i though that like the boston big dig and petrobas scandals they show that politicians have difficulty doing anything right      pure coincidence dont question it
  dont use words you dont understand little man
  if you take a train and/or dont have/drive a vehicle youre a retard most likely
meanwhile us in britain are replacing our high speed stock with brand new foreign designs weve had high speed stock including the fastest diesel trains in public service since 1973 45 years for our hellhole and the great united states cant run a single hst
  duplex tgv  the poor
  you have over 66 million people crammed into an area the size of oregon
  you have amtrak
  solid non sequitur dipshit
are americans aware of the fact that they live in a country thas is falling behind in almost everything related to quality of life serious question
  import the third world  become the third world  its fairly obvious whats happening
  im aware and i hate it im watching the country i love fall apart and it makes me so fucking mad people deserve to die for this but the average american is fat and pacified so nothing will happen its so fucking hopeless why do you think americans are losing it and murdering groups of people in mass shootings every couple of months we live in a broken society quality of life is only going to get worse but no one will do anything about it
  we generally tend to stick our heads in the sand and act like we are the best
  wow one guy says its true must be true doesnt matter that virtually no expert agrees read a book you fucking moron
  what is population density
  something you have in a large amount in many areas nobodys expecting an la to dc hsr so quit crying muh densootie
  something you have in a large amount in many areas  a large amount of mostly disconnected areas one city doesnt matter if its several hundred miles from the nearest other major city the nec is the only area that comes close in terms of having multiple large cities near each other and in terms of comparing to average western european population density every other region is well below that
  this isnt western europe its northern africa
  the connectivity between those areas doesnt matter you have planes for that the whole point is that you have those areas connected internally by hsr
  we just wanted a new better airport why do boomers feel the need to ruin everything reeeeeeeee
  wrong utterly wrong yet another american that has to be educated about his own country  paris 12 m people to marseille 2 m people 750 km theres a direct tgv connection  madrid 7 m people to barcelona 3 m people 550 km theres a direct ave connection  one could also mention the fact that theres an hsr from london to the continent paris brussels and iirc amsterdam as of recently where the 50 km tunnel under the dover strait probably cost more than a thousand km of overground hsr    there is no hsr for the following sub 1000 connections    nyc 20 m people to philadelphia 2 m people 150 km  nyc 20 m people to boston 45 m people 350 km  bay area 7 m people to los angeles 13 m people 600 km  austin 2 m people to houston 6 m people 260 km  chicago 95 m people to cleveland 2 m people 540 km  toronto 65 m people to nyc 20 m people 800 km  seattle 35 m people to vancouver 25 m people 230 km  miami 5 m people to jacksonville 15 m people 550 km  houston 6 m people to new orleans 12 m people 560 km  atlanta 57 m people to washington dc 6 m people 1 000 km  san diego 33 m people to los angeles 13 m people 190 km  dallas 7 m people to austin 2 m people 300 km    given a french cruise speed of 350 km/h 1000 km means a travel time of about 3 hours whereas a plane takes 1h 30 900 km/h of cruise speed but long take off/landing times with above an hour of overhead i accept that the plane is better for longer trips at least when it comes to time the train is still more convenient    there is literally 0 excuse to not have hsr especially given that north americans are richer than western europeans
  and as an extra heres a cool map to help you visualize how the usa are actually plenty dense
  being a prestige project without a verifiably solid business case is easily enough to override the population density issue the comparison originally made was between the uk and us read the thread
  fucking obviously the point is that literally only one of those approaches the density of europe that means inherently that all other things being equal the case is still harder to make literally everywhere other than the nec im all for funding this shit but there are not invalid reason why getting off the starting blocks is fucking hard
  cherry pick harder to dense fucking nigger its remains an indisputable fact that all of western europe has a much higher population density than the us even if you only looked at the east coast
  12 connections that would benefit from a hsr  cherry picking  do you want me to make the list of all sub 1000 km connections between cities of 1 m inhabitants in north america because theres going to be a lot
  given a french cruise speed of 350 km/h  its not this is false plain and simple
  320 km/h my bad the point still stands
  most lines in france dont come anywhere close to that
  define anywhere close because 300 km/h is very common i dont get why you keep in such denial even at the sad speed of 200 km/h 70  of the connections i mentioned would be competitive against the train and the car the irony of americans depending on the car but having 100 km/h motorways
  the comparison originally made was between the uk and us  no it wasnt and nobody would use the uk as an example for hsr anyway
just for further humiliation theres an hsr between helsinki and st petersburg and china has one going to fucking ürümqi in xinjiang    two enemy countries could agree to build an hsr between two notthatbig cities evil commies could build an hsr in the middle of the desert spanning 1770 km to reach a city the size of seattle    imagine actually thinking american public infrastructure isnt the laughing stock of virtually every country richer than mexico
  it is obviously some older train maybe just an ilustrative picture or the received some old units from france
  when will we get a hst from ürümqi to st petersburg
          probably around 2030
  they better make that standard gauge so you have high speed freight from china to europe without break of gauge
  china uses standard 1435 mm but russia doesnt on their nonhsr lines given that russia is economically chinas bitch though standard will probably win
    and there would probably still be the issue of slightly different shapes of steel tyres and flanges requiring a compromise for either side
  yeah lets just ignore what people want and do whats best for daddy government
  lets just approve a bunch of multibilliondollar contracts and then cancel them all after construction has begun based on a 3 voter turnout referendum as part of a hamfisted attempt at impressing nihilistic antigubmint zoomers
  do you even know what cherry picking means
  youve proven that you dont
  what a horrible waste of money passenger rail cant be competitive with air travel over that distance and level of isolation freight rail sure but thats not why this was built
  read the thread you fucking retard
  are you fucking serious right now you can easily look up with 30 seconds of googling the operating top speeds of french hsr lines most are not close to 350kph and many arent close to 300kph either why would you lie about such an easily disprovable thing
  what reality do you live in where american highway speed limits are less that 100km/h 104128 are the most common by far
  mind pointing out who in the chain of    and  was talking about the uk
  the chain of posts you injected yourself into started here 
  no it doesnt
  yes it does that is the reference that kicked off the bitchfest about population density and distance between cities    seriously go fuck yourself with a rusty knife
  kph isnt a unit and 320 is super common stop lying yourself look at the fucking map      air travel needs to die for the planet tho desu but i agree with the general sentiment although its not like 6 hours of train 1 800 km  300 km/h is that much of a big deal back in the day people would happily take a train riding 8 or 10 hours to go across 800 km
  why a rusty knife rather than a normal knife daily reminder rust does not cause tetanus
  that is true with the acela but the ne regional trains are really just a slightly more expensive mode of transit than fung wah for the jigaboos go and ride the 10pm from nyp to phi on friday night and sometimes you may find you are the only white in that car hence the hesitance of many to dump money into it
  bragging about class 801/2s
  youre forgetting about the other trains  included are the brand new caf made mark 5 coaches to be used with any pushpull compatible locomotive electric or diesel
    as well as the caf class 397 civity emus
      oh and not forgetting the stadler class 754/5 flirt bimode multiple units as well
the usa cannot into hsr because getting the proper right of way is too costly so our rail mostly has to make do with legacy right of way and rail from over a 100 years ago     cashr is being panned like air travel main terminals well outside the city centers track routes out in the valley for ease of land access legacy rail sections     look at japan despite very strong property rights and thought terrain they manage to get track placed properly mainly by tunneling straight through mountains and bridging over valleys     hsr in the ne usa is impossible unlessyou want to tunnel under everything every scum sucking yankee from dc to boston would want full market value for their property
      bragging about the death of the uk locomotive industry  bragging about bimode
  locomotives are mostly gone theyre just not up to the task of passenger rail anymore pushpulls took over when they could and now emus and dmus are the main passenger rail focus in europe    locomotives are switching to a freight focus in europe as more and more emus especially ones capable of high speeds 200km/h and above become far far more efficient for use in high density passenger rail  locomotives were doomed once the likes of the apt proved that emus were the future but the british tabloid press and the tories killed it brel was privatised and now the train building is owned by bombardier transportation who now manufactures bombardier emus and dmus like turbostar the electrostar and the aventra lets not also forget that bombardier also make the voyager supervoyager and meridian dmus which have already mostly replaced class 43 hsts theyve also made the sstock for the london underground and are going to manufacture the new tube for london    other brel facilities were taken over by abb and abb still make components for electric traction as well as rail electrification in the uk    ultimately youre the one whos obsessed with the brel of the 60s and 70s time has changed old man were in the future now its all about multiple units in passenger rail
  main terminals well outside the city centers track routes out in the valley for ease of land access legacy rail sections   pretty much all wrong the phase 1 major stations are san francisco san jose fresno bakersfield la and anaheim all of those stations are in downtown cores except anaheim which is in an area by angel stadium and the honda center that is getting mixed use densification through a series of development project     construction in the valley is physically easier which is why construction started there land acquisition has been slow and decidedly not easy    and the system has completely separate right of way throughout most of the system only for limited amtrak service to be integrated onto the new row after it opens
  i didnt mean the literal word locomotive i meant the fact that a generation of british trains is about to be replaced by spanish and japanese trains innovation is dead on our railways because these foreign companies are not interested in doing anything beyond building to the specification that they are handed fair enough but that leaves us unable to move forward
  spanish and japanese trains  the two countries with the most hsr
  hitachi are manufacturing their atrains in the uk and they have been since the class 395 while hitachi are an interesting competitor in the uk the main reason behind their presence in the uk is because they need to have a uk presence to be competitive since if they manufactured in japan and then exported it to the uk the trains would be subject to extraordinarily high import taxes and duties  bombardier transportation are the other ones to have a uk manufacturing presence but thats more because the trains for the uk need to be of a certain specification especially with loading gauges the electrostar turbostar voyager meridian and aventra lines of train are all uk designed mostly because no other existing bombardier model would really fit in the uk    this leaves siemens stadler alstom and caf as really the only foreign manufacturers which export to the uk thanks to the single market and the customs union thats the main reason why the likes of the pendalino and the various siemens trains make up huge parts of the faster uk services caf is dominant among regional rail but only with certain types of rolling stock ultimately the nature of brexit will affect train building in the uk while hitachi is already operating from outside the eu bombardier has a significant european presence which makes things complicated for them however unless there is something which excludes this this will make the modernisation of british trains much harder in the long term as competition from siemens stadler alstom caf and even other ones like pesa much harder making projects like hs2 and other rail modernisation have less of the competitive pricing when rolling stock becomes a question
  caring about the opinions of selfish lazy dumb boomers    we should do what is best not what most people approve of
  we should do what is best  if it were so easy to determine i wouldnt think there should be so much pain in the world
  yeah but not on the streetlights in my neighborhood desu
  mfw hsr from mexico city to queretaro before
  nah these are all brand new france made sure of it to keep the alsthom plants running same goes for the hsl half built by french companies its still not done tho the second part of the line is an upgrade tho
  why cant we have anything nice  niggers and spics they suck up and and government funding that would otherwise go to things like high speed rail or space travel its not entirety their fault though jews liberals and socialists are mostly to blame as they are the ones giving them all of our money
 begone anglinbot
  paris 12 m people to marseille 2 m people 750 km theres a direct tgv connection    as a fun fact to this the french have put so much money into their tgv system that the rest of the network is complete rundown shit
  still better than the american network
  mexico airport situation simply prove that corrupt people are gonna corrupt all the way to their root
  china building rail to xinjiang is no surprise they have absolutely control there especially for the segment of already constructed railway  whats surprising is that internal sabotage efforts have successfully ruined the line deliberately lowered its construction standard and thus making sameday trip between urumqi and beijing impossible      dont take their word for it remember that china and russia are also enemy and for this reason they cant even agree to build the short hsr linkage between vladivostok and heilongjiang  also if you follow the chinakazakhstanrussia alignment then i recall kazakhstan originally intended to complete a hsr between almaty and astana in 2019 but then nowadays you cant even see any trace of this project russia have been planning to extend its hsr west from moscow but the current plan is only to kazan and then only the first section of that in 1520mm gauge btw would be set to complete in 2024 with project funding up to 2030 then you can guess when will they extend that to yekaterinburg or even kazakhstan border and then you can also make a guess how long it would take to build rail from the two largest kazakhstan town to its national border when even the connection between the two largest town have failed to become anything substantial  and then internal planning in xinjiang i have see also put focus on enhancing conventional rail link to southern part of the region that there are plan to extend the hsr in northern xinjiang and toward kazakhstan border but the planned date was 2050        break of gauge along chinacis border is the most likely scenario not that it matter a lot because it would still be a dayslong trip that changing train wont discomfort much and with current technology high speed train units require regular check after running a fixed amount of distance/time that you cant complete the whole journey on a single train anyway
  le niggers suck up money  somehow the most diverse states are net contributors while 99  white rural states are kept artificially alive via federal agriculture subsidies  somehow the nec and the west coast have the best transport while the south sucks ass      not true its shittier than in the 1960s because they closed small lines but its a trend that started well before the tgv was a thing
  not true its shittier than in the 1960s because they closed small lines but its a trend that started well before the tgv was a thing    yes but that shows were the priorities are they could have upgraded some of the network instead of putting all money into the tgv network railfreight in france and spain is run to the ground as well  the us has a shitty passenger train service but when it comes to freight they are more ahead then any european country       le niggers suck up money    its true though who receives the most welfare    somehow the most diverse states are net contributors while 99  white rural states are kept artificially alive via federal agriculture subsidies    well guess who keeps the country going is wheat is harvested in the city oil minerals    somehow the nec and the west coast have the best transport while the south sucks ass    they dont need a nec in the south the distances between the populated areas is far too large its the same in canada does any high speed rail exist between toronto and montreal all you have is via using cn    the most diverse stats are also the most populated ones also the nec is government owned by amtrak they dont need to worry about making revenue
  laugth at america thread  if theres ever a prime example of projecting its threads like this
  wonder what wouldve happened had the japs used this logic back in the day and mindlessly brought uk tech
  while the south sucks ass  really makes me think
  not a fair comparison  british railways were always seen as a waste of money and something which should be shut down by the likes of the daily mail the sun the times and the daily telegraph all right wing news papers and bootlickers  the only time the uk actually attempted to innovate in rail technology was with the apt and that was killed off by the right wing media and the tories  if theres one thing which has done more damage to the railways in britain its the idea that it must always make money and that no one uses trains
  every fucking time    the dipshit hamburgler waddles in and mumbles from his suburban porch barely audible over the pickup truck traffic jam just outside his front door    we are just too big for hsr    meanwhile the educated masses from pretty much any other country in the world place a slender wellkept hand on the imbeciles shoulder coughing softly in the traffic fumes theyre not used to    no one is suggesting you build an hsr across the entire country    at which point the feeble greasy american keels over with sudden chest pains  a clear sign of an oncoming heart attack caused by his passive and sedentary lifestyle and the sudden realisation of quite how profound his own ignorance is    dont take me to hospital i cant afford it    at which point the international visitor gently pats the poor mutt on the back turns and departs the suburban warzone that the local indigenies call home
  i took a train from chicago to seattle and the deprivation i saw in rural usa was truly mindblowing    every single town had a mural pleading for the local populace not to do meth  abandoned homes and broken windows  basically looking identical to the shitty little russian towns you find out on the steppe
  america may be richer but frankly its full of americans
  every single town had a mural pleading for the local populace not to do meth  surly you must have taken a picture of one of these many signs right perhaps you can post one here
  not him but theres several dont do meth signs that ive seen in the more rural areas outside of metro atlanta heroine use has also skyrocketed among the well off white and asian kids in the northern suburbs
  lol no but thankfully the internet is a giant repository of information who would have thought         one example of many fuck you im not going to download the image and post it  i dont have the energy outside of making fun of your stupidity
  would you mind if i add this to my pasta folder awaiting a possible use in there
  british railways were always seen as a waste of money and something which should be shut down by the likes of the daily mail the sun the times and the daily telegraph all right wing news papers and bootlickers  it was more the faux conservative party than the papers and public but correct    the only time the uk actually attempted to innovate in rail technology was with the apt and that was killed off by the right wing media and the tories  apt was killed by the tories but the general seniment in your post was incorrect brel did far more than just the apt its just that apt was going to be the biggest thing that they did brel had the expertise it was fucked by money and nothing else    if theres one thing which has done more damage to the railways in britain its the idea that it must always make money  fucking this
  my sides
  even russia got hsr and it got the low population density of fucking nebraska there is literally no excuse
  disingenuous to compare all of russia with nebraska when russias population is mostly in a small portion of the country near europe
  kinda like the us then bucko
  this is a french train
  and morroco speaks french and arabic
is this where i come to laugh at americans i love these kinds threads
advances in hsr everywhere else  foreigners still seething and on the edge of a mental breakdown due to obsession with us    im not even a clapistani but this thread is genuinely strange and cringy since it appears to be full of nonyanks talking about yanks instead of simply ignoring that hsr challenged shithole
  welcome to 4chan
  sure go ahead man
  because youre the selftitled leaders of the free world
  whats 4chan
  youre    im not a burger and the uk hasnt led anything since 1945
  you lead the world in political suicide desu im praying for a hard brexit
  continental claiming that we are committing political suicide  t klaus hate speech is illegal bernhardt
  seething brit forgets that incitement to hatered is a real crime in the uk as it should be  thinks that somehow there will be any future with brexit  also forgets that the same political parties which want brexit also hate hs2 and hs3    sometimes i wonder if the uk really deserves the shit it gets with everything especially with the railways
  hatered  unsurprising that some mentally deficient ghoul on the continent cant speak english
  literally no argument
hue here how the hell can we get a better rail system  most of our goods are shipped with trucks far more expensive that trains
  privatize it
  that seems to be the case it is privately owned  a solution may be to have the federal government only own the tracks and be responsible for maintenance the government would then lease spacetime on the tracks to whoever wants to run a train and acquire maintenance/construction services for the money  the government could then subsidise passenger trains to get them rolling if thats the problem
nationalize it
  it is privately owned  that means that however more expensive shipping goods via trains might be its still cheaper and/or more convenient when you factor in everything private owners wouldnt choose not to upgrade the rail system if they knew that by doing so they could outcompete the trucking industry
  that means that however more expensive shipping goods via trains might be  oops i meant to write trucks not trains
  private owners wouldnt choose not to upgrade the rail system if they knew that by doing so they could outcompete the trucking industry    muh invisible hand
  roadrailing
  wouldnt containers be far better  build container terminals and transfer them between truck and train
  private owners wouldnt choose not to upgrade the rail system if they knew that by doing so they could outcompete the trucking industry  unless one of the industries was extremely subsidized to the point that a private business offering an alternative could only outcompete it in certain niche markets where the added costs outweigh the hidden subsidies    freeways dont have to make a profit private railroads do
estatizes it
  sort out the corruption and projects wont go over budget  bolsonaro and moro might be able to help that part
  how about dont vote in fascists for starters
  all these posts talking about politics and not the landscape of brazil    hey how do i make my floating rail system at 40k feet work    privatize it and get rid of corruption
 look mom i posted it again
  maybe commies should practice what they preach instead of enriching themselves from everyone elses money
okay now that we got the triggering of the snowflakes out of the way heres something relevant to the topic     brazil is completely shafted by its geography the population centers on the centralsouthern coast are cut off from everywhere else by cliffs and highlands its such a pain in the ass to build highways and railroads between them simply because of the terrain   combine that with the fact that only a small part of the population lives further inland on the continent and that the amazon rainforest is an absolute hell to build anything or even live in and its easy to see why the railways arent any better   i know two good videos on the subject        
  but there must be ways of getting around that  they already have these on the line from santos to são paulo to get up and down the incline  they work in pairs and can get 750 tonnes up and down the 104 incline
  hire all the favela dwellers to dig tunnels through the highlands
  but they dont even have passenger rail between their largest city and the other nearby large city which geographically shouldnt be that much difficult
 privatize it  is already private   nationalize it  is already nationalized americans bought a railroad ferroviária novoeste sa and were expelled   roadrailing   containers  trains of this type are inaugurated every year but two months later they are deactivated due to lack of demand  the best solution is to eradicate the brazilian railways
  yes it is exactly for the reasons i wrote in that post which the videos elaborate on
  but they dont even have passenger rail between their largest city and the other nearby large city which geographically shouldnt be that much difficult    it is when you have a massive mountain range in the way with no low passes to get through
  what about following the alignment of the br116 road
  they probably will do that but roads are far less sensitive to gradients than rails
  bolsonaro and moro might be able to help that part    thay are just two clowns who will sell to the better payer sooner than you say porra  more than this moro already sold his soul to the neoliberal market and the phony evangelist sects just watching the farse that lulas trial was can give you an idea    and no im not even lefty and yes i think lula at least endorsed corruption but the trial about the duplex was a dirty joke    that said i think that is very difficult that private business put any capital in extending the railroad net if theres not a sustancial benefit with almost no risk letting the state coping with the risk and later collecting the benefits is a constant behaviour in private business in latam
  a 53 line between rio and são paulo would be best to follow that alignment the mountainous stretches could be electrified with regenerative braking bimodal trains could be used as a stopgap measure if electrifying the whole route was too costly  kinda like were doing in the uk in east anglia and the great western mainline        these concepts could be scaled up to allow for doubledeck carriages if the loading gauge allowed it
      wot apparently there is a railway which already connect rio to sao paulo      is it freight only or
mildly related but why are there so many hues on strava being fat and riding front susp mtbs and trying to be my friend
  my understanding is that except commuter rail service there are exactly zero long distance passenger train in brazil
why fellow hue ill tell you how  literally all we need is an initial kick aka actually start building shit and youll just be able to watch economy take its course i remember one ibge study about the tav project showed that a good 80 of those interviewed did say theyd actually take the train if they could since caging around huezilian roads is a deathwish and planes can get silly expensive even here in the southeast problem is it cannot under any circumstance be done by the government like no way in hell not only was the tav nothing but a meme tier fake government job generator the actual planned lines were fucking retarded too take a look at the proposed belôsp line  almost 600km of rail and just 3 stations before getting to campinas thats pretty much refusing a wad of cash and screaming i fucking hate profits like im a special kind of autist who spends hours a day plotting railway lines on topographical maps and ive identified 14 different potential stops on a possible mgsp line dont even get me started on their plan to connect uberlândia to são paulo but not uberlândia to bh because fuck connecting places to their actual state capital   also i might want to add that mountains are a nonissue either plenty of river valleys that we can build on it only becomes an issue once you get to the rjmg or spmg border that you really have to tunnel big time under the mantiqueira but that would be what a 1518km pseudo base tunnel at best and much less if you hug br383 like shinkansen style small stretches of tunnel and bridge     youd be right were it not for efvm its a bad joke of a memediesel railroad though 660 kilometers or so and more than 12 hours to go from end to end only reason i take it once every blue moon is to visit my granny because only other options are to either cage through one of the most dangerous roads in the state or take a rural plane those are well known for crashing due to shitty pilots
  on brazil if you have a bike 99 chances of it being a cheap ass mtb 50 of it being 26 for the common folk who dont know the name of its components and 50 of it being a 29 for the tryhard boderline fatass hairy dudes that try to look smart and athletic by riding the same trails every weekend with other boomers and the occasional gay twink zoomer thinking theyre elite   they get hard for any little recognition a gringo might give them    all sporting cultures are fucked with toxic ghetto/street culture with the sole exceptions being martial arts and actual rich elite sports    tbrazilian
pointless bump
  image  that look like simply putting passenger carriage on freight railroad
  aanon i   thats exactly the case it literally is a passenger train on freight track it wasnt even double tracked until some years ago and best of all by law the passenger cars get priority since they now only run two trips a day but you can bet your ass that the train still stops because some cargo wagons are being shunted up ahead that and theres the 15 minute minimum delay all trips and i say all trips have some sort of delay  i just fucking want hsr already dammit
  please include ferroeste for paraná its the regions most important line for agricultural exports
  its just freight
  freight only but most of these railways used to take passengers in the past it was only when they nuked rffsa federal railway network in like 97 or something that literally all passenger lines disappeared at once rio and são paulo both got some of their commuter lines back but thats about it  only exception is  but thats dieselshit and gay

great thread op
what in your guys opinions would make an ideal city in terms of transportation and layout  for me its  super blocks  trams through main parts of the city  busses only for outskirts  light rail only has regional based lines plus lines to neighboring cities  stores on bottom residential on top  key market areas  underground parking lots  electric mail trucks  proper placement of wide roads  bike lanes can go through super blocks  my ideas may be shit so lemme hear yours
autonomous publicly owned selfdriving interconnected hydrogen cars everywhere    cages without the cagers
everything within walking distance
   super blocks  i disagree with barcelonas through traffic restriction
urban core  grid   building codes designed to encourage walkable neighborhoods  mixeduse zoning like japan has  mass transit with frequent service including interurban lines  cars allowed but all parking would be metered and expensive to encourage other modes  large delivery trucks only allowed access during offpeak hours with a special permit    suburban residential areas  excellent transit service  bike and walking paths like the netherlands  no onstreet parking of cars     suburban commercial areas  ideally deliveries would be made by cargo trams that could share trackage with streetcars  strict limits on the number of car parking spaces to prevent parking moats around businesses  operate a municipal delivery service that would operate on the model of a postal service making daily standard deliveries of goods from businesses to homes make your purchases at the store and anything you dont want to carry home immediately can be put in a standard shipping bin for delivery when the van completes its standard route through your neighborhood  this would dramatically reduce the need for individuals to own and operate large and heavy vehicles for personal use and minimize traffic and limit the need for and size of arterial roads
  oh yes keep going
  those are some really nice ideas
  maybe it would work better if it were more organic i guess
  or probably something similar to tokyos street usage
  really depends on the size of the city but in any case the idea would be to offer many good alternatives to car travel so that you would be discouraged from using a car on most trips     in any case i would want a city center either pedestrianized except for a few streets or with cars allowed at walking speed everywhere there would be a traffic hub adjacent to the city center with two or more main public transport arteries intersecting     below 50k inhabitants one to three tram lines busses biking and walking possible everywhere   50k to 100k extensive tram and bus network more than one railway station with frequent service you cant walk everywhere but biking must still be feasible   100k to 300 000k extensive tram/light rail network maybe a single metro line busses only for regional and neighborhood service   300k to 500k combined metro/tram network maybe one or two tangential tram lines 10 or more railway stations in the city busses for neighborhoods and the countryside   500k to 1m most traffic handled by metro city has to have a commuter rail network centered on it now trams supplement and feed heavy rail busses mostly irrelevant   1m metro everywhere metro ring lines around city center commuter rail serving both city and countryside maybe commuter ring line trams in feeder and interurban mode
  i like how you accounted for population and distribution
  cities below 50k absolutely need one railway station if not two for the 40k50k range where i live lots of cities starting from the 10k are connected to the light rail network going straight to the main city
   distribution  what i dont see this in  like is there a target people and building density by any measure          tokyo   yupcare much about connectivity we need to control cars and motor vehicles while keeping their vmt and bus optionally taxi service in mind
  by distribution i meant where he placed specific services    i also agree about keeping bus and taxis in mind while still limiting vehicles maybe tiny box trucks like a compressed isuzu elf should be allowed but restricted
  vacuum trash removal systems
  cities below 50k absolutely need one railway station  yes sorry i glanced over this in my post i took it as given almost all cities of the size have a railway station in my country usually even a few more in the adjacent villages   cities starting from the 10k are connected to the light rail network   oh shit you arent supposed to use nothing but light rail to connect to towns of more than 10k inhabitants     distribution    density  i have an enormous boner for midrise mixed use areas say buildings with businesses on ground level and residential units on the one to five floors on top of that   there can be a few exceptions to this rule but it should define the general character of the city
  everything you posted and no nonwhites
end your miserable existence right now
  i thought of something odd what if we put residential on bottom stores on top i know a nice cafe like that nearby me
  cargo trams  ive thought of similar for mail trucks certainly mail trucks and mail vans could partially be replaced by mail trains and mail subway systems just tack a mail car onto a couple of your subway trains
  just tack a mail car onto a couple of your subway trains  im retarded thatd thoroughly mess up schedules maybe make an entire onecar mail train for subways that yields to passenger trains itd still be fast not stuck in traffic jams
  cant we make tunnels under city for cars and shit
   cars  this meme every time
  i can see it happening in an ultra dense city with low available space but no real gains are found on the residential side while significantly increasing inconveniences and a less visible store front while gaining what a scenic view to drink your coffee id rather live in a place with a scenic view than changing elevation all day just to shop eat and cafe    besides most buildings have like the first 10 or so floors as designated retail/restaurant the next couple dozen floors designated as office space with the final top few floors for the top deck date night type high end restaurant    high rises suck balls anyway especially during severe rainstorms/blizzards/gusts with the building swaying back and forth its very unsettling
  hey i dont want get frozen in winter on bus stop
  european style layout american squares are ugly  metro service paid for via council tax and free at point of access for local residents and so reliable and extensive that neither buses nor mainline rail are necessary eases congestion and air pollution  dual carriageways linking outer areas well linked to motorways to other cities
  inner core  bicycle freeways with cloverleafintersections and roofs overhead  light rail with bikeracks  hsr at main trainstation  no cages allowed  ebikes allowed up to 25 km/h  goods are transported by cargo ebikes  outer core  bicyle freeway above main roads  other roads are shared with cars speed limit for cars is 25 km/h cars have to yield  only parking available is underground and expensive   weight limit for cars is 1000 kg  light rail with bikeracks  suburbs  shared roads  speed limit for cars is 35 km/h  no onstreet parking allowed  light rail ends at outer end of suburbs near a park and ride  weight limit for cars is 1500 kg  rural areas  shared roads  maybe trainstation    inter city transportation is archived by low tier hsr long distance travel is archived by verry fast hsr with verry few stops  obtaining a driving licence will get much harder and maintaining it require semi annual tests
  high rises suck balls  delet this ultra high density city centers is where its at i mean ive spent most of my life on the 5th floor but from the 2 years ive spent in the 15th of a 24 storey building i can tell you it was gr8
  no fuck that im not going to live in city where i pay for homeless transport  6 lane roads and 4 lane bike lanes maybe a tram  no subway or bus meme are allowed
  6 lane roads  having more than 2 lanes per direction is aids for attracting cagers theyd rather sit on wide highways if it means they can cage it than use a bit of physical exercise to ride a bike or a bit of patience waiting for public transport dont do that
  number of cars is limited by law and number of citizens  also roads should be retard proof otherwise traffic pollution gay coffin  it is possible to do
as much as i dislike things in most big cities today and would like some of the road in the ny grid to fuck off i am glad no one in this thread has the power to actually do anything and that if they did the city would simply fail
  3d city
does your country have a dedicated channel to post cabviews anons  help me find content im kinda new but somehow i love watching cabviews of places i wont be able to visit in my lifetime      
no specific channels for cabviews in australia but some channels have a lot of cabviews    tressteleg1  trams and suburban trains in melbourne also historical footage  sydney trains cab videos  does what it says on the tin  this bloke does mostly diesel videos and trucks but heres a cab ride in a regional train

will they be able to permanently transform the passenger transportation landscape in america any updates about these projects
  will they be able to permanently transform the passenger transportation landscape in america  no  any updates about these projects      
  1 3 4 2
  so you think all three projects wont success or do you think they wont make an impact
  no but from what i recall flixbus is leaking into the us they recently started offering trains in germany very likely that they will attempt to do that in the us as well once they catch a foothold
  4 4 4 4
  they already launched im the us but whats special about them
  4132    but really this
  if brightline keeps up its performance and momentum maybe
  the key part would be the orlando expansion
  cheap tickets but good busses
  i dont think prize and vehicle qualities are the two greatest obstacles to bus development in the us
  i read that the opponents of the texas hsr will be able to kill it when it the legislature convenes again next year
  and then to connect tampa and jacksonville
  that would also be something dependent on the performance of the orlando extension no
  but itll likely do well
      flixbus will either crash and burn violently or mess up everything for everyone forever within the next few years   their business model is basically nothing but externalizing cost to smaller coach transport enterprises and individual drivers they set the prices and schedules and the drivers have to do work overtime without breaks for shitty pay   the funny thing is that they havent even been making a profit for years now all theyre doing is offering low prices and buying up the competition so that theyll soon have a monopoly over coach transit in central europe and can set the prices as high as they want
  you can say the same for uber and many other companies of this type too
  thats true hermes and a bunch of companies that make food delivery websites are guilty of the same thing looks like this meme really caught on in the last two decades
california high speed rail is a failure building hsr only from bakersfield to merced is useless
  will they be able to permanently transform the passenger transportation landscape in america  if texas central and brightline are successful yes i do believe so this could signal other investors into making lines in other parts of the states to dig into the market especially with amtrak enforcing full ptc    any updates about these projects  texas central is still slowly buying land but all theyre officially doing is attending big meetings to get publicity
    youre misinformed so im going to revive a dead thread to correct it    cahsr is not building hsr from bakersfield to merced the bare minimum hsr plan is for 4thkingbakersfield per the initial operating segment the ios this is what was sold/bid to db who would operate full 220mph hsr trains on that route until the full build out from the new transbay terminal to anahiem    until that is built what will operate on the currently constructed tracks are the existing san joaquins chsra first made this announcement in their most recent business plan and its a practical move that will see 110125mph services which is at least legally not high speed rail only higher speed rail or hrsr this will continue until the pacheco tunnels are built _and_ caltrain sufficiently upgraded with passing tracks to allow for hsr trains    so either hsr only happens between 4thkingbakersfield or it doesnt happen at all either way the statement building hsr only from bakersfield to merced is useless is incorrect
future of american passenger railways  pic related
  either way the statement building hsr only from bakersfield to merced is useless is incorrect  well it is correct it just has no connection to reality either way the 99 corridor is a bitch to drive and several million people live on it this whole no one lives in the central valley meme needs to stop even if the project only placed hsr along 99 which its not itd still be serving millions of people and upgrading a popular rail route whose popularity is in spite of a 79 mph max speed and mixing with freight traffic
jr central established a new branch company at texas to work together with its existing branch there
  i thought they did that a while ago theyre the ones serving as technical advisors to texas central partners right    i heard the reason they stationed some employees in the us was because texas central could almost never talk to jr central due to time zone differences and viceversa
  the document said they established a consulting corporation back in 2016 mainly for providing technical support to tcp while this new integration corporate will be mainly to help them made different agreements with japanese companies alliance that will be formed in future for orders and such and if the japanese alliance is ultimately selected to build tcr it will also be responsible for subsystem integration testing and staffs training
ive been wondering on how tcr will manage to move the n700ss from japan to dallas/houston since they run on standard gauge the easy option would to run them on a freight line between cali and texas although itd be silly to see japanese trains running on american freight lines
  formed in future for orders and such and if the japanese alliance is ultimately selected to build tcr  hah like theres any doubt theyre gonna be the tech providers the deis specifically states the project will be using the n700 and both jr central and the japan bank for international cooperation are almost certainly going to financially back this thing if the eis goes through  the fact that the japanese companies got allbut locked out of cahsr is a big reason theyre so interested in the texas project they want to show up the euros by getting their project done first
  theyre not gonna run them directly on the rail even if they fit the loading gauge they dont theyre too wide no company wants to risk damaging the unfamiliar equipment theyre hauling by tugging it if they go by rail theyll load the train cars on to some flatbed cars and ship them that way if they go by sea the whole way they could just sail into houston    houston is a big port  one of the largest in the us i know i was surprised too noone thinks of houston as a port city but the numbers dont lie they could definitely get the trains in by water if they wanted
  eh thought itd be funny to see an n700s running on american rails but i had forgotten loading gauge entirely    yeah now that you mention it id imagine itd be easier to ship it directly into houstons port and you dont have the risk of people tagging the sets
  the fact that the japanese companies got allbut locked out of cahsr  yeah why was that with californias earthquake problem japans technology seems perfect
  thinks they wont fit the huge n american loading gauge  youre a dummy
  cahsra got smoothtalked by the euros into using international read european uic standards that arent compatible with unmodified shinkansen tech    the japanese companies knew that would drive up their costs and put them at a disadvantage to the european bidders so they lost interest      american loading gauge is huge     but its not 11 feet wide
    because nobody really knows what cahsr is going to look like until its done blending with caltrain and having diesel san joaquins use the finished track were not in the original ballot measure but both essentially make shinkhansen tech unusable unless it is custom modified at great cost also shinkhansens require bigger tunnels a cost which chsra is trying to mitigate as much as plausible        cahsra got smoothtalked by the euros into using international read european uic standards that arent compatible with unmodified shinkansen tech    chsra doesnt use uic they are still using aar plates this decision was made in 2013 when the decision was made for blended service with caltrain whose tracks are used by freight from 125am this is why chsra always planned on folding threshold gap plates to fold down as platforms have to be set back a few inches for freight cars to clear them likewise chsras wires are a few inches higher than uic for aar plate h double stack container clearance one of the reasons why sf keeps dragging their feet on the downtown extension is because the train tunnel under 280 needs to be dug out a few feet deeper for wires which means affecting existing caltrain service    not that i disagree with your points
    the issue is platforms stock shinkhansen trains have platforms flush with the doors but this isnt doable on the peninsula or la where freight trains would clip it    by the way see that concrete strip thats a standard caltrain platform notice the huge freight trains adjacent
    another shot platform heights in general are a big problem which is also why tgv duplexes are preferred since their doors are about the same height as the existing cars
    another image to demonstrate the problem this is also why caltrain is dumping all of their galley cars notice how the standard car amtraks superliners are the lowest at 18 as this is the platform height the san joaquins use it more or less means chsra has adopted a platform height no greater than 18 this is a problem when theyve already agreed on adopting a platform height of about 50 with caltrain    the solution is that chsra will abuse their station dimensions normal cahsr stations are speced to be 1400 long for 2x trainsets but because sf is dragging their feet on the downtown extension it was revised down to 700 chsra will likely build 700 of 18 platforms for the san joaquins and later the other 700 for 50 hsr trainsets as they move to actually start service     point being is that all of this is done to deal with american rail standards not uic
  but its not 11 feet wide  10 ft 8 in is the standard you bet that out west where there are few narrow curving tunnels that they can accommodate a dimensional load like that    if bnsf can move retarded long loads like windmill blades you bet some 11 ft wide niptrain will work
  right they could probably do an out of gauge load its not super uncommon  they just have to be careful with the routing     its still technically out of the loading gauge though
  what 11 feet is still only roughly 3352 mm    and 10 feet 8 inch is only about 3251 mm    i guess japan can actually get some of those mini shinkansen trains in
  that 10 ft 8 in just means unrestricted in interchange thats not to say that a carrier cannot easily accommodate larger loads i just had a 19 ft 8 in tall load that was 120 ft long weighed 260 tons and was like 12 ft wide come into my yard there was no issue routing it unless it was going to meet something else that exceeded the standard plate
  right an 11 feet wide load is technically out of loading gauge that doesnt mean they cant haul it they just need to make sure there arent any narrow tunnels/bridges and that there arent any other outofgauge loads that could collide with it    my main point was that an american railroad probably would just put the shinkansen pieces on cars and haul the trainset that way rather than run them directly on rail    to get back on topic brightlines offered a stop to the treasure coast and the meltdown is glorious    on one hand youve got the nimbys that are so used to getting their way advocating a hardline no because they still think they can block this    on the other hand youve got the pragmatists who see the writing on the wall and are trying to convince the nimbys to see logic and take the offer    the nimbys in typical nimby fashion yelled and screamed at the second group and called them traitors which only further proved theyre completely divorced to the reality of the situation
  why are people losing their shit about the treasure coast station youd think more stops the better or am i missing something bigger
  the nimbys are fighting the station because they see it as admitting defeat    truth is they lost a long time ago theyre just in denial about it
  out of gauge load  call it a dimensional or high and wide poindexter
  the other problem is that american rail is dogshit and texas central probably doesnt want their brand new shinkansens getting destroyed by being pulled halfway across a continent on eh it works quality track us class is plan on derailments
but yeah what i mean is can cahsr use mini shinkansen trainset that is compatible with narrower dynamic loading gauge

  even american high speed trains are bulky and shit looking
  thats not a high speed train
  what is it then
  a normal train that particular train never breaches 80 mph
  theres no such thing as american high speed trains
  a normal passenger train  never breaches 80 mph  christ what a godforsaken shithole america is      true
  well the train itself can do 125 which is typical for diesel trains but the track it runs on is privately owned and not maintained well enough for faster operation
    why are european trains so tiny
  and not maintained well enough for faster operation  the fec is one of the bestmaintained railroads in the us the 79mph limit in place between miami and west palm beach owes to the huge amount of grade crossings in that area not to any track deficiency the portion of the fec mainline past west palm beach will allow 110mph running once double tracking and crossing upgrades are complete
  i dont know what youre talking about that particular train is the san joaquins and runs on track only maintained to a standard such that only 79 mph operation is allowed
  being this dumb  79 mph is the max speed if there are no cab signals
  they only run 79mph because no cab signals  oh really well then someone should tell the fec because their entire mainline has had cab signals since the 80s
  misread your post thought you were talking about the fec not the railroad in your picture
  2 4 3 1 wtf is wrong with you
  small loading gauge  it comes with the territory of being the first nation in the world to have proper railways
texas central rail just got 300 million from japanese investors   
  nice
  thank you for being a patron of the dallas morning news unfortunately our site is unavailable to european union visitors while we work with our partners to ensure your data is protected    just brussels my shit up
  tldr/eurocuck tcr got a 300 million loan from japan and plans on repaying it the loan apparently is the last financial resource needed and now theyre waiting on the fra to finish the environmental report and other regulation permits to start construction
  us already has cheap buses in the form of greyhound and megabus if you are looking to get from new york to chicago you can do it extremely cheap
  thanks    also were leaving the eu in a few months
  only to rejoin within the next decade
  please no  itll be dead/stagnant by then
  too late its an inevitability
  nice    you do not know how long ive been waiting to hear something like this
    sncf continues to bitch and complain and not do anything
brightline just bought out xpresswest they plan to build and operate the line themselves    i wouldve never guessed this in a million years
  
      holy shit i guess this really proves that people want to ride trains in the us
  guarantee they fucking botch it
  would it be compatible with cahsr to enable through service
  brightline currently operates passenger rail service in florida between miami fort lauderdale and west palm beach and is expanding to orlando with plans to further expand into tampa    so they arent extending to jacksonville now
  hate shitskins take the flight
  so they arent extending to jacksonville now  i never heard once that they would build it to jacksonville only the plan to go to orlando
  tcr are shitlords for taking public money  how dare they attempt to build a railroad without gubmint assistance  what the fuck is wrong with sncf
  unless they want to secure their own row/trackage rights from la to the antelope valley theyll have to to provide meaningful service the only alternatives would be partnering with cahsr to sell tickets and have a seat change in palmdale or count on people to drive to the part where the drive gets easy pay to park get on a train and then rent a car in vegas neither of which are winning solutions
  isnt brightline buying up a few acres of land next to the strip so that when you arrive youre on the spot and dont have to worry about driving
  i have no idea what the latest from the lalv hsr people is the project has been a perpetual clusterfuck for most of my adult life i am however from the central valley in california and my dad lived in vegas while i was growing up and ive followed cahsr pretty consistently so im pretty familiar with the region anyways las vegas is likely the worst big city in america publictransportation wise they have a shitty bottom of the barrel bus system used exclusively by nogs and poor people and thats it oh and a monorail between two casinos so to go anywhere you either need a car a complimentary shuttle or a taxi the latter has become more popular with the advent of uber but if youre going to vegas for anything over than gambling which many people do contrary to popular belief exclusively using taxis is going to be expensive all of that is to say that without a massive change in the transportation picture of las vegas the only way to sell lalv hsr to nongamblers is to make it cheap enough that the time savings/convenience compared to a car offsets the cost of renting a car/taxiing not to mention offer a better service/price than flying speaking of which flying from california to las vegas is cheap as fuck one time visiting my dad my airfare was i shit you not 15 before tax that was to fresno so i honestly dont know what the market is like for other cities but i do know that with the sierra nevadas theres no world in which hsr between california outside of socal and las vegas is competitive with flying so basically for lalv hsr to succeed they need to have enough weekend gamblers and convince enough conference/convention goers from practically exclusively the la area maybe they can get customers from san diego too until then it will likely remain a neat idea when the economics get worked out figuring out compatibility with cahsr and where to put the station will be easy  tldr im not holding my breath
second quarter report from april 1 to june 30 for brightline is out    ridership  106090 passengers for q2 up from 74780 in q1 around a 42 increase  revenue  154 million from ticket for q2 up from 663667 in q1 around 132 increase  revenue lost  283 million lost in q2 up from 282 million lost in q2 around a 035 increase  gross profit  13 million in gross profit for q1 up from 590000 in q1 around a 120 increase    if anyone wants to dig up the online document from the municipal securities rulemaking board we can get more detail on the numbers
  how is gross profit positive if the revenue lost is much higher
  the revenue lost refers to net income and the profit referrers to gross income im sure someone else can better explain it but i think it goes something like this  gross income revenue minus the cost of goods sold not sure what cogs is in this case but i think its the ave price for one person to ride the train  net income gross income minus operating expenses and all other expenses such as taxes and interest paid on debt
    i believe he means    gross profit  gross revenue  revenue lost  loss    so that means that theres a 283 million loss in q2 compared to a 282 million loss in q1    so their loss has remained relatively consistent even as riderships basically doubled and revenues tripled     not a good trend so far but i still think its too early to tell whether its doomed to failure or not
  diesel or electric
  almost certainly diesel i dont see brightline going with anything but the siemens chargers and coaches they use in florida
  one reasons i can see to why the loss stayed about the same despite the increase in revenue is that the opening of the miami station probably added more operating costs in the form of additional employees maintenance etc  also does anyone know if brightline is starting to pay back the bond they took for phase 1 i believe it was either 600 mil or 11 bil this might be a little conjecture but brightline might be counting the money they pay back for the bond under total expenses    wed probably know for sure if one of these sites talking about it would link the document all we have on this is from a tcpalm article listing 13 million spend as general administrative and other and 58 million on salaries and benefits leaving around 108 million in other expenses left unsaid
  1166 passengers per day  11 trains per day on both directions in a normal day during q2  on average 53 passengers on board of each trains  yeah this is really bad    revenue 154m  not sure about operational cost but assume its roughly sane as lost plus revenue then it would be about 30m  that translate to an operational lost ratio of 2000  that is on the same level as lines going to be closed by jr hokkaido in japan
  operation lost ratio  i mean operationalcosttorevenue ratio
alright managed to find the msrb document with more specific numbers      ridership  106090 passengers for q2 up from 74780 in q1  no additional info    revenue   ticket sales  1143000 from ticket sales in q2 up from 664000 in q1 not wasting time with percents again  other  392000 from other revenue in q2 up 10400 in q1  total  1535000 total revenue for q2 up from 768000 in q1 most news sites must of only used ticked revenue when the q1 report came out  cost of sales  207000 in q2 up from 178000 in q1  gross profit  1328000 in gross profit for q1 up from 590000 in q1    operating expenses  salaries and benefits  5811000 for q2 down from 8951000 in q1  professional fees  2167000 for q2 down from 2368 in q1  general administrative and other  13048000 for q2 down from 13488000 in q1  depreciation and amortization  6521000 for q2 up from 4013000 in q1  total operating expenses  27546000 for q2 down from 28820000 in q1  operating loss  26219000 for q2 down from 28230000 in q1    other expenses income  interest expense  2224000 in q2 none recorded for q1  miscellaneous income  100000 in q2 up from 46000 in q1    net loss  28342000 lost in q2 up from 28184000 lost in q2    think the paints a clearer picture the biggest kick in the balls for brightline seems to be interest at 22 million of what im not sure they did manage to decrease there overall operating cost by 13 million minus that however so they seem to be on the right track but as  put it still not great for passenger numbers
  small error under professional fees should be 2368000 for q1
  that is on the same level as lines going to be closed by jr hokkaido in japan  yeah but their ridership isnt growing brightlines is    this is only worth panicking about if their ridership starts to plateau and theyre still deep in the red
  exactly i dont expect much until next year people need time to adopt rail as a real option for travel again
  european which means what  bongistan has a really tiny loading gauge but krauts and their protectorate have quite a wide one and probably could fit a burger sized trains  maybe except those super high autoracks and boxcars    obviously catenary mostly forbids double stacks    ex ussr has an even wider loading gauge and most of their rolling stock would dwarf us stuff
  and probably could fit a burger sized trains  yeah no you underestimate the size difference not even aar plate c which is basically the smallest loading gauge the us still uses would fit in the largest uic loading gauge
  i was in russia a few days ago and was i m p r e s s e d by their loading gauge  commuter trains have 33 seating  bilevel sleeper cars with two levels of berths on each level ie total of 4 berth levels
  european which means what  gc obivously
  commuter trains have 33 seating  more like 2525 it was designed for prehistorical thin soviet untermeches every time i seat near the passage half of mine ass hangs of the seat
  its designed for normal people youre just a lardass
so apparently the texas hsr is going to be designed by the italians salini impregilo    
  also renfe was picked as the operator    
    did texas central abandon jr or something or where they only intending to use the shinkansen rolling stock
  no way in hell they abandoned jr not after they just gave them 300 mill    i guess the deal was just for the technology because lets be frank here there was a deal of some kind you dont just give somebody 300 million dollars for nothing
  my guess is they dont want the project to look like it is some japanese attempt to invade texas so they get other international companies onboard also to counter sncfs complains
  not maintained well enough for faster operation  no they dont have speed limits higher than 80 miles an hour 130kph for the nonburgers because the fra has restrictions on operations faster than that namely incab signaling that class 1 freight companies are too cheap to install
  ex ussr has an even wider loading gauge  because their lines are mostly broad gauge lines and the wider your wheelbase is the wider your cars can be
  no they dont have speed limits higher than 80 miles an hour 130kph for the nonburgers because the fra has restrictions on operations faster than that namely incab signaling that class 1 freight companies are too cheap to install  the fec has cab signals which will soon be upgraded to ptc signals course its not a class i so your point still stands    i believe they run at 79mph on the current segment out of liability concerns there are way too many crossings on that part of the railroad    on the existing fec track from west palm beach to cocoa the speed limit will be raised to 110mph the max allowed with crossings for the new cocoatoorlando segment itll be 125mph because thats basically the most the diesels can put out    fun fact the fec will legally be able to run intermodal freight at 90mph thats 145kph for you eurofags between cocoa and west palm beach once the track upgrades are complete    i mean they probably wont but they could thered be no law stopping them from running 90mph freight trains on that portion just imagine seeing one of those monsters barreling down the tracks at abovehighwayspeeds
  imagine being so used to slow trains that one of them running at abovehighwayspeeds blows your mind
  brightline already runs at above highway speeds dingus im talking about a 200car long intermodal freight train thundering along at 90mph europe sure as hell doesnt have that
    i dont know why the us doesnt have more high  higherspeed rail already    updates  brightline     texas central  
  one day lads
  i dont know why the us doesnt have more high  higherspeed rail already  you clearly have no idea about the retarded passive people that are the us population those fucks believe any and every piece of bullshit you chuck at them
  nope so much of it doesnt make sense
  assuming we do get something resembling a high speed network would they really have lines that go through chicago since iirc there was something in the cities history about several railroads agreeing to have it be a universal terminal which is somewhat still true today
    why have a leg go to quincy illinois all on its own why not have a stop in madison wisconsin
elon musk rapidtransit test tunnel under la opens to public dec 10  it would be the more americanstyled high speed transportation right
  what do you think is going to happen to the one elon planned for chicago mayor rahm emmanuel approved of it but he isnt seeking reelection so im not sure
  none of that would matter since airline travel is so much faster even for east coastchicago distances    american hsr will inevitably be regional in nature
  that would be the ideal dream but lets step back and be a bit more realistic
  huh i thought musk have already get his approval there and all thats left are for him to actually start digging
  he does but something you have to understand about chicagos infrastructure politics is that a project isnt 100 confirmed until there are boots and machines on the jobsite rahm approved construction but he isnt running for reelection and i have a sinking feeling that the next guy will cancel it before the digging begins
  but when will they start doing works in chicago a few months ago they said the they can start digging in chicago in a few months
  chicago is a city full of delayed and cancelled projects so dont be surprised if our next mayor cancels the plans theres so much political resistance to developing anything here its stupid from zoning laws to over budget issues to permit problems to nimbys and rival politicians its actually quite astonishing when a new building or project is completed even more so when on time and under budget
  i was mainly referring to things like having a line say from st louis to milwaukee without having to transfer at chicago  but since you mentioned a chicago to east coast route i kinda think it only needs to be fast enough to get there overnight so you can leave one point in the mid to late evening and arrive at the other in the early to mid morning
  why not connect those eastern corridors while youre at it thats when it becomes really interesting
  so something like this
  no houstondallas corridor  get that shit outta here
  not connecting houstondallas  not connecting clevelandpittsburg  not connecting jacksonvilleorlando  literally why i get not connecting texan rail to cali rail to pnw rail because of the distance but all the shit i just named are right next to each other
  fixed your map your welcome
high speed rail is gay go back east eurofags airplanes are the future bois
    implying it cant be both    pilotfags boatfags bikefags and trainfags all have a shared cause against the cager
  enjoy your airplanes once transport methods are held fully accountable for their emissions
  relying on a finite resource  lul
  much better    see this is how you get a national hsr network it comes about through the confluence of a bunch of regional networks merging together yeah just about noones going to ride a train to miami from boston but thats okay because the real ridership drivers the links between closely spaced cities are still there to put it simply    the national arises from the regional not the other way around
  is there any reason to have a hsr line to minneapolis/st paul i mean the metro area isnt that big and its kinda isolated in terms of other big cities near by since iowa and the dakotas effectively have nothing of note to thats close by and while rochester might be considered big enough its on a different route then the preferred one  i suppose you could have it extend north and connect to winnipeg and maybe a stop at fargo or extend south to kansas city or maybe even tulsa and a possible stop at des monies but both ideas seem like a bit of a stretch
  linking vancouver  linking montreal  not linking toronto
  minneapolis msa still have like 36 million population comparatively winnipeg only have less than a million and about 2 million for kansas city  when considering a high speed rail line connection to minneapolis it should be 80 focused on the demand to travel between it and chicago
  the night train shall rise again
  most days i try to pretend toronto doesnt exist
  what about maintenance window hsr need fixed maintenance time slot unlike regular trains
  you are talking about a country that constantly favours freight over passangers giving them the middle finger always    the only way for redneck shinkansen to work is to bring actual japanese to work on it from top to bottom
  montreal would be connected to toronto and new york before boston there isnt even a train to boston currently
  night train use regular lines not hsr thats why they generate fewer emissions they dont travel at such high speeds
  but why not night bus then depends on condition of regular lines night trains might even be slower than buses and what about time consumption
  night trains have berths and beds so you can actually sleep without half the muscles in your body hurting the next morning night trains are usually not slower than buses in any case time is not of the essence in an overnight journey
  the only way for redneck shinkansen to work is to bring actual japanese to work on it from top to bottom  japanese bullet train operator opening office in dallas to assist texas highspeed rail    wish granted anon    the texas project is going to be a gamechanger if they can raise the money to build it it wont be politically watereddown expensive bullshit like cahsr and it wont be stuck using old pennsylvania railroad infrastructure like amtrak in the nec itll be actual real hsr
  night trains have berths and beds so you can actually sleep without half the muscles in your body hurting the next morning  only if theyre at least as comfortable than hotel beds which arent really that comfortable to ensure actual restful sleep can be performed  night trains are usually not slower than buses in any case time is not of the essence in an overnight journey  it depends like when it take 24 hours or even more for the night train between new york and chicago then its obviously too slow even when you considered sleeping and rest in it
  eh thats just their us company front its not like they are actually bringing japanese people to live there and work there
  so the corporate shell jr central set up in texas is called highspeedrailway technology consulting corporation or htec the fact they missed the opportunity to call it hitec makes me sad    one of the people i found online that works there is named hiroto sunahara this guy worked for jr central for 7 years and did highlevel civil engineering stuff ie project management another guy yuta hagiwara once again similair background worked for jr cemtral for 5 years primarily dealt with engineering shinkansen infrastructure except this guy seems to specialize in electric catenary and power distribution instead of project management    unfortunately none of the other 18 guys there seem to have bothered with linkedin so thats the only one i can pin for sure still while these people might not be jr centrals agame theyre definitely some of their bteam theyre serious about this project
update from miami the brightline trains run nearly empty even at rush hour now the introductory fairs are over and it costs 20 to go 30 miles it runs slow as fuck from running over blacks all the time    f
  nigga u dumb
  it runs slow as fuck  slow is relative    brightlines got a better average speed than just about any other passenger train in the us only isolated sections of the acela and maybe that one train in michigan beat it    the speed will be even better on the new sections 125 mph is basically the maximum dieselelectric locomotives can do anything higher and you need to look into gas turbines the bombardier jettrain approach or electrics the everyone else approach
bechtel will serve as project manager for the texas hsr  
  bus rides to brightline also take forever too since neither broward nor palm beach have metro systems
  i wouldnt say its a doomed project but it most definitely wasnt set up for success they didnt advertise it aggressively enough and the only way to keep hsr well pseudohsr in this case afloat is to have lots of people in it like damn lots the way they advertised it made it sound like its just another train for dumb millennials or old people which is not enough to gather up all the swamp hicks and make them ditch the cage also consider this  most hsr systems are set up between big business hubs or highly industrialized areas florida is neither of those its a tourist attraction full of rich foreigners who are only there to see mickey mouse or whatever the fuck  that last point is why i think that the texas project will work though heres hoping
  without orlando extension brightline phase 1 as it is now is just a commuter rail line
virgin group bought brightline and is going to be renamed virgin trains usa    
  brightline is saved
  hardly any significant impact
  if the rest of the public transport that connects to brightline isnt fixed   and by fixed i mean do a fucking low level format and start from scratch   no matter what you do it will still be a fucking sinkhole
  whats wrong with it is it that bad apologies ive been out of the /n/ loop for a while
  short answer anons are discussing whether a rail line is a success or a boondoggle based on less then a year of service  if you really want to stay up to date id advise checking this site once in a while   
  yeah whichever anon is talking like the projects already failed is jumping the gun massively    brightline had 48 ridership growth q1q2 and 50 q2q3 thats a good sign because it means they havent reached saturation the markets still adjusting to its presence and people are trying it out to see if it works for them thisll continue until the market settles and their ridership growth plateaus when that happens then well be able to see whether or not it worked out until then everythings just conjecture
  speaking of ridership theres a new document from the site for the october ridership    they carried 60013 passengers for the month and generated around 1 mil in total revenue  so thats around 1936 passengers a day and if their still running 24 trains per day thats an average of 8081 passengers per train
  thats roughly a 34 load factor according to an analysis someone smarter than me did on another site thats up from the 13 they had during the first few months but short of the 60 they need to break even    so as long as they keep having strong ridership growth theyre on track to meet it but thats the billiondollar question isnt it
short distance commuter rail line running at hourly frequency doesnt make sense anyway lets talk about its success only after the opening of its orlando extension
  is the 60 estimate still accurate they seem to be generated more revenue with less passengers comparing the results from october to the q2 and q1 here  1243837    q1 had 74780 passengers and a total revenue of 768000 averages out to around 1027 made per passenger served   q2 had 106090 passenger and a total revenue of 1535000 averages out to around 1446 made per passenger served   october had 60013 passengers and a total revenue of 1000000 averages out to around 1666 made per passenger served     granted this is mainly due to the increase in fares and other revenue like the advertisements/stores at the stations and the special event trains theyve been hosting but if this trend is consistent and depending on how much they need to make to break even it might be possible to calculate how many passengers they need to serve
wfaa channel 8 dallas released a really good article giving an overview of the shinkansen system and the texas project worth a read    
  bullet train is literally a giant rail gun that shoots the train off the tracks  thanks texas
   they extended the service to the north and its natural that people making longer ride would pay more
  and then they started charging for parking and raised the fares
where do you guys shit and piss when you go on 2 hour long bike rides
my pants
messican space shuttles but only piss im not a madman pooping is done at quicktrips
i piss innawoods  shit in my toilet before the ride
  what medical condition do you have that requires you to poop every two hours see a doctor
if the ride is short i shit at home before leaving when i do ultracycling i shit in a plastic bag which i then throw in the next opened bin i see shitting while riding is a weird experience
on tours i carry one of these in a bag with a roll of toiler paper  some disposable gloves     dig a hole away from water and shit in it then wipe and find a poop stick to mix the poo and the paper and the dirt together so it decomposes faster and cant be dug up by animals and then cover it all with the soil     always totally remove your pants and underwear before you shit so you wont get shit on them and give yourself enough time to find a good spot and dig the hole dont shit when its too late first time for me i learnt some hard lessons
  people doesnt suddenly get the need to take a shit
  see a doctor
  exactly unless your diet is terrible
  diapers
  my preride ritual is to drink a pot of coffee and then take a massive shit
  i make sure to shit before i ride ill generally stop at a cafe halfway through my ride and piss there
  who watches the bike
  on 2 hour rides i go with mates and they watch it if i go by myself ill bring a small lock that fits under my seat
depends on how much traffic and/or privacy is available in the middle of nowhere especially in prairie or similar i often just stop and piss without even getting off my bike just need to make sure that the right pedal is in the back     if im innawoods and theres a bit more traffic ill lean my bike against a tree and take a few steps to get myself a bit of privacy     if im riding near houses/people ill either hold it until i get away from them or go to a restroom at a public park preferred or a gas station
not pissing on the side of the road facing cars   plebs
  into his pants  
  either this or poor planning get all your shitting done before you put on your kit thats what your morning coffee is for after all 
  coutryside  if no loo is avalible some sort of bush or woods would work   city  us embassy and other kfc be aware some faggot location force you to buy some food in order to use a loo
  cornfields exclusively
his body doesnt automatically use the piss and shit for hydration and nutrition  imagine being a subhuman whose body isnt 100 effecient
  always totally remove your pants and underwear before you shit  i have more than once had to shit in public and the fear of getting caught is enough for me to just squat and wipe as quickly as possible im not getting my kit off to do it
  he doesnt take a shit birdstyle
having to take your jersey off to take a shit because you are wearing bibs  i mostly buy full zip jerseys now for that reason
  you still have to take it off though
  thats why i dont wear bibs
  please tell me you dont shit without digging a good hole and covering it     also what are you even going to do if someone catches you terminate mid shit and get shit on yourself and your clothes hell even if you wanted to escape mid shit it would be easier to do that naked than with your pants around your ankles     trust me man shitting naked is the patricians method
  piss and shit before i ride i am gonna ride hard enough that i sweat out most the water i drink and eat only a little bit so i wont have to shit until the 6 hour mark      i piss and shit every morning at 5am piss again around 930 piss again around noon then when i get home at 430 and once before bed    get your diet in order the only time mine varies is when i get sick or eat something that wasnt cooked properly
  but its easier to take off slide the straps down and then put back on dont have to end up taking the helmet off too
  i dont  take a pee before the ride and a big one after getting back home works great with 4 hourslong rides and up to 6 750ml bottles of water in the hottest days and poopoo only happens in the evening so its never an issue
i dont understand how you people can feel the need to shit on rides peeing i understand but shitting come on people youre participating in a highintensity exercise that pretty much shuts down or slows down your gi and urinary processes though sympathetic override yall need to pedal harder forreal
  have you ever tried them
  ive got a pretty solid party bladder and since my longest bike rides dont really go over 34 hours ive never had to stop to take a piss  also this is my first time noticing this board why is it under japanese culture
  trains
  are trains japanese culture
  look up densha otaku
  they just arent actually exercising it must be a leisure ride as a former runner i and some of my teammates have had the uncontrollable urge to shit but that passed for me in about two weeks ive never had to shit mid ride unless i didnt shit beforehand
    i think not having to shit while running is a little harder to tackle though the running movement in itself and the constant down/upward forces just make the human body want to dump everything out running requires a little bit more planning than cycling imo you have to shit before hand and/or not eat like 2 hours prior to a run and consume slow glycemic index foods prior or during
piss  not difficult to find an appropriate tree or whatever if its a very long ride ill probably stop for a meal half way out and take care of it then    shit  ive only felt the need to do this once fortunately it was a mtb ride in the woods i moved away from the trail squatted down behind a tree and evacuated my bowels to wipe i used some old mans beard that was growing nearby the only thing i ever learnt from bear grylls i dont carry a trowel or any similar implement so i covered up the fresh mess with a heavy flat rock the whole experience made me realise just how much of my life ive spent in immediate proximity to the sophisticated infrastructure of civilisation namely plumbing
  you know you dont need a trowel to dig a hole you could have dug a hole with that rock instead or your hands and its likely someone will move the rock and have to deal with your shit thats not cool man
  the rock was too big to dig with on what basis do you suppose that it is likely someone will move the rock before my faecal matter is fully decomposed
  ive encountered human shit so many times outdoors and its fucking horrible im sure every one rationalized how no one would find it theres no good excuse for not digging a decent hole     you were new to this so its understandable but next time please be responsible
  i wish i had that kind of anal power
usually dont get that far society that i cant wait to get to a store or something with a bathroom to shit pissing either also in a store or elsewhere if its more convenient and i can get away with it
  trains as a hobby require autism strong enough that you become honorary japanese
  nah i just plop it on top if im unprepared enough to need to shit in public then im unprepared enough to have a trowel otherwise id dig a little hole and just put on my rain poncho so noone could see what was happening underneath even if they walked by
  in my kit
  ditch
  always totally remove your pants and underwear before you shit    kek you were that fat little faggot who always dropped his pants to his ankles at the urinal in elementary school werent you
  this i rarely need to poop on ride and when i do its never so urgent that i cant make it a few more miles to some kind of business or church or some other building with a bathroom if you can find places to refill your water bottles on a long ride you can find a place to poop
  i do road cycling ive done 4h rides at a high pace and didnt have the need to pee hurting and sweating too much

tfw in the future people living under the peril of global warming will see cyclists as enlightened ones ahead of their time and cageboomers as idiots the same way we look at flat earthers today
maybe but global warming is mainly caused by industry and not wasteful citizens
earth is flat
  love how some people pretend people and industry to be two completely separate entities
  yeah but the root cause isnt that dale drives an f150 to work but that international companies are offshoring factories to third world countries with no environmental regulations
  its a battle on all fronts and all causes major and minor alike must be tackled dale may not be a measurable problem but ten million dales are people must reconsider their lifestyles and no amount of blame shifting is going to take that responsibility off their shoulders    this aside individuals are dotted along and situated at the end of every single industrial chain industries and corporations pollute because people are indifferent about it how often do you hear ive stopped buying their products because they pollute too much from people never thats how often
  i get the sentiment but even as a collective regular folks still make up a minority of the issue  its unfeasible to expect people to be able to research the carbon footprint that goes into the products they buy and corporations cant be trusted to act environmentally friendly at the expense of profits so they should be regulated
  ima nigger
  a collective of people acting in an ecoresponsible way will give politicians the courage to make more sweeping changes aimed at industry
  instead of trying to force the population to change why dont they just change the system itself    like encourage the building of nuclear reactors and use the excess energy from those to manufacture hydrocarbons directly from seawater this could then be used as a carbonneutral input to our current economy or even be used to remove carbon from the atmosphere and put it back in the ground
  nukes are scary xd
  lol no they wont but keep dreaming kiddo
  maybe there are lots of factors in global warming including human greenhouse gas emissions and other major factors such as fluctuations in the suns energy output and climate change is a slow hard to predict process that has occurred continuously throughout the history of this planet and believing that humans are in control of the planets climate is hubris
  i already see cyclists like that they generally have an aura of coolness to them  unfortunately i have to use a car for my job and a big one at that  my land is also completely surrounded by the neighbours guard dogs and i cant set foot or bike wheel outside without getting mauled
  zelda got fat
  thats link you retard
  just catering to their audiences
  im in the same boat unfortunately i really used to like dogs until i moved out here
  bikes and cars arent even equivalent modes of transportation its like saying that in the future people will see pedestrians as enlightened and motorists as idiots also most cyclists are still consumers of products that produce tons of pollution during manufacturing
  falling for the bait this hard
  they will see motorists as part of the selfish generation for sure
  thats why you influate politics and vote and work as a researcher instead of some apple marketing team employee im living in a suburb apartment and pay attention to what i do im pretty sure my carbon fpot print could be calculated as negative everybody could live on similar ethics and principles than i thats why im sure the hope isnt lost     btw its funny that if youre diet is meat heavy and environmentally destructive it might be better to even ride a small petrol eco shit box than ride youre bike thats due the need for increased energy and nutrient intake d  im on based vegan diet of course
  please stop repeating this tired lie billions of humans with an enourmous amount of energy output are changing the planet any species with advanced enough technology eventually triggers something like this we just have to hope we can survive the worst effects
  billions of humans with an enourmous amount of energy output are changing the planet  of course we definitely are having a major effect on the environment the question is how much of climate change are we responsible for and how much is external factors and how will the planets environment respond to climate change there do seem to be some self regulating features built in i definitely think its worth studying quite a bit but im very hesitant to believe what all the alarmists are saying because so far they have been very off with their predictions and the planet is such a complex system that i dont know if it really can be modeled accurately
  even if youre highly sceptical about scientific consensus isnt the fate of the planet worth considering like a pascals wager situation
  not wasteful citizens  average car produces about six tons of carbon dioxide a year  average american produces about 20 metric tons a year  just by existing as a human being in a an industrialized country you are contributing to the problem  clearly you can limit this by being a bit more conscious though using less fossil fuels
  believing that humans are in control of the planets climate is hubris  but i dont believe that believe rather that humans are simply shitting the climate up through their arrogance and wastefulness  not exactly hubris
tfw future humans will retroactively punish all noncyclists in the past
  regardless of whether global climate change is a permanent or temporary thing do you really think this woman is going to ride a bicycle to her evening event lol no she needs to ride in a car or some other conveyance that wont spoil her dress and makeup i suppose we could go back to horse and carriage but civilization would have to fall pretty far for people to resort to that or do you expect an entire team of servants to be pedaling furiously to get some 500 pound carriage 20 miles each way to the venue this fine lady is expected at lol nobody is going to sign up for that unless our entire civilization falls into utter barbarism    youre clearly and objectively one of two things op youre either very young and very naive and actually believe this nonsense youre saying or youre just another troll posting silly unbelievable bait which is it because theres no way any sane rational intelligent person could actually believe the nonsense youre posting if you actually believe what youre posting then its time you grew up and came into the real world with the rest of humanity if its bait then youd be funnier if you posted blimptrain to be quite honest
honey i think the baby is coming its time to go to the hospital my contractions are 5 minutes apart  no dear we cant ride bikes there im about to have a baby you need to get us a car why did i ever let you talk me into selling our car  call uber or an ambulance or something honey i need to get to the hospital now  so much for a carfree lifestyle lol    you guys really need to grow up
  yes goy own a car for a hypothetical event which wont happen without your knowledge and will at most only happen a few times if at all
its temporary  its only a few thousand years m8 deal with it  its mostly natural  its already bad lets just shit things up more  fucking boomers
  labor often doesnt start until considerably after the water breaks you fucking virgin and you can always call an electrified ambulance
  oh noes i sat in a car once that means im now and forever a cager and cant possibly ever go back to a carfree life
  true climate science is weaker than many other sciences specifically due to how fucking complex all the heat/mass/fluid transport phenomena are and yes there are loops within loops within loops one thing to worry about if you have familiarity with control theory is 1 the more energy in the system the less stable and 2 when systems go unstable its very hard to stabilize them that is a major worry basically the climate goes unstable and oscillates we die until it settles at another stable point     however we know that co2 levels are at their highest in 800000 years and climbing we know that human activity is the main cause also rapid shifts in climate give no time for adaptation thats bad its been studied quite a bit the best models and experts say shit is gonna hit the fan and we cant wait any longer what more do you need this is the only time for action unfortunately
  hello 53 year old boomer how are you today
  derp but it was cold today
he fell for the science jew
  he thinks hes so fucking important that he rates an ambulance for his fat ugly wife  lol he thinks any woman will have him in the first place  guess this doesnt apply to you after all
  attempting to sidestep the issue with nonsense  underage b please leave
  botw is a shit game
  how could you calculate co2 level 800 000 years ago it is definitely not human activity   climate oscillates naturally even before hoomans ever appeared
  it sure would be nice to have a climate where hoomans could exist if natural fluctuations are going to screw you over
  but it is most likely the case
  seething
  hooman  taking climate science advice from a ferengi
  yes it oscillates but never this fast this rate is unprecedented in the earths entire geologic history regarding co2 levels scientists use ice cores in massive glaciers to find representative air trapped in them     take away we know the time history of co2 levels climate never naturally changes this fast humans have changed and will continue to change the environment around them in very significant ways
  just gotta wait 80000 years until it gets better lmao    t boomer
  voting doesnt change shit the capitalist system must be overthrown in order to stop pollution and you wont get that by voting for another democrat multibillionaire
there are people who still believe in the cult of climate change
  based    capitalism is all about externalization of cost and most cost is externalized to nature no matter if its the rainforest factory farm animals the air around us or the planet itself they cant be saved without overthrowing capitalism
  its not externalized forests and animals and shit are privately owned by individuals you moochers just want the free positive externalities without paying for it
  do you see anyone paying for the nutrients their forests and crops pull out of the ground do you see anyone paying for the air their livestock is breathing do you see anyone paying for the co2 they put into the air    no tons of ventures benefit off free access to resources
  moocher  randian detected opinion discarded
   my carbon footprint could be calculated as negative    if you live in the us im sorry to inform you that your carbon footprint has a base figure you cannot change because it includes infrastructure and services of the us the usa generates 20 tons of co2 per capita and year     in 2011 the us citizens contributed with 21 to that figure the rest is industry commerce and transportation meaning there are 4 tons of co2 emissions per capita that you can directly influence    16 tons of your emissions are out of your reach you cannot claim to not have any connection to them since you use your countries infrastructure services and profit directly or indirectly from us industry and commerce not to mention military that guarantee financial and social stability in your country    source  
  co2 emissions guarantee financial and social stability
  a noncarcentric lifestyle is impossible because sometimes you might need to make use of some reasonable lowcost contingencies i mention in my own post  is that what you were trying to say
  aside from six inches of sea level rise per century global warming is a net positive for humans  inb4 muh hurricanes  ironically mostly not affected by average global as shown by the recent stagnations with moderately greater strength no reason to not be responsible though
  no its not you fucking moron
  im yet to see anyone provide a source for that quote at this point im pretty much convinced its fake
  you know you misanthropes really should just admit youre misanthropes and join the rest of the human race instead of fighting it you might even get a girlfriend someday asis youre going to end up that weird guy who always sits alone muttering to himself about shit nobody understands
  china  ftfy
  people still think nuclear is dangerous    sadly fukushima kinda fucked us on that one people dont understand the distinction between old and new reactors
  the main reason we have accidents with nuclear power is mismanagement and poor decisions along with bad reactor design there are ideas ive heard and read about for reactors that are much more inherently safe of course if we keep making advances in fusion technology then the point will be moot fusion power should be orders of magnitude safer than fission power
  please dont reply to my posts

one highranking boeing official said the company had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit crews due to concerns about inundating average pilots with too much informationand significantly more technical datathan they needed or could digest    this is a beyond idiotic explanation of why boeing would conceal a potentially fatal flaw in its flight control software from pilots unfortunately the statement from this moron does not surprise me this is the new boeing where the ability to spin is what gets you on the path to being a highranking boeing official i dont say this as a casual observer
if it is boeing  im not going  if it is airbus  i better take a normal bus    i guess i have to design my own airliner
  why dont they make the whole plane out of the airplane food
  lol sure shit doesnt sink
  its called sunk costs you design a system and then you do an analysis of the various possible failure modes their effects and the procedures the crew will have to take to mitigate them turns out your design was fucked but its too expensive and too late to go back to the drawing board    i used to work there too many chimpanzees cranking out bullshit ideas and the testing/certification was only done after the fact mainly to generate faa appeasement documentation
  you think were going to see 737 max order cancellations if boeing says that this is totally ok  i know a number of airlines were already planning to swap over from 737900ers to a321lrs primera air went bankrupt so theyre not going to receive any a321lrs but norwegian air shuttle and a few others still have orders  itll be interesting to see if airlines like ryanair keep with the max even after this incident
  just fly bombardier like all the cool kids
  dont you mean the brand new airbus a220
  meh not c919 masterrace
i wish they still made dick shaped airplanes
  cringe
  why did you post an a220
    if you put a mercedes benz badge on fiat it becomes mercedes benz  thats not how it works kids airbus did none of the design manufacturing assembly or testing
  i mean considering that bombardier aerospace in europe formerly shorts brothers has been manufacturing parts for airbus for years long before the a220 well they were more smaller parts which would be used in airbus factories but these were precision machined parts which were made by shorts before being shipped to bac/bae aérospaciale or daimler aerospace for assembly in an airbus of some kind bombardier aerospace still makes airbus components in the shorts facilities
  imagine flying on plane that was designed by /g/ and /n/
  and assembled by /diy/
  exactly bombardier makes stuff for airbus not the other way around
  if youre unable to digest technical documents you shouldnt be flying a 737 professional pilots arent ga pilots     this boeing corporate turd sounds like hes got his head up his ass like most suits do and his fuckhead attitude got people killed    cunt needs to go to jail
    id pay to see that
  i can make a logo
  id pay too to be honest i want to have riced gentoo on pfd
wait a moment do airbuses already use gentoo with riced lxde
    aircraft spontaneously explodes  experts baffled
  no it is ok it is kerosene spray system in order to keep pax in place
good i hope they sue the shit of boeing plus in the process i hope their fucking stock plunge into the abyss   they deserve it 186 souls lost because they forgot to add few lines of extra info on the manual fucking idiots
  and two extra lines in firmware  now i think that airbus is indeed superior since you can turn off all shit in one push off a button and there is no meme feel system
  airbus literally saved bombardier without airbus the cseries has a 300 tariff in the us bombardier only builds in canada airbus builds it in the us and is exempt from the tariff
  airbus has factory in us what are they doing there
  its a factory in mobile alabama  it originally only assembled europcopter aircraft but when eurocopter was rebranded into airbus helicopters and eads was restructured into airbus group the factory was looked at again  the facility now assembles a320s a321s and a319s in the us this avoids import tariffs but also means that a320 orders for us carriers can be fulfilled at a us plant with a shorter waiting list than one from hamburg or toulouse  there is another facility in tianjin china which can also manufacture a320 family aircraft similar reasons for its existence there though the tianjin plant was opened specifically for a320s while mobile had previously made helicopters before fixed wing aircraft
  no when the fcas detect a faulty reading it discards it unless it comes from the main three gyroscopes on which it automaticly closes down the autopilot and turn into alternate law     this is something airbus has in place since the 90s
  even better power of german engineering  but how do you turn off protectionfac press button on overhead panel or somewhere in breaker panel
  autopilot goes to offfull manual otherwise its passive
  ok but what about flight envelope protection what pilot have to do in order to be enter alt out story l direct law
  has to do in order to enter  fix
  fuck alt or direct law phoneposting sucks
worst vehicle that society idolises except zeppelins im going to say the lbscr e2 shunters no where near enough coal to do anything beyond shunting and idolised because of a show for toddlers
ive seen far more people complaining about the e2s than people who unironically like them
ill just leave this here    
  no dear god no you evil son of a bitch
dur tomas bestest steam loco ever  toomas can win every rarce
its a really pretty looking engine though
  why am i laughing
  go watch this guys channel its truly how he acts   and his creepy meat ups with kids   
the porsche suv the vehicle that says i have too much money but instead of buying a sports car im buying family car get out of my road you cheap sedan plebs i dont know anyone who owns one of these and i doubt i want to know the kind of bourgeoisie scum who would    also just suvs in general
  what the fuck did i just watch
  its not like sports cars make any sense for the great majority of sports car owners either
      lets step right into the cringe
  escooters theyre shitty toys but better streets advocates love the taste of corporate dick too much i guess    the macan/cayenne are basically i want a miata rf or boxster but muh wife ive driven a macan and its gts variant and it was quite nice for a suv steering was responsive and decently weighted braking was good although a little too much initial bite the gts was better in every way way too many buggy nannies though and the car was too isolated inside for my tastes the isolation meme is the biggest problem with modern cars if my 2017 miata is a 10/10 the macan is around a 6/10 the gts a 75 or so i cant say that the gts is worth 40k more than a cx5 tho
  something only a mad man would make showing how thomas and his friends were actually fucked up experiments by an ex3rd reich scientist and a money obsessed lunatic oh and theres a sequel featuring a giant monster made out of everyone who died in the last video
  i prefer the smaller luxury crossover/compact suvs desu macan gla250 ux200 rdx etc more space to put shit than a sedan still have sports coupelike performance better gas mileage and more fun to drive than the massive pickups and regular suvs and they sit high enough that i dont have to contort to get into them
  at least theyre sometimes pretty and can go super fast while the suv can only carry the suburban soccer mom and her awful kids
  badgwhores with families especially for rich women only good thing about this thing is that it gives porsche money so they can do fun stuff like racing
some new fag locomotive enthusiast really want to build a new leader because it was unique  hope you like cremating the fireman   not the joke one
  i must remind you op that if it werent for shows like thomas  friends the younger generations of railfans and railway modelers wouldnt have any interests in trains at all    its dismissive opinions like this that turn away any young person interested in the hobby instead of using that interest to further their curiosities about how railways worked back then and now
  youre very silly if you think thomas  friends is the reason any adults are interested in trains i didnt even care much about the trains as a kid it was just a good kids show what got me into trains was when i moved from the regional town to the big city and started getting around on trains all the time i loved the mobility of getting around fast without a car and getting around further than my legs could get me on a bike and i loved the sounds of electric motors revving up and down even the clack of rail joints did i ever think of thomas the coal rolling engine nope
  youre very silly if you think thomas  friends is the reason any adults are interested in trains    he literally said younger generations as in kids and hes right thomas was pretty much why i was big on trains as a kid i got shown the movies but wanted toys so my parents got me the wooden brio train set with the thomas trains and i loved the shit out of that and got to where i wanted to ride trains anywhere i found them look at models in train shops back when they were more common and so on for a country that has fuck all in the way of passenger trains that people can experience first hand thomas is a great gateway for kids the only thing better would be if they could ride euro or japanese trains riding the japanese rail network after i was an adult and could afford to buy the models got me to get into the hobby but i likely wouldnt have thought twice about it without the thomas set and everything that lead to from my childhood
  i just took issue with how he said  wouldnt have any interests in trains at all  the generalisaton hes making is that everyone is like you were not all though as i would like to point out
  thomas is exactly the reason i am interested in trains now and was  as i am sure is the case for others  actually quite enlightening in how many different variations of locomotive there can be    and to counter op i actually find the e2s very boring because of thomas hes so overexposed in the series that it feels to me like the ultimate plain normal unremarkable steam engine i do like tank engines in general but i much prefer saddletanks or panniers
  i doubt it kids are naturally fascinated by trains and this is why thomas is so popular not the other way around
may i nominate electric skateboards      you are spot on many of my friends own these stupid things even going first gen if they cant afford them new just for the image
    if it wasnt for thomas and friends this wouldnt exist
  
  so what theres a lot of locomotives that dont get any attention and have been lost even to the history books its nice that a niche class has something of value to its name    and without thomas a lot more types of locos would be unknown to most like pic related
  literally any suv
  everyone except soccer moms hates suvs and soccer moms
            have some emotional whiplash
what is some advice you can give to a poorfag looking to get a bicycle i dont care about brands i just wanna know what youd look into for a sturdy but cheap bootleg bicycle
90s rigid mtb
bootleg bicycle
90s rigid mtb
  sturdy  booleg  pick one of the above only
  op just stfu and buy a used namebrand bike off craigslist
use the fucking catalog and find /bbg/  bike  buy  general    then delete this thread retard
are recumbent bikes the unsung god of cycling    more aerodynamic  better breaking  comfy  better for touring  lets you see the scenery  doesnt make you impotent
i kind of want a recumbent but id want one like this or a tadpole trike
  trikes are great for long distance as they are really balanced and fantastic for hills  ones like your pic related are for mega speed you would overtake standing cyclists easily
  exploding knees  poor handling  cant weight shift as well as traditional bike
  suck at climbing  low position on ones like this  makes you invisible for cagers
   knees  only if youre mashing too hard just have to make sure youre using sane chainring sizes   handling  turning is for plebs chad goes in a straight line  t weight shift as well as traditional bike  this is true but can be fixed by making the road 100 smooth so you dont have to jump bumps or swerve around potholes
  so youre saying theyre poor replacements for bikes on real roads
  oh look its this thread again  they suck kid otherwise everyone would ride one
  holy frick this crosschaining
stops you dead
    heavier than a normal bike so slower on climbs less maneuverable due to not being able to shift your weight around slower on descents because its less maneuverable unless youre suicidal i guess you cant sprint properly because your butt stays planted in the seat no matter what you do yes even recreational and commute riders sprint sometimes even if its to beat a red light at an intersection not as safe because youre lower to the ground therefore less visible to motor vehicles unless you have one of those flags i guess but that just increases air resistance therefore youre slower finally more expensive than a normal bike due to having an even smaller market share recumbent bikes will always be on the fringes of cycling mainly appealing to people with back problems or other physical problems that prevent them from riding a normal bike    there really should be an /n/ sticky like on /fit/ that covers things like this so no one bothers to create threads about them its a settled issue and rehashing it doesnt change anything
    literally invisible to cagers  annihilated by speedbumps low curbs  look like a gimp
  imagine actually explaining at length why recumbents are bad  its like hating on retards for being retarded
    yes of course
recumbents were invented around the same time the first cars were invented somewhere in france i believe the inventor even called them velocars not bicycles or velocipides even the two wheeled ones         theyre a great extra type of bike if you want to live a car free life it makes longer journeys much easier thats where it excels but that also happens to be where cars and motorcycles excels and people much rather ride those because they are cooler the regular bicycle excels at shorter rides and motor vehicles dont really so thats why recumbents arent very popular
  if you plan on bike touring recumbents are probably the best as you avoid all the long term damage and pain and can travel further    also about the invisible to cars meme this is nonsense as everyone who has ridden one on the road sings their praise that because they are unusual cars are more likely to notice you like a midget clown in a party
makes you blind
  there really should be an /n/ sticky like on /fit/ that covers things like this so no one bothers to create threads about them  write it then 2000 word minimum on my desk tomorrow
    theres a place for recumbents but here are the main reasons why i dont own one    disclaimer there are striking differences between recumbents  upright bikes as recumbents vary widely the advantages  disadvantages listed below may apply to different types to different degrees or not at all    while the riding position is comfortable  removes stress from the arms it cannot easily be varied during a ride in a more reclined position the weight is spread evenly between the back  the buttocks the rider of a conventional bike can stand on the pedals to allow his legs to take the shock of a severe bump in the road the recumbent rider cannot    it is difficult to jerk the front wheels of recumbents onto curbs or other obstacles as the front wheel of a recumbent bike is often small driving onto full height curbs can be very risky even w/ suspension
i went through the whole recumbent phase my first one was a short wheel base alligt recumbent that i paid 150e for it had quite an upright seating position afterwards i bought a batavus relax which is basically a super heavy cheap piece of shit native to europe it was bad and i never got it into good rideable condition an sold it as scrap next i got a cheap 60e homebuild recumbent that was about the height of a mid racer but it was made of square steel pieces and weighted like 20 kg eventually i scrapped the parts from it and threw the frame into my metal scrap pile     next i wanted something more serious so i bought a raptobike lowracer for 700 euros it was in great condition and after a few accessories it had everything you could wish for but the front wheel drive system let me down and it wasnt efficient i was too autistic to ignore that terrible bend in the chain it was too low to the ground for me to be comfortable  i still have the raptobike but havent ridden it for a year and plan on selling it asap lowracers just arent practical enough for my needs if i ever get a recumbent again itll will be a long wheel base one something like pic related    all my recumbents suffered from terrible chain efficiency either because of tubing or because of weird bends in the chain the only type that doesnt suffer from this problem are the long wheel base recumbents or the front wheel drive flevobike types but they are a different type of bike altogether lwb recumbents look dorky at first but you get used to it their ride quality is superb no you wont be faster than a roadbike but they are very simple perfect for cruising easy to get off and on off you are also very visible exactly the height of a normal car
  but shouldnt bents be faster on descents because better aero and lower center of gravity both of which help in descending faster
  control isnt so good so if were talking the amerishart drag racing in a straight line in the wallmart parking lot kind of dick measuring descents then yes maybe but real nigga alpine descents then naw
    never heard such crap in my entire life stop posting bait
  recumbents are a meme if they were so great everyone would ride one and upright bikes wouldnt exist youll note that uprights are the majority by a vast margin and recumbent anything are on the fringe /n/ trolls are just memeing you
cant bunny hop  the uci could avoid a lot of bullshit if they centred their geometry regulations around this requirement
  these are just facts       recumbents are a meme    its just that you are a retard
  better breaking  sounds like a disadvantage to me
    bents are awesome in what they can do speed and comfort you have stated your dislike of this type of bicycle i think your points have been noted move along now please
  its astonishing to me how often i see people typing that
  i see noone typing it that way
  that chain looks like a hassle
  the only reason the upright bicycle is even alive today is because uci is on a crusade against anything that isnt one  yeah lets not fool ourselves into thinking that merit has anything to do with what bikes are sold
  move along now please  or what lol
  lol no those arent facts they are on /n/ a meme and that guy is no retard recumbents are a narrow niche of cycling always have been always will be and larping that you ride one and believe so fervently in them is as much a trollmeme as the socalled vegans on /fit/ or the whole onions to boost test meme on /fit/ maybe 1 in 1000 bikes i see on daily rides is a recumbent and i dont see them for long because i go past them like theyre standing still worst are recumbent trikes which take up 3 times as much room as a normal bike and are even slower recumbents are a meme clearly and objectively and you cant prove me wrong
  2/10 try harder
  your faith in meritocracy is adorably naïve
  recumbents have their use case where they excel touring and speed dependent on the type are where they excel    trikes and touring recumbents are ideal for long distance/tours because they are comfortable and let you see around you instead of only a few meters of road in the case of trikes they are more stable have more luggage storage ability and are a breeze on hills  speed recumbents excel in flat areas due to less drag the world human powered land speed record was won on a recumbent    normal bikes are more popular because they are more versatile but if you only want to ride a specific way flat speed or touring then recumbent bikes excel
df bikes are made for and ridden by sheeple npcs  recumbents are built by independent freethinkers  chances are if see someone riding one that person has an actual soul
  this post reads too dogmatic to have been made by a freethinker
  speed  lol thats hilarious every single recumbent ive ever encountered was behind me so fast i barely noticed them and ive never been passed by anyone on a recumbent even on my slow days
     
  faster on descents because better aero and lower centre of gravity  yes  t gravity racer    ad populum
  if they were that good theyd outsell safety bicycles
  because  
electric recumbent ftw
  arent you precious
  thanks for sharing that that bike trip looks pretty damn fun    tfw poor fag so wont be able to afford a setup and trip like that
your opinion on recumbents is worthless if you havent ridden one in fact ridden 5 low mid high trike velo until you do youll never understand why come back when you have
  dont know anyone i could borrow one from
  you sure could use one your prostate isnt getting any better gramps
i see a few recumbents here and there in my area in germany all of them are just casuals and they dont look comfortable at all most of that comes from the way they bend their neck to look up any bentfag here able to tell me if im mistaken by assuming the position isnt comfy
  its more than a little concerning that youd be thinking about my prostate at all kid is there something youd like to tell us come now anon youre anonymous after all no one is going to judge you xd
  the one exception to my opinion on recumbents are the handcycle people theyre about as hardcore as you can get and they get nothing but respect from me ive even seen handcycle criteriums theyre not anywhere near as highspeed as normal crits but youve got to respect them for getting out there and working their upper bodies that hard also you sure as hell wouldnt want to armwrestle any of them xd
i would definitely love to give a proper recumbant tour a go  it seems to me that theyd be perfect for crossing the usa on iirc most human powered ultra distance records are set on recumbants on the flat they are mile slayers
    xd  kys
  everyone would but they were banned
  never seen a recumbent gravity racer desu pics or it didnt happen
  in a straight line sure but if youre dealing with curves you have to go slower on a recumbent because youre less maneuverable
  depends on the wheelbase to be fair
  im itching to see this tested
  doesnt look like it to me the biggest limit to cornering on both types of bikes is more the tires than the angle you can turn the wheel    
  that wouldnt exclude recumbents    
  does he do any bunny hopping in that video
  he stands on the front wheel and hops with it if that doesnt count as bunny hopping that means its as countrived as geometry regulations
velomobiles or recumbents    
  sounds more like pogoing
    are all recumbent riders this retarded dont you know what a bunny hop is and what its for      no he doesnt his front wheel never leaves the ground while hes riding the bike
why so slow    
  probably because theyre a bunch of welladjusted leisure cyclists out for the simple pleasure of a social group ride instead of a pair of deviant malcontents with a chip on their shoulder about what others ride
  rather a chip on their shoulder rather than a dull pain on their groin
  how come recumbentfags are always racing against casual riders fat people and old women instead of joining a proper non uci road race
  are you implying they dont join road races        
  how much slower is a tadpole trike over a two wheeler
  world record for a human powered trike is 115 km/h     where as the world record for a human powered vehicle is 14417 km/h keep in mind the power needed to overcome faster speeds grows by the square cube if pressure rather than skin friction drag so the bicycle has at least one and a half times less power consumptionfunny how that works    
one of these days i will buy a flevobike and learn to ride it    this type of bicycle may never become popular because it takes high intelligence to understand such concept                this recumbent bike is fwd and you steer it with your legs it takes a month or so to master once mastered they say no other form of bicycle even comes close to control and fun it truly feels like an extension of your body    also it folds in halve
  brake levers butted up against the grips  dropped
  the bicycle has at least one and a half times less power consumption    lol
  handcycle  i want to get one of those so bad but the prices
heres a surefire plan to fix americas failing rail network  break up the major class is redistribute their track to regional state and local authorities to better manage the branches of the system and provide employment and service opportunities to communities where the track passes through  construct interurban and street railway systems in all major cities and integrate them into the regional rail network  where the track is near large coal deposits natural gas and hydroelectric power electrify the track for improved efficiency and economy  subsidize passenger and freight operations with a national gas tax  passenger trains have priority on all track including mainlines  all communities over 5000 population have a guaranteed passenger rail service with trains running at least twice a day  in order to support the economy full crew laws will be applied nationwide 5 or 6 man crews for all freight trains minimum of 3 crew per passenger train  railroads must serve any costumer/shipper on their line at cost if requested to do so like rural free postal delivery  ban laborsaving technology that seeks to eliminate jobs and reduce safety  put new construction operations in the hands of japanese railway engineers to avoid cost overruns construction delays and inefficiency    trains are for people not profits please feel free to add similar suggestions and comment
  a lot of these are rather weird  ill address the ones which i think are most unusual  break up the major class is  amtrak and via rail both classify as major class is and yet both get shafted by freight outside of a certain number of rail corridors both of these should stay as the intercity operators for public interest while i dont oppose competition from other operators amtrak and via rail should still have a public service obligation to serve stations which otherwise have no rail service much like they already do  construct interurbans  times and technology has changed and interurbans are obsolete as far as designs go some places do still operate interurban light rail but these are limited examples a better solution should be tramtrain which uses the same overal principle but modernised in street running the trams operate on sight and act more like the modern streetcars installed in places like dc and portland these trams will then move to signalling rules and higher speeds once on rail lines this allows for innercity transport to also act as a commuter system  theres also the option for stadtbahn like systems which operate underground like a metro in the city and then are more tram like as they head towards the outskirts and the suburbs  electrify the tracks  this shouldnt just be limited to these places 70 of all of frances power is generated by nuclear power the trains in france could theoretically be called nuclear powered at least indirectly  passenger train have priority  or take it one step forwards and build dedicated passenger lines or even better dedicated high speed passenger lines like the japanese shinkansen french lgvs german neubaustrecken or belgian/dutch hsls
  as far as bait goes this is 10/10 no really i havent seen bait this high effort on this board in forever good for you man
  continued  full train crews  on european and asian railways a full crew consists of one train driver passenger services will need customer service staff like conductors or other staff but for train operation only one driver is necessary  trains in europe and asia rely on gsmr to allow for telecommunication between the train driver and the singalling additionally the trains gsmr allows it to communicate to certain places when necessary staff responsible for coupling or other tasks remain at stations or freight yards and will work as necessary shunting locomotives typically have a crew of 23 people one driver and another two people to operate manual track switches and carry out coupling and decoupling  ban laboursaving technology  this is the most stupid aspect i can imagine most european and asian trains have advanced systems including ato automatic train operation which can be best described as driverless operation while the level of ato varies most ato requires a driver to manually close the doors and press a button to allow the train to move off ato is incredibly safe and relies on many technologies including automatic train protections gsmr and balise other systems for incab signalling also reduce driver fatigue and increase situational awareness which also increases safety  japanese construction  this is a meme and you know it the original shinkansen lines were twice the cost and had many delays all train projects are subject to this wherever you go ultimately the main focus should be on safety and reliability various projects in europe and asia have delivered on this and out of the many different high speed rail projects i can think of recently vde 8 in germany was at least the most on schedule and within budget whether japanese german swiss chinese british french korean italian or american there is no main benefit with picking one over the other the ultimate goal will be the same
   up the major class is redistribute their track to regional state and local authorities to better manage the branches of the system and provide employment and service opportunities to communities where the track passes through  class 1s already do a fantastic job of efficiently transporting cargo across the country lets take away their incentive to operate efficiently profit and watch how well that goes   interurban and street railway systems in all major cities and integrate them into the regional rail network  lets ignore the logistical nightmare that is building railways in busy 21st century city centers because of retarded 20th century railway nostalgia   the track is near large coal deposits natural gas and hydroelectric power electrify the track for improved efficiency and economy  building a power plant isnt as easy as selecting the type and clicking where you want to place it stop confusing cities skylines and real life   passenger and freight operations with a national gas tax  willingly having a tax imposed on yourself how do those boots taste   trains have priority on all track including mainlines  id rather stay in favor of the system that transports the vast majority of bulk freight in this country and drives the economy rather than a system that nobody but poor people and boomers on vacation use apart from high density rail corridors like the nec and amtrak california   communities over 5000 population have a guaranteed passenger rail service with trains running at least twice a day  so thats passenger rail service to the bulk of where people live in a country 37 million square miles large give me a second while the government pulls a couple trillion of of its ass  1/2
  subsidize passenger and freight operations with a national gas tax  oh for fucks sake kid if youre going to troll at least learn enough about the subject to do it intelligently what youve posted here is embarassing    rail has been government subsidized for many decades now without that it would have ceased to exist already    now go back to 
  2/2   order to support the economy full crew laws will be applied nationwide 5 or 6 man crews for all freight trains minimum of 3 crew per passenger train  even when train crews had 56 crew members post steam era only the engineer and conductor were working the rest polished off cases of beer and watched the scenery go by go back to the first grade so you can learn all about how paying people to do nothing is fiscally irresponsible   must serve any costumer/shipper on their line at cost if requested to do so like rural free postal delivery  and whos gonna pay for it then you muh one percent   laborsaving technology that seeks to eliminate jobs and reduce safety  finally one nonretarded point i can actually get behind   new construction operations in the hands of japanese railway engineers to avoid cost overruns construction delays and inefficiency  do some reading on the history of japanese rail construction and how shinkansen lines have a long history of going massively over budget    it might be shocking to you but this isnt europe and it isnt japan either this is america and things work differently here then in places around the world wanting to model your rail network after countries with vastly different area sizes population densities economies and attitudes toward travel is just plain 50 iq    trains are for people not profits  the cherry on the cake trains in this country have been for profit since the first railroad was opened and their ruthless expansion across the country is what helped us not stay on the east coast

why would you break up the class is sure maybe theres theoretical efficiency in having more smaller roads but you know what they say if it aint broke dont fix it the freight rail industry has only recently emerged from decades of stagnation and underinvestment lets not kick out their legs just after they found good footing     the important thing is just to not allow any further consolidation of the big class is the regional balance is good enough as is it could be better sure but it also could be a lot worse    passenger rains the real nightmare and there are two different approaches we can take the evolutionary or the revolutionary    the evolutionary approach consists of buying the right to run passengers on an existing railroad and upgrading it to passenger standards for practical reasons of cost and political expedience the evolutionary approach tends to be favored though i think its not always a good idea most of our existing rail lines are not favorable to highspeedrail the ones that are are usually nearcapacity for the cost it takes to add new capacity and upgrade the corridor to passenger standards you dont get that much maybe a 110 mph speed limit if youre lucky but usually youre stuck piddling along at speeds closer to 60 mph with no way to improve other than buying new land to smooth out the curves at which point the cost advantages of reuse start to disappear for every existing corridor thats wellmaintained straight smooth and suitable for highspeed running such as the fec railway or most of the nec theres twenty janky piece of crap lines that are falling apart rough as hell zigzag all over the place and have grade crossings every twenty feet see most nonmainline freight tracks    building new lines would make sense for places outside of the northeast but its not practical right now unfortunately without a good row you cant pull a brightline and without gobs of cash you cant pull a texas central
 up the major class is redistribute their track to regional state and local authorities to better manage the branches of the system and provide employment and service opportunities to communities where the track passes through    wow so instead of 7 different railways that enjoy dicking businesses we get 50 different state railways that cant do anything with each other for shit and kill the entire industry    anyway op amtrak already did this with passenger services everything is owned by the feds but theres 4 different regions west chicago southeast northeast amtrak organizes its operations from
  carbon tax on airline tickets and highway/interstate travel and freight
  domestic flights in the us need to have taxes levied on them in order to make taking the train much more of a financially appealing choice  a balance will be necessary though making the tax lower for a coast to coast flight makes sence but the tax will need to be higher for flights between dc new york boston and other east coast cities  puerto rico other territories hawaii and alaska should be exempted from this tax for obvious reasons
  how about we set the taxes aside an see how the railroad can be a desirable option otherwise you can fly from la to sf for 95 how is some meme hsr gonna beat that
  you can fly from la to sf for 95 how is some meme hsr gonna beat that  it cant right now which is why i would suggest placing a lower domestic flight tax for coast to coast flights the intention isnt to target flying long distances but rather shorter ones instead  hsr gonna beat that  if hsr was to be constructed coast to coast the best option in my opinion would be some kind of sleeper train the idea would be for the train to leave at around 830pm and then arrive the next morning at around 9am this gives a journey time of about 12 and a half hours  if the train was to get up to 300 km/h and the track was as straight as possible with the trains running from washington dc to san francisco then the time taken would be possible to cover that distance  put in a number of high quality cabins with 2 seats which can convert into 2 beds at night plus a dining car and room service for a dinner and then breakfast the next morning and you are looking at the option of getting from coast to coast without having to spend extra on a hotel the other end  services which already exist like the trenhotel in spain the sunrise seto in japan and the lapland express in finland already show off how sleeper trains can be very spaceous and luxurious fit in an ensuite bathroom with a shower toilet and sink for premium class and have a common shower in a more standard class for each car and youre looking at maybe one of the more comfortable ways to cross the country in a more environmentally friendly way
  it would have to average 220 mph no way
people talking about how efficient class is are  have a 10000 ton/4000 ft conveyor rock train that can only be broken at certain cars shoved down my throat  in a yard where the longest track is 3000 ft  ask to divert it to nearby larger yards  nope we want it here  decide 3 days later they dont want it here but 600 miles away instead
  elsewhere high speed train is a higher class option than low cost flight not sure about the us though    hows la to sf coasttocoast both of them are inside california    average 220mph is possible when you schedule nonstop trains
  nobody is ever going to schedule a nonstop coasttocoast train believing they would is delusional
  all post in the thread is talking about coast to coast wont make sense what are you arguing about
publiclyowned local and regional railroads are a great idea and are already a proven success in parts of the country     the lake county railroad reporting mark lcr based in lakeview oregon united states is owned by the lake county government and operated by frontier rail as the lake county railway lcy the lcy hauls products for both the perlite mine and lumber from the collins fremont sawmill    in march 1985 the sp filed to abandon the line and the abandonment was approved 5 months later the county stepped in to save the route vital to local businesses and the state legislature enacted a law permitting local governments to own railroads outside of the state and then the oregon state lottery agreed to fund up to 85 of the purchase price if the county could find an operator the county went to work and the great western railway an established shortline based out of colorado agreed to operate the line on a contract basis1 lake county purchased the line from sp on january 18 1986 to keep the line open    tacoma rail reporting marks tmbl trmw is a publicly owned class iii shortline railroad it is owned by the city of tacoma washington and operated as a public utility it is one of three operating divisions of the municipallyowned tacoma public utilities service but unlike other city services the railroad is selfsupported and generates revenue for the city of tacoma and washington state tacoma rail provides freight switching services serving the port of tacoma and customers in tacoma south pierce county and parts of thurston county it operates 16 diesel locomotives more than 100 employees and about 140 miles of track many of which are former milwaukee road and bnsf railway lines around western washington    theres no reason why every county municipality and/or state couldnt do the same and efficiently operate their own railroads for interstate and longhaul shipments the class i transcon mainlines could be nationalized
all communities over 5000 population have a guaranteed passenger rail service with trains running at least twice a day  thats pretty fuckin delusional bud
  class is are only efficient at long haul bridge traffic to and from west and east coast ports hauling containers and unit trains of grain oil coal and other bulk commodities theyre shit at everything else and have been since the 1950s when the trucking industry took off and they stopped giving a fuck about shorthaul revenue service

  break up the major class is redistribute their track to regional state and local authorities to better manage  fuck you commie
  even when train crews had 56 crew members post steam era only the engineer and conductor were working the rest polished off cases of beer and watched the scenery go by  not true they passed hand signals back to the cab when switching no handheld radios and that was during the days of standard journals the equipment wasnt as good then and needed the extra manpower in addition many head end brakemen learned how to run trains after the engineer and fireman got too drunk to run
  theres no reason why every county municipality and/or state couldnt do the same and efficiently operate their own railroads for interstate and longhaul shipments the class i transcon mainlines could be nationalized  duhh its better to have thousands of small operators who may or may not know what theyre doing than a few big ones who do
  this
  their property would be fairly assessed and they would be compensated for their assets       in addition many head end brakemen learned how to run trains after the engineer and fireman got too drunk to run  based
  their property would be fairly assessed and they would be compensated for their assets  youre straight up retarded
  how so you act like successful condemnation proceedings against private utilities have never been done before
  if you are serious about breaking up the class 1s youll have a hard time convincing me theyll be in better hands in numerous government bureaucracies than among themselves
  implying americas rail network needs fixing    yikes
you seem to have good intentions with this but chill
i like one or two of ops ideas but the us could always go with the nuclear option    nationalize everything  all class 1 rrs  all commuter rail  amtrak either gets destroyed or becomes the face of the nation  all regional hubs are united  no more well ill take lirr to njtransit to septa nope just one commuter train line under amtraks regional that makes all of the stops
  chill    make me bitch
  the idea that public transit cannot make a profit is exactly what is killing public transit in this country     if every single time public transit wants to expand it needs to pass a measure in the local ballot how the fuck is it supposed to expand quickly     tokyo and hong kongs public transit systems should be models for the rest of the world they both turn a profit
  duhh its better to have thousands of small operators who may or may not know what theyre doing than a few big ones who do  implying more operators with a vested interest in the territory they serve will be less beneficial to society labor and the local economy     pic related freds will be eliminated and cabooses will make a return with full crews
    you could just nationalize the row/rails and stations and make privates pay by ton/mile and axle weight gsmr for management gps log all movement and send via iot satcomms offer regional/national contracts to supply minimum services to undeserved areas pay to cover sucky lines have competitive biding for profitable commuter/urban line service have government be paid for right of access    maybe dual mode bus/rail vehicles as interurban substitutes but thats pushing it    the idea being infrastructure is too capital intensive in marginal profit industries so should be run like public utilities with common access where there is no profit motive only access motive
  great post well said sir
  even when train crews had 56 crew members post steam era only the engineer and conductor were working the rest polished off cases of beer and watched the scenery go by go back to the first grade so you can learn all about how paying people to do nothing is fiscally irresponsible    stay cucked pathetic hireling who deserves to be a slave of his corporate masters and will never know the true freedom of the rails absolutely disgusting
  but why tho
  strongly based
  unfortunately rail transport becomes more efficient as the scale becomes bigger  its why wagon load freight died in the uk and most trains are block workings  these thousands of small operators will merge or buy each other out and youll eventually end up with a new oligarchic system
  ownership  operation
  youre introducing new levels of bureaucracy into the system that didnt exist before great idea
daily reminder that privatization fixed britains rail
  correlation is not causation this graph doesnt prove anything about what each era of operators did just what the passenger figures are
  commie desperation
  if anything the ridership only dropped 25 during the entire era of motorization and affordable air travels arrival thats not that bad especially when compares to some other countries
  guys privatisation fixed the railways  passenger numbers falling during wartime  passenger numbers collapsing after the beeching report and rail lines were closed down  passenger numbers at the lowest point during thatchers premiership when the tories were defunding british rail  fixed the railways    nah people just took the train more when they realised that fuel costs were too high to commute with privatisation merely coincided with the realisation that trains were a necessary means of transport instead of driving for 2 hours on packed motorways
  im not saying your point isnt valid but that you need better data to back it up
  id kill for those numbers with amtrak    the modern us rail networks actually pretty good from an international standpoint only when you factor freight in tho but nothing stings more than realizing the us was obsessed with rail until the 50s and had some of the best lines with the best service in the world    automatic block signals invented and used by tje eastern railroad overhead catenary the pennsylvania railroad didnt invent it but they sure as hell pioneered the use of it automatic train control pennsy again     then we saw the car and threw that all away without a second thought

planes that never flew thread     lets have a thread series dedicated to honoring aviation marvels that could have changed the aerospace world as we know it but sadly had the plug pulled before they even had the chance gone but not forgotten    rules    aircraft must be serious proposals from real manufacturers and not just outlandish pitches from either retarded engineers or aerospace enthusiasts  aircraft whos development was cancelled but managed to have one or more prototype test flights are disqualified thus they technically did fly  global rules and local /n/ rules apply dont be a faggot    starting with a classic the mcdonnell douglas md12 or the plane the a380 wishes it was it would have been the first real competitor to the 747 and would have solidified the supremacy of the american aerospace industry but complications with md fucking up the cargo door design on the dc10 made customers never trust them again and led to the entire company going under they were bought by boeing in 1997
boeing 2707
concorde b    would have had more efficient engines which combined with the active leading edge would have removed the reheat/afterburner at takeoff all together it would have used 25 less fuel that combined with a slight increase in fuel tank capacity would have allowed it to do nonstop long distance flights at a reasonable cost it was basically the aircraft that operators actually wanted
lockheed l133 this was kelly johnsons first unsolicited proposal for a jet fighter in 1939 usaaf couldnt be arsed with such an outlandish concept as an aeroplane with no propeller eventually the clods got their heads straight and the p80 was built and put into very limited service at the end of wwii
before the arrow there was the cf103  1/2
2/2
  implying the existence of any serviceready turbojet engines in 1939
  the me262 entered its design phase in 1939  the de havilland vampire 2 years later in 1941
  still wouldnt have allowed it to fly over populated land
  youre extraordinarily dense    the design was started in 1939 with the knowledge that practical jet engines were soon to come by 1940 lockheed was running early versions of their own l1000 sucknblow    please work on your reading comprehension and critical thinking skills
  the sonic boom problem was an invented myth
      are you the retard who makes the when will we have supersonic passenger planes again thread every week
  i can hear the sonic boom of a plane flying at 60000ft    you cant hear the engines of a 747 at 30000ft either its not magic
  regardless id still rather not pay 7000 to get to my destination four hours earlier go back to your concorde appreciation thread
  okay except like i said the concorde b would have actually been affordable and capable you might not pay it but lots of people would    go back to being bitter and poor
  im     im not the retard who makes the threads im the retard that replies to them because even though theyre a complete fail as a sustainable transportation solution theyre fucking neat as hell
  incorrect
  but lots of people would  wrong concorde stopped flying because people stopped paying for tickets engines with afterburners capable of bringing a plane up to supersonic speeds are extremely inefficient and airlines have to charge more just to offset the costs for the last few years of its life concorde was actually losing the airlines money why would someone with the money to fly in a comfy business cabin on a normal jet pay the same amount to fly in a cramped and extremely noisy cabin just to save four hours theyre cool planes but thats it theyre not coming back until someone can engineer an efficient and comfortable one which isnt happening any time soon so keep calling me a poorfag while i state facts
  plus youre limited to subsonic speeds over land
  i agree with this post    i fly ewrlaxewr twice a month the flight is 6 hours going west 5 hours coming back nominally    i live on lawn guyland near islip to make the 5pm flight from newark i have to leave my house no later than 2 i usually leave around 1 earlier if its a friday    my office is in shithole lancaster i get to lax at 8pm if im lucky ill get to the flophouse around 1030 its more common to be a little after 11 i hate la    11pm pdt is 0200 edt doortodoor im traveling for 13 hours less than half of my travel time has been in the air its not unusual to have up to an hour delay due to any number of fuckedup ground holds    so if an sst could go ewrlax gatetogate in 3 hours or even 2 thats still putting me at a travel day of at least 9 hours only 2 of which are inside a tiny noisy alyouminium tube    furthermore i can get no work done on a 2hour sst flight so my whole day is nonbillable time essentially at least on the 777 i can get a solid 5 hours of work in going west i never work on the way home i drink a lot    supersonic flight is a luxury and an affectation its not practical for a business traveler who actually you know works
  engines with afterburners capable of bringing a plane up to supersonic speeds are extremely inefficient and airlines have to charge more just to offset the costs    yes thats why the concorde b which wouldnt have afterburners would be economical enough to bring the cost down to something people could afford    itd help if you read the thread before you got all pantybunched
  concorde b  try to look at it from the perspective of an airline exec the people who put in orders for aircraft instead of an autistic aviation enthusiast who only cares about cool factor which airline would order an untested 20th century design with no working prototype designed by a company thats been defunct since 2000 before you say some dumb shit like they could take the design and have boeing or airbus modernize it consider that would cost too much and innovation in the aviation industry currently revolves around efficiency not speed
  planes that what if appreciation thread    kinda hard to appreciate arent they lol you fucking dummy op
mcdonnell douglas a12 avenger ii    combining all of the benefits of the b2 and the a10 dick cheney insisted that md pull the plug on it in case you didnt have enough reasons to hate him
  it would be airbus who would be the one to modernise it since airbus did manufacture the first concorde although the name hadnt been adopted yet  its worth mentioning that all the systems like the hydraulics electrics and air conditioning which were developed for the concorde are still in use in aircraft as recent as the a350 albeit modernised  an airbus concorde 2 would likely focus on composites as well as modernisation of the flight deck likely copying that of the a350/a380
  combining all of the benefits of the b2 and the a10  yah no cuntmunch
    and also the l2000 which was not only superior to the concorde and tu144 but also to the 2707 from an economic perspective at least    but the 2707 was picked because it was faster and could stuff more passengers into it ultimately complications with the swingwing mechanism and lobbing from angry hippies who were pissed about sonic booms killed both programs    i wonder if the l2000 had been picked instead they actually would have a shot at putting it into production
  on the other hand id sure as shit pay for cutting travel time in half on my sfoshasfo onceamonth trip that fucker is over 13 hours long and i spend under 90 minutes in transit/at the airport on either end cutting 6 hours out of a 17 hour trip would be great
  but the 2707 was picked because it was faster and could stuff more passengers into it  what made the l2000 better then
    being an actually attainable goal and not batshit insane
  angry hippies who were pissed about sonic booms  good less noise  better
    whats not to love about a stealth brrrrrrttt
      if you want to put a tank in the air why not just do it like the ac130 and make it useful
  wheres the brrrrrrrttt
    you gotta believe the brrrrrt
whitecombrule 767 wasp waist fueselage greately accelerates benefits of area rule    could cruise just a few knots below mach 1 without burning extra fuel    unorthodox fuselage proved to cumbersome to build in the end    another version of this concept had all 3 engines mounted on the tail rather than just 1
  thank you if you could make the nrtjfk/nrtewr flight or even the laxnrt flight supersonic that would be a game changer
  i dont believe it ive never seen anyone else mention brrrrtt in the a12 and it sure as fuck doesnt look like it would fit a gau8
  i wonder if conformal fuel tanks could be used on civil airliners to achieve an area rule effect
  when did anybody even suggest any of the things youre talking about in that post    oh thats right never did you even bother to read the op
  based
  i had to do it to the concordefag if you were on this board for more than five minutes youd know him but i see you dont

     sha    thats pvg show some respect        speaking of ewr i know this is off topic but ba runs lcysnnjfk flights for businessmen using an allclub world a318 if path ever gets around to extending service from newark penn to ewr do you think well see direct lcyewr flights jfk is way out in in outer queens but ewr is a short hop across the hudson river via taxi or limo to lower manhattan especially combined with border preclearance in shannon i could see some business demand
  do you think well see direct lcyewr flights   lcyewr is never going to happen without going through snn because the a318 is weight constrained departing lcy
  because mach 3

  lockheed actually knew what the fuck they were doing i will never not be angry at boeing
boeing sonic cruiser    killed by the 2003 recession
  i remember this thing if the economy hadnt soured it sounded like it had a good shot at being developed might have been too different for the market though
  the post2004 petroleum price high would have killed it anyway
        rumor has it that boeing is considering reviving the project with a less retarded engine configuration
    rumor also has it that donald trump is really the koolaid man in disguise
  hard to see through your feet the better solution would have been to use mirrors much like periscopes
  helicopter pilots manage
    how do flaps work on canard designs conventional flaps would make it pitch down because the wings are behind the cg obviously thats not okay if you want to get off the ground
  flaps on the canards obv
this was boeings proposal for the c5
there was a proposal for a mach 2 harrier jet in the 60s but it was quashed instead for the f4
horten flying wing bomber
  most designs dont bother much like most delta wing aircraft some make the canards pitch up enough to compensate the effect of the flaps some like the saab viggen do like  said some settle for using only leading edge slats others give the main wing so much sweep that the inner part is actually close to the cg
  looks like a c5 except for the tail
    they dont this is why the canard configuration is taboo for large commercial jets but popular for small experimental aircraft
either this was a design running againts the b 757 or it preceded it i dont remember
a shame they did not spend just a little more money  could have been the great eastern of the skys
  looks like a c5 except for the tail  yes but noticed the hump behind the cockpit clearly a 747 to me
  preceded
  really lets dedicate a whole thread just to what avro could have made
      jesus christ dust that shit off
he flew a few times but never went into production however it really makes you imagine the possibilities
  why does the one on display at the aerospace museum have a rainbow painted on it
    im cool with that
the naval version of the f117    i suppose it would have been long retired by now had it been built
  this mad thing obviously flew but there were no orders placed i wonder why this tech has not been employed elsewhere
behold the l500 the passenger variant of the c5 able to hold over 1000 passengers each
  that kind of looks like it was designed for use in regional airports like the original 737  its hideous though everything about it is pretty bad at least as an airliner  i could have seen it work pretty well as a dedicated civilian frieghter but considering that the c5 is a rollon rolloff strategic airlifter it would make more sence using it as a car airliner just drive to the airport drive onto the plane and then sit in your car for the 45 hour flight from coast to coast
on that the lockheed 141 also had a commercial variant
  no windows and 999 other passengers on a 12 hour flight
  and then sit in your car for the 45 hour flight from coast to coast  a new low
mcdonnell douglass tried to made a new model of the f4 to replace the air forces old models twice the first time they tried it actually was superior to the f15 they were making however they canned it because they didnt have enough money at the time to put two mainline fighters into service at the same time and shelved it until they had the capacity to produce it the second time they tried it they werent able to finish designing it before it was cut due to md not having enough money to finish it as this time around md was in even an even worse position due to the commercial flop of the md11 and the loss of several contracts the first one was going to be called the f4 2000 not to be confused with the kurnass 2000 and the second one never got a designation due to being so incomplete
  the f4 was nearly resurrected again by boeing with the super phantom proposal which would see various improvements and changes for the f4 however the same problem as the first time came around again as this time the super f4 was seen to have too similar of a performance to the f18 and was again slightly superior to the f15 and so they canned the project
  superior to the f15    holy fuck i laughed so hard i think i pulled a muscle
would have been pipers first production jet killed by the 2008 slump
  pay the same amount to fly in a cramped and extremely noisy cabin just to save four hours  because it would make the excruciating pain that is a flight to asia half the time you fucking retard
  those of us who live in the first world dont take 4 hours to go to the airport it takes me 15 hours by public transit 45 minutes by taxi for a 10 hour flight thats about 15 hours door to door shaving 5 off of that would be an amazing improvement
  i should have specified it was superior in speed and payload but not maneuverability although the problem was that it wasnt that superior so they didnt feel the need to change either way what i sad is true you can look this all up on wikipedia although there isnt much detail on the page itself the sources listed have more info 
  bold design who needs second engine
you are all certainly wondering what the hell is that hell this is what the eurofighter once look liked
in the early 90s there were ideas being brought forth to eventually replace the f14 from usn service the name of the program was the naval advanced tactical fighter  at this time the usaf was deciding upon the next generation of aircraft which would eventually lead to the f22  seeing stealth as being the eventual means to keeping a modern naval air wing several proposals were created based on a similar overall design as the tomcat but with probable costs expected to be very high due to complicated engineering and a tech still in its infancy the idea was dropped in 1992  the pic was an idea from lockheed martin very much based on their raptor
whatever the fuck this thing is

    so how is that fucking thing supposed to generate lift
  weather or not you consider this a plane might be up to debate but it was an intereating concept
it probably wouldnt have worked and it would have been too impractical in the day to fly in at mach 3 slow down to shoot its missile
  not just a concept aerospike engines are among the most efficient since they get the highest specific impulse of any rocket engine at varying air pressures while a vacuum bell on a rocket engine might get better specific impulse in space that engine would struggle to work at sea level    ultimately we never got the x33 the dcx or the constellation program a great shame really all i can hope for is the dream chaser on board the arianne 5 or the atlas v
    the skylon is another promising concept
  i am well aware about the benefits of the aerospike engine and the cooling issues of the cicular form vs the linear form  constellation programm  well we are getting some components of it for example the sls/aresv and the orion capsule maybe even the lander    i would argue that relaunching rockets will stay cheaper than ssto spaceplanes for the near future  the development of skylon will take quite some time because it relies on technology that is not yet available and if it is sucessfull it will probably take longer than bfr fornits maiden flight  dont get me wrong i realy like the idea but it is a realy complex issue
  well we are getting some components of it for example the sls/aresv and the orion capsule maybe even the lander  i just hate that nasas direction is basically steered by the president who has all the political benefits of cancelling whatever project his predecessor started only to make his own  this just creates the cycle of 3 years working on something before cancellation no wonder people complain about nasa their problem comes from presidents who have no idea what they fuck theyre doing to space exploration  esa and jaxa at least have the benefits of having a high level of decision making separation from the governments which fund them arianne 5 is human rated anyway so it can be easily modified to carry a human rated capsule of some kind i have no idea if the hii is human rated or not all it really carries these days are htvs    roscosmos is in a very different mess these days in competent idiots now work there and will install components upside down or use hammers to make ball joints fit i know theyre working on the federation capsule system but the issue still remains that they havent picked the rocket for it yet either the fenix/soyuz5 or the angara neither of which have flown yet    itll be interesting if esa manages to get the rights to buy orion capsules airbus are already making the orion service module but since that was just a system derived from the atv im sure they could just buy orion capsules made in the us and just stick them onto an arianne 5    itll be interesting if the russians do just take the ros and turn it into opsek and the americans make lopg a thing perhaps then the europeans and japanese might invite the chinese to the iss
    the boeing rc1 a pitch for a gigantic triple fuselage flying oil tanker for hauling oil out of alska    powered by no less than twelve engines
c5 for scale
  thats looks like it would need those massive tanks to just fuel the 12 engines  what was boeing smoking when they came up with that design i want to know if they were still smoking it when they came up with the mcas for the 737max
  blimptrain
    what was boeing smoking when they came up with that design    apparently not as much as lockheed was smoking when they came up with pic related 1100 foot wingspan nuclear powered mothership flying aircraft carrier    yes this was a serious proposal from the company
      absolute units
  it would be more comfortable than most business class fares today
  single jet     why dont we see more of these
   i want to know if they were still smoking it when they came up with the mcas for the 737max  some indian smelly sticks considering nationality of software designers
i dont quite know how serious they were with this proposalbut it would have been awesome
    redundancy
    if one engine quits you can use another unless thats the only engine
    theres plenty of single turboprops why not jets
  yeah some of the early space shuttle proposals were wild have you read dennis jenkins book on the program
    im pretty sure the faa outright forbids single engine designs bigger than 10 passengers
  but why no single jets for planes with under ten passengers   i assume its because such small planes typically fly short distances where a jet isnt the most economical option i dont know much at all about the aeronautical world so please correct me if im mistaken
  over larger land masses it could be an option so long as you were not flying transoceanic but rather within a continent flights within north america or europe the single jet engine would be much faster than a pilatus or other similar single engine turboprop and would make longer 45 hour flights over land at least more fuel efficient at higher altitude

an alaska q400 has reportedly been stolen from seatac airport there are additional sketchier reports that it may have been shot down and/or crashed but no confirmation on that as of now
  alaska q400    horizon q400    derp
apparent confirmation that the plane has crashed
    sounds like he was on a suicide mission
the madman did a barrel roll
sheriff is pretty certain it wasnt shot down    tail number is reportedly n423qx
  my ass this is a coverup that plane had passengers and was shot down just like twa 800  the us military truly is the most evil and incompetent organization in history

this is fucking awesome the balls on that cunt

  love it
    recording of audio of him and atc    something beautiful about this guy nobody got hurt he exposed a security flaw and he went out the way he wanted rip
  a real hero  go away reddit boomerpede
  he believed it was part of why he was unemployable for anything above minimum wage but yeah   the reason someone wouldnt get pissed off at him despite this is that hell never do it again and the only people who got hurt were only hurt financially and whoever they were they owned a plane so they were obviously rich so they obviously deserved it somehow
  random mental guy isnt really a security flaw is it its more like an act of god
  exposed a security flaw  literally all airports will review their security set up because of him he indirectly saved untold amount of lives
  ironic he could save others from death but not himself
  implying tsa wont just find more ways to make air travel even more obnoxious
    he had a flightline badge though is that really a security flaw
only one thing will change   flight simulators will get fucked up
  i think im gonna land it  like uhh a safe kinda manner and  think im uh gonna tryna do a barrel role and if that goes good i think im gonna go nose down and call it a night   fffff  f  ffff  f  f

  white people have developed an unbelievable victim complex in the last decade or so
  f  why though  im think  has a point if he had been black or even worse middleeastern you wouldnt be holding f to pay respects
  because neither of them would be as charismatic or light hearted about it
  the black wouldnt have been able to do it and the middle eastern would have actually tried to take people with him   the sympathy comes from both that he managed to actually achieve his goal and that he wasnt aiming to hurt other people
  was this guy a muslim
  so content doesnt matter its all about presentation      the black wouldnt have been able to do it and the middle eastern would have actually tried to take people with him  unwarranted overgeneralisations im saying he could have done the exacta same thing he did with the exact same intentions but you would have reacted differently if he happened to be a muslim which would be incidental and irrelevant to the events
  dorner got plenty of respects and he actually killed people i dont agree with you
  got plenty of respects and he actually killed people  some people just want to watch the world burn

i love the e1 shinkansen design so much  it was killed way too soon   do any japanese people agree  why hasnt someone basically copied the design
being jr shikoku seems pretty suffering this year be broke but still fix all your lines after flooding then get direct hit by typhoon a couple weeks later
  i thought double deckers were cool too then i rode s max tanigawa service monday and saw this shit and threw up a little    six across  no armrests  no recline  final destination
  death to boring stainless steel liveries  that being said can this trend with colored doors and removing cheatlines fucking stop
  most of them seems to reopen after the typhoon pass away
  lucky seemed pretty intense
  simply the current strongly commuteroriented design of existing bilevels the one extra 33 seats squeezed in on a few upper level contributes insignificant capacity hell having more green car cabins would still not influence it as the highest capacity type much
  why hasnt someone basically copied the design    why hasnt someone basically copied shinkansen loading gauge
  pretty sure all other northeast asia countries and cis countries have more or less compatible loading gauge

    broader network and higher frequencies  capacity in order to compete with budget alternatives lcc airlines/highway buses    this is one of the reasons why jal/ana didnt purchase a380s to replace the domestic 747s it was decided to refocus towards more frequent trips on efficient twinjets like the 767/777 737ng and a320neo and expand infrastructure kobe airport and new kitakyushu airport are good examples of this to win back market share from lccs like skymark jetstar airasia japan/vanilla air etc    the shinkansen analogy is new lines kyushu shinkansen hokkaido shinkansen etc and faster trainsets n700 e5/e7 instead of largercapacity slower trainsets e1/e4 max    flying honu doesnt count
  broader network and higher frequencies  capacity in order to compete with budget alternatives lcc airlines/highway buses  will the bottleneck at omiya change anything  this is one of the reasons why jal/ana didnt purchase a380s to replace the domestic 747s it was decided to refocus towards more frequent trips on efficient twinjets like the 767/777 737ng and a320neo  more like lowering the cost base and also enhance capacity discipline i dont think there are many new frequencies after transition to smaller aircrafts  and expand infrastructure kobe airport and new kitakyushu airport are good examples of this   that is not something the airlines decide  to win back market share from lccs like skymark jetstar airasia japan/vanilla air etc  theyre now part of the two airlines groups anyway and their market shares are still exceedingly small comoares to lccs in other regions  the shinkansen analogy is new lines kyushu shinkansen hokkaido shinkansen etc and faster trainsets n700 e5/e7 instead of largercapacity slower trainsets e1/e4 max  how much speed improvement can be obtained by increasing northern tohoku shinkansen segment and hokkaido shinkansen speed from 260 to 320/360
kintetsu and tobu both advertise local trains as 普通 but announce them on atos as 各駅停車 which other railway companies cant make up their minds about this and why the fuck are there two different ways of saying local train in japanese anyway    also are local trains on the chuo mitakaakihabara sobu asakusabashichiba and joban ayaseabiko lines announced as 緩行 各駅停車 or is there no 列車種別 announced at all     flying honu doesnt count    well the flying honu a380s will be flying out of narita t1 ana/star alliance terminal which doesnt have any domestic flights anyway and even though japan has extremely deep ties with hawaii as well as guam as a matter of fact nrthnl is still a japanus flight at the end of the day thus they count as international flights
  and why the fuck are there two different ways of saying local train in japanese anyway  local train  all stops train  all stations train  english why
  jr west tell its employee to sit in a tunnel watching shinkansen trains pass through at 300km/h to feel the wind  union quoted employee saying it is scary and ask for termination but jr west said it let them learn the importance of safety check and thus for safety they wont stop doing it
it appears that for the section of the hitahikosan line between yoake and soeda that was damaged due to the flood from last year jr kyushu is floating the idea of replacing that section with brt as restoring all 60 infrastructure damages costs around 56 billion yen while a full restoration scenario is still on the table but that particular section could become third sector as the section between tagawagotōji and yoake had a meager 300 passengers/km/day            id assume it is due to that undercarriage crack incident
  the comment by workers union was from last year so it seems like they started doing so before that incident
  why dont you simply search on youtube    and why the fuck are there two different ways of saying local train in japanese anyway   why the fuck not because they mean different things slow allstops normal/ordinary    chuo mitakaakihabara sobu asakusabashichiba   thats a wrong understanding the line limit is at ochanomizu station   各駅停車    joban ayaseabiko   its toride   do you know about the joban line medium distance services they are unannounced 普通 and will be said to run as rapid after entering joban rapid line   各駅停車   緩行 is never a train designation only for lines
  for chuo main line ozukitakao the 列車電車 distinction is more important when both local service exists the regional service will use 普通 and for joban line it run as rapid or above and the suburban service will use 各停
  the medium/long distance service designated as 列車 will use suburbtantype trainset not to mention expresstype and freight trains and the shortdistance 電車 uses commutertype rolling stock   tokaido main line mix is more confusing yokosukasobu line i believe less so
   usually   chuo line atos announcement can be confusing too
ah hokuriku shinkansen have also given up fgt future fgt development will be focused on for private railways with different track gauge
    各停 is used on lines that were historically     electrified early on   made frequent stops within central tokyo   didnt extend much outside of the central wards   ran at high frequencies    such trains were traditionally given the moniker 電車    普通 is used on lines that were historically     suburban or mediumdistance lines   made few stops within central tokyo   had wide stop spacing even outside of the central wards   didnt run as frequently    the utsunomiya line and keihintohoku line are a good example of this duality keihintohoku only runs between omiya and yokohama stops are spaced very close together and trains runs very frequently its a 電車 so its local trains are called 各停 utsunomiya line on the other hand makes only six stops initially ueno oku akabane urawa saitamashintoshin and omiya and even the suburban stops north of here hasuda shiraoka kurihashi etc are spaced further apart the trains are very long 15 cars with green cars and onboard toilets before the uenotokyo line midday frequencies from ueno were every 1520 minutes 列車 so its local trains are called 普通    continued because of post length limit
  flying honu doesnt count for the simple reason that it is a mandatory purchase
      緩行 is not used for train types only for train line names it differentiates between historically 列車 and 電車 services that share the same infrastructure note that all lines that use the term 緩行 do not run under one singular brand like tokaido/tohoku    chuo   普通  mediumdistance takaomatsumoto uses 211 series and e353 series   快速  limited stops between tokyo and nakano usually runs as far as takao or as far as otsuki during peak hours uses e2310 series   緩行  chuosobu line services continuing to/from akihabara makes local stops between tokyo and nakano but only runs as far as mitaka uses 209500s exyamanote e231500s among others    sobu   普通  mediumdistance trains between chiba and choshi uses exkeihintohoku 2090 series signed as 2092000/2100   快速  limitedstop that run between tokyo and chiba continue onto the yokosuka line only stops at tokyo shinnihombashi bakurocho and kinshicho uses e217 series   緩行  again chuosobu line services from ochanomizu stops at akihabara asakusabashi and ryogoku runs as far as chiba    joban   普通  mediumdistance ueno/shinagawaiwaki or between mito and iwaki only uses ac/dc e501 and e531 e657 for limited express they run as 快速 south of toride   快速  rapid trains ueno/shinagawatoride or ueno/shinagawaabikojr narita uses e2310 series in joban colours   緩行  continues to/from the chiyoda line kitasenju stop is on tokyo metro tracks and not joban line tracksuses e2332000 series tokyo metro 6000/16000 series and odakyu 4000 series    early morning/late night services that make all stops between tokyo and takao since the chuosobu line doesnt run at those times as well as thruservices onto the hachiko line are signed as 各駅停車 i might be wrong but i believe thruservices bound for okutama/musashiitsukaichi are also signed up as 各駅停車 east of tachikawa/haijima
    when skymark purchased the a380s they overextended themselves and went bankrupt in the restructuring ana took a big stake in skymark and acquired the finished a380s as part of the deal is that what you mean by mandatory purchase    i dont know how skymark was expecting to get any use out of the a380 which is designed for ulr services it wasnt specially modified for domestic shorthaul like the 747sr was    even if ana decided to buy a380s out of their own accord instead of picking up skymarks finished a380s i highly doubt theyd be used for anything but nrthnl/nrtgum services haneda kansai sapporo new chitose dont have a380 gates and itami bans quadjets so whats the point china southerns pekcan a380 route hemmorhaged money for domestic flights in china its better to use the 7379 max/a320neo/a350900 and thats the crux of the problem domestic 747srs in japan faced four big problems in my view     japanese economic stagnation since 1988   the post 9/11 spike in oil prices   shinkansen has expanded greatly since the days of the 747sr   more efficient twinjets like the 767/777200/a330 later the 787/a350/777x
  skymarks plan was to deploy them onto intercontinental route and acquire an competitive edge via characteristic of the aircraft however the domestic lcc competition was getting more intense which continually worsen their financial performance along with high fuel price at the time that keep delaying their future expansion plan and ultimately their contract dispute with airbus recall the rise of me3 at the time and the advantage they have at the time over other us/eu airlines    now i dont think ana will fky the a380s to anywhere outside hnl i dont think gum will get it either    these a380s ana will be getting are not tails that originally designated for skymark those have already went to ek the anas order is technically a new order although originating from skymarks situation    kansai can take a380  haneda can also take a380 but its taxiway configuration make it generally unavailable to airlines in rush hour  on japanese aviation photo database there are photos of a380 present at cts too so landing and take off shouldnt be a problem although i am not sure about the gate which it might need remote stand    for domestic flight in china the market is still immature many people are still using cheap multiday old trains to make long distance trip instead of spending 150usd to fly the route which would have only take 2 hours or so and then theres also competition from subsidized high speed train and quota on widebody fleet purchase    as foe 747sr in domestic japan routes imo the two big killers are itamis quad ban and 773s efficiency and capacity bankrupt of ana and jal caused by raising oil price and other factors speeded up the process of fleet renewal and give raise to the concept of capacity discipline in domestic japan market but thats only auxiliary to the two aforementioned factors  as for expanded shinkansen network they arent that competitive at that long distance so thats also minor stagnated economy stagnated not cut demand
    hokuriku shinkansen have also given up fgt    faggots btfo joking aside should i assume the development and operating costs for making a variablegauge hsr is too much for the companies liking    future fgt development will be focused on for private railways with different track gauge    how many private railways could actually utilize it besides kinki due to its southosaka system being narrow gauge instead of the rest of its standard gauge network both systems intersect at kashiharajingumae but the kashihara line ends at that station as yoshino line south of that station is narrow gauge
  too much for the companies liking  difficulties in development and operational  manufacturing costs are cited as reasons  operational cost would be increased due to heavier trains production cost would be increased due to it being more complex and maintenance cost would be increase due to necessary inspection and replacement of axle because of the discovered trouble about axles  and then it would also need more time to develop and test alternative solutions for the axle wearing problem  and then other reasons cited are the developing fgt will be slower than sanyo shinkansen max speed thus disrupt time table and such although it wont be a problem for hokuriku shinkansen with 260 max speed however hokuriku shinkansen version fgt will need additional investment and development for antisnow procedure  and another roadblock against fgt service between nagasaki and shinosaka seems to be amount of platforms available at shinosaka  where can they be used  for instance kamakama line kintetsu meitetsu through service naniwasuji line any number of private railroads using 1372/1435mm lines to offer through service with jr lines through service between conventional jr lines and mini shinkansen lines convert the section of railway leading up to narita airport railway station into dual allow dual track operation instead of parallel single track through service to sakhalin
jr freight sanin operation started
more jnr era 205 series emus are waiting to be shipped off to indonesia which will probably replace the even older trainsets that were transferred        convert the section of railway leading up to narita airport railway station into dual allow dual track operation instead of parallel single track    wouldnt it be better off and probably less expensive for them to just make both tracks dual gauge instead this applies to naniwasuji as well regarding your various examples would any additional revenue from operating intersystem services be able to offset the costs of additional infrastruture dedicated trainsets and maintenance
  replacing mushashino line stock  gotta press x to doubt on that chief     but real talk is the mushashino going to get e231500s or are more sobu line 231s going to be spilling over since the sobu line is getting all those e231500s recently
  wouldnt it be better off and probably less expensive for them to just make both tracks dual gauge instead this applies to naniwasuji as well regarding your various examples would any additional revenue from operating intersystem services be able to offset the costs of additional infrastruture dedicated trainsets and maintenance  that would depends on how much kintetsu can cut the operational cost of those trains i guess  but yeah given that it take at least so many seconds or even one or two minute cant recall how long it take to change the gauge it probably doesnt make the most sense to use fgt for such a short segment
  speaking of jr freight why do they still use the old jrf logo all over the place are they just too poor to repaint even the locomotives
ps moomin55 a cute
details of rinkai brts 2020 olympics initial operation and 2022 full opening   
  
    actually they have been removing the jrf logo from some of the locomotives since last year but im not sure if they will keep removing them
    the jap work culture is intense
  brtは渋滞対策として専用レーンを設けることもあるが都は原則設けない  whats the point of brt when you arent even going to put dedicated bus lane onto roads
   bus rapid transit   kanfuta when it is completed in 2020 is a main avenue thats somewhat limitedaccess with few intersections especiallt those tunnels and bridges at the very least i have to be appalled by the lack of signal priority   its more like a suburban / intracity express bus which japan is more familiar to   their terminology with lrt and brt is quite bad
     brtとはbus rapid transitの略です連節バスicカードシステム道路改良等により路面電車と比較して遜色のない輸送力と機能を有しかつ柔軟性を兼ね備えたバスをベースとした都市交通システムを指します  they treat brt like a modernized improved bus same as their lrt as the contemproary tram over the traditional streetcar ie 次世代型路面電車 like how longer articulated trams in hiroshima sapporo are hailed as lrt   it is scathing tokyo would do worse in brt and lrt than other lesser cities
  nah kan2 section there wont be completed until 2022 in 2020 they will have a temporary onground straight road connecting rinkai area to the city but it will only have 1 lane per direction
  my input was cut short meant to type out the 2020 and 2022 arrangement in full         longer articulated low floor trams
  the yellow one will in that image will open later this year just before the new fish market openiirc   then they will work on the orange road whichs expected to open in 2020 march

  プレ運行時の表定速度は1115km/h程度運賃220円前トビラ乗車が原則となりこれまでの路線バスとあまり変わりありません    本格運行時にはlrt水準の表定速度20km/hを目指します運賃も値上げが検討され全トビラから乗車できるようになります  it really isnt attractive     frequency during prelaunch time 6/hour during peak hour 4/hour for other time  and you call it brt  when the systen fully launched 20/hour at peak 12/hour offpeak  this seems slightly more reasonable  the figure is actually the combined figures for all the routes in the system the least frequent route will only get 2/hour during peak time and some stops wont be served at all during off peak hours  what    fuel cell buses  are they really reliable for the purpose of brt    naming competition  saw someone saying why not just name it corporate slave transporter
nankai seems to be really taking a huge hit from the typhoon
rip kansai airport bridge
  when shinkansen trains stop at maibara station theres a patient with emergency circumstances in a nozomi train stopping on a track without platform and thus a simple corridor was made to transport the patient via another shinkansen train
  wow i get those older catenary structures have quite a bit of surface area compared to the modern ones but thats crazy
  its the 11 foot width anon lots of countries have heights that are similar or taller but not even russia has trains that wide
jr east announced that they will replace the e217 series emu currently used for the yokosukasobu rapid line with e235 series emu the base 11car will have the same 6m5t configuration as the ones running on the yamanote line and it will keep the 2 green cars which will have power outlets and wifi the amount of cars/sets that will be built will be the same number as the e217 51 11car sets and 46 4car sets for a total of 745 cars        ignoring on some peoples opinion on its frontal design but doesnt it require to have a door for emergency evacuation as per some japanese law as it does run on underground tracks in tokyo or would its emergency batteries be enough to circumvent that        the station looks like it is on fire  google image reverse search finds out it is a station for nanaki named ozaki station  finds out that it was burned down due to what most likely an electrical fire    just
  jr east to replace yokosuka/sobu rapid e217s with e235s starting fy2020 personally i find the cab end coloring scheme kinda ugly any thoughts on whats going to happen to the e217 rolling stock
  i believe russian loading gauges are at least that wide
  seems like it have to do with tunnel design and that some trains currently run in jr tunnels dont have frontal doors either   jrの地下区間は全て横から脱出可能な設計です実際255系が乗り入れしていますしe217系も途中から非貫通で製造されました  comment taken from comment area of certain news site    i like the yamamote line coloring of e235 but this is not
sakhalin west coast line still havent been regauged
  i absolutely love the look of those trains
typhoon in kansai  jr hokkaido still gets fucked    will they ever catch a break
  er this typhoon maintained its strength around hokkaido actually even russian territory like sakhalin and primorsky are also damaged by it
  jr shikoku took a direct hit and still has less lines closed
  apparently not given the earthquake
    地震に伴う停電の影響により当面の間全道で運転を見合わせています  停電のためホームページの更新もできない状況です  literally all the trains in entire hokkaido including even the hokkaido shinkansen have stopped running due to power outage caused by the earthquake  and even the homepage cannot be updated for the same reason
  its like a tropical depression strength  wtf japan
  the typhoon still maintained a minimum pressure of 974hpa when it convert into extratropical system on russian coast
  at most thats a category 2 hurricane thats absolutely sad we still fuck around outside at that strength
it seems like it take more than a week before the power supply at hokkaido can be fully restored  will hokkaido shinkansen stop running till then
  start trying to run hokkaido shinkansen at 210km/h during night time if therere no problem then all shinkansen trains in seikan tunnel can run at speed up to 160
  but jr hokkaido is like 90 dieselshit they should be able to deal w/it
  and it landed in god damn neyagawa 10km away
  what about signals and such
  for wusses
  couldnt even bother to put on the new jr logo after repainting  sad    what the fuck is that on the side though
    e217s are close to 30 years old so directly scrapped
  nah theyre going on the musashino line   who am i fucking kidding youre right theyre more than likely going to be scrapped
      some of them could replace kanto 211s and nikko/utsunomiya line 205s i feel they wont use them in nagano area
  nikko/utsunomiya line 205s  i dont see that since those where just freshly retrofited but i do see those 4 car sets going towards the ryomo/takasaki line tbh the e217 look like utter dogshit in shonan livery this photo doesnt show how actually gross it is in person
    all the kanto 211s are gone if i recall the last ones were on the tokaido line tohoku line and sobu line medium distance tokaido 211s were retired in 2012 the last tohoku 211s were retired in 2014 and the boso 211s were replaced by refurbbed exkeihintohoku 2090s renumbered 2092000/2200     unless im missing some the only 211s left under jres jurisdiction are the ones in the kofu/matsumotoarea    as for the 205sthere were two runs the original 2050s which were retired in 2013 or 2014 i cant remember they were replaced with refurbbed exsaikyo 205s sans 6door cars i think itll be years before the 205600s are replaced    on the subject of the yokosuka e235the e217s arent really that old and didnt they just get refurbbed in 2010 i was under the impression that jr intended on keeping e217s around forever like jr west did with the osaka loop line 103s will they be given a subseries numbering like e235系900番台 and run on the singletracked portion between yokosuka and kurihama    by the way do jres garages tokyo general/osaki takasaki tamachi oyama etc correspond to a certain line or lines or do lines mix and match rolling stock like how the uenotokyo line sources trains from both kozu and oyama depots and you can get organizations with a 10car e231  5car e233    and whats up with all the garage shuffles like the 山スカ 115s/211s they originally were split between mitaka and matsumoto depot then moved to toyoda depot and finally nagano depot or the tokaido line which used to run out of tamachi then it was moved to kozu depot in 2013 then of course uenotokyo line fucked things up what motivated these roster/garage shuffles it makes it hell trying to keep track of roster movements
    this photo doesnt show how actually gross it is in person    should i assume the shade of green is a lot worse in person        well this is the current stock levels for the jnr 211 series as of april 1st 2018 sauce japanese wiki pages    takasaki rsc 134 cars 23 4car sets and 14 3car sets operates on joetsu shinetsu ryomo agatsuma and utsunomiya line between koyama and utsunomiya    nagano rsc 192 cars 14 6car sets and 36 3car sets operates on shinetsu shinonoi chuo west of tachikawa oito and iida lines    will they be given a subseries numbering like e235系900番台 and run on the singletracked portion between yokosuka and kurihama    considering that they will have a different configuration as the e2350 series 92 green car plus 4car sets itll probably have a different subnumber ie 1000 and 3000    cont next post since itd be better to seperate talking about each which lines each garage serve
cont    by the way do jres garages tokyo general/osaki takasaki tamachi oyama etc correspond to a certain line or lines    yes they do as all the cars do have their own home garages ill just list the various branches that serve the tokyo area since listing everything else would be an even bigger wall of text sources are from jp wikipedia which are just taken from various rail publications that publishes rolling stock inventory books on a regular basis    tokyo  tokyo general yamamote e231500 e2350 and imperial car e6551  oku nogami e655 shikishima e001 cassiopeia e26 and other passenger cars  matsudo joban rapid  narita e2310 and joban/chiyoda/odawara lines 2091000 and e2332000    hachioji  toyoda chuo rapid e2330  mitaka chuosobu 209500 e2310/500 and chuosobu/tozai e231800    takasaki joetsu shinetsu ryomo agatsuma and utsunomiya lines 115 211    chiba  keiyo keiyo 209500 e2335000 and musashino 205 209500 e2310  makuhari various lines for boso area various 209s 255 and e257500    yokohama  kamakura yokosukasobu rapid e217 yokohama e2336000 and narita express e259  nagahara tsurumi 205 and nanbu e2338000  kozu sagami 205 suburban lines e2311000 and e2333000 and liners 215    omiya  omiya various express trains 185 251 253 and 6511000  saitama keihintohoku and negishi lines e2331000  kawagoe saikyo e2337000 kawagoe  hachiko mix of 205 209 and e231 and the mue train  koyama suburban lines e2311000 and e2333000 nikko  utsunomiya 205 and karasuyama eve301    mito  katsuda hitachi/tokiwa e657 mito and joban lines e501 e531    what motivated these roster/garage shuffles    tamachi is no longer a formal garage in 2013 when all the cars were moved to various garages most of the garages are usually under specific main branches
  i remember it being highlighter shade more than a darker green that the e231/233s where
since jr hokkaido loses money every day it operates does not operating at all actually save it cash
  probably only a bit since maintenance is a huge part of their cost that do not vary even if therere no trains running
first pictures of the jr west 2271000 emus are out 28 2car sets will be built to replace the jnr era 105 and 117 series emu used in the wakayama area the main differences besides the green livery are that itll feature all bench seats instead of a mix of cross/bench seats and ic reader            highlighter shade    absolutelyharamjpg        you know theyll still need to pay the staff to actually check and repair any infrastructure damaged by the earthquake which costs more money 
  火災のため閉鎖されている本線尾崎駅はホームにスロープを設置し9月11日から営業を再開することになった
after 31 years of service after its conversion into a joyful train the very last kiha 58 series dmu kenji will finally be retired        according to nankai it appears that they will build temporary entrances ramp and ic readers included and toilets on both platforms so those who dont use ic cards will need to acquire bording certificates from staff to be used when disembarking and actually have to walk around the block if you have to go to the other direction as there will be no bridge    
    why was the 227 series chosen as the base model isnt wakayama on the hanwa line i thought kansaiarea trains would have been used kind of like how how the 113 series running on the wanman section of the fukuchiyama line was replaced by 2car 2235500 series in this case there could be a 2255500 or something based on the upgraded 2255100s already running on the hanwa line
    im assuming the 227 was chosen is due to the fact that it was meant to replace shorter train sets used in that area although for 117s case you can just like 2 sets together and all the 225 sets have a minimum of 4 cars    implying itll make a difference when all the newer jr west rolling stocks are literal samefaces anyway
  you and i wish  tfw ywn ride 90s / 00s jap trains again
    only 90s/00s  not jnr era trains    despite their age i find them to be more comfy
    it appears that the damaged section of the bridge has been removed so work on repairing the railway section can begin the rough estimate is around 3 to 4 weeks to restore rail service to the airport    
which unbuilt railway lines in japan do you wish had come to fruition and which existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources
the rest of the sanyo main line that was affected by the flood in july will reopen on september 30th however parts of the kure fukuen and gelbi lines are still undergoing repairs and wont resume service until early 2019            which existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources    since the sanko line just closed recently ill have to say itll have to the ongoing restoration process for the section of the tadami line that was closed due to the flooding in 2011 apparently itll be completed in 2021
  unbuilt railway lines in japan do you wish had come to fruition  narita shinkansen  existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources  too many to list
  which unbuilt railway lines in japan do you wish had come to fruition  shikoku shinkansen via awaji even though it wouldve been a white elephant  which existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources  hokkaido shinkansen which while i like can get fucked because it killed the remaining night trains besides the sunrise expresses plus objectively it will never make cash
   narita shinkansen   unbuilt railway lines in japan you wish had never come to fruition and railway lines you think are a waste of resources in its planned alignment
     which unbuilt railway lines in japan do you wish had come to fruition    tsukuba express extended to marunouchi and being run by jr as joban new line instead of the thirdsector ownership     which existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources    joetsu shinkansen its a pork barrel 土建国家 project that was only built because the shadow shogun kakuei tanaka is from niigata
  does the joetsu not turn a profit
  土建国家  ma boy
  hnd/rjtt having a380 service  besides the obvious operator who would operate that plane and for what route would it work
basic functionality tests including the selfpropulsion thru battery at 5 km/h for the preproduction shinkansen n700s set has been completed from october 10th onwards jr central will run tests on 8car configurations for 2 months and perform long term tests in 16cars and testing selfpropulsion at 30 km/h in 2019    
  which unbuilt railway lines in japan do you wish had come to fruition  high speed commuter rail line across tokyo bay but was there any plans for this   and which existing railway lines do you think are a waste of resources  all local line that see construction started in 1950s1970s
   was there any plans for this  depends on definition of plan no idea yes
  gulf carriers by which i mean qatar etihad and emirates  all 3 have large hubs through which they operate and with premium services they would be capable of competing against the asian and european airlines which are offering direct flights in smaller aircraft like the a350 and 777/787  the gulf carriers dont do many routes to japan korea and china though i guess that this could mean that they have the option to expand their operations
  almost all current a380 operators in the world can deploy their aircraft onto hnd route if hnd can be redesigned to allow efficient use of a380 in the airport
  me3 are bilateral limited in china  infrastructure of secondary airports in korea like pusan/taegu limited the possibility of long haul routes out of then  japan other than the three metro area fukuoka/sendai/sapporo/niigata/hiroshima/kagoshima/okayama that come afterwards all have only like a million or so population that might not worth sending any of those me3 long haul planes in despite you can argue that fuk can serve as entry point for entire kyushu and cts for entire sapporo travellers could still book their tickets with transfer to local airports instead
i have been to hakodate hokkaido japan to see my grandma this month and i boarded a train of isaribi railwaysouth hokkaido railway company it was good
heres the interior of different train of the same railway
the train was full of students in school uniforms on their way home in early evening it was good to see local train being used for the commute of everyday life of local people
  isaribi railway  third sector  give it 15 years max b4 ded
  even if passenger services stop operating the line will probably still exist for freight services
          this is the story ive heard so bear with me    where the a380 shines is highdensity  lots of business demand ulh routes between slotcontrolled airports    ba singapore thai emirates korean all fit this bill     thai has bkklhr sq/ke fly a380s to sfo/lax qantas has sydsinlhr emirates funnels traffic from congested airports in europe lin/mad/bcn/cph/etc to asia/australia via dxb    already the business case for domestic a380s in japan doesnt make sense  small densely populated country 1500 miles from north to south 150 miles across  high speed rail network that has been expanded in the last 20 years especially with the kyushu shinkansen in 2004 and hokkaido shinkansen in 2016  most of japans population is concentrated in or around tokyo commuter trains and shinkansen are entirely sufficient    ever since the 777/a330 made highercapacity twinjets feasible emphasis has been reduced on domestic 747s jals domestic 777300s have 500 seats anas domestic 787s have 335 seats the breakthroughs in engine technology in the a350 will make jals 777s look like gas guzzlers by comparison    japans other population centers are close enough apart that shinkansen covers most intercity travel for journeys that are too long for shinkansen where air travel wins out lowerdensity routes can be served with 737s/a320s while higherdensity routes hndfuk itmoka etc can use the 767s/777s flights are turned around extremely quickly which means frequent air departures frequency is a big reason why shinkansen wins out on so many routes with fewer aircraft and less fuel consumption jal runs 16 round trips a day between haneda and sapporo departures every hour and sometimes every 30 minutes     youre not going to put an a380 on hndfuk or hnditm when shinkansen  a larger number of 737s/767s/777s can meet demand especially since an a380 consumes gas like brent kavanaugh consumes beer
  the gulf carriers dont do many routes to japan korea and china though i guess that this could mean that they have the option to expand their operations    emirates daily a380 to narita daily 77l to haneda daily 77w to osaka    etihad daily 7879s to narita and nagoya auhpekngo    qatar daily 77w to narita daily a350900 to haneda    turkish daily 77w to narita at its peak mid2015 turkish had double daily 77w service to nrt and daily a330200 service to kix the cuts were probably due to the subsequent political chaos in turkey    emirates is also switching from 77w to a380 on the dubaiosaka route starting october 28th
  what you are talking are all just secondary and tertiary analysis of a380 based on its cost and revenue potential  the cost per seat of the current short a380 is not lower than 77w by a lot and thus the financial incentive is weak in japan  slot expansion have been made in japanese airports and also via bankruptcy process both airlines increased their average load factor so plane with capacity higher than 773 is currently unneeded  itm banned 4engine aircraft which limited a lot of operation and i think ot is the key reason  shinkansen only have marginal presence on longer routes like hndfuk and such that you mentioned  as for using large number of 737/767 to meet the demand you have to know that why they didnt do it was because of airport slot restriction and large travel demand factors i mentioned above alleviated it but it still exists hence why theyre still mainly using widebodies on these routes  and then as for fuel consumption a380s fuel consumption per passenger wont be higher than other operating widebodies as long as you can fill all the seats a stretched and updated a380 would provide a more obvious fuel burn advantage but thats for other discussions    also i believe the difference in fuel burn between a350 and 777 are within the range of singledigit
long test shinkansen is long
    why they have such long noses airplanes have shorter
  airplanes dont have to deal with tunnels and all the aerodynamic problems that tunnels cause
  hm
     i just realized said brent kavanaugh instead of brett kavanaugh  お前様がしぎぢぎづう     also i believe the difference in fuel burn between a350 and 777 are within the range of singledigit    does this take into account that the domestic 777s which were delivered between the 90s to the mid 2000s have pw4000s i find it hard to believe that the fuel burn of the trent xwb is comparable to the old and inefficient pw4000     the cost per seat of the current short a380 is not lower than 77w by a lot and thus the financial incentive is weak in japan    oh yeah one thing i forgot to mention is that domestic flights in japan already run at pretty low load factors which im sure doesnt make the financial argument much better      slot expansion have been made in japanese airports    besides haneda and naritas expanded terminals the only expansion airports i can think of are ukb and kkj and arent those airports limited to lccs    anyway this is more of a subject for /gag/
  its alright anon it can be hard keeping up with the msm propaganda
    the current end cars for the e5/h5 shinkansen sets already have very little capacity as is 29 ordinary class / 18 gran class  the 22m nose car for the alfax will have even less capacity    is there even a point to put seats in those cars if they ever adopt the really long nose end cars when you will probably get half the capacity of the current ones which would make it around 9 gran class and 15 ordinary class
  gran class becomes more exclusive    in programming terms its not a bug its a feature
  duckbills have gone too gar
    e5 and e6 are pretty much dildo trains at this point due to how phallic they are compared to the 700/n700s which have capacity restraints as all tokaido/sanyo 16car sets must have 1323 seats
  ive riding these exmusashino line jr2055000 series in jakarta on daily basis they served the jakarta inner city commuter ring rilway
few jr2055000 exmusashino line trainsets are now serves as the latest rolling stock operated by railway company pt kereta commuter indonesia the onboard lighting still uses the jr stock lightbulbs not yet being changed to local lightbulbs japanese writing still littering the trains interior pretty much they shipped the train from japan and put into operational status in jakarta in short time
  i wonder whats the small white box on the purpose for
  new livery for the 2055000 in jakarta
  testrun for the newlypurchased 2055000 exmusashino line in jakarta area
  jrs logo livery still clearly visible on the trainsets we dont even bother to cover it up with something we tend to leave these japanese remnants as it is as a reminder where we get these train from
  exmusashino line jr2055000 on a night sortie jakarta
  it says 非常燈 which means emergency lamp

gg hokkaido
jr kyushu revealed its new 821 series emu and yc1 dieselelectric hybrid cars to the public im not particular sure if putting the washroom in the midsection of the car instead of the back end for the yc1 is a good idea            implying the closure for the nonelectrified section of the sassho line isnt a foregone conclusion when it fucking bleeds money
  im talking about typhoon 25
so what is/was the fastest japanese steam train c62   would any running steam trains be able to handle a speed test
  that asia train they run in manchuko
  iirc there was a faster run done by a c62 on the tokaido line getting up to 80 mph the two wikipedia entries the one on the asia express and the one on the c62 disagree on that im pretty sure i saw in a jr museum that the c62 did reach that speed on a passenger run but that was well after wwii
  i though those manchuko trains can go faster than 80mph
  sorry thought we were going off the maximum speed that they actually operated revenue service at just going off wikipedia the mantetsu asia express locomotive was apparently capable of 87 mph though it didnt go faster than 75 mph while running a service i dont see an actual top speed listed for the c62 but id assume its close
  aar plate f would like a word with you anon    literally only 6 inches less wide than shinkansen loading guage and 66 taller
  i have question indonesian anon why kai likes to import train from japan instead buy it from locally company like inca  what is the reason is it quality different specification or else
  any chance these guys will have green cars  i dont know which i find weirder the thought of a really long train going down the yokosuka line that doesnt have a green car or the fact that yamanote still doesnt have any  now i want to see a yamanote bilevel 
    pdf shows green cars  ask if they will include green cars    but yes it will include 2 green cars in the main 11car sets just like the e217 sets did
  not that anon but its more about the cost and need kci needs a lot of trainsets for their rapid expansion and importing secondhand trains are cheaper than building new ones also most inka emu heavy rail trains have lots of reliability problems though at least theyre getting better the new lrt cars are looking pretty good
sanyo mainline will be fully restored tomorrow and hr freight will stop sanin line alternative operation
which lines do electrified freight still is there a good english database for japanese electric freight and passenger locomotives or a book published on this and ive seen a map in one of these threads before showing which lines in the country are electrified could someone repost it please thanks
tokyo metro revealed the new 2000 series emu to the public it is slated to replace the 02 series in the marunouchi line starting at 2019    
  god that face is awful   why didnt they just take the 1000 series and paint it red with the white line and sine wave
    it looks like a giant tesla grille
  usually almost everything thats not in hokkaido
  phew thats only half bad but its horrendous in the whole context with 80s90s looking stations    because muh progress and muh design  the 1000 is pinnacle of modern train design and all new trains should derive off of it prove me wrong
amazing how they nailed it here  yet completely shit the bed here  to me the 2000 series has to be the worst looking of the modern tokyo metro stock
  cockpit section takes up only one car  why stop there there should be an entire car dedicated just the nose section and another car for the cockpit section
  what could of have been
with odakyus retirement of its other two 7000 series lse romancecar emus they are planning to sell merchandises by reusing its curtains tables and such proceeds will be used to fund the ongoing preservation for one of the 3100 series nse romancecar control cars i have to wonder if theres someone mad enough to spend 600k yen on a goddamn chair that is technically as is and yes this is the first part of the project so expect more absurdly priced memorabilia    
the train that derailed in taiwan and killed 22 and counting is a train exported by japan apparently there were some mechanical problems with the train before it details the train unit was only 6 years old cause of accident still unknown
  getting the speed up to 140 km/h on a tight r300 curve with rail gauge of 1067mm where speed limit for the tilting train is 75  literally why anyone would do this
  because pt inka industri kereta api have not been able yet to produce a reliable and affordable emus inkas rolling stock kfw i9000 are always experienced breakdowns technical problems high prices and maintenance costs are the reason why pt kci kereta commuter indonesia subordinate of pt kai kereta api indonesia chose to import japanese emus due to their reliability and familiarity weve been operating japanese emus since 1976
ah just realized that earlier this year tokyo picked 6 lines to establish a fund for and direct funding to  kamakama line  haneda access line  tama monorail northern extension to hakonegasaki  tama monorail southern extension to machida  tokyo metro line 8 yorakucho line koto ward northsouth connection  tokyo metro line 12 oedo line oizumigakuen extension
  kamakama line    which kamas are we talking about here    kamakura to 
  
see video about new seibu trains being delivered  look up what the 50000 series looks like under the protective plastic  mfw  why japan why do you do this
    is there a link for that all the actual pictures of the train set i see only had the protective plastic when it was being transported from hitachis factory to seibu
  videos i referred to are these they were uploaded yesterday    
thought it was just a meme  
  second last trolleybus service in japan ending soon later this year and will be replaced by battery electric bus and theyre bow organizing a tour to let people listen to the sound of vvvf inverter of the trolleybus when its running
ive always wanted to find out more about the history of japans railways but because japan is even more antisocial than me its much harder to find english sources for theirs than it is for other countries     then somebody linked me this     yeah thats an entire index of japanese railway and transport articles    guess ive got new reading material
  typhoonsama is fearsome
  im riding in one right now they feel pretty nice     also i hate my commutes ube to hofu and ube to shimonoseki get home so late
    the fact that their press release for the laview doesnt show the full body shot of the lead cars say a lot about the design    
seibu railway limited exp   new train
  honestly who looked at that and said yea thats good
  probably your mom
    considering the designer in question she probably would be old enough to be our moms    
  d e s i g n l e s s  e s i g n l e s s  s i g n l e s s  i g n l e s s  g n l e s s  n l e s s  l e s s  e s s  s s  s
  tell me theyre going to paint that at least
  all indications lead to no
  not in english  antisocial  stop being so anglocentric
    autistic    somehow thats the design
    lol is this why weebs exist theyre so stupid that they think this person speaks my language poorly means this person is a social retard just like me
a number of changes to the chuo line east limited express services coming next spring like abandoning of super azusa name as train model get unified to be e353 removal of free seating and introduce the new seatyettoassign ticket similar to the service on tokiwa line limited expresses new through service to fujikyu railway for direct service to mount fuji and fujikyu support new ticketless ic card method of payment while abolishing regulars discount tickets and also adjusting the price a bit        
      ok but weebs aside asian cultures are typically more conservative and less outspoken than western ones arent they like just compare taking the train in the us or tokyo or something
  how  inb4 american people are more likely to make a conversation in english to stranger on trains than japanese people
    japan isnt antisocial just xenophobic and also entirely unwilling to travel abroad or study overseas unless its to hawaii or guam or sometimes the philippines/thailand/vietnam koreans are flooding western universities to escape hell korea but japanese people just shrug their shoulders and say 海外怖いよねしょうがない    2chs railway board is also a pretty good place if you know japanese unfortunately they ban foreign ips theres also jns forum or the skyscrapercitycom forums for english discussion    
  a number of changes to the chuo line east limited express services coming next spring like abandoning of super azusa name as train model get unified to be e353 removal of free seating and introduce the new seatyettoassign ticket similar to the service on tokiwa line limited expresses new through service to fujikyu railway for direct service to mount fuji and fujikyu support new ticketless ic card method of payment while abolishing regulars discount tickets and also adjusting the price a bit    i dont understand why there are three separate limited express services on the chuo line like whats the fuckin point    are these fujikyuko trains gonna run through to tokyo during rush hours like the rapid trains that run to otsuki
  theres also jns forum  i discovered this place a little while back they have a relatively active n scale japanese rail modeling community with a lot of really knowledgeable people that wont get their panties in a twist if something sint prototypical
    i dont understand why there are three separate limited express services on the chuo line like whats the fuckin point    azusa was the only limited express service on the chuo line until 1988 when it became two different services azusa for shinjuku  matsumoto and kaiji for shinjuku  kofu super azusa as added in 1994 when the e351 emu was introduced for the service and will folded back to azusa once all chuo line services use e353 in 2019    the third service between tokyo/shinjuku and fujiko is something different altogether as it runs on fujikyu line between otsuki and fujiko and only uses the 3car supplimentary sets due to short platforms
   i dont understand why there are three separate limited express services on the chuo line like whats the fuckin point    super azusa skips more stops and shaves 30 minutes off the shinjukumatsumoto travel time i think 1 roundtrip a day runs to chiba as well seasonal trips continue from matsumoto onto the jr west oito line used to be 1 daily roundtrip yearround until 2010 super azusa only runs shinjukumatsumoto kaiji exists because of the additional commuter demand between shinjuku and kofu between kofu and matsumoto is pretty sparsely populated even by koshinetsu standards also azusa/kaiji are 11 cars probably in order to fit on yamanote platforms but im not sure super azusa are 12 cars    but that does raise a question why the fuck does jr west operate a line in niigata     the third service between tokyo/shinjuku and fujiko is something different altogether as it runs on fujikyu line between otsuki and fujiko and only uses the 3car supplimentary sets due to short platforms    two roundtrips run from tokyo to kawaguchiko each day   weekdays rapid inbound early morning commuter rapid outbound late evening   weekends/hol chuo special rapid in both directions  the 64 car e233 sets decouple at takao with 6 cars continuing to otsuki and 4 cars running onto the fujikyuko line and of course viceversa in the mornings in this case theyre similar to the ome line roundtrips that decouple at haijima 6 cars run to musashiitsukaichi and 4 cars run on the electrified part of the hachiko line
    but that does raise a question why the fuck does jr west operate a line in niigata    during the privatization west japan railways gained control of the following lines in the sea of japan side of the mainland ishikawa toyama and niigata prefectures     hokuriku main line goes all the way to naoetsu in niigata prefecture   nanao line portions of it were transferred and partially abandoned after said transfer   himi line   johana line   takayama main line toyoma  inotani aka the portion in toyama prefecture   oito line itoigawa  minamiotari goes into nagano prefecture as well    after the hokuriku shinkansen opened the portion of the hokuriku main line between kanazawa and naoetsu were transferred to various third sector railways but jr west still controls the northern portion of the oito line and the two shinkansen stations in niigata itoigawa and joetsumyoko latter is shared with jr east so thats how it still has a line in niigata prefecture connected to the hokuriku shinkansen despite its nonexistent ridership 104 passenger/day/km in 2017
    or just look at it in a simpler way hokuriku is traditionally affiliated with kansai so the company that run western japan trains will obviously take over their operation
  super azusa skips more stops and shaves 30 minutes off the shinjukumatsumoto travel time i think 1 roundtrip a day runs to chiba as well seasonal trips continue from matsumoto onto the jr west oito line used to be 1 daily roundtrip yearround until 2010    youve got it backwards azusa was the one that served chiba some trips and used to have 1 roundtrip/day to minamiotari super azusa is shinjukumatsumoto only
now that yokosuka line is gonna get new trains does that mean every major tokyo line will be operating a rolling stock of shinkeiretsudensha design heres my running list     yamanote e235  chuosobu exyamanote e231500  keihintohoku e2331000  chuo rapid/ome/itsukaichi/hachiko e2330  sobu rapid/yokosuka future e235 suburban variant  tokaido/tohoku including ss and ut e2311000/e2333000  joban rapid e2310  joban localchiyoda line e2332000  joban mediumdistance  uenotokyo line e501/e531  nambu e2338000/exchuo rapid e2338500  musashino exchuosobu e2313000  keiyo e2335000  saikyorinkaikawagoe east e2337000  kawagoe westhachiko exchuosobu e2313000  hamasen e2336000
  new rolling stock on musashino line  gonna press x to doubt on that chief
jr hokkaido is also going to partner with express delivery service provider and carry those parcels within passenger trains  apparently limited to northern part of soya main line for now
  you know all these 205s are going to be shipped to indonesia right
    azusa was the one that served chiba some trips and used to have 1 roundtrip/day to minamiotari    actually that is still a thing but only one service begins/ends in chiba and minamiotari respectively        the only real correction is that the exchuosobus are e2310s    sobu rapid/yokosuka future e235 suburban variant    apparently the only major differences compared to the yamanote e235s will be having toilets and the 2 green cars in the middle as they will do away with the box seats and just go full bench seats        he keeps saying the same thing to the point it is basically a meme in this thread
  i say x to doubt because those musashino line 205s arent being replaced yet also the e2313000 are 4 car kawagoe line the mu2 is just a single e2310 set from the chuosobu line what i see from jns forum is that the e2310 is going to replace the musashino line rolling stock from both the joban and chuosobu line but nothing official so far
a e653 just got repainted recently and boy does it look nice in old jnr colors
       the only real correction is that the exchuosobus are e2310s    cars from e2310 sets b5 and b6 were used to create new 4car sets 41 and 42 these were renumbered e2313000 and assigned to the kawagoe westhachiko line im guessing they were reclassified from 0 to 3000 because those lines have 80m platforms 4x20m cars kind of like how the exkeihintohoku 2090s were reassigned when assigned to mediumdistance sobu line services on the boso peninsula because on kt they were 10cars but on sobu they are 4cars or sometimes 6cars    this is a big reason why theres no thruservice between the two halves of the kawagoe line lolnospoilerwell that and matoba/musashitakahagi/komagawa are inaka af and the only landmark of note is tokyo international university/lolnospoiler     the mu2 is just a single e2310 set from the chuosobu line     i mean mu2 might just be only one set but its still better than nothing the musashino 2050s were the last 205s ever built from new and have been the oldest urban trains in jrs tokyo fleet and the last jnrera design ever since the last chuo 201s were retired in 2010
    i guess i screwed up on me quoting on things the musashino line e231s are still e2310s as they only took out two trailer cars to reduce the car count from 10 to 8 but yes the kawagoe line are e2313000s and they will apparently put 6 4car sets into service    i mean mu2 might just be only one set but its still better than nothing    it seems that there are 3 e2310 sets right now mu2 mu31 and mu32 and there should be more moving in as more e235s enter service and the e231500s get moved to chuosobu line        that looks much better than the cg render apparently it is the u108 set from the niigata rsc and will be trasferred back to katsuda rsc where it was originally stationed
fukuoka mayor candidate want to build a ropeway that connect fukuoka station to the fukuoka harbor in order to alleviate congestion  why is it always fukuoka that propose retarded urban planning idea and the mayor is also the current mayor of the city which seems to have a high chance to be reelected despite i am not familiar with the politics there given that his opponent is a newcomer supported by japanese communist party  and how he reached the conclusion that the ropeway can provide half the transportation capacity of a metro
ah talking about ropeway theyre removing the remain of mount aso ropeway stations because its difficult to restore them due to damage from earthquake and volcano eruption and theres currently no plan for restoration yet 
    ridership income expenditure and losses for fy2017 for all jr hokkaido lines they changed the way they calculate ridership which lead to an increase in the usage statistic for the furano and sapporo area lines and a decrease in eastern hokkaido especially the portion of the nemuro line from kushiro to nemuro everything else is as youd expect
  fucking japan and their horrific novelty designs     they have such an incredible design culture yet they either go for bland boxes or dumbass goofy looking dross    i blame the manufacturers and operators design process being dominated by the engineers  japs love hard science
    eh thats not a bad thing    japan builds ugly bullshit all over its beautiful mountains so losing a ropeway and getting some fatties to actually use their legs isnt much of a problem
  theyre having a replacement bus now  and still it seems luke they might rebuild it in future
  there could have been much better way to make it even if the goal is to have a steel tube
  shinkansen operational coefficient  202  transportation density  drop from 5600 to 4500  it cant be helped
  oh of course   i was so naive to think they wouldnt have a スカイラインor some other katakana english named road just smashed up the side anyway    reminds me of the time i hiked ibukiyama near maibara only to find a car park and a tourist centre 20 m from the summit or actually that time i hiked hieisan in kyoto  no wait also fucking takao san lmao oh and iwakisan in aomori too    自然と環境を破壊する土建国家は自民党の政策で栄える
  their policy successfully influenced china and then china further projected the policy onto all developing countries around the world  can it be said that they indirectly ruined half or even more parts of the earth
  i like you we think alike    it can be said but only halfway china took it to a new extreme and have nearly completed turning their country in to a concrete wasteland and eliminating all tradition and culutre they used to ahve
  try climbing fuji from the base for 8 hours pass through the ruins of the old rest stations and arrive at the 5th station where all the lazy fat fuck american tourists are getting off to climb fuji fukuzatsu na kanji fampai    not to say that those longer hikes arent worth it for the solitude from the masses that start further up and the neat shit you find
last week on the 9th there was a major incident in sapporo where a signal box actually got uprooted and fell onto the tracks due to strong winds near the shin sapporo station as a result a 3 hour delay occured on the chitose line while crews had to remove the signal box and check other signals        currentyear  ever expecting infrastructure usage will keep growing after the novelty wears off and wont regress back to the mean unless it really saves people time    shiggy        try climbing fuji from the base for 8 hours    im curious as to where did you start climbing
  im curious as to where did you start climbing  from the fujiyoshida sengen jinja trail only proper base to summit trail left as far as im aware
what are these things called    i know this isnt 100 related to trains but ive seen these kind of things in photos of railway line inaugurations in japan
  割り玉
i wonder if some people know how far is too far with the monstrosity that the e235 since some people just take the horrible design to the max
  wow the design isnt really anything special but that twotone door colour scheme is absolutely horrible
  jesus christ who approved this trash  on an unrelated note    towns along the southern portion of the hidaka line hidakamombetsu to samani finally give up and agree to closure of that portion fate of mukawa to hidakamombetsu still up in the air
 actually it is keisei hakubutsukan doubutsuen eki
hello i will be going to japan from hawaii to meet my grandfather does anyone know the best way to get to shikoku i have to get to otoyo where my grandfather will meet me
  fly to kochi and take the dosan line
  local media compare the train to japanese icefish  hahhahahahha
if jr central can bore a tunnel between kofu and iida then why cant jr east bore a tunnel between nagano and toyama
    volume of traffic between nagano and toyama will probably never be able to offset the cost of constructing such a long and deep tunnel for jr east remember that most of the tokaido shinkansen ridership between tokyo and nagoya and eventually shinosaka as well will probably be shifted to the chuo shinkansen once it opens
  actually while chuo shinkansen tunnels will indeed be constructed by as in its construction cost will be paid by jr central i dont think thats the case for hokuriku shinkansen at all as in wasnt that supposed to be paid by national government and regional government  humm looking at online information it seems like there are also problem with the geology around there and also the environment there might result in more opposition  and then maybe there were no such technology back then when the route was decided unlike now
jr series 205 number m10 and m12 is now on the way to jakarta being the 9th and 10th former musashino 205s shipped to jakarta
not railway but still in japan  
    even with the cost being shared by different levels of government the cost of digging such long tunnels through the alps is still probably too much for them to handle and they probably want convenient shinkansen stations throughout the route which is something you dont get if you dig through the mountains        so are they replacing those trolley buses powered by overhead wires with electric buses is the only major advantage less infrastructure maintenance
  that is railway per japanese law    not really hokuriku shinkansen have barely anything positive to niigata similar to situation saga is facing now with nagasaki shinkansen    and then for the trolleybus other than infrastructure maintenance cost i think another reason is that existing trolleybus are already 20 years old and is time to be replaced and that battery bus are simply cheaper than trolley bus  also emember the reason why they use trolleybus in the first place was just that they dont want engine emission within the tunnel and capability wise there are nothing that favor a system that use catenary instead of regular buses especially in such a place with so many snow and is singletracked within the tunnel anyway if you look at the system from railway point of view so it doesnt really benefit from other advantages of trolleybuses and have mo reason to continues using it when now we have emissionfree battery buses

  obligatory burger post to make way for everyone else   freight capacity is excellent but literally everything else is mediocre at best and trash at worst i like to think it will get better though
  they are often late by several minutes trains get canceled slight snow means apocalypse ac works only up to about 30c if at all  the rolling stock isnt exactly new cars are everything from the 80s to recent models some stuff is even older  locomotives are a total clusterfuck that includes everything from steam powered freight trains to modern hsr and 160 km/h commuter trains in regular service    im from germany
nonexistent since 1936 there is a museum with a short loop of track though
over complicated as fuck and called railways oh and theirs only a 75 chance youll be on time
  im gonna guess that your british
  
  if  is right your being very optimistic some stations its rarer for a train to be on time than late or cancelled
    im going to reply as if each state in the us is a country because each can widely vary on what kind of trains exist in it    welcome to the state of new jersey where we are an hour from everything and we dont care what you think    nec upgrades have almost completed allowing for trains to run at 135mph from trenton to new brunswick  at the same time that fucking portal bridge and hudson tunnels are always causing problems  ptc upgrades have been annoying  my local commuter train/subway patco is unironically the best in the line in the state  new plans to build and expand the network are in place  on time performance has been good everywhere except for the nec but guess which line is the most used    we need more wawas built into commuter stations im just saying
  delayed  t german
amazing freight capacity highest freight rail modal share of any country 68  powerful locomotives pull trains multiple km long across an entire continent id say its pretty impressive    passenger service toronto and montreals commuter rail systems are okay in places theyre even pretty good lakeshore lines in toronto come to mind outside of that though passenger service is nearly nonexistent and where it does exist its constantly late underfunded expensive to ride and generally terrible    t canada
what do you all ride i have a trek roscoe 8 and a bikesdirect bike i think its called a monster gravity fat bike i enjoy them both opinions on off brands like bikesdirect or even dicks sporting goods vs name brand     pic is my roscoe 8
  sweet ride whats that little saddle pack looking thing hanging off the top tube i like the look of it and how do you like the bike good value for money no pic but i ride a norco charger 93 been a great bike so far
mid 10s diamondback hardtail i dont ride it much except around the neighborhood but they are finishing the rails to trails in my town so it should get more use    i rode a road bike 2000 miles this year but i enjoy the mtb when i can
  cove std with a boxxer front fork i tend to ride jumps mostly had the bike for quite a while theres something really fun about how flickable it is   i dont really like off brands since they arent really suitable for my style of riding
2013 specialized status 2 its more of specializeds touristy dh bike that youd see places renting except mine was always cared for so its in good shape the thing can rip on just about any trail you want it to

  gonna stop posting now and kms
  cool bike dogg
2012 kona tanuki bought it new in 2013 and have been upgrading very fun bike and somewhat lightish at 28lb
i scoff at these newer cx bikes    cross country 26  cx
  take a new picture already
  no
  yes
  that bike wouldnt be legal in my state for cyclocross based on the tires and the handlebars would disqualify it for cat 3 and up  or are you trying to say xc because thats a whole different ball game
  he means that old mtb are only good for riding fireroads
  i would dust yall on my other gt with with the rigid fork

how long did it take you to realize that mountain biking is just ritualized bike and body breaking

so i regularly see busses like these which can bring you from place to place over long distances they seem to be a lot cheaper pic related for example    i was wondering what your thoughts are related to these busses would you ever consider this option for medium distance travel because airtravel can be a pain or simply to absurd for this and hs trains even normal ones are undeniably more expensive internationally speaking
  long distance buses are the worst in my opinion  unless there is abolutely no infrastructure or regional airliners using turboprops just dont exist or are extortionately expensive i would rather just take the budget airliner or the train  the airliner will take about 2 hours max although time to get to and from the airport will add up however the flight itself will be short relative to the other modes  the train will be far more comfortable but at the very least the train will have a café car maybe even a restaurant car plus you are able to move around freely and the seat is comfortable    i took a 12 hour train journey in 2017 from some town in brandenburg germany to london gatwick airport and let me say that none of the trains were uncomfortable the least pleasant was the thameslink from st pancras to gatwick but ultimately the eurostar was excellent the ice 3m was wonderful the ice 2 was comfy and quiet and the stadler regional train was smooth  that journey cost about 90 though ive seen it go as low as 80 and this is without any rail cards  between a 245 flight a 12 hour train and a 20something hour bus id probably take the flight for convenience and the train for fun
  week in week out a friend would take a pos bus from the midlands to london to meet some chick had seen on the intertube because it was the cheapest way to get to her    muppet    his now wife id crawl there over broken glass to get there    where there is a will
greyhound with actual stations is a joy and except for the fascists at dc i dont have to worry about sleeping at the station between busses dc fucking wakes you up and makes you move around     megabus picks you up at some random stop and will dump you in like a bass pro shop parking lot fuck them though i like their overhead front seat desu
  they are competitive for instance the closure of jr west sanko line in japan is a direct result of failure to compete against buses so is most night train services across entire jr network and many other examples
   sanko line   thats totally irrelevant the railway is an old unupgraded narrowgauge localspeed line the distance is more regional hamada expressway is the direct straightline route sanko line was serving local trips in the aging depopulated mountains theres no limited express train running on the line    night train   not sure about ops topic towards the end he seems to be comparing buses to shorthaul flights to the point of regional flights and hsr so at most up till the 4hour wall should be considered while the older toukaido corridor night trains sleeper or no would have been a nice added choice its the end of kyushu and hokkaido routes thats more regrettable        long distances   medium distance   made up your mind yet which one is it
  ah right my it would be more appropriate to apply my comment onto the other two lines that one served express train between hiroshima and izumo area
would taking shelter in a jumbo jet during a zombie apocalypse be a good idea  with gear down its raised quite a bit off the ground and it pretty damn well sealed not to mention bathrooms food etc which makes it basically a hotel of some sort you could stay in the first class area or some shit for real beds  also if youre a pilot you could fly it somewhere remote if you needed to the only thing youd need to worry about is fueling the plane on your own which shouldnt be that much of an issue if the outside area of the airport isnt that populated with zombies  you could also use a freighter variant of a jumbo jet if you wanted to though youd need to bring many supplies of your own
a good temporary idea but a runway is likely to get filled with the zs especially given that all airports are likely to be filled to the brim with people trying to flee in the event of an apocalypse this will be a huge problem for flying as well as landing also jet fuel goes bad with the years    theres probably enough food and water for a small group to survive for a couple of weeks though so if the zombies get significantly weaker over that time it could prove a good idea overall then again not much better than just locking yourself in your apartment
  i think id be better with 777 or 747100
  another possibility would be that the runway is clear and someone skilled enough could take off and fly somewhere far away from civilization to not worry about the undead but close enough to make runs to a city or what have you for supplies  this could be when a freighter would come in handy if you had the time and knowhow to load vehicles and such inside after all the cargo airline side of the airport is usually filled with less people/
  have you even read the basics of the zombie genre airports are some of the most dangerous places you can be in any epidemic outbreak    jumbo jet   would rather an airship stol as well
   after all the cargo airline side of the airport is usually filled with less people   wont the entire airport runway and airspace would have been locked down and quarantined quickly
  the airport itself would be a hotspot for a time before inevitably falling to shit terminals would be infested with zombies and cdc people / the national guard that also ended up infected youd have to do a bit of planning it really comes down to timing
  stol not a bad idea
taking a helocopter to something like a shopping mall might be a good idea
  yeah but you wouldnt be able to take shelter in a helicopter like in a jumbo
commercial shipping ports    fenced in   shipping containers and cranes to make fortifications  the masses wont flood them trying to escape   all those goods to scavange   a decent sized roll on roll off cargo ship will be better to use than an airplane  fuel dumps  heavy vehicles and tools
  it would be much better to be in some stol aircraft than a jetliner for such purpose
  commercial shipping ports   in    containers and cranes to make fortifications   masses wont flood them trying to escape   all those goods to scavange   a decent sized roll on roll off cargo ship will be better to use than an airplane   dumps   vehicles and tools  why stay in a port
  pretty damn well sealed  but not airtight it wouldnt keep airborn pathogens out for very long    youd also need a power source for comfort/survival depending on outside conditions airline food spoils within a day or two if not refrigerated so lets look at power sources    ground power  wont be available for long once the grid shuts down or the cart runs out of diesel    airplanes own batteries  lel those will last about half an hour    apu  fuel flow of a 747 classics apu is about 400600 kg/hour so youd get about 320 to 480 hours ie 1420 days assuming full tanks youd be drawing a lot of attention to yourself but it might work if 23 weeks is long enough to sit it out
  by basics do you mean the bullshit authors come up with to try and justify why their epidemic had any chance at being threatening
any /n/iggers have popup taillights
bump
wrong boar cars go to 
  are there buses with popup taillights
  no
  how do you imagine this
popup taillights  is this some sort of meme those need to work all the time its not like with head lights where you only turn them on when you need to  popup lights on cars are one of those things that are cool as shit but completely idiotic as a concept
  not idiotic with proper placement they can become an active spoiler and increase load on rear axis thus increase efficiency of rear brakes
  have to slow down  warn other road users while increasing downforce    brilliant
  yes brilliant  this idea isnt even new  just add couple lights and done
  high effort post just wanted you to have some recognition
  not uniflizfunny but still funny
  no but i have smol
they exist
  shooped miata headlights
  it is idiotic because putting lights which need to be used much more often than headlights onto complicated moving aero pieces is just asking for excessive maintenance more importantly imagine how dumb it would look in traffic when your brake lights have to pop out every few seconds
  the aesthetic is specifically heist vehicle in a getaway car you put your brake lights on a switch so that youre harder to pursue having them as popups is just that idea but taken to the next degree
  confusors exist if speed is low enough it wont retract
  dumb smal silvia
im trying to restore this railway carriage am i insane
  as you live in australia probably     crack on
roof is fucked no surprises there but the rest of the carriage pretty much needs a reskin    and a very good dust
  you are not   actually i ought to say you are awesome   i want to do the same in france but i could not find any sncf station willing to sell one for a decent price   my piece of advice make a post to /diy there you would have many sensed comments in here i might believe your thread will 404 in less then one week
for what reason
  do you legitimately own it  why would you do that
  ill look into that    its at a tourist railway i work at and i thought fuck it why not    i dont own it tourist railway does which is good so i dont have to buy materials
op here    this is its state at the moment taken off all the rotten panelling and taken out the doors to restore ive been slowing working on fixing the roof
  not at all restoring old stuff its knowing the true value of it
  restoring it so people can experience its full glory once again  youre doing gods work anon best of luck
  all preservationists are insane but not in a bad way godspeed anon
just dont fuck up
  just wondering do you know what railroad the carriage is from
  its from the victorian railways in melbourne its a bpl excursion class carriage built in 1921
  its one of these    except mine is number 86
no you arent crazy because rr cars are just steel and wood so repairing them is easy id suggest you get a big tarp though so if you have to park it outside it can be protected from the elements
  oh its in a shed at the moment   it was outside collectively for 50 years though so
  where at anon i think its a good project
  not restoring it to use it as living quarters  lel pleb
  mornington railway melbourne   bit too big to fit in the ol backyard also cranes are not cheap
  a little bit insane but its fine we need people like you its gonna take some time but if done properly it will look glorious good luck anon you will need it      sncf will never accept to sell an old passenger carriage or an old locomotive whos not used anymore because almost all of them contain asbestos especially if you are a random dude who come out of nowhere    personally i own a small diesel shunter but i need to do some work on it before it can move on its own again
    no
  seems like quite the audacious task there buddy
  personally i own a small diesel shunter  now you have to post pics thats fucking cool
    i have this old photo taken one year ago after both shunters were unloaded    the one with missing windows is for spare parts
this is a cool fucking project anon lots of restoration energy goes into locomotives but the cars themselves are woefully underappreciated if you were in burgerland id definitely lend a hand to help you out
op here found this photo someone took while it was being shunted the other day
  no op you have a great goal
  you get like 8 portuguese guys and they would have that rebuilt in a long weekend
  no thats actually a nice carriage im a bit jelly
gl op
  yes you are insane but in the best possible way
  yes but you still have my respect what part of australia perth has a few rotting train carcasses floating around
  mornington railway melbourne  did they close the section of line going into the main town area  at least you vics kept your tram system too the west had a two systems in fremantle and perth and they were replaced first with trolley buses then diesel buses then gas buses and now theyre realising they should have kept the fucking trams to begin with
  they did built shops over the site so the terminus is about 15 km up the line now    and yeah its pretty good we still have the old w classes rattling around
  not compared to me i whole heartedly want to restore birdymcbirdface back to flight    i mean fuck if they can get glacier girl why not go for it liberty belle is being ressurected
godspeed op
itt people with honorable dreams but no money or manpower    it sucks when youre truly in the dream but cant do anything so it becomes a nightmare you cant wake up out of
im the guy with diesel shunter   heres a picture i took recently    green paint on cab is only here to prevent rust
    the drivers desk
  and a little peak at the engine
  german and how much did it cost
  op is volunteering at a heritage railway thats been running for 30 years dont think he needs your pity you cynical sack of shit and misery
  nope its french but the hydraulic transmission is german    for the cost around 4500 to transport them by road to an heritage railway  they were given for free
op here just finished restoring one of its doors the other day the steel panel on the front has had half of it chopped out and replaced and the window was so rotten the bottom half was just sawdust came up well only another 7 to go though
and heres some pics of it being lifted from its siding onto the running line
and another
  youre doing gods work anon best of luck with your project but also consider this 
am i crazy for wanting to build my own coach nothing huge but small something a horse could pull
  i dont own it tourist railway does    wait so you come in and work on it for free and in the end they get to keep it and show it off
    not op but yes its called volunteering
  op here it doesnt matter if its restored and running its a lot better than it sitting in the rain until its destroyed plus i get an inscription on the frame saying who restored it in a state like victoria where our heritage is being destroyed stuff like this is important
depends on condition of the railway carriage but i think you arent insane when you want to achieve something through your own work
  the carriage is mainly shit on the exterior the interior mainly needs a complete revarnish and then its okay its mainly the roof thats the problem
  looks great man this is a fantastic thread
post those explanation charts you got on /n/ components infographics exploded views whatever you want    im looking for fixed gear hubs in exploded view pls post them if you have it
posting a few more images
  still a good hub till this day still made too
  like should i just start posting all of the shimano exploded views until the thread hits image limit
best melbourne tram ever prove me wrong
  yes
  yes and i will save all of them
bump for justice
  imagine the racket for the passengers sitting in line with the propellers
  front chassis is so long
  i mean gear
  8abreast on a narrowbody
yeah thats going to be 120 for your complete tuneup
  then learn to do it yourself you fucking mook
  120 bucks for a gear cable and a bit of chain lube  wew lad
  120   most bike shops in my city recommends midtier tune ups that range from 110150 every year  gotta be fucking stupid to spend 300 yearly on tune ups
  gotta be stupid to spend any money on a tuneup
  yeah why pay for someone to provide you with a service
  whats a mook 
  t mook
  i like paying for individual tweaks rather than the whole tune up    im taking the bike in because i want a new chain while there i might as well have them check and set the fd for 15 after they install the chain part cost 15    most of the time theyll not even charge me if its just a little limit screw adjustment or something
  you
  actually im a bike mechanic
  t broke mook
  why pay someone to provide me with a service im entirely capable of performing myself at home a very good question
  can you build wheels
  check and set the fd  why would you even need to the limit screws are already set and wont unset themselves  if your chain is skipping off the chainrings something is very wrong
  some people dont even know how to change a tube anon
  its true my local mechanic said now that its warming up hes getting heaps of customers coming in to have tyres and tubes replaced  he doesnt complain though its ez money
  see 
thinking about offering basic services such as tune ups tube replacements etc from my home  whats the worst that could happen
  as long as you have liability insurance nothing much
  plus tax  tip
  google mook  get dutch results  trains started riding again after collision between mook and cuijk  wat
  mook  moot  gook
  
  but i wanted the ultrasonic cleaning for an additional 60
  true    yes
    do it on a cashonly basis so they have no paperwork to prove you did anything
  a lot of shops r shit  not me tho
  ok
struggling for ages trying to get new tyres on the rim  try everything make sure bead in in the middle soap tyre levers  give up and go to my lbs  guy gets them both on in seconds with his bare hands  no charge    love my lbs desu  yes im a fred dont ask
  if youdve spent a whole 10 minutes on the internet you would have found the one stupid trick to doing what you paid the lbs faggot to do    i can remove and mount tires with my bare hands u mad
  no charge
  i can do most tyres with no problem ive done tubeless several times before with some struggle    this is my first tubeless carbon rim with schwalbes which seem to always be tight in my experience and yea i did spent time on the internet trying to figure it out
  youre a little faggot
  i tried to help my friend install some tubeless tires on his rims and he ended up doing the same thing i wasnt going to hump his rims as hard as i would have my own but those were the tightest tires ive ever tried to get on a wheel usually im like  and can remove and mount tires with bare hands thanks to the massive amount of grip strength ive accumulated over the years of giving handjobs to tourists but man those things were something else
when i was a noob i once paid 10 usd worth of money for a fucking tube change they even kept the punctured one    i still cringe and beat myself over it kek
  if the price of a new tube was included then thats not terribly bad  but yeah every cyclist should be able to change a tube
  if the price of a new tube was included  it wasnt     it was at a top dollar fred ridden store i went there because it was closest to my apartment now i know better thankfully
  physical and mental weakfags who cant figure out something as simple as mounting a bicycle tire without it becoming an hourslong project  brainlets like you are why lbs mechanics stay in business
  lol in any store except performance bike they try and fail to convince me that its somehow better to toss an otherwise perfectly good tube just because its got one puncture in it even if its been in use for 1 day or less imagine the look of disgust i give them when they say shit like that some of them even stopped carrying normal patch kits and only carry the quick patches that leak like a sieve
  its another lbs hate thread
  owner of this site and 4chan
  you are
  our shop doesnt patch tubes because we cant guarantee that it will hold i consider a patch a last resort like if im out on a ride or something id never leave one on longterm if you get enough flats that putting a new tube in is too expensive then you need new tires
  a properly applied patch holds indefinitely
  this i have a crusty 50 year old bike with over 20 patches on the tube
  that comment of yours is the worst steaming pile of shit ive ever heard on the subject    bike shops wont patch a tube because the labor involved is more than a tube is worth not for any liability reasons and anyone who actually has a shop install a tube or tireandtube are either dumb or have money and dgaf anyway    by the way frugal does not equate to poor why throw money away when you dont have to thats just stupid selfmade rich people got that way because they dont throw money away stupidly    theres no reason not to patch an otherwise good tube why toss one that has one little pinprick in it thats just stupid ive got some tubes around here that have several patches on them and if theyre properly applied theyre as strong as a new tube only catastrophic damage warrants throwing one out like the valve stemtotube junction leaking cant fix that apparently you dont know what cold vulcanization is so you must not be a very good mechanic which certainly is in line with my experience with socalled lbs mechanics most of you are complete hacks    youre also full of shit about any correlation between getting flats and needing tires as anyone on /n/ who actually rides regularly can attest to    on analysis i dont think youre a bike mechanic in fact i dont think you even ride a bike i think youre just another bullshit troll posting troll bullshit ie youre a faggot gtfo
  anyone who actually has a shop install a tube or tireandtube are either dumb or have money and dgaf anyway  at least we can agree on that point its a quick moneymaker for the shop but i still hate doing in i seethe with anger every time i see a capable adult walking up to the front door holding a wheel because i know they have a flat and are too stupid to do it themselves    youre also full of shit about any correlation between getting flats and needing tires as anyone on /n/ who actually rides regularly can attest to    i just meant that if i were to get several flats especially small pinpricks i would rather explore getting a better tire than continue patching a tube    on analysis i dont think youre a bike mechanic in fact i dont think you even ride a bike i think youre just another bullshit troll posting troll bullshit ie youre a faggot gtfo    settle down friend i wasnt personally attacking you why feel the need to lash out
  be me  go to bike shop to check if they have spokes for 27 wheels  bring wheel with me  they dont have spokes long enough  okay whatever dont really blame them   can you guys at least remove the cassette i dont have the tools  sure thing bud  how much will it cost  ill do it for free takes 20 seconds  mfw  fast forward 2 years   same situation  go to different bike shop  they dont have spokes either  thats gonna be 20 to remove the cassette  can i rent the tool for 20 seconds for like 5  nope store policy says i have to charge 20 minimum for all work  this is why you get a good working relationship with a good lbs instead of going where the freds go i have a complete tool kit now but ill be eternally grateful to the boomer who removed a cassette for free
  im not your friend and ive had more than enough of shitty socalled bike mechanics at bike shops seems like any time ive had no choice they fuck something up that i have to literally take apart and redo properly the one exception is the shop that builds wheels for me they know what theyre doing with wheels at least most lbs mechanics are complete hacks and i wont pay them one penny to do anything id rather do it all myself and i do    again tires havent got a damned thing to do with getting flats it has everything to do with how someone rides specifically not paying attention to what youre rolling over sometimes you cant avoid it or just miss something so small that blends in so well that you get a puncture anyway but ive never blamed any tire for getting punctures theyre all paperthin compared to a car or motorcycle tire and get punctured easily blaming your tires is childish and stupid you can cuss and swear at them all you like because its a pain in the ass but you cant blame the tires
  im sorry to hear about your experiences with bike shops but you dont have to take it out on me    tires havent got a damned thing to do with getting flats  really nothing i agree that part of the battle is how one rides and paying attention to the road as you noted but to say that tires make no difference is absurd a tire has many jobs not least of which is keeping the tube from being punctured
  not the guy youre arguing with but i generally agree with him    there are only two reasons that get a new tire should be the response to i get a lot of flats if the tire is clearly obviously worn out literally to the cords or if the riders commute takes them through an area of town littered with broken glass and theyd rather ride a turdly schwobble marathon than figure out an alternate route    frequent flats almost never are an indication of a worn out tire that needs to be replaced its usually 1 chronic underinflation leading to pinch flats/snakebites which a new tire will not fix 2 an issue with the rim tape which a new tire will not fix or 3 something sharp embedded in the tire which can be removed if located  no need to replace the whole damn tire
  yeah if youre part of that weird faction of the cyclist community that thinks its super kewl and pro to constantly be fixing flats so you can gain an extra 3 watts then by all means rock those 170g tires you found on youtube    there is a reason commuters are crazy about gatorskins and it is not because theyre ignorant about the benefits of muh watts
  you can buy tires on youtube
  hes still coping about his shitty tires
  yeah its so hard to cope passing you on the way to work when youre freezing your fingers off in january trying to fix a flat on your turbocottons because you were too autistic to get something actually suited for something other than a race i bet that extra 7 seconds shaved off your strava segment was really worth it
  how do you get this mad about bikes
  you can find tyres shilled by various shills on youtube
i love bike mechanics good ones  i never work on my bike bikes are for riding they are not an oil dispenser for my hands i got better things to be doing fixing bikes is on par with cleaning my house i pay someone without a career to do it for me
  fixing bikes is on par with cleaning my house i pay someone without a career to do it for me
  waxlet detected
  t fred the dentist
  lol i make more than a dentist
  if only it were that easy i got a work stand and tools because the shop kept fucking things up do you think i wanted my hands covered in grease
  tuned up a bike i recently built up for 120 bucks  shifting setup worse then what i managed  charged me 10 bucks for new brake pads when i bought new pads from them 5 days prior  feels bad man im new to biking and i liked the guys at the shop but i feel like i got taken for a ride going to confront then about it tomorrow and see if theyll set it straight otherwise ill have to find a new shop
  frequent flats almost never are an indication of a worn out tire that needs to be replaced  i agree with that youre saying i guess i should specify that when i said something about needing new tires i should have said different tires i have nothing against patches or their effectiveness but id just rather not have to use one in the first place so if i were to keep getting flats especially small ones i would opt for a tire with better protection
  lowquality bait  
  different tires  what kind of tires you have have little to do with it either on average 100 tires get punctures as often as 20 tires thorns glass metal tiny little sharp shards of stone etc are all harder than any bike tire run over them chances are you get a puncture regardless otherwise someone would have come up with truly puncture proof tires by now and everyone would be using them no such thing exists in a pneumatic bike tire
  otherwise someone would have come up with truly puncture proof tires by now and everyone would be using them    its called the schwalbe marathon plus and lots of people ride them
  i never said there were tires that are immune to flats but there are certainly ones that fare better than others there are tradeoffs theyre usually going to be heavier and stiffer     i just cant fathom how you guys seem to think that tires make no difference in flat protection i see some pretty shitty tires  ones with like a 20tpi casing molded between thin layers of rubber then there are tires like the marathons like  mentioned that are much thicker and/or have layers of other protective materials that are puncture/cut resistant and they are infinitely better
  i never said there were tires that are immune to flats  the schwalbe marathon plus is immune to flats though     boomer just doesnt know what hes talking about
  they also ride like blocks of wood which is fine if you just need to get from a to b
  well yeah
  the schwalbe marathon plus is immune to flats      become an hero its your only option now
  yeah schwalbe is not exactly known for highperformance bike tires i dont think id descend a mountain at high speed with those
      continental psyops fake news     im speaking from personal experience and anecdotal experience from others not the phenomenon that you can find anything on the internet because the world is a vast place exceptions dont disprove a rule     schwalbe marathon plus dont get flats       no one is suggesting its worth the tradeoff but the grip is mediocre not poor and theyre a strong favourite for paranoid touring cyclists who regularly descend mountains and theres less risk of the tire failing other than losing grip than that of fast slick     why would you even comment on puncture resistant tires when you are solely interested in road cycling its just not something you have any knowledge or experience of
infact i hate marathon plus and id never ride them again but the simple fact is that they dont get flats     that wasnt even your contention either your contention was that there isnt really any difference in flat protection between different tires which is just absurdly incorrect
  ur a little pansy ass faggot
  maybe in you lil hilbilly town they carry pastanigger tires and nazi jew slave labour tires  schwalbe stronk
  as a bike mechanic i think hes pretty much correct
      please keep posting ive got a fresh batch of popcorn in the microwave
  making popcorn in the microwave
is there something i can put on my bike to allow it to ride in the snow i dont have to go far like a quarter of a mile but i need to be able to ride there on time
depends on the snow    i dont have to go far like a quarter of a mile  lol just walk
  i cant for alot of reasons
  too fat too stupid tell us
  i dont feel like waking up at 630 in the morning thats it
  walking a quarter mile takes 5 minutes wake up at 625
    thinks he needs something special to ride in the snow  distance is 1/4mi thats like a 2 minute bike or 5 minute walk  i dont feel like waking up at 630 in the morning thats it  what the fuck i dont even
  need to be there on time    wake up earlier like 5 minutes dont be so autistic about setting your alarm earlier and holding yourself to a schedule blaming your equipment when it snows is like blaming traffic for getting to work late people dont care
  fat tires
  just ride only thing you have to adapt is your brain abs and esp
  fpbp    drink less alcohol    i dont know why anyone would bother with that nonsense when its not very effective and you have all the disadvantages of a studded tire anyway
do they make tire chains for bike tires like they do for cars    my answer would be to swap out a pair of wider tires or even studded tires but you cant ride studded tires at all in the nonsnow    tire chains are super effective on cars
   /n/ discord
  you should invest in studded tires
  those actually work on motorcycles i suppose they will work on bikes too
  is there something i can put on my bike to allow it to ride in the snow  there are dedicated ice/snow tires for bikes like the marathon winter or pic related the schwalbe ice spiker pro
  but you cant ride studded tires at all in the nonsnow  untrue
  interesting i always thought you spun out and cant get any traction i just run my mtb in the winter if i need to ride somewhere and there is snow
  good handling skills cannot be purchased
  its no big deal mostly its just louder slightly harsher ride and unneccesarily wears on the studs    ive been riding studs on tarmac the last couple of weeks since the snow fell stayed a couple of days and then disappeared i always ride my studded tyres on tarmac for a while in the spring until the temperature stops hovering around freezing and i get around to changing tyres
as long as the snow is not above the hubs you can just use your normal bike studs are useful when it gets icy of course but where i live you there are sand or salt on the roads when it gets icy
  id like to see you try to get through snow up to your hubs
if the snow is deep enough just xc ski
    they also have considerably higher rolling resistance than anything youd use on paved roads in summer     im in the same situation as other winter anon and have had studs on for a few weeks already because we had some snow and freezing temps but now its been above freezing for some time also had to replace both tires as the studs came through the tire and kept puncturing my tube after only 10 000 km on them found an old almost unused nokian branded one in the garage has to be around 10 years old and the last thing thats remaining of the bike i used to ride to high school
  nokian made great studded tyres
  experienced winter commuter here    studded tires seriously its like night and day they grip like fucking velcro on polished ice you can make your own studded tires but by the time you add up the cost of a newish quality nonstudded tire the hardware your time and a few inevitable flats you need to be pretty poor to make that worthwhile i use and recommend schwalbe marathon winter theres cheaper and better out there but its a great tire for a good price dont ride them all year like any winter tire they just fall apart in the heat    it sounds like youre looking for a minimal solution and the tires are all you need to get you there reliably but a winter bike will work far better with  bar mitts  snowboard helmet  dyno lights batteries dont like the cold and winter is dark  fenders  geared hub derailures dont like slush  disk brakes      there are things fat bikes can do that nothing else can but theyre not the tool for this particular job you need skinny tires that cut through the slush and grip the hard layer below not lowpressure tires that try to float on top of it you will rarely encounter snow firm enough to support even the lowest pressure fattie and deep enough to stop a skinny tire anywhere in a urban environment studded fat tires do exist but theyre like 200 each fats are for mud sand and offroad not snowy streets      you cant ride studded tires at all in the nonsnow  as the other anon said totally untrue they make a buzzing noise but as long as they never see summer heat they work just fine      ghetto chains  just no im not sure what this guys doing perhaps using the zipties to seat the bead or something in any case if youre looking for reliability you might as well take the bus over this zipties dont make effective traction aids    schwalbe ice spiker pro  a pricey option and not what you need for snowy streets but they work great it you do winter trail riding too
    its 1/4 of a mile     you dont need fucking chains or snow tires lol
  bar mitts  absolutely not needed on anything that isnt a multi hour ride in really cold weather    snowboard helmet  qol improvement if you do long rides normal helmet with vents potentially taped shut works fine    dyno lights batteries dont like the cold and winter is dark  unless you need the lights to actually lighten up the road then battery options are more than fine if youre riding on mups with street lights all you need from lights is to be visible to others and show the reflectors others have battery lights can do that without any problems in battery life    fenders  fenders are useless and sometimes actively hinder you in winter though the snow packs into the fenders and starts slowing you down in certain conditions    geared hub derailures dont like slush  if you store your bike indoors having derailleurs isnt a massive problem also certain gear hubs just completely stop working when it gets really cold looking at you shimano     disc brakes  hydraulic or bust though having cable actuated disc brakes is just as bad if not worse than rim brakes hydraulic discs are a godsend on winter though     fatty with studs  you dont need studs on a fatty unless you plan on riding polished ice the low pressure tires with massive area are enough for most winter riding also fatties are amazing for winter trail riding and come spring there are usually multiple days when you can ride the fatty everywhere
  is there something i can put on my bike to allow it to ride in the snow  yeah a rider
  you will rarely encounter snow firm enough to support even the lowest pressure fattie  if the snow doesnt support my fatties they must by definition be cutting down to the ice below so whats your poiint
  you dont need studs on a fatty unless you plan on riding polished ice  there are always at least few day in the beginning and end of winter where the streets are made of polished ice and slush
  beginning and end of winter  honestly the worst parts of winter to ride because thats when temps hover right around freezing and its raining and snowing while its still too warm to bust out the serious winter jacket theres a point in deep winter late jan/early feb it gets too cold to snow so its just a cold dry already paved winter landscape thats when wearing the seriously insulated jacket doesnt overheat you and its super comfy warm and the bike doesnt get caked in slush    really though there isnt much to invest in bike gear besides good tires and fenders especially if youre planning to only ride 1/4mi its more important to invest in cold weather gear for a range of temperatures and conditions most importantly good gloves boots and face/ears protection
  absolutely not needed on anything that isnt a multi hour ride in really cold weather  i have reynauds syndrome and i will fucking fight you    i spent years trying to figure a good system for gloves and layering gloves and experienced the screaming miserable pain of near frozen fingers every nerve ending on fire thousands of times before i finally got bar mitts and put that horror behind me maybe not for everyone but for some folks bar mitts are practically essential for rides under 25 degrees that are longer than a few minutes
  fucking hell
  depends on the snow  this fresh powdery snow is fine to ride on if its icy at all i take the bus or uber levels in between use your best judgment
  no need to fight me for that as its a valid reason for bar mitts
  this is a pretty valid reason for bar mitts blood flow is the only thing keeping your hands freezing inside gloves really pretty shitty crutch though sounds like a fast track to frostbite
  but how come bar mitts work better than regular mitts    personally in the winter i ride with a pair of thick mitts and a base layer of running gloves keeps my hands nice and warm dont see any need for bar mitts
  the problem is that for someone with reynauds you need such heavy thick gloves that they practically hinder braking and your ability to grip the bars and can actually worsen the problem of limited bloodflow     pogies/bar mitts solve that problem by blocking airflow and dramatically reducing heat loss which does away with the need for extreme insulated gloves with bar mitts i can ride when its 10 degrees out f and be quite comfortable with very basic wool gloves and have ridden comfortably at 14 with ordinary ski gloves on under my bar mitts
  they also have considerably higher rolling resistance than anything youd use on paved roads in summer  my studded tyres roll faster than my summer knoblies
are fenders worthwhile  i only really have to commute about 15 miles to work but i remember riding my bike when i was a kid and wet roads make a mess  is fenders something i should really care about or do they not really do very much maybe stupid question but i just started cycling last week and ditched having a car want to research things before i actually need them  also how are these skinny 80psi road tires for winter i assume theyre going to be slick as fuck but what would the option be someone posted studded tires i looked at but do they fit skinny road bike wheels or are they just more fat tire things
  fenders are super important for wet weather     as for winter it depends on how much winter you get chances are you wont be cycling on sheer ice although my shoulder remembers when i found a bit of road that was narrowest studded tire you can get is 32mm you probably just want gravel tires for winter rubber will work for anything that isnt sheer ice this includes snow  i was on hardrubber marathon 23mms last winter and it was kind of okay switching to 40mm gravel tires this year though
  proper fenders make a huge difference if you ride wet streets    schwalbe winter kguard suomi tyres w104 and 45nrth xerxes are examples of 30 mm studded tyres havent found skinnier than that
  this
can i convert my 80s road bike on bald 24 marathons into a winter bike i feel like i should just buy a used hybrid and slap some good winter tires on it instead of trying to frankenstein something with my road bike
1255727  not even giving you a you for this poor bait
not op but running 700 x 23c continental gator skins right now it looks like the closest i can get to that are 28c marathon winters am i missing something or is that my best bet
tfw riding in snow/ice on 28mm slicks
  you need a ebike for winter driving  the power delivery is linear  using your legs power delivery is oscilating and you get allot of wheel spin and dont get anywhere
what did amtrak mean by this
  well its a mystery really
  youd have to ask them to be sure after all
  i imagine its just an insurance thing for example a cow could refuse to leave the tracks causing confusion and delay
  derailment
  not like its any use to you if you die
        those were terrorist attacks that trump covered up to not give them glory     what are the odds 5 trains derail within a month of eachother     also notice how much fuckton of security there is with rail copps now and they are putting up barbed wire and surveillance systems as we speak    thanks trump
  i find it hilarious that half of those things are mandated by law in the eu at least for train delays and cancellations not forgetting the emergency assistance that already exists as well  im not sure why preexisting conditions are covered since that should be your health care system not your train paying for it  the only things which arent already covered by the train companies or the government in europe is lost luggage youre responsible for that on your own and if you miss a train not because of a previously delayed service  ultimately though 9 for what is basically travel insurance is pretty cheap id just be concerned about the excess they cover
mfw i book student fares through amtrak and the conductor never asks me for student id
  yeah its crazy that us companies can get away with that shit if my train is cancelled of course i should get my money back same with late fees meals etc i wonder if maybe some things are actually legally covered but signing up for this insurance waives other rights i wouldnt put it past them and it would explain why their being so aggressive over 9 bucks
  travel within the eu is covered within the eu laws on this  there are variations depending on the mode of transport rail air bus/coach and boat/ship/ferry

  on the acela first class now   more than an airplane in turbulence  quality of american railroad
  on the acela first class now   more than an airplane in turbulence  never had this issue i dont think that us railroads are any better than russian roads that werent serviced since 1990
i find hsr in general to be rather shakey certainly more than a plane id say it compares to say light to medium tier turbulence hsr at 300 km/h shakes about as much as a regular train at 120 on normal lines with good to mediocre maintenance at least from my experience in spain and france    otoh its a comfy shaking
  expect acela to run as smoothly as the shinkansen  with that infrastructure youre dreaming pal not to mention the horrid fra abomination that acela coaches are
why is my 1930stier infrastructure bad  i dont know op
  1930s prr  as bad as modern nec amtrak  0/10
  the nec out of ny literally begins with crossing a bridge that predates the 1930s    portal bridge  inaugurated 1910   in extreme cases rail crews must bang the rails into place with sledgehammers before trains can cross
  reading compression  im saying that the nec is sub 1930s standards
  wapo nytimes the economist

  are you talking about crh or talgo trains
  fortunately /pol/ is a nsfw board that would soon be parted from us

  make a more fuel efficient plane next time
  it was proof of concept by the way you make more efficient plane your 737 max is outdated and consumes more fuel
  737 is outdated  is still in the market  will have a version that will be able to go transatlantic
  737 is outdated  a318 could fly transatlantic and do stol in the same flight  a321 could carry more passengers than any 737  a321lr will soon carry passengers transatlantic from medium sized airports to other medium sized airports  a321ulr in development could fly transpacific
  737 has sold way more than the a320
  737 has been in the market since 1968  a320 has been in the market since 1988  a320 currently has 60 market share of the narrow body market  737 currently has 40 market share of the narrow body market  a320 has had more orders and deliveries than the 737 since 2003
  crashes in an airshow  
  crashes due to unspecified modification
  was advertised as the first commercial plane to be able to fly on its own  crashes in demonstration
  was advertised as plane on which pilots have   only if they have hands made of asbestos pads to stop a trimming wheel while mcas commits suicide
  have control fix
    at least the 737 has actual controls
  implying winged bus drivers want a workout at work
    even mentour says that the 737 has a system which makes it incredibly hard to pull up when the plane thinks the angle of attack is high and makes pushing down on the yokes very easy
  airbus allows pilot to have absolute control of aircraft just pull the breaker and enjoy barrel roll
  transpacific in a narrow body   figuratively thats a flying coffin
  crashes
  if passengers are properly restrained there is no problem
buy tupolev please north korea approves
  what are the boeing 707  douglas dc8
  flying aluminium coffins
  cant go fast without your tires huh faggot
  crashes
  and boeing dominates airbus in the widebody market so whats your point
  a321lr will soon carry passengers transatlantic from medium sized airports to other medium sized airports  a321ulr in development could fly transpacific  both 100 false    a321 could carry more passengers than any 737  240 in high density vs 230 in max 10 high density
  correction the first point is niche as hell the 2nd point is completely false
  gets scrapped
    i think concorde got scrapped because they dont want the plebs seeing what the earth looks like at 60000 ft
  i think it got scrapped because jews drunk all kerosene and it became so expensive so plebs couldnt fly at 60 000
   will soon carry passengers transatlantic from medium sized airports to other medium sized airports   in development could fly transpacific  both 100 false   could carry more passengers than any 737  240 in high density vs 230 in max 10 high density  a321xlr will be able to fly transpacific although it would be more like something similar to yycuus
  oh noooo hoh nooo hoohhh noooooo  gotta love the frogs
  there is zero fucking evidence to support the assertion that a theoretical a321xlr will be transpacific capable
  a320lr range will be 4000nmi  something like yycuus is just 3700nmi so with the help of wind or even without wind a321lr should be able to do the westward trip  then a321lr probably couldnt do the eastward trip because of the wind however with the a321xlr which added further fuel carrying capability it should be able to do that
  or in other words i wont call a plane with just 5000ni or even less than that to be a transpacificcapable aircraft however its still able to handle a few transpacific routes
we  you  lol none of you faggots are in any way involved in plane designs stop taking credit for shit you will never even get within spitting distance    its like two dirty beggars flinging shit at eachother while pretending to be royality sad
  lol none of you faggots are in any way involved in plane designs  not yet you faggot im still designing a logo for an a/c that should /n/ and /g/ make
  accordingly an a320xlr will be capable of a trip of over 8300km  from a quick search on google assuming theres no winds or anything like that such an aircraft would be capable of flying from lax to nrt nonstop    now its more than likely that a budget airline lets guess a japanese one since there are more of them and their service is much higher quality compared to european budget airlines would prefer to go out of a smaller airport which is cheaper to operate this could make such flights more comfortable to operate for these budget airlines if and lets go with if the a321xlr manages 9000km of range when its actually made then youre possibly looking at transpacific flights from smaller west coast us airports to smaller japanese airports   from seattle things get better and you can end up with flights being able to reach south korea from there  if anchorage becomes a major hub even it is a great location with the xlr being able to get to pretty much all of china from there including hong kong it can also get to the phillipines    the a321xlr will be transpacific capable australia will be out of the question but asia will be more than within range  even the current existing a321lr is capable of going up to 9300km range with a low density cabin think along the lines of the existing a318 cabin for british airways lcyjfk route imagine what an a321xlr in a low density cabin could achieve
  such an aircraft would be capable of flying from lax to nrt nonstop  no it wouldnt not without reducing payload significantly headwinds all the way    the a321xlr will be transpacific capable australia will be out of the question but asia will be more than within range  again literally zero evidence to support this 100 speculation at this point    even the current existing a321lr is capable of going up to 9300km range with a low density cabin  and almost every single one of those services has failed
  no it wouldnt not without reducing payload significantly headwinds all the way  which is why i said assuming theres not winds a range of about 9000 km would almost certainly be necessary to pull that sort of flight off  again literally zero evidence to support this 100 speculation at this point  well were basing this from what airbus has said so far airbus has already given us the ranges theyre estimating their aircraft will be at least capable of  and almost every single one of those services has failed  the a321lr hasnt even entered service with its launch customer arkia yet theres no way you can say whether or not the service has failed the only comparable service is that of the a318 between london city and jfk airports that hasnt failed although i will admit that ba has downsized that service down to one flight in each direction a day down from 2 a day the main reason it downsized was because the preclearance in shannon airport also used for the technical stop for the westbound flight closed when the second westbound flight left reducing the benefit for business travellors taking the later flight  bas lcyjfk flight in the morning remains profitable and it looks like ba isnt interested in stopping it soon
  no i dont know whats the claim for 4750nmi for a321xlr being based on but the claim for a321lr was based on a passenger load of 206 passengers with bags and airbus range estimate have been traditionally more optimistic when it cone to operational conditions     yet a plane with 4750nmi range on the paper should be able to do a 3700nmi flight with significant payloads even when there are headwinds
  well were basing this from what airbus has said so far  where have they said this ive never once seen it attributed at a person from airbus just industry/expert speculation    theres no way you can say whether or not the service has failed  almost every a320 family commercial service in an allbusiness class configuration has failed same for the 737 by the way there is not a strong reason to believe the a321neo changes that its just a bad business model outside of routes that you could count on one hand you picked like the one that hasnt failed many more have been tried and did in act fail because again its a shit business model      what part of your ass are you pulling that 3700nmi flight length from
  the example uusyyc i used above is 3700nmi
  which is a route that does not and will not exist theres no demand for it its not the lack of the right aircraft economics that prevents it
  i picked this city pair simply because it sound nice as an example
  its a bad example that is nothing but a technicality st johns to edinburgh is technically transatlantic that doesnt make it real or even a good theoretical example
  3700nmi would be comparable to something like yvrcts not an existing flight but still kinda possible but yeah then something like yvrnrt would already be 4000nmi
  this does not look comfy at all plus customs would be utter hell on a small airport
  ive been through customs and the immigration point of many smaller airports it would not be hell if it was just a narrow body aircraft especially if the aircraft was in a lower density configuration you could just have about 120 people going through customs  theres no way narrow bodies will ever replace widebodies on many routes but extra long range narrowbodies could introduce budget airlines into long haul routes and it could also introduce new point to point routes from airports which are more than large enough but are more distant from major cities
either im stupid or boeing is stupid why to make 737max when you can revive 757100 with new engines and shit
  if anchorage becomes a major hub even it is a great location with the xlr being able to get to pretty much all of china from there including hong kong it can also get to the phillipines  everything thats old is new again
  i mean if you started up an airline made the fleet out of a321lrs and a321xlrs you could become the north american version of wow air or icelandair flying from any number of smaller sized airports in north america to anchorage connect onto another flight and youre in asia  hell icelandair already flies from keflavik to anchorage plus anchorage is already the worlds 4th largest air freight hub in the world    plus anchorage airport has 2 runways with a 3rd under construction this would be perfect for a middle of market aircraft to dominate especially if the air fares were considerably lower than the traditional airlines
  i think the whole thing about the 737 is its physically suited to being this lowtotheground airliner that doesnt even need steps 757x would be rad as fuck but then the 787 just shits all over what it does i think
    transpacific prices could go down
  theres no real reason why widebodies and such flights wouldnt continue but if we already look at the narrowbodies really driving prices down for transatlantic flights imagine if flights from alaska to japan korea and china really were lowered maybe to about 150 each way  if that were the case i would love to see such an alaskan hub also connect to iceland imagine getting a flight from europe through to iceland then onto anchorage and then to wherever you want in asia  the a321lr and a321xlr could give us this future maybe if boeings 797 materialises the longer range might make more normal flights be possible as well
  so they made it like they made just because they couldnt make it higher nor get rid of stairs  what stopped them from putting 737s vert stab on 757
  unification  most airlines who already operate the 737ng have pilots who are 737 type rated  with the 737max that means that all they need to do is read about whats new and whats been changed and they can fly the new plane  with a 757x you then need to take all your pilots and then type rate them in the 757/767 and then tell them whats new and whats been changed in the 757x    this is the main reason why airlines have either gone to an all airbus narrowbody fleet or an all boeing narrowbody fleet unification just makes it easier and less financially taxing
    main problems   757 production have stopped last decade with all production tools and supply chain abandoned/reused for other purpose/etc it would be expensive to bring it back to production and also the cost of designing a modern wing and all that meanwhile they have just renewed 737 with 737 ng not so long ago comparatively   757 burn much more fuel than 737 even if you change its engine and modernize the wing its weight would still be much heavier than 737 and that would mean double percentage difference in fuel consumption even after modernization of wing and engine
  dude i would be happy if low cost pacific travel could occur because then that would make aa/jal or ua/ana lower their prices from the us to japan
  its a snoot    t h a t d r o o p s
  daily reminder the concorde used 4x the fuel that a boeing 747 would    supersonic transport should not happen it only benefits the ultra rich
  it only benefits the ultra rich  if the ultra rich are willing to pay for it no problem  used 4x the fuel  again if the rich are willing to pay stopping the few from consuming extra fuel has no impact on emissions or fuel demand as long as the plebeians fly economy class all will be well
  sorry i dont speak vodka
  short term a more realistic hope would be when airasia x japan took off
  4x  isnt that only true when you only measure it in term of per passenger  and then that doesnt make sense because if you fit the 747 with all first class seat them fuel consumption per passenger will also increase accordingly    i think some modern russian planes have english marking
    geared turbofans them all into history
  u dont speak vodka u drink it    i think some modern russian planes have english marking  afaik yes they had some export versions with english markings and translated pfds  btw  glass cockpit  still needs a flight engineer
  max capacity same a a319neo and less than 7377
  droop snoot
how many insecure threads is this board going to have by insecure euros who are obsessed with their godless nightmare governmentowned airspace conglomerate    real talk the a320 is a nifty aircraft clearly better than 737s and the the mask on the a350 looks good but other than that i dont get the appeal at all the best aircraft airbus currently makes wasnt even developed by them
its the 23rd century warp factor 8 has been achieved what are the best starship designs and what would be their equivalent to todays planes
  what good is that bussard collector on the dorsal nacelle and why is there an impulse engine spewing hot plasma into the center pylon
  bussard collectors dont really need to be anywhere open just somewhere they are just intakes for refueling in a nebula anyway and i doubt youre ever doing warp speed through a nebula    the impulse drive should have been relocated to a pylon much like the impulse drive on an intrepid class starship though since impulse drive is just a reaction thruster anyway i doubt it would seriously do much damage to a pylon
  excelsior 4evr
  i doubt it would seriously do much damage to a pylon  its enough to propel a large and heavy ship to a significant fraction of the speed of light in a matter of seconds
  nx class or bust  now that is a starship which feels like it could be a real vehicle
  it doesnt even have energy shielding tho
does anyone here like baldwin/limahamilton diesels
  they definitely created some of the most unique locomotives to ever ride the rails     
        no we hate them
  neat
      ill have to add baldwin diesels to my list of things that trigger you
  thinking every troll on the board is one person  how new are you
  ive been here all summer bud
  milwaukee road  at least now i know who i am dealing with    limahamilton is the shit all my family used to be employed by the factory
  thats cool dude i always liked the blocky look of limahamilton diesels im guessing your relatives built more steam locomotives for the company than diesels though when did the factory finally close down did it stay open after baldwinlimahamilton exited the locomotive market in the 1950s
  the failures of the centipede and shark killed the company when pennsy stopped buyingthey were done
  as far as american locos go these are some of the best ive seen must be from before chugga chugga big box spazomotives became the norm
  baldwin was a renowned builder of steam locomotives who had difficulty transitioning to diesels after wwii    i always thought they looked like diesels with steam engine styling if that makes sense    i think yuro trainfags would like our firstgeneration diesels in general they had a more ornate organic look than subsequent generations
  the shark got that one in o gauge

  why do you get turned on by lycra handlebars jerseys saddles and pedals
  because i am a straight male and i enjoy exercise and being fit
  cool so why arent you discussing those topics on /fit/ and /asp/ since what you just stated has absolutely nothing to do with transportation
  if the picture is of a locomotive without it transporting anything that is also not related to transportation i transport myself you probably cant even do that
    itt  neckbearded foamers  lycraclad hipsters  neither even knows how to ride

  please dont give the retards ideas
  if you could find posters who ride horses for fun but occasionally do ride their horse to the grocery store/work or drive a buggy in the city sure horses could be discussed here
  is the yellow and red marking symbolic or decorative and what livery is that anyway
  that horse probably fucks her bareback too    its because its ugly and broken soviet trash

  werent the two surviving sharknoses being hidden by a guy and refusing to let anyone see them
  i heard they were in storage by some shortline in michigan because they had mechanical issues they wont let people near them because someone stole the builders plates
    they are owned by the escanaba  lake superior railroad in the upper peninsula the owner of the railroad john larkin is a railfan himself and owns and operates a small collection of old mostly baldwin diesels and other equipment    at some point in the 1980s some people broke in to the shed and stole a bunch of shit off of the sharks leading to the railroad to adopt an antirailfan stance everything is kept under wraps photography and trainspotting is discouraged etc    larkin is a member of a rail museum in the upper midwest and some have alleged that the equipment is set to go there when he dies
  well at least they arent planning to scrap them i have seen way too many locos that should have gone to a museum get the torch
  unusual since emd was on the cbq line    also damn thats halsted street station and the brandnew kennedy expressway

  didnt realize they ever got sharks
  they owned an abba set from 1950 to 1955 and used them primarily to haul taconite ore trains out of waukegan around 1954 they ended up briefly working on the dmir a sister railroad for a bit    ultimately they didnt work out so they were sold to the bo    heres a shot of them in ohio en route to their new owners        these are actually rebuilds that given emd engines and modified sw1200 hoods compare to the unaltered one in op

blh made the most europeanlooking american locomotives
  i think everyones engines back then looked pretty much the same this was before you had emd roll out the sd45 and gp38 that has been the standard design and look for the last 50 years almost
internal corridor units must have been a bitch to work on and maintain but fuck they look good shame a e s t h e t i c s arent considered a part of locomotive design any more
  locomotives havent been sexy since the 1960s
  nice
  pretty interesting looking i like the lines of the bodywork

  i came
  cpr 8000 is in the middle of a cosmetic restoration right now i was shown some pics of the cab and theyve removed rot from the floor getting ready to repaint the interior and then put the control stands back in
crown zellerbach vo1000  it could have been saved 
these look pretty cool ignore 1st 30 secs    
  is it going to be in operational condition
  unfortunately no strictly a cosmetic job but a good one at that i examined 8000 in late 2002 and it appears the mechanical stuff is all there but it did lack traction motors and the control stand
  been a while since i visited i love this thread so much 3

did baldwin make any locomotives for export if so i wonder how many are still around overseas
  thats s darn good question  one ive never thought about i thought only steam was exported but apparently diesels were too         i wish there was a torrent available for the mid80s kalmbach production first generation diesels the search for survivors it had some decent action shots of baldwins
  thanks for the link good info there     its interesting that their export cab units have an inward sloping nose like their domestic models
  heh this was sent to me by the photographer
  wooden cars with diesel engines
so whats going to happen to those two rf16s in michigan    if they were to be restored what livery should they be painted to  prr ofc
  one in prr one in new york central preferably nyc had a lot of sharks
  argentina
what did op mean by this
  where is that one based at any hopes of a restoration
bumping this dinosaur
its very difficult for me to get interested or excited about switch engines

the eje operating interchange service around the outskirts of chicago bought a fuckton of these centercabs dt662000s and rebuilt them with gmemd parts circa 19581960
  heres the rebuild sw2400
  neat but man the visibility must suck equally both ways
wwhat happened to this thread
1193 days  people have completed entire undergrad programs since this thread was made
  one of 2 accidents 6 months apart that wiped out half of their drs441000 roster
  shame cn bought the eje used to never get caught by the j and i liked the livery better cuts west chicago in half when a j train rolls through and now it happens all the time      /n/ happened just simply /n/
  another view supposedly when this unit gets fired up everyone in town knew about it very loud

  that adorable little cp branded tank car
  is this older than the rock island thread we had a few years ago
may as well post in here before 4chan dies
that guy who used to post model trains was alive when this thread was started he might have even posted in it
  see    
  theyre actually still there they use them as water cars and used to stage them at various parts of the line during the summer fire season obstensibly to protect several of the large wooden trestles    which reminds me i need to go down there tomorrow and get some detail pics
aaaaaaand thats 300
  please do it do they have any other ontrack equipment they use with them or do they just hook up fire trucks
welp we hit bump limit  rip baldwin/limahamilton thread  you had a good run
  may she live forever in our hearts
getting baldwin dubs
goodnight sweet prince
f
  pretty sure the bump limit is like 310315
  no unfortunately when the cpr ran the line they were used as an immediately available source of water i think they kept hoses  a pump in a cabinet on the tank car i dont know of any instances they were used filled every spring then emptied and returned in fall they havent been utilized since at least 2006 maybe longer
  not yet
this has been a good thread lads mods please delete half of the posts so we can keep it up for another three years
  hopefully if they ever do discard them one will get donated to a museum and restored    shes auto saging now boys     _

it has been an honor

prime example as to why we need at the very minimum two crew members on trains unlike certain class 1 railroads in america cough    cough up bnsf cough are working to set thoughts on single member crews
when did bnsf go to oneman crews
  they havent yet but they were working to try and buy out unions to get employees to vote for them back in i think it was mid to late 2016 was a feeble attempt but still an attempt
  theyre been trying that for well over a decade dont think the other class 1s wouldnt jump on it if they could    eventually theyll probably get it too one way or another another good reason not to work at the railroad the fear of losing your job for good is always hanging over your head
  you also need an automatic vigilance device
you actually dont need any crew on a train when you have computers
  these trains are operated remotely from a facility here in perth what seems weird to me is that they could derail it from 800km away but they couldnt pull the brakes
  probably brake failure in that case number of crew onboard literally doesnt matter
  rio has remote controlled trains bhp and fortescue still use drivers
anyone speculate on how it happened
  probably brake failure in that case number of crew onboard literally doesnt matter  couldnt you kill the engine and wait  or engine brake it for that matter
  inertia
    if you kill the engine you lose your ability to pump up what brakes you might have and you lose dynamic braking capability even so depending on the grade and the tonnage dynamics might not be enough
  lac megantic shouldve been enough to put the kibosh on this shit in a lot of north america at least but muh profit motive
  friction would stop the train anyway
  eventually sure
  you dont need to pump up the air to set the brakes unless you drop below a critical amount in order to reach this point youd have to perform serious errors in train handling
  in other words you need to pump up the air before you set the brakes
  stop complaining  its not like jobs or safety are important anyway
  truly and rightfully you pump air to release the brakes you reduce pressure to apply them
the two crew meme lead that taiwanese rail department being able to get away from their procedural problem by simply installing two crews and then pretend the problem have beeb magically solved just by doing so
tey labor costs alone are over a billion dollars a year for just uprr
  point
  so theyll go to one man crews and automation as soon as they can get the feds approval conductors are fucked
  its not a decision the government can make right now crew consist agreements are between the carriers and the unions
return of fiveman crews again when
bhp said the train came to a stop after a braking system control cable became disconnected and when the driver got off an emergency air brake was not engaged    it said that the electric braking system that initially stopped the train automatically released after an hour while the driver was still outside but because of an integration failure the backup system did not deploy    the train rolled down a gradient and hurtled uncontrolled for 90km at speeds of more than 100km/h before it was run through a siding south of port hedland and derailed    the rail safety regulator said investigators had discovered a potential issue with a system called automatic train protection which is supposed to provide a backup to ecp braking    it said the trains had a software feature to preserve battery life on ecpfitted wagons where the electronic brakes are released in some circumstances  including when there has been no input to the system for 60 minutes    where these conditions exist the ecp braking system will release creating the risk of a rollaway incident unless the air pressure within the system has been released to atmosphere the alert says    the regulator said it had found that in the event of a rollaway and the failure of the ecp system the atp system does not fall back on the mechanical pneumatic system the alert orders all operators to check whether the 60minute release system has been programmed into their ecp braking software

  yeah but the median includes all those people in flyover states where you can buy a house for 40k and a lot of kids working in fast food and stuff 95k is middle class lower middle if youre talking about a place like nyc or san francisco where salaries are much higher and cost of living is much higher    how could anyone possibly think thats a good idea
  lifting bodies look weird
  the real deal
what kind of communist makes something as bourgeois as a fucking concorde     oh yeah because socialism creates even bigger inequality than a normal pareto distribution only stalin and lenin get to be comfortable
  actually the tu144 was very uncomfortable loud and constantly vibrated from gate to gate it was so loud you couldnt even hear the person beside you speak  the cost of the short lived supersonic service from moscow to astana was only 50 roubles the same price as the regular subsonic flight  the main reasons why the tu144 was withdrawn from service only months after introduction was that it  1 burned too much fuel for the price making it incompatible with the planned economy  2 carried too few passengers from moscow to astana the train cost about 1020 roubles depending on the class and not many people would be traveling anyway  3 safety of the aircraft was in question from day one since the tu144 incident at the paris airshow which caused the cancellation of many concorde orders the tu144 was never reliable and suffered from constant system failures and the planes spent more time being repaired on the ground than they were flying
  due to some soviet shitty plane and some amerifats we stuck on speeds lower than 1 mach  thank to those niggers transatlantic takes fucking forever
this is an attempt to get a german general going german refers to the language region so austrian and swiss transportation topics are welcome as well    lets start this off with a humorous failure at the düsseldorf rheinbahn who have ordered 43 new trains for their tram network they however forgot that they have a branch towards duisburg and let the trains built too wide for their lowfloor platforms the entire order cost around 130 million and the added cost has yet to be determined    news articles german   
    couldnt resist    
  german refers to the language region  i think the term you should use is dach since those are the country letters for the 3 places    but speaking of which do any of you have any interesting pieces of information about the berlin construction projects    this has at least some list of stuff buts its in a clickbaity format  theres no new news on the u5 little news on ostkreuz and also absolutely nothing on ber
  montabaur  shouldve derailed into 11 hq instead
  i know but nongerman speakers might not know what dach means so i did it this way instead
  wenigstens wurde niemand verletzt   aber im ernst scheiß auf die deutsche bahn astronomische preise und gleichzeitig knausern die bei der wartung der züge man hätte die nie privatisieren sollen
  regarding berlin  ber is helplessly lost to the point that people claim demolishing and rebuilding the terminals from scratch would be cheaper than trying to fix the problems  ostkreuz rebuild is supposed to be completed by december or at least thats what db claims source below  u5 is delayed until 2020 that was known for long so not really news  i gotta say though that my main interest is in schleswigholstein and the greater hamburg area so i only have surface information about berlin    ostkreuz source 
i dont mind the topic but this really neednt be a general
  probably i was just trying to get one going basically a pilot but if it wont keep going then you wont see any more of them
  i like it a dach general is a nice idea
  retards who start using their native language out of nowhere in an international discussion
  this isnt exactly the most international discussion this is an english language website but i doubt how many nongermans are going to be interested in a thread like this  i would count myself as a nongerman but i can speak the language as a second language so its not problem for me
  im sure theres many nongerman speakers here interested in whats happening im always interested in /n/ related happenings all over the world and depending where its really hard to find firsthand information other than crappy press reports
rip
  they however forgot that they have a branch towards duisburg and let the trains built too wide for their lowfloor platforms  this is something you very much like to forget if youre in a situation like düsseldorf and duisburg municipal reforms were a mistake stadtbahn rheinruhr was a desaster
  missed my bus two times in a row because of notfalleinsatz am gleis more or less meaning emergency doctor operation at the rail which is an euphemism used by the db when somebody gets traind
  have they worked out what was the cause of the fire yet
  its simply impolite
  i thought theyd use personenunfall maybe its just the hamburg ubahn though      some news outlets claimed the trafo caused it but last time i checked neither bahn nor police confirmed it
  this is something you very much like to forget  one would have assumed they had a digital system that keeps track of  among other things  the loading gauges present in the network  they apparently had not or they forgot to check it or there was wrong information stored in there hopefully they will release a full report  municipal reforms were a mistake  agreed although i dont see how they play into this  stadtbahn rheinruhr was a desaster  you forgot about the is and will be part of that
    ac still not working
  düsseldorf doesnt give a fuck about duisburg because düsseldorf is one of the most important international trade and industry hubs of the country and duisburg is a ghetto with a postindustrial wasteland attached it is a very real possibility that u87 or whichever it was will terminate at the municipal border between the two cities in the near future because operating a stadtbahn line in duisburg just doesnt pay off anymore doubly so with the new incompatible rolling stock
  scheiß auf die deutsche bahn  ich fahr von karlsruhe  münchen für 29 im sparpreis dann für 15 mit der bob keine 50km    so schlecht ist die bahn nicht
  dann für 15 mit der bob keine 50km  what the fuck are you doing thats a regular category c train isnt it  you could have covered that with your sparpreis  by the way the price table is more or less determined by deutsche bahn not the bob  the bob is forced to accept that tariff by the transportation authorities here beg    so schlecht ist die bahn nicht  its not but the federal government has been doing its worst  prices for regular not sparpreis not bahncard tickets are fucking insane  at least there is an upper limit of roundabout 160 euro and there is bahncard 100
what do you think of the plan to ignore timetables in the sbahn münchen tunnels
  da sie eh immer spätet kommen begrüße ich diese entwicklung
  wow its almost as if forcing 30 trains per hour and direction from seven different lines into the same twotrack section with block signalling is a really bad idea
  kdefag
  it wont change much for the most people if you need a line to a certain suburb you are either on time or you wait about 20 minutes for the next train to your suburb if you are just riding the sbahn for a few stations you can take almost any train anyway       it works pretty well for decades
burger here and i have a couple of questions for you germa/n/s  1 what cities in germany have the best networks for their size as well as the worst frequency reliability cost and so on  2 how would you rate your local network  3 does your network still print some sort of timetable book
  im not a german but i lived there for nearly a year and i feel like i have a decent amount of outsider perspective with enough actual knowledge  1 what cities in germany have the best networks for their size as well as the worst frequency reliability cost and so on  berlin has the largest network for a single city the sbahn berlin is unique in its nature well maybe similar to the sbahn hamburg but its still a very expansive network with metro like stopping inside the city its uncharacteristic for an sbahn though berlin does however have a large number of re and rb trains which allow for express services within the city as well as to the outskirts as well  the rheinruhr area is probably the largest sbahn and regional network overall but thats a mess of several cities like cologne düsseldorf and smaller towns frequency here is high enough to have a great level of mobility costs are very similar in many places though but within nrw going on a 20 minute train with a single ticket can cost about 8 which i would say is too much considering some networks elsewhere would have a similarly distanced route costing 320 or something like that i guess its up to the transport authority in the area but monthly and annual tickets can be really cheap in the long run especially if you travel a lot reliability is pretty decent a lot of germans really give off about the unreliability of whatever but ive experienced rail disruption before and it usually only occurs maybe once every few months  2 how would you rate your local network  i lived near berlin i would give it an 8/10 not perfect but damn near good thanks to how well integrated regional and city transport was with each other  3 does your network still print some sort of timetable book  db publishes a departures and arrivals book each year 
  dach  not chad
  the service pattern of 30 trains per hour literally hasnt been like this for decades
  yes do you suck poetterings dick
  1 what cities in germany have the best networks for their size as well as the worst frequency reliability cost and so on  can only speak for hamburg pretty much we have very frequent service and reliability for anything not sbahn is good its insultingly expensive though we have some of the most expensive tickets in the country    2 how would you rate your local network  hamburg its good in the city centers the sbahn is not so good but that is mostly because the hamburg senate is forcing all u and sbahn lines to run through the central station and while the ubahn has two seperate and independent stations there the sbahn has not so any time there is a disruption in the area literally all sbahn services come to a halt it does offer very fast service though if theres no disruption also most stations are clean enough to not feel displeased by anything id give it a 7/10    3 does your network still print some sort of timetable book  yes the hvv a tariff union of some 40 transport companies in and around hamburg publishes a large book for the main area and seven smaller books for each of their member landkreise german equivalent of us counties every december
  seconding this
  1 what cities in germany have the best networks for their size as well as the worst frequency reliability cost and so on  die zeit had an issue on that last year i think it mostly were the usual suspects at top and bottom cologne was surprisingly bad though  2 how would you rate your local network  its not bad but once you get into the more rural sections you are obviously fucked  even the lines in the city center could use improved frequencies in the morning rush hour since they are packed they literally could not cope with more people getting out of their cars  3 does your network still print some sort of timetable book  yes the verkehrsverbünde usually issue those unfortunately no printed kursbuch by deutsche bahn anymore  there is   though
  no but im forced to use poetteringware
  they literally could not cope with more people getting out of their cars  this  friend of mine works for stuttgarts transit company and he is quite mad at all the politics pushing for  stop using your cars because of air quality use the trains instead  the trains are already packed at rush hour and they cant make them longer because they are already at max length and they cant run them more frequent because they are already at the max frequency that is safely possible  the only thing that could help would be new lines but good luck getting anything build in germany  first you have to fight the nimbys and if you finally managed that your project is already way too old for the current reality and it will cost 5 times more as planned back in the day see s21
  pulling out the term nimby in the context of s21 feels misleading  s21 was shit by every standard it wouldnt have increased the capacity actually quite the opposite it wouldnt have lowered travel times it wouldnt have increased reliability the only upside it had was that room at the surface would have been freed for other purposes  you could increase the frequency by introducing etcs level 3 you could increase the length by making the platforms longer i think the maximum train length in germany is determined by the axle counters in the network which are assumed to only store a byte 255 axles  the ebo states an ever so slightly lower value for safety reasons iirc the trains in stuttgart are probably still far from that
  s21  nimby  it was a shit project and a complete disaster and now they want to do the same in hamburg with the altona station and that is even worse because now they even move it away from the city core i never actively protested about anything before but for the old altona station i definitely will
  i definitely will  watch out for your eyes man
what do you think of the ideenzug konzept  actually useful  lounge  comfortwith moveable backseats  with consideration  dining area with snacks  lowbudget leaning seats  buissiness class seats and privacy cabins  absolute meme tier  rest  especially biking and gayming
  forgot to add that they are for commuter trains
  well its a concept car so there is a lot of overexaggarated bullshit   leaning seats are usefull for shorter commutes  i can also see the premium class seats being a thing poeple would gladly pay more for a small table to put thier laptop on   lounge is also pretty neat and i guess you could always fit in a coffee machine
        most of these concepts would work well in some sort of doubledeck ice or ic train indeed the larger ic2 bombardier twindexx would be great for an upgrade to improve the seating and indeed the catering options  that said very little would be useful for an re train consider the typical re with a baureihe 143 as the hauling loco you have two decks of reasonably comfortable seating which may also have wifi depending on where you are there might be vending machines on board which are surprisingly nice but the main focus is on high capacity for a shorter train would passengers really like to have leaning seats no its stupid and i would suggest that reasonably basic economy seats would be suitable for such a train especially since these trains tend to be packed full of people standing as well  fewer and fewer regional trains have a 1st class as well these days as the only thing 1st class really gives you is a slightly nicer seat and a table in regional trains itd be much easier to just eliminate 1st class from designated re and rb services and just go for a reasonably comfortable seat with as high a density as can be afforded
  that looks like youre not allowed to be taller than 175cm
  the absolute fucking state of german rails where wifi is still discussed as a premium first class feature for future projects meanwhile other countries already have it in every fucking train
  i lived in the berlin tarif zone area and i remember db regio carrying out a modernisation pilot in the area where they installed wifi systems as well as a capacity indicator near the doors to show how full the top and bottom decks were before you got on as well as bicycle space availability  i remember the speeds on that wifi to be actually rather good    i remember it being piloted and tested on the re1 and re3 services in the berlinbrandenburg region though i must say that it was rather nice to have and far more reliable than what bvb has going on in their stations or vehicles
  many ices already have free wifi  for regular 2nd class travelers even  a local train i use nrw re42 also has some trains fitted with wifi    the situation is far from great but not as bad as you make it sound  dont like they are attempting to cut tls connections open though
  westfalenbahns stadler kiss trains re60 and re70 have had free wifi on second class for a few years now so do ices
  i feel like they could have fit two normal flat beds into this same space
  db regio nord have ordered like 32 wagons for the hamburgkiel/flensburg service and the last of them went in service in like february  turns out not even six months later they want to start implementing wifi in the trains why the fuck could they not just tell bombardier to equip the wagons with wifi from the start
  kek  looks like some are getting fired
  bombardier might not actually have that as an option they can fit i might be as has been the case with a lot of trains ive been on around europe that the fitting of wifi systems is done by 3rd parties now the rail operator can pay that 3rd party for the equipment and install it themselves but with siemens stadler and bombardier it could be that they dont want to deal with 3rd party equipment  especially with older rolling stock its often easier to get aftermarket parts after delivery rather than going to the manufacturer and saying hey install this aftermarket part for us
i am reading an old newspaper from year 1935 saying that austrian national railway company will adopt a rubber tiered train which would be streamline in shape and is electric locomotive and the train would be 75m in length weight 34kt generator power would be 100hp with speed up to 70mph  anyone know what was the news referring to
be me  23 years old  study in kiel have a dorm there  come back to the parents house in hamburg for the weekends though because no internet in the dorm  have a mybahncard 50 because its just 69/year and even just for traveling between hamburg and kiel it saves me hundreds of euros overall  midoctober  get mail  we need confirmation of your age  wondering because i sent them a copy of my id card last year already  go to service center  service woman thinks im born in 1991  tell her no she says well send your age confirmation again  forget about it  get bahncard 50 bill  250 or so  fuck off send age confirmation quickly  that was last week monday 22 oct  fast forward to last friday  get email that i receive a normal bahncard 25  fuck off i call them  oh yea that was a mistake i will order a mybahncard 50 for you  on monday i get an email that i have to send my bahncard back  today i receive the regular bahncard 50 that has already been canceled in my mailbox    why the fuck are these cocksuckers stressing me so much and why are their bahncards more on time than their trains if they fixed the sylt connection as quickly as they send me a card and a 250 bill they would actually be considered one of the best railway companies for fucks sake    pic related is how i feel
also happy holiday to my fellow nord bros and catholic fags
  do they really need an id card for proof of age  i got a mybahncard 25 with none of that stuff for relatively cheap i think like 36 for the 12 month period but that was back in 2016  i had a bit of an issue cancelling the card when i moved back to my home country i had to email them saying that i no longer was resident there and the bank account i used to pay for it no longer exists  i only hope the guys at db didnt do anything to my bonität if i ever move to germany permanently    that said i do hate the bureaucracy its so dumb and ive experienced this in all sorts of places ill make this somewhat relevant but i ordered some db merchandise from the bahnshopde like a wall calander and some other nice db branded stuff but i wasnt at the place i lived then when deutsche post tried to deliver so they left that little ihre sendung ist da note with a code for their website and it just said i could arrage a redelivery online well their website told me that i could only receive my stuff from a post office in the town  not to worry i went into the town queued up for a bit and then when i explained that i need to get my package they asked my for my id i showed it to them but they didnt accept it its an id card from another eu state so i showed them an eu driving license and they didnt accept that either they wanted proof of address that i lived there because apparently having your name on the package isnt enough fortunately i had a letter from the university with an address on it they accepted it and i got my package  die typische deutsche bürokratie
  do they really need an id card for proof of age  yes a regular bahncard 50 costs like 250 per year and a discount one is only available to people under the age of 27    the other part  lmfao horrible
  a discount one is only available to people under the age of 27  im aware of the mybahncard bit since i did have a mybahncard 25 i suppose it makes sense that a significantly discounted railcard would need proof of age since a regular bahncard would cost like 60 or something like that eh     other part  lmfao horrible  i mean this was in brandenburg so its probably not as surprising i had less bureaucracy with the townhall of all places than receiving post i get that the sparkasse kinda needed to know a lot about me but eh most banks do no matter where you are  do any of you have any idea if db can affect your bonität if things start getting weird with your bahncard like when cancelling it  if i ever do choose to migrate to germany and id like to i would sure hope that db doesnt mess me up especially since so many landlords are so concerned with your bonität when you want to rest some appartment making it near impossible for even eu citizens to just move to germany
  and hes gone    
  
  germany is third world when it comes to internet service and pricing
tfw sbahn was killed in the whole region in the 60s and 70s  tfw a citizens initiative in the early 00s went nowhere  i dont even care if it would be cheaper more punctual or more reliable but i want a comfy sbahn reeeee
  lol hat deine uni kein semesterticket     sbahn was killed in the whole region  where
  lol hat deine uni kein semesterticket  different anon but the berlin univerisites only give you a berlin abc semesterticket for about 240 if you want to have your ticket cover the whole of brandenburg you have to go to the asta and pay them additional money to add brandenburg zones to it  meanwhile the universität potsdam has their standard semesterticket cover the entirety of berlin and brandenburg    likely that anons uni only offers a standard semesterticket for the kiel area or maybe even only schleswigholstein theres also the factor that longdistance trains ic ice ec arent covered in a regional tarif area vbb has a list of ic and ice trains which are valid for travel with vbb tickets but theyre a limit number of trains and i doubt many people actually know that they can take 4 ices a day from berlin hauptbahnhof to berlin südkreuz with their vbb ticket
  where  koblenz i dunno i heard some old folks say it was kinda shit anyway  i know that neighbouring neuweed the picture before stopped using its own around the same time    kinda interesting article sadly completly in german    die idee der sbahninitiative besteht darin die kosten so gering wie möglich zu halten indem weitgehend auf bestehende gleise zurückgegriffen wird haltestellen müssen da eingerichtet werden wo die menschen sind das ergebnis der studie wir haben die möglichkeit ein sbahnnetz im norden von rheinlandpfalz anzubieten  zu den niedrigsten kosten in deutschland  the idea of the sbahninitative is keeping costs as low as possible by largly using already existing rail infrastructure tram stops have to be established where the people are at the result of the study we have the chance to offer the north of rlp a sbahn network  to the lowest costs in all of germany
  hamburgkiel anon here  my uni has a semesterticket but its only for the kiel area a monthly ticket for kielhamburg would be like 250 a month way too expensive so i get a bahncard for 69 bucks and pay a bit over 100 a month at most for trains still quite a bit but saving over 100 bucks a month is something i have to do of course the astas of sh universities are advocating for an shwide student ticket though that also includes hamburg last i heard is that it would be around 100 per semester starting in 2019 so this would be my last bahncard year anyway
    yeah i know its a confusing mess my unis asta is absolutely based when it comes to transport politics this has the downside that i pay almost 300  per semester now most of which is the price of the ticket     the concept sounds very interesting but it looks like new railway routes wont be built in germany more tracks and better infrastructure maybe maybe an extended tram or metro line here and there but we wont have any new main line railways before socialism wins     it looks like you got tram and sbahn confused by the way dont do that its the mark of the redneck
  most of which is the price of the ticket    while that is true at least if you are in nrw most means barely more than half of it  a lot of those 300 go into retarded endeavors like equal opportunities offices but at the same time a lot of people probably also perceive the semesterticket as a retarded endeavor be it because they never use public transport or because they perceive it as an outrageous injustice its limited to college students  semestertickets are fucking awesome for everyone though not only students they keep rents from exploding even further in college towns and reduce car traffic and thus emissions they also make colleges further away from the big cities more attractive  its a winwinwinwinwinwin situation
  with the berlin universities fu hu and the many hochschule the semesterticket being about 230 is pretty high consider too that it only covers the berlin abc zone which is the entirety of berlin itself and the socalled speckgürtel outside of berlin in brandenburg  it means you can live outside of berlin with really cheap rent and then take the bus or re into the city when you need to of course there are many issues with how buses and so on are managed in brandenburg with god awful timetables with basically next to nonexistant services on the weekends or on public holidays which is a nightmare when reformationstag is a public holiday in brandenburg and is a normal working day in berlin    that said the sheer amount of students who just cycle into the universities in berlin kind of brings about the question of why even bother with public transport that said its kind of funny that when your bus is running 15 minutes late and youre late to your class you recognise that your lecturer is on the same bus as you i suppose that with certain places you cant really do much with the semesterticket the costs will almost always be high and there will be plenty of people complaining that theyre never going to make use of it  a lot of those 300 go into retarded endeavors like equal opportunities offices  the fu has a breakdown of the fees you pay 230 approx was for the semesterticket 20 was for university registration and 10 was for the asta
  while that is true at least if you are in nrw most means barely more than half of it  the price at my uni is currently at 19070  so yeah i thought it was higher from memory   a lot of those 300 go into retarded endeavors like equal opportunities offices but at the same time a lot of people probably also perceive the semesterticket as a retarded endeavor be it because they never use public transport or because they perceive it as an outrageous injustice its limited to college students   i dunno i like all the stuff that is being done with the rest of the money our asta is pretty based   i cant fathom how anyone could not like their semesterticket even if you already live in the same city where you study it opens up a bunch of possibilities to visit places in nrw and beyond such as other cities your friends relatives landscape etc nrw is fairly large and it is the most populous state by far it certainly has a lot to offer i think im gonna enroll for a degree in physics or something once im done actually studying fuck cars and fuck paying out of my ass to travel by public transport which should be free anyway     with the berlin universities fu hu and the many hochschule the semesterticket being about 230 is pretty high consider too that it only covers the berlin abc zone which is the entirety of berlin itself and the socalled speckgürtel outside of berlin in brandenburg   why would you want to go anywhere else in brandenburg except for hiking   buses and so on are managed in brandenburg with god awful timetables with basically next to nonexistant services on the weekends or on public holidays which is a nightmare when reformationstag is a public holiday in brandenburg and is a normal working day in berlin  haha that sucks but its a new problem aint it lower saxony only made reformation day a public holiday this year
  why would you want to go anywhere else in brandenburg except for hiking  i uh lived in brandenburg at the time i mean it was still within the berlin c zone so i had no issues with the semesterticket but i did have issues with the buses where i lived since i relied on them to either get me to the train station for the re or to another bus stop which connected onto a bvg bus  brandenburg at least has potsdam which is a really beautiful city plus brandenburg is really cheap since the mietspiegel is so low compared to berlin plus if youre close to a station with re or sbahn services youre pretty much 20 minutes away from mitte  haha that sucks but its a new problem aint it lower saxony only made reformation day a public holiday this year  i encountered this problem in 2016 apparently berlin officially adopted reformationstag as a public holiday in 2017 by which stage i was no longer there my guess as to why brandenburg was so early to adopt it as a public holiday likely stems from the fact that wittenberg is a pretty important religious city at least for lutheranism    kinda unrelated but you say your asta is pretty based but from my experience at least in berlin the student elections were dominated by the socialist solidarity list the antiracism list the end patriarchical hetronormitivity list and so on there was one dont let your voice be left with the left list a pretty liberal translation on my part which was mostly conservative but their posters got torn off walls really quickly i didnt vote in those student elections in part because idk if i should have as an erasmus student i had heard about die liste appearing in some student elections in some other universities which i probably would have voted for
  fuck cars and fuck paying out of my ass to travel by public transport which should be free anyway    cars arent the problem its our society that forces many people to use cars and albeit not remotely as strongly as in the us puts the poor people stamp on public transport riders which is not reflective of the situation public transport is often more expensive than private car ownership in the long run sometimes even in the short run i always come back to thinking about that top gear episode where they bought a secondhand car got it insured topped it up with gas and it was cheaper than riding the train for the same trip our societies are fucking ridiculous verkehrswende my ass  public transport should not be free because it would lower its publicly perceived value even further yes everyone ought to be able to afford the trips he needs to do in order to live a good life thats the benchmark
  i uh lived in brandenburg at the time i mean it was still within the berlin c zone  yeah i meant why would you want to go outside of that zone plus potsdam maybe     i encountered this problem in 2016  wouldnt have guessed considering how much of brandenburg is atheist rather than protestant     there are delegates from sixteen different lists in my universitys student parliament right now 24 out of the 29 seats are held by center to left groups but most students are center to left as well especially those who are interested in university politics we continue to have lots of trouble with the identitarian movement a turkish rightwing group and an especially disruptive brand of rcds members so im glad there is enough opposition to those groups in the parliament       thats pretty much what i mean by fuck cars i dont wanna abolish them altogether i just think they should be limited to say 20 of all trips and our cities villages and public transport networks should be built to facilitate that   i dont think perceived value is a problem here i dont wanna ride in shiny new mercedes benz trams with payforuse wi fi   yes everyone ought to be able to afford the trips he needs to do in order to live a good life thats the benchmark   i agree but that also means that costs have to be significantly reduced for pensioners jobless minimum wage workers large families etc etc at that point why not just fund them via tax altogether
  yeah i meant why would you want to go outside of that zone plus potsdam maybe  sachsenhausen is just out of the c zone a lot of the havel and the lakes around there are also outside of the c zone  outside of the area frankfurt an der oder is apparently interesting if you want to see the border with poland theres the tropical islands the worlds largest indoor water park in brand i think there are a few narrow gauge railways in brandenburg but im not sure of them  also cottbus and brandenburg must be interesting cities right  and if the transportatio/n/ overtakes you eberswalde has a trolleybus system one of 3 remaining in germany along with esslingen am neckar and solingen which has a line to wuppertal eberswalde has a number of former bvb east berlin trolleybuses which are preserved although ironically preserved eberswalde trolleybuses are now kept in salzburg
  at that point why not just fund them via tax altogether    what would happen is homeless abusing buses and trains as shelter at night and in winter  at the moment doing that without a ticket is a crime
  sounds like a comparatively minor problem considering that they already do it with or without a ticket anyway i personally dont like sitting next to a homeless person either at least if they smell or keep begging for money but its certainly better than being sexually harrassed by a 50 ladies skittles club or being squeezed in between a bunch of dortmund hooligans those people all pay and are much worse than the homeless     maybe we should open more homeless shelters and offer better care as well remove the incentive to ride a train all night instead of sleeping in an official shelter im afraid thats too far removed from general corporate interest though and the homeless arent generally a relevant voter base either

hi guys got a question whats the type of motor on ice 4 pmsm or the conventional induction motors or something else
    be at work  testing german train ticket machine   shit ton of bugs nothing works properly prints wrong tickets  team gets call from germany  they need the soft build asap  tell them its fucked  send it now  ok retard but its on u  mnfg    when did germany become so
  when did germany become so  unless you drop names which i assume you cannot and absolutely should not i cant really answer that question  as to why theyd need it now instead of later well the yearly timetable change is in three weeks    if there is actually a problem it will make german news on a large scale
oh no  trams are too expensive  
  what do you think about the 29 upgraded projects    many of these projects are necessary investments that were postponed for years or decades its about time that they get the attention they need and make up for the negligence rail traffic has been at its very limit in many of these hubs or lines that are mentioned there    being from the west im especially mad about  9 abs grenze d/nl kaldenkirchen  viersen  rheydtodenkirchen  imagine having a railway line that plays an integral part for freight traffic in the west of europe but youre too lazy to build that second track a line that mostly goes through flat fields where smaller train stations inbetween already have their second track to let trains pass from different directions pass another    30 abs münster  lünen  another candidate that is in dire need of a second track afaik this line was already prepared to get it but due to change of regulations that requires a wider distance between tracks everything has to be planned anew to accommodate todays standards    41 knoten köln inkl westspange und verknüpfungsbauwerk kölnmülheim  the entiretiy of colognes rail network and its surrounding is and has been a clusterfuck for years theres almost no line or station that does not need investments to accommodate the mass of traffic of today alone it doesnt even include the increase that has to be calculated in for the next years its just a small patch for a major bleeding but probably better than nothing          they plan to modernize the hameln  elze railway line not the hameln  hannover one that eventually leads to lehrte i suppose the intention is to relieve hannover as a major hub for the northwestern region and especially lead freight traffic around it     see pic related    found in this presentation 
  dropped the image
  imagine having a railway line that plays an integral part for freight traffic in the west of europe but youre too lazy to build that second track  dont most freight trains towards the netherlands go via aachen west gbf and emmerich bf  im madder about the eisernen rhein its ridiculous it ends in dalheim these days
  i suppose the intention is to relieve hannover as a major hub for the northwestern region and especially lead freight traffic around it  considering that the major rail line it connects to is the lehrteberlin high speed line i would make sense to me that they are looking at ways to increase capacity for the lines around hannover while allowing more trains to get to berlin  berlins first high speed line was the lehrteberlin one mostly as that was the only line kept open into west berlin from the federal republic berlinhamburg and berlinleipzig came a bit later but there is still the pretty poor situation of having very few fast train services to berlin  cologne/düsseldorf via hamm to berlin takes 5 hours  after the recent opening of the nuremburgerfurt high speed line munichberlin now takes 4 hours down from 6    the train from frankfurt or even stuttgart still takes ab obscene amount of time to get to berlin while i guess berlin isnt like other cities like london and paris where everything centralises around it berlin is still the federal capital and is also an important connection for international trains to prague warsaw moscow malmö budapest and so on
i cant believe you ride your bike in yhe winter thats crazy   spends 5 minutes scraping ice from window and another 10 minutes sitting in their ice cagr waiting gor it to warm up
  i really need to start spell checkink
  i say this exact thing to people when they bring up winter riding at the same time though commuting by fat bike fucking sucks even if i destroy all the obstacles in my path and there are just some days where a smaller/normal bike cant do it
  10 mins waiting for car to heat up    in leafland it takes up to 30 mins
  im in denver so its not too bad
to be frank i get a perverse sort of pleasure out of riding in really nasty conditions and seeing the astonished looks i get     also it comes in handy sometimes because nobody at the office complains about the weather or uses it as an excuse for being late for work because its so easy for a coworker to point out that d rode his bike to work and was on time
  also it comes in handy sometimes because nobody at the office complains about the weather or uses it as an excuse for being late for work because its so easy for a coworker to point out that d rode his bike to work and was on time  fucking faggot
      he doesnt have an engine heater in his car while living in an area with a winter  americans
  so many denverites on this damn board
  based    unbased
  tbqh its probably still less time than putting on all the layers of winter bike clothing
    if i were to commute by bike i walk right now during winter would i use clipless or flats its a short commute on a main road that will be fucked out with ice snow and ignorant soccer moms for the next 5 months i will be riding a single speed cxstyle bike my head says flats so i can bail if i wipe out or am i being overly cautious
  how confident are you in your skills
  i mostly ride trails and skatepark so zero on a cross bike
  im just gonna send it with clipless since theyre already installed
  i personally prefer flats in any kind of traffic situation
  i ride my mtb all year round with clipless but last winter i had some situations where flats could have been better ist was slippery as hell and i couldnt bail as fast as i wanted to also snow accumulates in your cleets and pedals sometimes making it impossible to clip in
  get these and have both
  neat   are clipless really worth it
  for longer rides yeah  the disadvantage of needing a separate pair of shoes for riding and walking around makes it less useful for commuting or running errands  you can get walkable spd shoes but its still not the same
  i ride both and i dont feel any difference apart from climbs where you can temporarily pull on the pedals instead of switching to a lighter gear
  you can also do that with clips
  plebeians dont have heated garages
  no garage
  press a button on my key fob 10 minutes before i leave to turn the car on   ice is all melted off and car is toasty when im ready to go  pull out onto street and speed down the bike lane mowing down bikefags by the dozens on my way to work
  pull out onto street and speed down the bike lane mowing down bikefags by the dozens on my way to work  once then the popo grab me at work and take me to the clink  homeland security gets involved once they discover i frequent 4chan  declare it domestic terrorism i get sent to gitmo  spend the rest of my life in an 8x8 cell

i want an old 80s steelie but deep down i know that it will never get ridden
i spent the last 20 years wanting a set of spinergy wheels and i just managed to make it happen d
  not to bum you out but arent those dangerous and discontinued
   arent those dangerous and discontinued    yes and they are broken  and i am going to repair them at my machine shop and ride on them and make a thread about it      s u i c i d e w h e e l s
  you cant machine garbon you dipshit fucking weeb
  cant machine garbon  being this dumb
  that inset photo  imagine peeling back gods own foreskin like it aint no thang these neanderthals had no idea what they were fooling with
  i hope you document the process and share it with us
  first full sus i ever rode  shop owner let me take it for a spin  actually the only one come to think of it      aloud  nah were all just reading it mentally so its pretty quiet

i definetely wouldnt lead with pix of the flying v theres a janny around here trying to corner the market and thats a red flag for him
is this one collectible
i have a pair of giant mcr wheels  carbon spokes and aluminium rigida dp18 rims  weight 3kg they roll so fast though
  adjustable stem
  gentlemen
  fuggg ive seen an anon post this exact bike in a long gone pybt i never fapped so hard in my life i want one so badly
  i had them too absolute garbage wheels but they had a e s t h e t i c s
  u leik
  /r/ photo of cockpit setup
  would if i could i dont got it no more but it has sakae bars from the junk yard shimano exage brake hoods and a sturmey archer bar end shifter
  looks like theres a modest amount of seatpost extension did you use a supershort stem to keep the reach within reason on that oblong frame
  if marlboro would make a folding fat tire full suspension electric bike i would take up smoking 
    i know a shop that has one for sale should i pick it up
  saw someone post it in a pybt once and he got laughed out if the thread by people making fun of the bike
a group of graffiti vandals assaults three passengers on barcelona metro    among the assaulted was a pregnant woman who had paint sprayed in her face    the incident ocurred around 0348 when a group of 34 graffiti vandals activated the emergency break on a line 4 train which at that moment was stopped at maragall station they then proceeded to paint the train     the pregnant woman got paint sprayed in her face and two other people were shoved and hit in the face     one member of the group was detained by metro security personnel and delivered to the police     what can be done to deal with this scourge /n/ i suggest armed guards shooting to kill any such vandal
helloooooooo  graffiti will never stop sorry  you can always learn to like it  in any case assaulting people  not cool but theres no need to generalize theres assholes in every scene lets look at the nice things          these girls are cool as hell      lot of love 
start cutting off their hands like the saudis
graffiti can be really cool its a way of young people putting life and art into a city and fighting back against the dreary machine we so often live our lives working for and in   if you dislike the aesthetic then the way to stop it is to embrace it create interesting public and private spaces and fill the city with legal commissioned art   you crush a rebellion by addressing what is being rebelled against and appropriating the good of what youre fighting
  college freshman tier cringe
one of the reasons i like riding the train is because i get to see free art every time without graffiti i may as well take the bus  assault  assault is bad but entirely unrelated
  why cant people create art without vandalizing property
  i dunno man in my area they only paint buildings where the paint is already falling off because the owners dont give a shit about the building  the original paint you can see at heights above the graffiti is so disgusting id rather see the fresh coats of graffiti instead of beige paint marked by rust and grime and missing flakes
  the best way to reduce graffiti is to encourage good public/ private art and design in the city       why am i wrong
  well thats what you want but others might not
  think of some beautiful cities they all have graffiti op was in barcelona a city with no shortage of great public spaces architecture and art
  do they have graffiti marring the aesthetic parts of the city though   i cant speak for barcelona but where i live its almost exclusively on ugly or derelict places when the city bothers to make something nice then people dont abuse it they especially dont with public art and when the city actually hires street artists who do graffiti and makes public spaces available for work then you definately dont see the quick ugly runngun bombing around it     all thats being tagged on it ugly or derelict things/ places which in my opinion are improved by it hell my city did a really quick paint over all the graffiti on one rail coridoor into town for a big spots tournament but they didnt bother to make anything good of it and it made the trip much worse
  hell all i can see in ops pick is a hideous beige metro and trains and interesting pieces of color improving them     you might say its not to many peoples taste but actually if you take grafitti as a part of hiphop culture as it originally was well that culture is culturally dominant now in america atleast hiphop is now the most popular genre of music    
  also i proposed a solution   which has inherent merit regardless of whether you agree of its efficacy or not theres no downside aside from expendature     im yet to hear any other solution all the conventional methods seem to just be relatively futile attrition which is just an enormous waste of money and largely ineffective  armed guards shooting to kill any such vandal  ok college freshman cringe is better atleast than primary school edgelord cringe
do you think this is bad  do you think anyone is going to tag on this
  yes
  theres no downside aside from expendature  
  i agree with this but  i think its a bit wack to paint the trains windows
i dont know about elsewhere but around here graffiti seems to be on the decline hip hop has fully arrived in the mainstream the underground and rebel novelty is wearing off the region is gaining wealth
  they want grimy peeling flaking buildings i think this post is entirely correct      ive seen /a/ and /jp/ sorts of graffiti too
  what can be done to deal with this scourge  at the very lest the same thing that happened to the faggot aussie or american in singapore a hard caneing to the ass although i wouldnt mind a firing squad for the second offence
  sounds about right
  create interesting public and private spaces and fill the city with legal commissioned art and good design
  penalty for cost for cleaning up everything lost of revenue and mental damage due to this and also disruption to society multiply by 3 times these damages for the penalty they need to pay forced labor if they cannot also 5 years of jail sentence
  why they arent a problem in asia
  shoot to kill for vandalism   im ok with this
    t jeff goldblum from death wish    it contributes to an atmosphere of lawlessness this can be tolerated if youre liechtenstein where it would simply serve to make the place less oppressive but if you already have street crime then it should be discouraged    its ironic that sunnyside gardens should be mentioned in an apparently positive way when sg is a notoriously nimbyist pearlclutching area
  it contributes to an atmosphere of lawlessness  street art of a girl watering a tree
      pls tell me where you fucktards live i want to rebel against the man by putting some art in your living room and by art i mean signing my name on your wall
  because these people are god damn foreigners who dont even live here and dgaf about whether art is encouraged or not they go places just to tag trains for the hell of it and why do you even assume that art isnt encouraged here you massive cuck theres lots of places to paint graffiti or even abandoned buildings noone cares about you have literal shit for brains you cocksucking son of a goat and seven executioners
  spraying graffiti in someones living room is the same as on a house wall/train station/wherever
  trains and stations dont belong to anyone so its fair game to vandalise them
  it would still have the same effect even if theyre literally writing down the law there
  all art is vandalism
   art is vandalism  whos to determine that someone who doesnt own the property
  please explain to me how a large mural of a girl watering a tree contributes to an atmosphere of lawlessness i would argue the opposite that the street art would be universally respected except you and would discourage people from tagging on and around it   you might say that graffiti contributes to an atmosphere of lawlessness and i dont necessarily agree but my point is that commissioning street art reduces graffiti and makes people take pride in respect and look after places
  actually it would depends on the identity of the person who paint that because those arts act as a signifier of those who painted them if theyre painted by gangsters then it will attract gangsters no matter how positive the painting might seems maybe if theyre painted by nice schoolkids then theyll foster community integrity even if they both have exact samecontent
  graffiti  art
  as someone with no connections to either gangsters or schoolchildren i have no idea who the artist was that painted any of the street art ive ever seen   i dont readily categorize people as either gangsters or schoolchildren either that is an absurd dichotomy if someone can make a cool mural then they are an artist     if you dislike graffiti because graffiti contributes to an atmosphere of lawlessness then my point is that encouraging/commissioning street art will reduce graffiti   that is for several reasons   it brings something used as a rebellion into the mainstream which takes away some of its appeal to rebellious people   it takes away the notion that society doesnt care about us so fuck society  it makes the space more aesthetic and gives it artistic value so anyone tagging on it either has to live up to that or be disrespecting it     i dont understand how even if the artist was a criminal or whatever that any of that would not still apply and how most people would even be expected to know or care
  its really a question of semantics at this point  what is art   etc a tiresome arguement     and there is certainly both good and bad art so calling something art is not even an endorsement of it
  ask yourself the question  why are people tagging    one answer is as a big fuck you to society    so if society private and public commissions street art then tagging can no longer be a fuck you to society because society has appropriated it and is endorsing it it completely depowers that motivation to do graffiti
  graffiti are cultural they represent a culture that ignore laws the culture should be eradicated not reduced but eradicated and it have been done pretty successfully those who disagree with it can protest by jumping off the platform    alternatively they can be put in jail until theyre trained to understand the cinceot
  cinceot  concept
  youre not really addressing what i said you have your own position youre stating it and then youre largely ignoring mine     graffiti are cultural they represent a culture that ignore laws the culture should be eradicated not reduced but eradicated and it have been done pretty successfully  actually graffiti was originally one of the three components of hiphop culture alongside rapping and breakdancing that is the origin of graffiti hiphop culture which is culturally what graffiti truly represents is globally dominant its actually mainstream culture now     the other way to interpret what graffiti represents culturally is that of youth rebellion and a cynical third thing might be criminality youth rebellion is universal and unending it is not a culture which cannot be eradicated no matter which form it manifests itself in punk etc it will always exist and it is ultimately to the benefit of society
  alternatively they can be put in jail until theyre trained to understand the concept  how old are you
  hiphop culture  it is american subculture and should stay within america  youth rebellion  thats why education via punishment is needed    how old are you  young enough that never did anything that need to be put in jail
i highly recommend this documentary about the origins of graffiti in nyc if youre interested in the subject     it focuses on the subway a lot and has crazy shit in it like cock putting up double fences with wolves in them     even if you want to eradicate it youd do best to actually try to understand it and the people who do it not simply dismiss them as criminals who should be locked up/shot     
   culture  it is american subculture and should stay within america    lol im a kiwi and hiphop is basically dominant here now especially amongst young people and i meet euros pretty often travelling around the country and thats by and large what they listen to as well christ german rap music is awful von party zu party     its global and the world in general follows america culturally     no but how old are you why not answer that
  and im simply refuting your point as to what it culturally represents being on the verge of eradication or something you even can eradicate its either hiphop or its youth rebellion   neither of those things are possible to eradicate     and fuck im even saying how you might reduce graffiti its simply not lock em up and shoot em or whatever nonsense authoritarian cunts believe
  another example for the infectious nature of american culture     i recall when they were actually somewhat popular here and thankfully thats no longer the case   probably even those rebellious young people are now able to see the ridiculous element of doing so
  they  what hiphop or graffiti   here  where
  they  american culture  here  somewhere in the eastern hemisphere thats not oceania
  why are you being such a paranoid faggot
  it sounds like youd be happier moving to singapore  or maybe best korea is more to your liking
  i hope your lungs explode of all the crap paint chemicals stuffing into it and you die from inside out
  lolollololol    blaming it on foreigners  so angry on the internet    godam u just thought of how it must feel beeing you walking down the street in real world and it made me feel bad      by the way all the people here speaking about the artistic part of graffiti etc etc youre not getting it  the big energy driving this movement is that its illegal and that its vandalism thats the fucking fun part of it most people here are law obeying normal people you will never understand how it feels not giving a fuck about the law and deciding for yourself what you wanna do and just for fun paint everywhere cause thats the only thing it is bros just paint in some place    and damn its fun to paint dont you rememeber when you where kids the same thing but way more fun and with a statement  there is no total private property  the underground resistance that lives beyond the law will always exist so fear us and call your police so they can go defend you when whatever at your life goes wrong    life is like a video game just fuckin play more dont takeit all so seriously we all die anyway fuck im happy right now and no i dont do drugs    pic related is pixacao 100 vandalism isit still art who cares
just let it happen     better yet graffiti should be viewed as a public service and subsidized  paint is expensive and it prevents rust and corrosion graffiti artists are willing to paint shit for free they also bring vibrance to otherwise dreary and decaying infrastructure
  this
  you think grafitti artists buy their paints
  graf artist here a lot of times we steal but in the long term a ton of shit is bought cause we fukin consume it as a drug you cant steal enough
  being this correct and reasonable on /n/    what the fuck is wrong with you
  they want grimy peeling flaking buildings  i think theyd prefer the building simply be fixed up but personally i prefer run down shit to graffiti art
graffiti is simply a part of nigger trash culture and its no surprise lowt whites on this forum love and encourage it
  
  not him but whenever a train getting graffitied in my place when they air the cctv video footage of those vandal on the news those criminals always look like theyre from some other part of the world
    paints are expensive  have you considered how much it cost for train companies to paint them and more painting reduce aerodynamic
  nice samefagging ass spelunker
  lolollololol   it on foreigners   angry on the internet  godam u just thought of how it must feel beeing you walking down the street in real world and it made me feel bad    by the way all the people here speaking about the artistic part of graffiti etc etc youre not getting it  the big energy driving this movement is that its illegal and that its vandalism thats the fucking fun part of it most people here are law obeying normal people you will never understand how it feels not giving a fuck about the law and deciding for yourself what you wanna do and just for fun paint everywhere cause thats the only thing it is bros just paint in some place  and damn its fun to paint dont you rememeber when you where kids the same thing but way more fun and with a statement  there is no total private property  the underground resistance that lives beyond the law will always exist so fear us and call your police so they can go defend you when whatever at your life goes wrong  life is like a video game just fuckin play more dont takeit all so seriously we all die anyway fuck im happy right now and no i dont do drugs  pic related is pixacao 100 vandalism isit still art who cares  sorry i would not like to live in an anarchist country and also not in an anticapitalist commieland  besides public transportation vehicle arent private theyre brought by train companies that either gather fund from government or gather fund from passenger ticket fare they belongs to everyone by vandalizing them you are vandalizing property of everyone  inb4 who on earth pay for fare or tax lol  society order destroyers like these are why public systems get ruined eating upon contribution from every other individuals in the society even communist wont welcome this type of person
  kys scum this is only a way of rebelling against the society if you are too pathetic to make any real difference in anyones life this is why it is done by poor trash who will never amount to anything
  not liking anime graffiti
  that was a commissioned mural  doesnt count
  read my posts   my point was that commissioning murals street art and good design was the best way to reduce graffiti
  reduce is not eradicate
  sure but couldnt you still theoretically get most of the way there with what im suggesting and then still execute the people left tagging or whatever edgy authoritarian nonsense you fantasize about     its not mutually exclusive and i dont see a downside to my idea even regardless of its efficacy
  taggers dont give a shit about how good a piece is they just feel entitled to cover anything up anywhere coon scum should be free to shoot
  coon scum should be free to shoot      seethe harder i havent said shit but youll find a reason to get pissed off and scream /pol/ at anyone who you dont like    i dindu nuffin   funny how polcunts behave like niggers
  actually graffiti was originally one of the three components of hiphop culture  yes thats right nothing happened before the twentieth century
  youre right but contemporary graffiti as an art form with the specific style we associate with it is a subculture of hiphop
  and also less widely associated with punk before then which is in many ways similar   but the aesthetic we think of now as graffiti thats a hiphop thing
people itt defending taggers and implying they make art  w e w l a d  e  w  l  a  d
  
  the bruh just legoloise it bruh is the shittiest idea we ever got in the modern era stealing copper wires and painting over important street signs is a way to say fuck you to society slashing peoples tires for fun is a way to say fuck you to society punks harassing people on the streets is a way they say fuck you to society so now should you provide criminals with specific light posts to rip the copper on and signs made to paint over  should we give them parking lots full of tires just to slash  have paid actors that they can get their harassment fix on all day     or maybe we should just you know answer the demands to break away from society and expel them from it and since we cant throw them into the wild we invented a place for this its called jail
  have you considered how much it cost for train companies to paint them and more painting reduce aerodynamic  lol what sure it weighs slightly more but i dont see how a 01 mm layer of paint would affect aerodynamics in any meaningful way
  so now should you provide criminals with specific light posts to rip the copper on  in a very indirect way sort of yes you should provide them with meaningful economic opportunities so they dont resort to plundering copper      painting over important street signs  punks harassing people on the streets  parking lots full of tires just to slash     lol where do you live where any of these are realities and not some fearmongering authoritarian boomer nonsense strawman
  not him but come to lille france and youll have exactly these types of things that and the subway here is made of plastic and easily taggable material so every train is covered in shitty keymade graphs     oh and kys faggot
  dont listen to this anon lille is in the north aka trash france but not the rich kind of trash like in the south east but rather the poor kind of trash
  style wars is so freaking cool   1
  lol where do you live  planet earth im sorry if i dont live in fucking la la land like you i unfortunately inhabit a place where that happens in just about every country short of switzerland actually they probably got shit too and we just dont know also  yes  wrong answer you get an f
  to corroborate the point made in  heres the very first result i got in google for tyre slashing     i dont even live there and mind you that is canada not hajiinfested europe not mexican infested southern usa so you can bet these arent just poor misunderstood or unfortunate people theyre rich and middle class kids out deriving their fun from fucking with you about the other points  punks harassing people is just fearmongering  read the op punks graffitting street signs not a reality  leave your damn house now you still didnt answer whether we should give these people free tires to slash free signs to vandalize and paid actors to harass
  so the fact an example of something exists online makes it a serious issue in your community     i guess underwater dolphin rape caves are a serious problem for you too
i have literally never been inconvenienced by the defacing of an important sign   or been harassed by street punks  or had my tires slashed   or heard of anyone i know having their tires slashed
  so the fact an example of something exists online makes it a serious issue in your community   i guess underwater dolphin rape caves are a serious problem for you too  not the other users but were getting some of these incidents like once every two or three years in the entire city it is not serious per se but its still a huge disruption that should be targeted and eradicated i bet theres a place on the heaven where they can spray as much paint they like without disrupting anyone else granted they would most likely fall into the hell instead
    oh anon i though you were trying to make a point not shitpost by posting a recent example that simply showed up on google on another country entirely recent and that i had no idea ever happened im saying its more common than it seems  i have never  been harassed by street punks  seems like you have a terminal case of reality detachment syndrome or sheltering dont worry theres a cure though its called leaving your house and walking a street but do note that the driveway on your gated community doesnt count but what do i know ive never been murdered raped or stabbed before so those cant be real actual problems and are probably just zoomer crybaby nonissues right 
  lol please tell me about your experiences being harassed by street punks   was it something like this    
  rape murder stabbing  graffiti    hardly equivelant issues   if youd never seen graffiti before it wouldnt be an issue for you just because you could google some in canada would it
  either you live in a really poor area or very near one for this to be as common as you make it out to be or youre just lying  also graffiti is one crime youre just randomly bunching it with whatever else worse crimes you can make a mural without punching old ladies and bullying neckbeards on the subway
  this is what we get for letting the bad guys win the war
  so there are good crimes and bad crimes  i mean the whole point here is that the same people are usually committing all these acts but sure good to know let me know where you live so i can express myself through the good crime of throwing rocks at your windows also shouldve figured you were going to pull the lol just dont live in a shithole card people always do that when their first reaction to anything is asking where others live unfortunately for you thats actually a problem in every place that isnt your condo my dude
as a graff writer reading these is always fun the more you dislike or hate graffiti the more i am going to enjoy painting my pieces
  va bien te faire foutre the same phenomenon can be seen in paris as well but hey cunts will be cunts
  what on earth are you talking about of course theres difference between crimes or do you think murder is the same as jaywalking because theyre both illegal but then again you seem completely unable to comprehend any degree of nuance in things  what i meant by the poor area part was simply what i said its not as common as you make it out to be i live in a very high immigration area with plenty of poor areas and theres little graffiti trouble street crimes are aso pretty low you cant just pretend its the same in the whole world as it is where you live
  you cant just pretend its the same in the whole world as it is where you live  where he lives  likely a rage filled impotent fantasy land / basement
  have you ever tried to sleep in an apartment within downtown of a city during midnight and then disrupted by people on the streets    its not that frequent to spot them but whenever i do the atmosphere in the area become bad    still disruption to society nevertheless    there are good crimes and bad crimes but disrupting social order is definitely a bad crime    writer  as if anyone would read whats written in those dirt    jaywalking  talk about disrupting transportation on a transportation board  yeah any drivers who saw jaywalkers on the road should have the duty to immediate accelerate and steer toward the targets position in order to remove that obstacle
i love the look of new concrete and steel around train infrastructure shiny new catenary and electric substations why cant you guys go tag some ugly stuff instead
  they already tagged your mom enough
          i dont consider those graffiti it looks good    i consider graffiti ugly and oppressive artpieces meant to make surroundings worse      those are graffiti ugly and aggressive meant to make people feel bad
  even worst korea has almost no graffiti garffiti only exist in places where there is a dwinfling notion of public good
  graffiti  spray painting peoples property at its worst hurts  property values  the property owners wallet should he choose to repaint his property  illusion of grip that local authorities have on the current generation of problem kids    im going to walk around whatever you define a bad crime and just ask for how an offender should be punished since disrupting social order is incredibly vague and common see drunken disorderly noise complaint other nonviolent offenses    given the offending people are likely  dumb youth to young twenties with nothing better to do saw graffiti and want to emulate it  young adults who grew up doing this and want to remain edgy probably wont be caught as theyve been caught several times before    how do we punish most perpetrators young people without ruining the rest of their lives     i do believe there should be an upper level of consequence for things like defacing landmarks or highvalue/irreplaceable objects probably repeat offenders as well
  how do we punish most perpetrators young people without ruining the rest of their lives   without ruining the rest of their lives  whats the point of punishment then it is their own choice to commit those crimes
  thats the fucking point you dont want to punish you want to rehabilitate i know the impulse to get revenge is a strong one and i struggle with it myself but ultimately we want to fix people and no that doesnt mean bullshit short sentences or second chances i mean actually rebabing them
  thats the fucking point you dont want to punish you want to rehabilitate i know the impulse to get revenge is a strong one and i struggle with it myself but ultimately we want to fix people and no that doesnt mean bullshit short sentences or second chances i mean actually rebabing them  what why why would you want to fix someone who have screwed themselves better make an investment on ordinary citizens hoping them would become even more useful to the society than trying to recycle trash of the society and hope they somehow become marginally meaningful
  my point with the people being young is that people make mistakes as part of growing up sure its their fault and they chose to commit them but the crimes are nonviolent and more often than not are nondestructive kids do dumb shit every day teenagers are the fucking worst but the point is that everyone grows up if you can push them in a different direction through service or getting to route cause why theyre doing shit society is better in the long term     jail is an expensive solution that doesnt really solve the root issue it just sends it away to fester and rot where we cant see it
  well do you want to fix the problem or not  unless everyone who does anything wrong will be put in jail for life theyre gonna get out eventually and i would want them to not do whatever wrong thing they did retard
  why would you give them a free pass to commit crime just because theyre young young people do dumb shit everything but they arent actually dumb they can read the law and enjoy it if the consequences doesnt bother them  but the point is that everyone grows up if you can push them in a different direction through service or getting to route cause why theyre doing shit society is better in the long term   they have already picked the path of ruining themselves why should the society help them      also if the argument is young people then you can simply make the judge consider the special circumstances of each individual cases instead of lowering the punishment for each crimes      as long as those who want to ruin their own life actually get their own life ruined then there will be fewer and fewer people wanting to tries ruining their own life and the society will become better
  first of all no most things dont work as a  deterrent   as our current system works you either get a ha ha sentence or youre fucked for life now very few people really are in jail forever so i will ask you again do you want the majority who get out to be fucking fixed or not go back to the dark ages
  after they served their sentence they can still try to find some jobs that would give them minimum wages income or less than that as long as they are willing to face what they have done and are willing to take the consequences of people seeing them differently then it shouldnt be a problem
  have you ever tried to sleep in an apartment within downtown of a city during midnight and then disrupted by people on the streets    i have a similar feeling when my boomer neighbour wakes me up at 8am on saturday with his lawnmower but its not really being harassed by streetboomer punks
  thats you
  youre such a shitcunt lol   this other anon has the patience of a saint to bother arguing with you
  hey robbing people is okay if its only part of your income  i never understood grafitti artist if they want a canvas to express themselves on then put up a board in your garden it cost next to nothing and is easy to do and the main problem most people have with grafitti is that 99 of it is shit ugly and have no effort put into it you see some people here who hate graffiti saying pretty graffitti is not graffiti most people just tag their shitty highschool gang or write make love not war wwithout the comma mind you because they are only doing it for kicks and shits
  how do we punish most perpetrators young people without ruining the rest of their lives     canning singapore chose this option and graffiti effectively disappeared from the country
          someone needs to learn the difference between graffiti and public art
  pretty sure canning paint is what lets young people do graffiti
  someone needs to read the thread
  but it is a problem and its part of the reason we have such a high recidivism rate
if you realy need to spray some shit find some place in town where people wont get offended
  idea why not put some lethal chemical as part of painting can package this way those criminals that stole them and use them for painting can be killed safely without disrupting others    recidivism rate  it wont be a problem if you keep track of them after theyre freed
  kill yourself
    no teenagers are dumb not smarts dumb not school dumb life experience dumb men are dumb up until mid twenties do you see college people making thoughtful and insightful decisions every moment of their lives no no you dont     a nonviolent offense that does limited damage to property should not cause someones life to spiral out of control thats why things are how they are now handled commonly as misdemeanors with fines and limited jail time thankfully judges do consider first time offenses age and backgrounds of offenders as they should equating someone drawing a dick on a bathroom stall with a violent crime that actually warrants jail and rehab is oblivious as fuck
  thats why all punishment need to me raised to a degree that one can figure out it is dumb to do something even without life experience see the philippines now doing drugs there can result in death without persecution how many people over there still start to try drugs now  if theyre still too dumb and thus ruined their life then show him to the community let him reflect why he have did such dumb shit and use the remain of his entire life to repay the sin let everyone he know and everyone around him meet in person let him personally impress those whore around him and retell his own personal experience so they wont follow and to do such dumb shit ever again
  idea why not put some lethal chemical as part of painting can package  wah someone wrote on my neighborhood so now they must die     id rather see the shittiest tag than literally any ad no one bats an eye at those    it wont be a problem if you keep track of them after theyre freed  what do you propose      doing drugs there can result in death without persecution  thats absurd
   why not put some lethal chemical as part of painting can package  wah someone wrote on my neighborhood so now they must die   as long as we put enough warning over mass media then anyone remotely care about their own life will stop doing so and thus wont be a problem those who continues to do so despite with the presence of lethal chemical mean they dont care about their own life in this case the society could help them complete their wish to die  id rather see the shittiest tag than literally any ad no one bats an eye at those  as long as theyre good ad then thats okay they help promote economic activity and businesses   wont be a problem if you keep track of them after theyre freed  what do you propose  well keep track of them what else do you think it could mean   drugs there can result in death without persecution  thats absurd  prosecution  no real different anyway
  well keep track of them what else do you think it could mean  uh i dunno like what the fuck does that mean they wont do it again if we keep track of them ok but they werent rehabilitated so what youre gonna have a man in black follow him around the rest of his life waiting for him to tag then smack the can out of his hand before he can you said that there will be no recidivism so fucking what whats your plan    what are you fucking nine oh i do love seeing ads when im at the park or going to work or having a stroll ads are good i love me some ads kill all drug users ha ha theres no systemic reasons for drug use no sir mommy told me to be a good little worker and not to em theyre bad and icky
  good thing that we now have technology  advertisement in public space and public transportation subsidize their management and operation thus its good to have those   systemic reasons for drug use is there a system that get force people to take drugs instead of being an individual choice ah yeah that system is called gangs that further proves that we need to get rid of any gang activities
  billboards subsidize business owners yachts    ah yeah that system is called gangs  yeah opiods are a problem because of gangs i smoke weed cause a ganger said so    again what does keep track of mean
  billboards subsidize business owners yachts  thats if they on the the yachts of business owners municipal governments should also actively utilize their own assets to make it financially easier to operate public facilities if it is not convenient due to conflict of interest and possibility of corruptions and such then they can outsource their management to companies that can do so to ease financial burden   yeah that system is called gangs  yeah opiods are a problem because of gangs i smoke weed cause a ganger said so  if not the gangs then whos there to distribute and lure people into doing drugs why is there much higher drug abuse rate in some countries than others  again what does keep track of mean  keep track of their position via computer system and implant devices and then depends on crime severity and risk and other factors assign forces to secretly follow them in disguise once in a while to see how are they doing in the society
  keep track of their position via computer system and implant
  what states already do this to criminals with more severe offenses this is nothing different
survival of the fittest if there are someone who arent capable of deal with different rules in the society then it proves that they are not adoptive to the modern society and allowing them to live on and prosper would go against the law of nature and is detrimental to the society
  example       who says the laws are just
  example   australia or so  who says the laws are just  no one say so but rules are rules and laws are laws regardless of how justified they are
  allowing them to live on and prosper would go against the law of nature  any law that is actually within your power or capability to violate is not a law of nature
  thats retarded dude

  fuck you im literally in this situation in cad so more like 1000 usd/month but still
october 28 at chongqing china a bus carrying 15 people including the driver fell from a bridge into the river after crashing with a car because the river is 70 meter deep and other complexity in environment there are difficulty in search and rescue task and they are unable to recover any survivor from the accident    after they recovered the sd card from the remain of the bus they are able to put puzzles together and tell what happened in the bus before it crash into the river
  first of all the bus was servicing route number 22 and because of roadwork it cancelled a certain stop along the route at the stop before that cancelled stop the bus driver notify passengers that such arrangement have been made however certain passenger is no aware of it later when the passenger find out that the bus have went pass her destination she demanded the bus to immediately let her off however there are no bus stop along the road and thus the driver ignored her request    100332  the passenger walk up from her seat and stand next to the driver continually blaming the driver the driver initially tried to explain the situation but their languages have become more and more heated as time went by and started to vocally attack each other  100849  the passenger hit the head of the driver using her right hand with phone  100850  the driver hit back released his right hand from the wheel hitting the neck of the passenger the passenger attempted to hit the driver again but was blocked by the arm of the driver  100851  the driver take his right hand back and then made a quick turn to the left using the withdrawn right hand and caused the bus to change its direction crashing with the car in opposite direction and fall down from the bridge    recovered camera footage from the bus     according to state media report both the incidental passenger and driver would have been guilty for their actions the passenger endangered the safety of the operating vehicles while the bus driver havent recognize his counteraction against the passenger would threaten the safety of driving and severely violated the code of conduct of bus driver and both of them have also damaged the public safety
  right after the accident occur some blamed the car driver which the bus crashed as reason behind this accident for driving in the wrong direction and call for a ban against women drivers however video footage revealed that this is untrue
  so a ban on women leaving the house is needed otherwise this would have never happened
  this should happen regardless
  wow he didnt just bump the wheel that was like 2/3 of a turn
  why the fuck bus drivers like water so much
update new information shows that the cause was china
  look at the footage he doesnt even try to correct the wheel i think he wanted to take them all off the side
  this literally just gave up on life only retards cant spot this
  being a bus driver in china means you have to deal with violently entitled passengers a lot and i think this one was the one that made him snap
  theres another theory the theory said in china if you are being hit by someone then unless something severe happened police will most likely ignore the case and let everyone went back to do their own things as that doesnt worth putting effort in to investigate however if it result in a traffic accident then what the passenger have done would be considered endanger public safety and can be sent to jail so the bus company teach its drivers that they can punish impolite passengers by intentionally causing an accident
  
beijing  a knifewielding assailant injured 14 children at a kindergarten in the western chinese city of chongqing on friday morning police reported the attacker a 39yearold woman was taken into custody no motive for the assault was immediately publicized        this place looks nuts
  lame i want to see the bus hit the water
  bridge needs guardrails that arent made of wet cardboard
          no fucking doubt
      yeah the way he turns the wheel doesnt look unintentional at all
  why aisian bus drivers like so much water   literally two buses in water in a week
  guy obv had a screw loose  whether is has to do with working conditions in china or something like    i dont know
  its china one in a billion events happen more than once a day
  both events took place in same city
  chongqing is known to be somewhat of a shithole even by chinese standards theres a reason its not one of the cities that the chinese government subtly shills to western professionals
  i thought its better than the northern plain northeastern area shandong and guizhou
hisnamewas wikk wussl  he just wanted to do a roll
china   aaand thats your problem
  i know bacon i still think about sky king every day too      f
seems like such event is linda common in china but they just went unreported like last year in city of shenyang alone theres already three different cases that passenger determined guilty for successfully causing the bus to lost control and crashed something
  whether is has to do with working conditions in china or something like    you mean the one where a passenger kept beating on him and nobody helped    heck in canada even in chicago america somebody would have stepped if only because the driver could have crashed accidental or intentional    im reminded of a short story i read in a chinese column i think its fictional but its meant to criticize real chinese apathy thats been making all sorts of incidents worse the story is that a group of hooligans kept harassing the female driver only one male passenger tried to stop them from dragging her off the bus it is implied they raped her when she got back on the bus she kicked out the one male passenger that tried to help her and then she drove the bus off a cliff
  kys chang  capchaselect all non waterlogged busses
  100849  the passenger hit the head of the driver using her right hand with phone    i dont know why they arent installing shields on all the buses in china considering how crazy some passengers are and okay bus drivers too but if i have to deal with those passengers i would have drove into a volcano
  yeah that is strange considering that in soviet buses shield existed for years and it is more like a designated steering room not just some shield like in mercedes connecto citario for thirdworld shitholes
  this is china we are talking about where bus manufacturer make buses that would be accidentally autonomous and become a kamikaze traffic accident producer despite fully stopped by the signal without drivers involvement do you think they would care about it enough to install such shields
  do you think they would care about it enough to install such shields  maybe this is one of those things that americans culture of suing could have solvedbut eh its so messed up in china there is actually an upper limit to pay outs for wrongful death      wow i really like the vibrant colours im surprised cause i always thought that soviet mde stuff would be gray and bland like those cement block apartments i read about    torontos new streetcars are rather train like the drivers is in a completely different compartment cant find a photo of it just the model    but i was on the spadina street car its not a clear glass i couldnt see the driver at all i was really looking for him too as im still using up ttc token which the machine didnt accept its supposed to accept several forms of payment right now eh passenger and driver interaction is now completely eliminated i guess its an urban necessary given all the stabbings thats been going on even without the fear of assault its probably too distracting now there is a huge crowd of people on phones leaky earphones talking loudly etc the compartment lets the driver focus on driving    i do remember the times when i was a kid and arguing with my brother and it looked like our father wanted to drive into a tree    
  even without the fear of assault its probably too distracting now there is a huge crowd of people on phones leaky earphones talking loudly etc the compartment lets the driver focus on driving  passengers need to be disciplined even from the point of view of passenger user experience
    how dare you this dude is nothing like sky king  this coward killed a dozen people bc some common bitch hit him with a fucking flip flop  richard took a plane alone started it took off chatted with atc for an hour about the meaning of life did a magnificent barrel roll with an f15 escort and then quietly left this world    dont slander his name by associating with this bullshit
    according to chinese state media the driver veered off of the road after discovering that a passenger had micturated in his cocacoca
  when i was searching for pictures of the driver shield on ttc buses one of the first page results was this one where the passenger actually reached pass the driver shield to pour coffee on the driver      the driver shield on the ttc buses now are made off two parts the opaque bottom half door that swings open and shut like that which encloses counters at many shops and medical offices and the transparent glass/plastic window at the top that can be slid half close or more closed that has been there for at least ten years now generally the buses on the long routes use it eg finch but neighbourhood buses dont at least not in the good neighbourhoods     the streetcars downtown on spadina are newer cant even see the driver at all in their own compartment could be a robot in there and we wouldnt know    thank goodness for driver shields because we have a lot of bridges and bodies of water in the gta and people who are dumb enough to argue with the driver as the vehicle moves if i dont have my fare ready when i boarded as a consequence of chasing the bus i might wait till the next stop while waiting at the front certainly i wouldnt fight to get my transfer while the bus is moving      i remember that i feel sorry for that guy it was an expensive plane but come on it then should have been guarded better im thankful in the end that a guy who meant nobody else any harm got to it first but if they had secured it better he might have died suicidal and reckless impulses comes and go  thats why high fences around bridges are effective if i had a gun ill probably be dead now but i was too scared of screwing up hanging so now im over my suicidal depression and alive
  he was a airport employee with all credential needed  planes have no locks and very easy to get into if you know how and he did  its not a security issue events like this are unpreventable
  he was a airport employee with all credential needed    waaaaiiiit does that mean that the highschool dropouts and felons that the tsa hire could actually steal planes as well as luggage 0_0
  yep flying is so easy that someone who has never flown before can takeoff and aerial maneuvers on a commercial plane pilots are glorified taxi drivers makes sense too because most uber drivers make more than starting pilots why pay a large amount of money to pilots when anybody could do their job
  fuck no  background checks are very deep at least where i live you need a perfect record       makes sense too because most uber drivers make more than starting pilots  you retard pay does not correlate with complexity of a job   also he was trained to start engines the rest is not impossible to decipher its a plane not the space shuttle   he didnt try to land because he would have smashed that plane on the runway  moreover you first salary depends on the company you can do anywhere from 80h/month for 2000 to 60h/month for 5500
  flying is so easy that someone who has never flown before can takeoff and aerial maneuvers on a commercial plane    lets remember he didnt survive the landing      but i hear about tsa thief all the time

  every airport and country has its standards  the one i worked at was very professional  other were a complete shit show  also airport security / ramp agent
  beijing november 15  dispute on fare collection  take the on board fire distinguisher try to spray the driver stopped by passengers  argue with other passengers who stopped the action and then rush to driver seat try to bash the bus dashboard yell lets all die together and attempts to gain control of the steering wheel  stopped by the onboard fare collector which apparently is also a security guard captured by police afterward    should we assign dedicated security guard to all buses in the world
sichuan  a family  father cant find phone as theyre about to get off the bus  place the kid at bus stop and the couple search on the bus  bus already departed when they find the phone  request deboarding  driver rejected as it is not destinated stop area and explain next stop will only be a 5 minutes walk to the previous stop  father accepted but the mother didnt  pic related happened
   the kid at bus stop and the couple search on the bus  why    sometimes when im on the subway i dart out of the subway car to throw away a food wrapper ahead of my stop but i always drag my bag or shopping cart with me why risk the train carrying off my bag in this case their kid outside the bus the kid could have been ran over by another car too    this is a user error cant change the user change the equipment put box around drivers    drivers wont give emergency vehicles right of way add cow catcher in front
  the chinglish autotranslation makes for some good reading  
  every airport and country has its standards    where on the grade scale is ryan air    what if hed been a terrorist bomber mail on sunday reporter gets inside the hold of a ryanair jet after being given a job without any vetting or even an interview  reporter abul taher easily gained job as a baggage handler at london stansted  within days had access to aircraft holds and highsecurity areas unsupervised  there was no criminal or background check and he wasnt interviewed for role   civil aviation authority caa has launched an investigation into mos findings  by abul taher and nick craven for the mail on sunday    published 1700 est 24 november 2018  updated 1700 est 24 november 2018      unlike crappy cruise ships you cant just avoid plane you can be on the ground and itll hit you post 9/11 can people in charge of the airline be charged for being careless
  installing shields on all the buses in china considering how crazy some passengers are  this kind of incident is very rare china is just very big so rare things happen      yeah the way he turns the wheel doesnt look unintentional at all  he might have been trying to knock her down by swerving a little or causing a minor accident to get her into trouble as the other anon says
  he was like fuck you bitch here take this drives into the railing and he was clearly seeing where the bus was going maybe he expected it would just bounce back or stop at the railing and he then would blame the crash on the stupid bitch did he forget about the camera as well
  as we have already went through he expected death for all
  where can i learn about the colloquialisms like what are the shitholes of china am decent at chinese so you could recommend sites
  just  go to any chinese forum/site and talk to people
post tickets from your public transport
tfw no oyster card in collection
used for all public transportation methods
  very nice ive got the charlie ticket the mta metrocard and the marta card and a bunch of sfmta/caltrain stuff but my foreign stuff is all mexican
  i dont think i have my v/line tickets around atm and the xpt ticket is just an a4 sheet which is rather unexciting as you can probably guess the concession myki has seen the most use though i currently live in gocards area but barely do anything but walk for transport
  i managed to lose my green myki a while back and im still torn up about it
  new one is a boring drab and uninspiring greywhite looks like a copy of opals design really with the dark background ptv is doling out the graphic design money meanwhile have go card or opal even ever done a rebrand
the tickets on the left are used for the brt network while the right is for the commuter rail     the pink ticket is the old paper based tickets which they got rid 4 years ago for the cards the banks basically went their own ways resulting in 5 different card systems and farefree buses somehow require proof of payment    before cards are used in 2013 the railway also used paper tickets sadly i dont have the black card is no longer used due to system upgrades which make the card obsolete the cards introduced afterwards starting from the silver use sony felica system  the first two cards are basically standard tickets that can be used again within a week   the railway also launches special cards but i never get the hold of em    at the bottom is a ticket for intercity trains ic train tickets here can be bought online or in convenience stores
  while this is my collection of tickets from overseas  some given from relatives
  tickets  begone back to the past with you vile creature    spoileri kinda miss buying tickets/spoiler
    the netherlands has awesome public transport but one of the most tourist unfriendly ticket systems out there its 7 euro no refund when you leave netherlands and has a required minimum of 20 euro to use it    on behalf of the dutch sorry
    i can go older lads
  damn that top tickets almost as old as me
    dont even have a travel card now just swipe in and out with a debit card these days
zagreb croatia    prices vary from 4kn for very short tour to 15kn 2 for a ticket bought in the vehicle
i have number of paper tickets scattered around my ic card collection is what i prize when i travel i try to always get one
wow i wonder where im from
hoping to collect a lot more at the end of the year going on a euro trip
  am i allowed to get a refund on my weekly pass if i changed my mind  theyre upgrading the rail which is causing me a massive headache so i just want to take the bus instead
jr west baby
  literally unreadable

posting in this thread with no valid transport ticket whatsoever
   4688 pounds  are british railways really so expensive
  yes for me a season ticket from bristol to london is over 11000
  oh my godhow is it possible to cost so much how many km does the train travel from london to bristol
  sandy to kings cross is something like 70km a huge chunk of the decent jobs in southern england are in london i hate the commute and am trying to get something comparable in cambridge
  yeah its crazy to make pay 11000 pounds for 70 km trip even if the ticket lasts for one year
  oh mine is 4688 bristol is probably at least double that i dont like it much
  oh my god again
nyc subway card
clockwise from top left xian oslo hamburg and bucharest the hamburg ticket has been in my wallet for 6 years now the xianese one for 5 idk why i keep them
i fucking hate the rise of digital tickets    partially obviously because of privacy concerns although at the point where you carry a phone with you all the time it hardly changes anything so thats not the point to complain about i think  more important is that the validity of tickets factually isnt codified in the tariff anymore but in the code of the validation systems which is something a regular rider has no access to and that may very well be different from the tariff
this started coming out in mexico city as a test
  we always moan about it but they are much cheeper than in the us for what you get

what kind of housing is most comfy for the /n/ lifestyle
  those rowhouses and three story walkups are dense enough to support heavy rail and are more comfy than apartments for me
  does anyone have a link to that video which had a bunch of nimbys at a council planning meeting interspersed with wrestlers suplexing people and calling it a quadruplex
in preferred order  34111
  fixie in a midwestern brick multiflat about 510 miles away from the heart of the city
  housing is not comfy it goes against our huntergatherer instincts and needs
  its literally comfortable
house in the suburbs and a car and a road bike to ride on the perfect tarmac is the best
commie blocks or boats
  medium density housing close to regional train system which connects to a major long distance station and with rapid transit in the city  if it takes about 20 minutes from something thats more dense than american suburbia but less dense than british towns then thats the perfect system to have fully integrated regional rail with a citys rapid transit like can be seen in germany and austria or taken to a national level like in switzerland can be great as it means you can be in whatever part of the city within the hour while also having a relatively quiet place to live
  live in smallish commieblock  live near tram/light rail hybrid  pretty accurate chart
i live in commieblock khrushevka in moscow in 3 minute walk from subway station    it is good for you when you are 2030 year old  you dont need much for living 2 small rooms for 600/m is more then enough for me and my wife and have option to get wherever you need quickly and cheap 50cent for a ride    but when when we will have a child well move to a bigger flat or a house   somewhere in suburbs near new city railroad  buy a car    i think city is a complex system and there is a place for various type of housing from onefamily home to commieblock and transportation systems
  khrushevka  while they fit the definition of commieblock theyre pretty unusual compared to the more infamous brezhnevka  ive been in a number of different khruschevkas around the former ussr and some similar designs in the former eastern bloc but theyre more classy and theyre extremely pleasant if theyve been modernised  brezhnevkas though theyre total garbage and they deserve to be knocked down and replaced  no idea about modern constructions in russia though its been a long time since i was last there and ive not heard positive things kyiv has had a lot of nice new buildings built tbilisi is lagging behind though
  suburbs are superior but i will never buy an suv since i dont want to hear bank angle and terrain warning
  i moved from that shithole commie blocks sucks man without carpets of floor you will hear every fucking fart of neighbors also some pidory ponaehavshie will flood you at some point   suburbs are 20/10 no wonder best nation in the world lives in them no need in hammerdrill in order to redo wiring all water pipes are in basement and easily accessible drywall are straight unlike brick/concrete no fight for parking space   subway is the real meme in moscow i used suburban trains and buses/trams it was faster and quite empty since goyim dont know about this but before sobyanin shit i just drove a car like a white straight man with heater and radio     if i had an option to nuke some cities  id definitely nuke moscow and other default cities
  this out in the boonies would be maximum comfy
  four plex city bitch    youtubecom/watchvkva_dtvw4u0
  my krhushevka is made with bricks not so panels so it quite warm and good noise protection i heard neighbours only once in last year and it was his wife screams during sex i was not even mad  this beast was fucking her hard for 15 minutes non stop    nah fuck american subways car industry cucked american cities good city is comfortable for walking     europe cities are better organized we need to transform soviet commiblock cities in more europelike36 floor max good public transport mix zoning
  no idea about modern constructions in russia though  i present to you modern russian houses     for your information in soviet time architecture would be sent to gulag for this monstrosity  soviet commieblocks looks ugly but there is a tons of requirementsgreen areas with trees near by infrastructure and etc on them and you see city planners were thinking how people are gonna live in them modern development company just want to sell sell sell
  subway is the real meme in moscow i used suburban trains and buses/trams  it is just impossible before sobyanin busses didnt have bus lanes and trams were old and slow and even after sobyanin transport reform metro is will superior    i was in london madrid athene berlin pariswarsaw  moscow metro is the most clean nice and efficient crowdy in rush hours  yes but they already built second circle line mcc and are building third circle line and also 5 light railroads going through the city like rer in paris or shahn in berlinwhich might will decrease crowds
  american suburbs
  is this hong kong  i dont get it russia has shitton of space to develop while it certainly doesnt need to go full us suburbia sprawl mode there should be enough room for less dense projects shouldnt it or is this what corruption looks like
medium density housing with trams
  reasons   poor population   high demand for housing    low experience in quality house development old soviet school   developers greed   state support those developers who built as much flats as possible it is political reason  to decreace social unrest    there are some developers who decided to build less dense  and built auschwitz
  good thing there a lot of people who traveled to europe and understand what is good housing so slowly demand for decent houses is increasing some developers already understand the trend and  thought they still built commieblicks they try to prettify them
  fuck that looks like hell and theres a fucking leroy merlin in it      pretty would like to see the face of that cladding in a few years though
    leroy merlin in russia    wtf i though they werent popular enough to move out of france and its surroundings
  spain is full of them too i think there is a correlation with fucked up urbanism and presence of fucking leroy merlin and other french retail stores
  heh i worked on lm it project for half a year were doing automated regression testing for inner system they are a big market player in russia top 3 i guess
  developers greed  yeah no shit they are not some charity developers are greedy is literally the worst of nimby arguments their greed is backed by actual demand for housing  russia has like america some stupid regulations like setbacks and parking minimums good housing wouldnt be so expensive if it didnt have to pander to agers and nimbys whims
   hong kong  why dont you look across the border for commieblocks and microdistricts
  there should be enough room for less dense projects shouldnt it  theres plenty but its easier and much cheaper for the developer to bribe their way to hook up to existing mains in the old block than build new ones in the middle of nowhere as well as roads schools shops etc by the time new homeowners happy with cheap housing realize overloaded shits breaking down all the time there are twice as much cars in the block than the possible parking spots lawns included the only freeway out is in traffic jam 24/7 and all you see from the window is next building at the cigarette butt throw distance the developers long gone and its not like they can legally complain anyways because they wanted it cheap and didnt mind the fine print back then
  or like in  pic try to squeeze as much as possible on as little land as they can as well as get away with the absolute minimum of infrastructure required by law to keep the costs low
  my krhushevka is made with bricks not so panels  they all are the same  so it quite warm  they have relatively poor thermal insulation but central heat fixes it   good noise protection  it is difficult to make a good noise protection even european commie blocks suffer from this   europe cities are better organized  yep european cities are better designed and they didnt fell for 9000 stories meme like moscow did in 80s until now and they feel much more comfortable even though they are nearly identical commie blocks   we need to transform soviet commiblock cities in more europelike36 floor max good public transport mix zoning  it would be a good idea to build a underground parking or at least put building enough far apart so there will be no fight for parking lot and no shitboxes near entrance     it is just impossible before sobyanin busses didnt have bus lanes and trams were old and slow and even after sobyanin transport reform metro is will superior  bus lanes are meme since it creates more traffic dangerous situations just look on marking near turns and camera placement and bus will end up it traffic anyway   bus lanes could be done properly but that wasnt a purpose sobyanin made it for money   but they already built second circle line mcc  except they didnt built it just electrified   5 light railroads going through the city like rer in paris or shahn in berlinwhich might will decrease crowds  suburban train lines are close enough for ex paveletsky heading there are a lot of short trains that go to birulevo and domodedo and airport interval is like 1015 minutes good enough  or kurskoe heading  it replaced for me 9 2 7 10 lines even though i lived withing 6 minutes of walking to subway if combined with bus or some escooter which are pretty usable in winter it is top way to get around in moscow     no they are max comfy
  btw driving car in moscow now requires a cabin crew of at least 2 people now since one should drive other should be looking for cameras and shit
  or at least put building enough far apart so there will be no fight for parking lot  if we build an even more unwalkable hellhole finally there would be enough place for cars  this is what nimbys actually believe  no it doesnt work like that theres never enough place for cagers remember large distances  bad density  good  european cities are so comfortable because there werent cages around when they were built
holy shit this place looks exceptionally comfy
    it was everything i had hoped for and more           theres nothing inherently wrong with projects like these just make sure that theyre broken up by attractive public spaces and recreational areas and that transportation and everyday necessities are in reach avoid ghettoization at all costs
  why bother with this expensive door setup though if its in the boonies anyway just build a cheap open steel hangar
  large distances  bad density  good  large distances  bad density  bad
  large distances  bad density  bad  theres a contradiction here dont you think
  no density is bad and large distances are bad  but large distancesdensity
both are equally bad when people living in a housing sprawling over large area have to commute to densely packed businesses
  the /n/ lifestyle  since this is 4chan id have to say cardboard box in an alleyway
  the chart needs one more tier a cyberpunk arcology with the elevator as the mode of transportation
   their greed is backed by actual demand for housing    so much this     developers dont build houses and apartments for shits and giggles     i live in a city with old housing we recently had a boom in luxury apartments but people cry about the lack of new cheap apartments walking distance from everything you cant have it both ways it costs a bit more to make new construction luxury which attracts less cost conscious renters who pay for the building over the first few years meanwhile we have walkable small towns with transit to the city that are dying     nice  close to things  cheap    pick 2
  no density  no public transit
hate apartments  hate living in a city center  want things relatively close by  want lots of space  what do
  commit sudoku or get a car it makes world closer or a bike if you live in rainfree area snow is ok tho
  we have more empty houses than homeless
  find a better city  i lived in toronto suburbs where every suburb has its own skyline and those suburbs and downtown are all connected by the ttc it was by far the best place ive lived in
  found the fellow minnesotan
  what i meant by greed is that they use as cheap materials as possible sell house and then vanish and another house management company is responsible to maintain shit they built
  if youre concerned about the homeless go build a house and give it away for free or shit even invite a few homeless people to stay in your home thats right you wont faggot
  if youre really concerned about homeless hire them and provide a room and a shaver with some soap

what sort of procedure would be needed of someone living in a place like san francisco or tokyo want to get his personal watercraft for daily commute
anyone here a work as a naval architect do you do construction hydrodynamics or technology or do you just dabble with boats and smaller ships how do you like it
  just need dock space
  i mean a very small one that i can take it off water fold it abd take back to home  is there anything needed to take care of if large container/oil/cruise ships frequently use a water channel that i want to cross
  youfold up you boat youre going to need a public access boat launch on either side of your commute you cant just haul your boat up on private property let alone that the shorelines of major cities are built up with concrete bulkheads also boats are heavy motors are heavy and using a motor is the only way youd be able to commute in any manner of timeliness its not exactly something you can fold up and carry like a folding bicycle something like pic is the closest i can see being applicable to what youre asking and it would be a huge pain and added time to inflate/deflate and break down on either side of your commute    and please dont consider crossing busy shipping lanes by oar twice a day
  hey thats its
  not necessary boat but could be something like inflatable rafts or whatever similar to those things like kayacat that seems to have motor option too but would that be too unstable in a bay of a large city or some larger options like goboat or bomboard
  the goboat is essentially a floating ring tube with a trolling motor if youre looking to cut time compared to morning traffic a trolling motor will not get you the speed you need not safely maneuver around large ships    the bomboard pictured is a stripped down jet ski weighing 90lbs you could probably lug it around and have the speed to get where you want in time    a question how do you expect to get to work with either of those options without being soaked in harbor water by the end of the commute
  guy uses folding boat towed behind folding bike to commute    
  how do you expect to get to work with either of those options without being soaked in harbor water by the end of the commute  like change cloth and bath and tidy up myself at company site instead of at home
four days till screw change boys
so im a college drop out in the middle of california and i wanna get the fuck out and get on the water is it as easy as moving to the coast and getting a few credentials i dont mind working up from the bottom im tired of sitting on my ass working minimum wage like a chode i feel like the ocean is calling me as gay as that sounds and i wanna do something i actually find interesting for once in my life any tips from somebody who went through anything close to this thanks in advance
  theres a bunch of crewboat companies that run out of la/lb
  are you the guy out of louisiana
  yeah i just got a job out here
  hows the first hitch been did you do well anything
  its not bad the boat i was on got a charter a little over a week before crew change but i was taken off the boat a day before going on charter because the company they got the contract for has a stipulation about the amount of newly hired people that can be on the boat at any given time so that was pretty gay however all the crews ive worked with thus far have been very helpful and overall top notch     pic related is the boat i was on

some jackass in a center console ran right over the fucking reef about 30 yards from my divers right next to a piling and even kicked up his motor i yelled at him but he didnt give a shit and just drove off after lowering the motor i couldnt even get his hull number to report him im shook

    did this dude get arrested for violating a marad security zone
going home today
  honestly i drink that sometimes
  the coop projects are no fucking joke luckily i went engine so mine were easier but my classes were harder
  coop means that the college im going to is setting me up with a job between semesters
  we know
  yea you have to do projects and get stcw certifications while doing them    source went to mass maritime
what is life of marine ship captain   i heard that they have big salaries but you kinda live on ship most of time avg trip is like 13 month  and is it worth getting a job on ship
  for deck are you a 1st officer yet what do you think of the career
  supposedly pogy boats smell like shit
just got off my ship yesterday after a 6 month  hitch still hasnt registered yet
  paperwork dealing with local authorities remind the crew of things  afternoon naps kpi emails make sure of everything paperwork  arrivals and departures  1to1 on ship/at home  plan what to spend big salary on when get home
so i finally got around to reading into the raging sea    this is my fucking face every fucking page holy mother of god those pour souls were murdered
  ha i said watch but i meant hitch
  i got nothing against it it just made me laugh
  damn type of vessel plans for your time off
  if anyones interested vanity fair did a pretty interesting article on the faro    
need any help dude  nah bro i got this
  god i wish that were me       also finally going offshore boys
anyone here hawespipe their way to a maritime career rather than go to school
engine or deck    what are the benefits and the disadvantages of each job 
sup fags am about to get my 2nd officer rating thinking about going to work at a tug probably master everyone else wants to go on the big ocean liners though am i in the wrong
  depending on your country its not a question of wrongness as it is there not being any jobs on tugs in the us youve got dozens if not hundreds of mates working as abs trying to stab each other in the back to get their toars and move into the wheelhouse the industry is just too glutted
  engine  cons you work in hell  you are responsible for keeping the shitters working  pros you get really good at fixing stuff  90 of your work only involves machines    deck  pros you can see the sun  youre actually driving the ship    cons youre actually driving the ship  all of your offwatch work involves painting or watching cargo  you have to bash your head into a brick wall every time you try to get another ship to do something so you dont run into it
    s    jones act is safe for another generation
  we won this round boys
  what this guy said  dealing with retards on board and retards in the office being responsible for retards on board  being the fucking gestapo on board to cover your ass so most of crew hates you
  thanks     and what about the electrotechnical officer 
i live in baton rouge would it be possible to get a summer job on a tug boat or cargo ship between semesters would i go up and down the mississippi
  youre an engineer but for gmdss equipment and radars and computers dont go for it unless youre good at understanding electronics and replacing vital components regularly    oh and those guys are rare these days outside of cruise ships keep that in mind too
  look up marquette transportation or crosby tugs both of them are hiring and are based on louisiana       all of our diesel electric boats have etos on them
  came back yesterday on my birthday got to surprise the old lady    got fucking hammered in alaska for my bday  when the captain leaves the bar and says be responsible so you catch your flight  bars didnt close until 5 am i aint ever seen that it was a glorious night besides some samoan trying to said i was talking shit and starting shit and being offered drugs it was a great night  great hitch  other deckie drunkenly talked of how he lost his whole crew  about how he lost his whole crew when he was a fisherman but was only able to recover the body of the captain   man before the coasties rescued him he had tears in his eyes and is a stout motherfucker he never told me about that shit before    ive met a lot of dudes who lost people in the years ive been in this industry        almost everyone on tugs is a hawsepiper is seems a few tongue point fags who came outta school with abs and qmeds but still gotta work their way up top or down below ive worked with a few cma dudes one is a mate who said he didnt know shit when he landed his first gig with crowley other guy never got any certs   school cant prepare you for real shit in those years like working the deck can confidently
any decent films/documentaries about shipping or maritime life in general  also tugfag you take some sweet fucking pictures my dude
  hi can yall post your paystubs please thanks
  there is only one martha 1967
i love working with my filipinos
what advice would you give someone whos starting at a maritime college in 4 days
  dont fall in love with female cadets
  appreciate it dude     also youtube mighty ships theres a few of them on there and they do a decent job documenting various types of ships    a good youtuber to follow for maritime stuff is jeffhk hes got some good content     also shameless self plug i upload timelapses i take on my iphone once in a while   
  come to terms with the fact you will be doing a fuckhuge amount of chipping and painting and mopping the floor for a few years underclassmen cadets are treated as abs essentially
    oh shit didnt know they did a book read that vanity fair article a while ago and was fascinated but im not a maritime guy  gonna read it now
  so cadets are basically crew until theyre licensed and get their sea days
  well who else is going to do the ab jobs on the training ship you have to learn how to be a seaman first before you can understand how to be an officer you move up to officertrainee as a junior/senior
how do i make engineer  how much seatime until i can take a engineering license course am i required to do a qmed first
  why would you want to be an engineer in the first place
  they can actually find jobs
  while on the subject what are other positions that i can use somewhere else besides a ship if i decide after a while i might not want to be at sea anymore
  and deck cant lol
  stewards can go work in hospitality gigs obviously cooks can be cooks and stewards themselves can probably translate into hotel managers or restaurant managers keeping track of all the food and cleaning supplies on a ship and organizing the use thereof is a good skill to have    engineers can use their licenses to go anywhere theyre rated for horsepower not tonnage so its very easy for them to get jobs in power plants and the like    deckies usually can only move into shoreside offices working for shipping companies without retraining for a new career they cant use their shiphandling or navigation skills off the ship so they can only use their expertise with the logistics of shipping      theres a serious glut of mates and theres a serious shortage of engineers and you know it
  you didnt mention piloting for deckies thats mostly shoreside and six figures aswell
  piloting  good luck actually getting a piloting job you need to be at least a master to get pilots associations to even consider you
  not the guy youre replying to but us college dropout interested in hawsepiping here    besides an mmc and twic what other certs would i need to get a job as an wiper on a jones act boat like coastal transportation in alaska id hope to move up to qmed and maybe 3rd ae
  i went engine so i cant really offer too much advice on the deck side but no im not a first yet and honestly i could never do a normal 95 office job i tried for a year and literally wanted to kill myself so i think its pretty sweet
  none wiper is bottom rung in the engine room equivalent to an os even gudes are higher up you just need the basic lifeboatman and firefighting certs that everyone has
bump
  coastal doesnt have 3rd aes they are uninspected fishing industry vessels by regulation you wouldnt need a mmc to work for them as a wiper although you might as well get it youre mostly going to be doing cargo work as a wiper
  tankerfag reporting in first time on /n/ whats going on here
so im reading run the storm rn and my question is  wtf is this mike davidson niggers problem
  oh no no no
    this is absolutely horrendous poor souls
  welcome to /n/ please post your pay stub
  you would laugh if i did
    how many books are there on el faro how do they compare
  dunno checked out the raging sea one on amazon and the rebiews said it was shit so i clicked onto a related one called run the storm and the reviews were gr8 so im reading this one instead
wow  so i just finished run the storm and basically this is what i see  the entire crew was murdered by a cuckold literal boomer retard who was totally impotent and useless as a captain  next the crew must have realized his orders were totally fucking retarded but said basically nothing the entire transcript of the vdr reads like a bunch of fucking awkward freshmen doing icebreakers too scared to say anything  next when the cg guy went to inspect el yunque and reported it was totally fucking fucked big time mate his boss told him he was oversteppung the investigation bounds and told him to shut it down and retired immediately afterwards and 2 weeks later was a vp of maritime ops at tote how the cocksucking hell is this legal  next they sail literally into the fucking eye of a hurricane and their lifeboat is an actual titanic tier lifeboat rowboat again how is this fucking legal and why the fuck would anyone agree to taking a job so mindnumbingly fucking dumb  lastly this retard boomer calls ahead to ask the safety officer if he can send a distress signal while the fucking boat is in the process of sinking and calls abandon ship like 5 minutes before the fucking thing goes down    holy shit how do you guys do thus fucking job i come from an aviation background and we obviously have a lot more fucking authority over our decisions than marine guys having to ask permission to deviate around a fucking hurricane there were so many signs shit was totally cooked and nobody did anything if any of the crew sitting up front in the cockpit doesnt like the slightest thing about and approach even the guy in the jumpseat deadheading not even flying anyone can call go around no questions asked and nothing will ever roll down on you from the company fuck i feel bad for you guys     reading this book pissed me off man
  into the raging sea is roughly the same its more of a narrative of the actual sinking written by a journalist so it flows better
  reading this book pissed me off man  welcome to the maritime industry captain ahab is still an accurate depiction to this day safety is largely ignored for your own sanity if you seriously think about the age of the lifesaving equipment on board youll never go to sea work/rest regs are a fucking joke youre supposed to get 10 hours of rest per day but if the ship needs you for mooring operations youll get called out so you dont have any rest periods for the day and thats 100 legal mistakes are more and more criminalized so nobody ever admits them because they can go to prison if they do    its pretty shit not going to lie
  thanks m8
to foreign maritime workers  in south korea 999 of young navigators working for avoid conscription    its a really sad story  and im also invoolved it
  and can i ask reason of choose this job
  sorry i dont understand people take jobs on ships to avoid conscription
  yes it is  in south korea every male adults are take compulsory military servicenormally army soldiers salary is under 200  / month only     for poor guys maritime job is safer choice to saving money cause salary is more than 3300  / month in subsitute military service
  if any of the crew sitting up front in the cockpit doesnt like the slightest thing about and approach even the guy in the jumpseat deadheading not even flying anyone can call go around no questions asked and nothing will ever roll down on you from the company fuck i feel bad for you guys  cockpit resource management    yeah we have something like that at sea in theory bridge resource management is pushed by the company and the coast guard but at the end of the day if the captain wants to say what the fuck do you know youre just a 3rd mate and disregard your warnings he can and will
  thank you awesome read
what kind of maritime jobs can i get with a 4 year lib arts degree im currently working as a courier
  you can get the basic 3 unlicensed os wiper or stewards assistant its the very bottom rung but its a start
  ya grandstanding captains doesnt exist anymore in western aviation we figured out that tends to get people dead very fast it is very very much the way they do things in chinese airlines though which is why i say never fly chinese total shitshow  i guess changes move slower in marine ops
anyone /liveaboard/ here used to live on a narrowbeam canal boat so somewhat familiar with boat life but looking for some advice on salt water living i have enough cash funds to buy something in the 3540ft range and the means to go anywhere to purchase where is the best place in the world to shop for used yachts
  budget dependent you could find a used crewboat for relatively cheap and live on that   theres plenty of smaller ones for sale that range from 3565ft     they would require moderately less maintenance because theyre made of aluminum however they also will ride like shit because aluminum     you could ball out and get a 120ft one like pic related
based transport canada when they first started being progressive c 2005
  5 stop abusing my male priviledge and assuming she isnt a strong empowered woman
  when all the captains logbooks are cooked  hey mate this log book doesnt show i only had 2 hours off then had to work 12 hours while you got to sleep  yeah thats why no one gets fired here when we run aground since its known were working an illegal amount
  where do the tires come from do they buy new
    on the tugs i worked on we used old worn out airplane tires    it would be silly to buy new
captain catches you dozin so he puts the bnwas on  another mate lets it go off and cant figure out how to silence it before it gets to your room so you get woken up by it at 0430    poetic justice sucks when it happens to you
  this is something i really like about 12 hour watches   i am guaranteed plenty of sleep every night and never find myself drowsy
  we have more time if we want to go ashore our job has more variety we get promoted a bit faster salaries are better before reaching captain/chief engineer rank
  depends on company the one im currently in is treating cadets like officers we use officer messroom and recreation room dont do cleaning or chipping unless spare hands are really needed our job is to assist officers doing their job and learn but its not a standard i work for arab compny with arab/european officers and filipino rarings
  and thats how you get entitled whiny officers that dont help during maneuverings and when they end up chiefs or masters have no fucking clue about deck work  when i was cadet i was basically a underpaid ab  captain told me on my first day on board that there is a lot of deck work to be done and learning navigation and what an officer does will be next contract 6 month contracts by the way  so i ended up chipping painting cleaning tank cleaning and working 12 hours a day on deck most of my contract but i was a young lad and had enough energy to go study on bridge after    after i got promoted to officer in same company different vslthere the cadet was working 4 hrs shifts usually day time on deck night time on bridge    although the treatment i received is not a good way to learn becoming and officer ive learned a lot of things that come in handy after i was chief and master like    realistic approximation of deck jobs duration and difficulty  so you dont fuck ppl with your unrealistic terms    understanding paint related jobs and paint characteristics mixtures  if you get a retarded bosun youll have to explain what paint to be used and how to prepare it    deck tools and how they work and parts they use  important in ordering spares    ropes types boating knots splicing etc    appreciating the work that ppl do on deck    and most important you learn many ways that deck ratings can fuck a job up intentionally and willingly just because they dont like an officer or are lazy  guess whos gonna get his ass blasted for a shitty job    all this stuff you will never learn looking out a window from the bridge you need to be there with them and breath rust paint fumes etc
  whats a 3rd mate making roughly on a non us flagged ship
    i can see that you are still a decky because as an officer you would realise that more than half your plebs are dragging ass and you have first hand experience of that
  john the navy or marines and try to get to camp pendelton if the try to send you to tatooine kill the admin
  the idea is that you know how they do it its like magic you know is fake but dont know how they do it you need to know what to search for so you dont get scammed trust me i relieved a lot of wheelhouse chiefs that didnt know or didnt care about deck work and found wrong paint being used or painting over rust etc    most companies delegate 3rd mates to being safety officers deputies  chief mate is the official one but you end up doing all the work basically you just inspect and maintain lsa and ffs eqp  2nd mate is navigation officer passage planning gmdss    the only companies ive heard do it the other way around are italian companies
  the question im asking is what is the pay like i understand the organizational structure
  depends on type of vsl  but roughly from 3200eur to 5000euro/per worked month no tax deductions  i believe stena and maersk pay 3700 permanently even when you stay home
do you guys think hydrofoiling container ships is a good idea  a small ship capable of carrying a few containers at speeds of around 100kph
  literally no point it would have very short range and would be very expensive to operate a truck would be able to to its job for a tiny fraction of the cost
when the company does something that actually makes your life easier    they just sent an email saying effectively yeah the traditional watch schedule and 66 really aint helping with stcw hours so were trying the european style system now fleetwide    watches are now broken up into one 2 hour watch and one 6 hour watch  2/m has it from 00000600 and 08001000  c/m has it from 06000800 and 12001800  3/m has it from 10001200 and 18002400  1212 in port  mfw they found a way to make the c/m a dayworker and a watchstander at the same time  mfw 9 hours of uninterrupted rest while onboard ship  mfw not being screwed out of port time anymore  mfw literally everyone is happy about this new schedule and nobody gets screwed with it  i am in utter shock
  sounds good but its the first time i see this schedule and ive been sailing only with european companies    anyway looks good on paper in port and while sailing during maneuvering and drills everybody is fucked  3m 1012 1824 best schedule except during drills that in my whole time at sea take pace after launch time  2m 06 810 2 hrs for breakfast shower sleep yea right 0 rest  cm 68 1218 812 will be prework daily meetings inspecting deck work giving jobs to bosun paperwork  also this schedule will turn obsolete and youll get back to 66 during tankcleaningballast exchange etc if captain doesnt do cm watch    maybe im wrong but yea during long sea passages its comfy as fuck
  yeah our polish c/m had never heard of it either    1212 solves most problems though you got screwed during manuevering on 66 too but this at least reduces the chances of something like being left on duty for 9 hours straight after being called out halfway through your rest period no real need to worry about going back to 66 at sea either we can just do 1212 there too its not the long stretches on duty thats the hard part its the lack of rest in between
  when i was doing 66 as an officer captains only used the current duty officer for maneuvering station fwd or aft only in shity situations strong winds of dense fog they would wake up the resting officer but that only happened 23 times in my career
  it was like that on the last ro/ro i was on the captain didnt wake the resting mate for departure but this one does so he keeps one mate on the bow and one in the wheelhouse to do the eot/bell book he doesnt trust sending the eot out to the wings apparently the captain i sailed for before once got the eot stuck out there for an hour or two so he needs someone to be there and we dont have a deck cadet this voyage    i mean its not that bad but if arrival/departure is timed so you just go straight from tying up to watch after being called out of your rest period it can suck for a bit
  i didnt know trucks could drive on water
  a hyrdofoil would not be making a sea passage it doesnt have the range at best it would be a feeder shipand considering the operating costs a truck would do its job better in almost every conceivable way
not peeling the wire cutting it then putting the rubber back on  lmao  ur life

hey 3/m youre going to come relieve me in 20 minutes right  what i dont relieve you any more its two hours before i have to be up  oh right thats the 2/m click    this motherfuckering chief mate
  nigger come work on ghetto inland tugboats    sleeping  general alarm goes off  fall out of bed  throw on boots  run stumbling up to the wheelhouse  70something half senile captain sitting in chair gazing placidly out the window  uh cap    he wanted a sandwich and hadnt seen the other deckhand in a while
  a chief and couple others i worked with told me a story of this old captain whos infamous  woke crew up with general alarm  everyone runs up to wheel  house   fire fire  wheres the fire  there a fire in my shoes watch me dance  he was drunk    anyway my last mate texted me tonight asking if i was back to work he and the other deckhand were back to work about 3 weeks after a 2 month hitch    fuck that they shame me for enjoying my time off my last 2 hitches i was with the same deck hand weve lived together more than weve been with our old ladies this year    i got an ironworker appenticeship tryout this weekend if i land it ill probably come shoreside
    working on tugboats sounds like working at a summer camp in backwoods alabama
    captain i worked with on the harbor tugs told me stories about working on the river back in the midlate 70s   woken up be the deckhand on watch and given a hit off the bong  walked up to the wheelhouse and the captain told him to walk over to him  pours whiskey in his coffee cup      worked with a captain who only wore black 50 gallon trash bags for pants      he also told me all the shitty stories about trying to make and break tow in the middle of winter   kinda makes me want to try the river but also not want to try it at the same time    also  stuck on a laid up boat this hitch  slated to go to dry dock on the 15th  oh lucky me
  and heres a few pics from the tug while i was off

      why do you like tugs so much why not go for the real money
  he did he works on a crewboat now
posting some pictures from a field trip today

  god damn that is a sexy boat
is there any chance there is anyone here from australia nsw in particular that can help me get my life on the water    im not getting any younger im 25 ive always wanted to do it but i have no clue how to get into the field and out of this dead end shit
  thats a big propeller
  i work on osvs now once i have my mates ticket im going to look for work on container or general cargo ships     tugs are so much fun to work on though       4u

      well that didnt last long three port stays where my rest 12 got fucked by arrival and port state control and now were back on 66 right before a week of 6 port stays less than a day    i fucking love ro/ros
  i dont understand why ships just dont have two full crews for constant 12 and 12
  channel ferries do actually even have two captains onboard at all times
flying home today mofos      those falgout boats always look like theyre in mint condition

  i agree but at the same time i bet that tan paint on the house really helps hide the rust
are river barges the best form of inland transportation     what makes foamers and cagers interested in such a weak and inefficient form of transportation
  great pic
  not everyone has a river but if ppl were smart they would make one just for that even rail is underutilized because no one wants to deal with unloading and they can never get to the final destination thru barge etc  in an amazon prime world thats too slow
  didnt land the ironworker gig  gotta tryout again    i got a flight tomorrow morning gotta get up at 0300 to make it to the airport flying to the san francisco bay for dredge it derrick work
  i have no idea what in the fuck doing with this towboat shit or calling in distances
  how are you having a hard time calling in distances its one of the easiest and sometimes most important things you do on a tug    use a 20ft container as a reference
this thread is suffering from a distinct lack of posted paystubs
  shoo shoo amo    youll get no scab espionage this day
  jesus
call in the wrong eta to port control  but they misheard the first time so they dont notice a corrected eta the second call    just turned a guaranteed firing into a letter of warning    im the luckiest son of a bitch alive
  why are things so strict does eta still mean estimated time of arrival    t land lubber
  yes and if you give the incorrect eta it could lead to all sorts of fuckups down the chain pilots will be expecting you at the wrong time which also leads to tugs waiting and line handlers all standing around doing nothing on the clock
so is there a general irc channel for maritime shit should be able to run on ocean internet right
  i shitpost on here so much since this website works so well on boat wifi     but as far as i know theres no irc chat
  yeah id do the same when im a few months on board aside from shitposting what else can one bring/do to fight boredom btw
  get an ebook reader and load it with books
  im only on for 28 days at a time currently so shitposting doesnt get old especially since i hardly use 4chin at home     we also have a decent gym and satellite tv on board     also make sure to download pelenty of porn
  i can just imagine the smell of that tiny little room
  its not bad at all actually we mop just about every day
  this tbqh    i bought a kindle paperwhite best decision i ever made after bringing my camelbak along for cargo ops the best part is that ebooks are small so you can keep restocking it if you ever finish them all
  bringing my camelbak along for cargo ops  this may be a dumb question from a landlubber but please explain
  camelbak for cargo ops  genuinely mad at myself for not even considering that as an option definitely bringing mine next hitch      think like a big rubber water bottle backpack that holds like a liter of water
  yeah i know what a camelback is i dont know why youd want one on cargo ops
  so you dont have to walk all the way back to the galley for a bottle of water every ten minutes
  sorry if wasnt obvious i dont work the kind of job where i need to drink every ten minutes
  its amazing how much of a game changer it is especially in these middle east port rotations mine holds 3 liters so its just about enough to last me through a full 6 hour cargo watch complete nightandday difference im still hot but im no longer as utterly exhausted as i was before i thought to bring it if you fill it with ice too so it keeps your back cool for a while    best part is that since mine has like an antimicrobial treated bladder if i just put water in it i never have to wash it        cargo ops are at the bare minimum several hours standing and walking around in high temps/direct sunlight watching people do shit and making sure they dont fuck up and at the most its hard physical labor in the aforementioned high heat you need to drink lots of water to keep yourself functional in those conditions so you either need to have a water bottle on you or you have to go all the way back to the house to get water there having a camelbak just makes shit easier youre carrying a lot of water in an unobstructive container that you can drink from without having to move your head or use your hands is a godsend    all in all i highly recommend them to anyone in the industry a good one is like 100 and it will make that money back for you several times over
  yep definitely wish i brought mine these last few hitches its not so bad now as it was during the summer here but louisiana is still pretty brutal
  jesus christ you have shit so easy    all those amenities shower daily etc    meanwhile i work over 84 hours weekly routinely fucked on my off watches have ghettorigged workout shit usually do 3045x and good crews are hit or miss no cell service when in alaska  oh and my current stateroom is right near the stairwell to the wheelhouse all i hear is the captains bullshit    the other deckhand im with for a week now is a ducking weirdo whos been with the company 5 years he barely talks our only legitimate conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes while  waiting for the boat     then when im home i get lazy as shit and go crazy since everyone works and i have nothing to do
  my guy nobody is forcing you to work there its not like theres a shortage of tug companies out there and i dont do shit when im home either just find something to do to occupy my time

  ahh i hear your merchant fleet is getting screwed by an influx of eastern europeans and flips since you guys dont have any cabotage laws like the jones act
  most companies operating around british isles only really hire brits deep sea companies hire flip flops as ratings but officers range in nationality authorities seem convinced we need more brit officers but when they get their coc they cant get a job
captains piss jug in the crows nest  he mustve drank 2 pots of coffee in his 20 hours at the helm
  at least he doesnt rain it down on the deckhands    spoilerfuck you david/spoiler
  had a mate who was pissing onto the texas deck for a couple days in alaska when it wasnt raining    after commenting very loudly it smells like piss down here within earshot of the captain it stopped    getting bitches at by captain in the most passive aggressive bullshit way grown men can bitch at you  dont worry anon i got yelled at 3x since he yelled at you ready to enjoy this the rest of your career    fuck no  are you stupid or just retarded  worst part is when youre getting your ass chewed for shit you didnt do its fucking better to just take the blame
  to this day i cant figure out why you dont just get a job on another boat/tug
  same reason why sailors who hate sailing in general dont get another job were the battered housewives of the employment world

so i read a short story about texas tower no4 and holy fuck this shit is nightmarish 28 men sentenced to death because the air force was being a bunch of bitches the short story is safety tips for living alone by jim shepard heres some excerpts    they faced engineering problems as unprecedented as the space programs tower no4 in particular had presented a much greater challenge than the others since its footings would stand in 185 feet of water more than three times as deep as the others in 1955 the maximum depth at which anyone had built an undersea structure was sixty feet and that had been in the gulf of mexico because of that the air force had decided that this tower would require bold new thinking in its conception and hired a firm known for bridge design the firm had had no experience at all in the area of ocean engineering for marine structures    because the footings were so deep no4s hollow legs had been designed to be towed to their location where theyd be upended and anchored to the caissons on the bottom before the main deck was attached and raised but because the legs were so long the designers had had to use pin connectionsgiant boltsrather than welds in the underwater braces though bolts were an innovative modification they failed to take into account the constant yet random motions of the sea the moment the bolts had gone in they began generating impact stress around their connections and gordon had further discovered a storm had pummeled two of the underwater braces during the towing that theyd sheared and sunk during the upending and that everyone had then floated around until the air force finally gave the order to improvise repairs at sea to avoid having to haul the entire structure back to shore    and it just keeps getting worse from there the thing was so unstable they called it old shaky and the tiltin hilton and warned crewmen not to shave with straight razors
  get off your fucking phone then smelt and pay attention i bet youre a suny shit its fucking embarrassing

 got a new deckhand to work with on the boat  63 kinda gawky talks fast and loud and often gets tongue tied kinda just doesnt fall in with bluecollar working class   bullshitting about politics on the west coast and voting  leans conservative like the whole crew then he eventually goes on about not voting being an anarchist and playing down statistics of the holocaust  head up to pilothouse with him   he asks the captain and chief  are you guys talking about 4chan  ive been going to 4chan for 11 years now im always on /pol/  yup totally makes sense  im glad ive never revealed my power level
  you should take him down to the local siu hall and introduce him
  ive made one connection from /n/ on another platform and thats more than enough for me nobody really knows how full bore 1488 gtkrwn i am keeps things simple
  the annoying thing is thats still in the fucking cgs question bank       i absolutely refuse to mention anything about this god forsaken website on the boat i almost got caught shitposting once but was able to play it off as some other forum lel     i know theres someone else from this thread down in this shitty bayou but they havent posted in a while
  wait i didnt really follow this if hes really 1488 why are you afraid to reveal your power level why did he think the captain was talking about 4chan
  no i meant it the other way fucking everyone calls it the iron mike in the bluewater fleet you dont say in autopilot on course 123 you say on the mike
  yeah ive seen 4chan circle jerks irl ill pass      why are you like the only namefag      chief and the captain were talking about skinwalkers its some running joke they got    chief lets his girl back home fuck other guys  you at least bang other girls while  home right  he doesnt bang other girls while home    the fuck
  idk lol
  nav1   difficult
   lets his girl back home fuck other guys   at least bang other girls while  home right   doesnt bang other girls while home  thats fucking tragic the fuck  no wonder maritime has 2nd highest rate of suicides
goodnight gulf work maybe next decade
  there were people who actually tried to ride the boombust cycle in the gulf instead of securing a bluewater job that wont evaporate at the drop of a sheiks headdress    well looks like msc is going to be fullup of desperate 3/ms fighting for jobs so they dont lose the houses and trucks they suddenly cant afford anymore
  even had a mate who said he has an open relationship with his wife they just dont talk about whatever they do  like manyoure out here working nonstop shes at home able to take as much dick as she wants    and im sure of divorces and all that other shit  see this pic from my bunk  makes sense for suicides lmao      i just flew home yesterday night slept from like 03001300 after sexing up the old lady   finally had the energy to drink a few this evening and got a whole 4 hours of sleep im wide awake now my shit is all fucked up   fuck 6s who the fuck thinks that shit is a good idea
    i just need the gulf to last at least a year and a half until ive got enough time for my mates license then im definitely switching to bluewater its gay as hell out here
  its a tough industry most ships ive been on did 6s but only in certain shithole ports britfag so not sure how things are in states in terms of working conditions and employment going for first contract as 3/o in a few days and fiancee is pretty depressed dont really regret getting into this work but it is tough at times
  fuck 6s who the fuck thinks that shit is a good idea  the same people who order you to falsify your workrest hours and the same people who call you out in the middle of your short rest period for undocking every time and get away with it because of the fucking necessary vessel operations exemption    i really wish the coast guard would actually get off their ass and enforce that shit so companies would have to back the fuck off for once
    fiance  starting a career at sea    nigger you dun goofed  supposing you just finished school and are young it s not a very wise move to make  from my exp none of my colleagues relation ships from before they start sailing lasted the first trips    put yourself in their shoes  young horny a lot of jamals ahmeds and chads out there to hit on her while you are away a lot of temptations    my advice is wait a couple of contracts before marrying her see how she holds up most of my friends gfs finances at the time said they they can t bare the w8 and being alone for long times    dont really regret getting into this work but it is tough at times    and will only get worse
  feels good to have no attachments desu
  ive been apart from her for 2 contracts already both times close to half a year now im doing 4 month contracts were in contact every day and i trust her completely     no experience is the same desu shes not a stacy also we live in the country surrounded by old people    i appreciate the advice senpai but weve been together for years and ive been away for longer than im going now    its difficult to find them but loyal girls are out there
  i miss that feeling but its too late now have a gf baby mama as us fags like to call them and a 11 months son  why the fuck does everybody call most offshore vsls tugs that clearly is a psv/osv        your call senpai but dont make the same mistake everybody does it wont /cant happen to me  better safe than sorry  found out last year a coleg of mine killed himself after his gf broke up with him he was onthe vsl and jumedship they didnt found the body to this day
  not a stacy  get blackpilled man i was with my girl for ten years she had been fucking around and i was totally dumbstruck when i found out about it because it was so antithetical to her personality dont fucking trust them
  blackpill
  assume your loved one is fucking a nigger no matter who she is shes fucking a nigger
    no being blackpilled is a term for being hopelessly bleak about the state of the world
fucking ferries
  my name is tugfag since i used to work on harbor tugs no real reason to change it i just work on osvs now
if im getting a 2 year diesel service degree mostly focused on trucks will i be equipped to work in maritime either right outta school or after some work experience
  youll need more horsepower certification
  get your mmc get on as a deckhand on a tug and you can be a deck engineer/unlicensed until you get your seatime my company pays like 370 a day or so for unlicensed chiefs 540 a day same as mate for licensed
    p o s t   a  y  s  t  u  b o i
  this was for like 14 days with 700 or so taken out for insurance    i could make more shoreside if i worked every week vs drawing unemployment about breaking even
  a paystub is actually posted
anyone worked out of kirachi pakistan eni starting up there for a bit
  karachi    no    stay away    stay the fuck away    do not work in karachi unless you want to worry about the taliban daily and work with literal shit water and beijingtier smog
    ahshit wasnt sure how bad it was going to be im used to west africa mostly and that can be pretty shit as well i sign off on arrival and have been told our crew change will be done by chopper not sure if thats from the port to the airport or what see what happens i suppose
  based and underrated
  how do i become qualified for mmc
  theres no qualifications necessary for os/wiper/stewards ie entry level just do the app
  its not as bad as you may think  the people smell really bad though as bad as indians
  but you need imo courses
just got my permanent 1/o promotion christmas came early this year
  wtf is permanent promotion  is there a temporary one also
  permanent position anon as in theyre the permanent 1/o on that ship who comes back there after each vacation instead of a relief officer who has to try and put in for the job constantly
  i dont think he meant that  from my exp thats usually a company policy or you can have an agreement with the ofice and your reliver to return on the same ship
does anyone have experience with the job corps at tongue point i was thinking itd be my way into the industry but every time i call it goes to voicemail and my emails never get replied back to i really wanna get started on this shit but im not good enough for the academy and ive heard entry level jobs are near impossible to get with just the twic/mmc and no experience is the maritime industry actually facing a shortage of workers due to a retiring workforce or is that bullshit ive done some research mainly on gcaptain and it seems like its bullshit
  no its legit you commonly see abs and shit working into their 70s and 80s eventually theyre not going to be able to reup their medical certificates    you can get a job with just a twic/mmc but youre very limited in jobs/ships you will have to join the siu and youre going to have to sit and wait in the halls as an applicant cbook for a job on the pride of america to clear the open board a few times its rather low pay but the contracts are long and if you want to ride it you can for as long as you want easiest way to upgrade your card and your certs and you never actually leave the us or even hawaii if you catch the poa youll be able to get your ab ticket in a very short time compared to fighting for the other os slots left on the board
so how hard is it to get into sailing as a merchant marine im 28 and have been working shit jobs my entire life i saw the twic requirements and i dont know if job hopping a lot hurts my chances
  as long as youre not a violent felon they really dont care you cant get a twic if you dont have a valid reason to but if you do its not hard to get
  thanks man im researching this as a career path what kind of things should i be looking for im not going to lie the military wont take me because of adhd meds when i was in middle school
  the military has weirdly stringent standards at times as long as youre not taking them now youre fine the coast guard doesnt care much if you are taking them now you might need to get an exemption from a doctor
  im not and i got cleared by a doctor years ago i know theres a lot more to this but thats really the big thing im worried about is having that washed out of boot stigma
  you will not believe how many people are like that out here my watch partner is a guy who got rejected by the navy and msc because he got a false positive on a tb skin test once in like 1999 hes fine and has a valid medical certificate but the military dont care
  thank you for the encouragement is there anything i should know before i get into this other than the long sea time hard working conditions and dangers associated with going to sea i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me
  just dont get distracted by your paycheck you will make a lot of money and have very little bills to pay while youre doing it and depending on the company you will get a massive payoff when your contract is up we naturally do stupid things with it spending like a sailor on shore leave isnt a meme its gods honest truth if you can avoid that you will go far
  you will get sea sick no matter what something nobody seems to take into account  everybody gets it it depends only how it will affect you  get sleepy get hungry headaches stomach pain vomit  i had a couple of academy colleagues that quit sailing after a week or so because they felt like shit and couldnt get out of the bed from the ship rolling those are some rare cases but keep in mind they exist  a lot of assholes very individualistic ppl  and if they spent a lot of time at sea some crazies  old abs bosun captain  do your job dont be afraid to ask if you dont know something no matter how stupid seams be prepared for a lot of banter and all types of jokes observe who is trustworthy on board  until then stfu  socialize but dont expose yr power level even if other do so  never sailed with us guys or on us ships but i think the above still applies
  i know it doesnt apply to you per se in your late twenties but every cadet i talk to i give the same advice when you start working go out to sea for a year or two straight as much as you can handle do it while youre young nothing is going to change at home everyone will party work repeat ad nauseum come home after all that with enough cash in hand to clear debts and buy a house free and clear before you can even rent a car
alright so i started on the my twic with the tsa website and apparently i need to have a job in the industry first i also found great lakes academy is the academy a good idea
  its the best one out of them all in terms of learning environment however you will be slightly pidgeonholed youll graduate with great lakes pilotage in addition to your mates license so itd feel like a waste to do anything but sail on the lakes they pay just as well so its not like youre losing anything major though    i think being a member of the siu counts for your job in the industry im not sure but its worth asking about if you dont want to do the academy
  i was able to get my twic before i was working in the industry schedule an appointment at a tsa office and do it in person
how can america make decent state wide public transit systems of regional and interurban trains commuter trains metro trains of necessary and streetcar/tram/lightrail networks all working together as an integrated whole  rather than the current situation where a local municipality decides to build single short lightrail in the gentrified downtown and nobody can figure out why it doesnt solve shit
  createfederal guideslines on how these systems should be integrated with one another  state level transit agencies that would create rules intended to railroad pun intended local municipalities into cooperating with each other
  socialist revolution
  you got it all wrong its not about municipalities cooperating its the total dearth of funds available cant build whats not paid for
  what i am asking is about getting beyond a small municiplaity doing something in their own little fief    how will that encourage thinking about the whole place and transit around everywhere
  the question youre asking is really about how infrastructure gets built at all in the us the best model for that with transportation is highways as far as i know the way that works is that the federal government makes money for highways available to states if the states follow the stipulations that the federal gov sets out so the states arent being forced to do anything but they can opt in and obviously want to develop infrastructure     mostly comes down to what money is available and how its incentivized to be used
  how can america make decent state wide public transit systems of regional and interurban trains commuter trains metro trains of necessary and streetcar/tram/lightrail networks all working together as an integrated whole  unironically deport or genocide all noneuropean ethnicities     inb4 
  unironically this   nimbys have been convinced by those that stand to profit that cars are a life and death thing and a measure of your worth as a man and your value to society  the boot is so thoroughly deepthroated in this country it will literally never happen until money and profit isnt the main goal in life
  based     remember not to reply to the post ending in 280 its bait
  thats true as far as it goes but only halfway the feds give to the state which then decides what projects to fund  this is why marta is the only us transit authority with no federal money atlanta is full of niggers and fags and the rest of the state is rednecks who hate atl and vote for rednecks to rep them in the state legislature    however the feds _can_ strongarm the states but the only instance of that happening that i know is when louisiana wouldnt change the legal age for alcohol from 18 to the national standard of 21 until the feds said fine no highway money and they rolled over like rover
kill yourself
 mandatory
  only for kids adults should be able to decide if they dont want to wear a helmet because it looks silly and then get brain damage in a bad fall
  no if you make it mandatory  i get a car
making helmets mandatory is as stupid as forcing people fastening belts   let idiots die ffs
  drive wisely no fall will happen helmet will never safe from retarded brains
  no but latina braphogs should be mandatory for all anons on this boards
helmets shouldnt be made mandatory for any vehicle that has you turning into a projectile no matter what happens  or rather is seatbelts are required so make em have a helmet which is funny because we dont if i wanna kill myself let me      at least in some freak accident a belt could keep some retard from flying out and hurting someone else who didnt consent
  at least in some freak accident a belt could keep some retard from flying out and hurting someone else who didnt consent  you underestimate windshields and dashboards
  i mean more like uncle drunk drive wont wear a belt because he didnt need to wear a belt in nam then his fat body flies around the car and kills his nephews that might have otherwise survived
  ok i thought about dummy flying into other traffic
  lmao that guy with the beard
tfw no catherine rampell gf
electric scooters should be illegal
    yes certainly but who is going to police it and what will be the punishment     i live in australia we have mandatory bicycle helmet laws i would not wish that fucking bullshit on any body at any cost wearing a helmet at 30kmh on a road makes sense but it also meant cops would patrol parks and give you a 120 fine for just rolling through a grassy a park  5kmh without a helmet cost me thousands dollars of fines and jail time     just dont go there just dont also electric scooters should only be allowed to park where there are docked ride share bikes no where else
  no fuck that ban idiots and rentals
ridership plummets whenever helmets are mandated  see australia  and its exactly what we dont need in times when cities have an urgent demand for alternative transport methods    in other words go ahead and do mandate helmets if you want people to become cagers
  but thats what the general public wants so politicians will pander to drivers by making laws that discourage cycling
  they want people to cycle yet force stupid things like helmets and force slow riders drive with cagers and after that fatality rates sky rocket
  its often 2 different levels of government working against each other cities inherently more liberal want cycling however at the state level the government might be held by conservatives who pander to their ignorant spiteful supporters
  mandetory  fuck off   people who want mandatory things should be mandatory castrated youre ruining the world    youre probably the same stubborn types that make any other mandatory laws required because you insist on forcing your ways to others be it appropriate or completely out of place
  on reddit they are rallying for sugar to be treated like tobacco or alcohol and under the jurisdiction of the atf because sugar is toxic
  you wear a helmet to protect yourself not others  if you want to take the risk why should anyone stop you  the only person that could get harmed are you yourself after all    same goes for bicycles and motorcycles
  because when you fuck yourself up you become a burden on society and the people around you
  weather or not a insurance should pay or increase rates in this case is a different question
  in that case its in my interest to keep my insurance costs down to legislate that you wear a helmet
  you dont have to do that your insurance could offer discounts for wearing a helmet or have a policy not to pay for incidents where you dont wear a helmet
  so you wont wear a helmet and you wont get the insurance and then what
    should ban all forms of sport and personal transportation then well all live in insurance utopia
  thats not going to do any good for the state of society there is an optimal point of control and freedom no need to go to the extremes in any direction
  this is why the state has to go
  the state organises cooperation of people on a greater scale than is possiple in a pure anarchy humanity has reached the dominant position we hold on the planet because our ability to cooperate
  then it doesnt cost the insurance anything or the insurance can charge premium
  then it doesnt cost the insurance anything  in which case you will be a burden on society when you fuck youreslf up
helmets should be mandatory for all activities   driving  you might crash and hurt your head  walking  you might fall and hurt your head  showering  you might slip and hurt your head  reading  the book might leap out of your hands and hit you and you will die  sleeping  you might fall off the bed and hurt your head  fucking  you might smack your heads together and die
  no you just fucked up big time
  this is what dumb myopic faggots actually believe is good and right  underage b needs to leave
  you might crash and hurt your head  seat belts and airbags exist i think theyd protect better that some 3 cm thick helmet  you might fall off the bed and hurt your head  i sleep on floor   you might smack your heads together and die  lol
    every authoritarian empire eventually collapses rome nazi germany the ussr and someday our current empire which relies on locking people in cages for nonviolent crimes will also fall would you rather have children that require threats of punishment in order to behave or would you rather have children that learn to behave without being punished our system is holding humanity back like a crutch its preventing us from growing and adapting to freedom and responsibility     people get lazy and rely on government instead of learning to handle their own problems but no one wants to declare anarchy tomorrow we have an obligation to make sure we have as little authoritarian violence as possible and one day that will mean no authoritarianism imagine when humans colonize the solar system are we going to boss around another fucking planet or someone deep in space     and a lawless society is not a ruleless society when people go to church camp they follow additional rules because they will get kicked out if they dont if you dont like what someone is doing then you are allowed to kick them off your property and communities can figure out who owns what and you dont need police because you can hire security and have mutual defensive pacts with your neighbors
helmets should be mandatory for stupid people    what those people happen to be doing at any given time is not at issue
  no let stupid die
  oh look its a helmet/no helmet thread how original  i reject your trolling attempt    this is now an antiscooter thread instead electric scooters should be banned outright as a public safety hazard that cannot be mitigated any other way  center of gravity too high to be truly stable  operator cannot secure themselves properly to the vehicle therefore a panic stop would cause them to fly forward off the scooter causing bodily injury and loss of control of the scooter  no brake lights or signals not safe to take one hand off the bars to make hand signals  at the very least they should be limited by a governor mechanism to no faster than walking speed 5mph for safety reasons this of course would make them impractical for transportation purposes therefore they should just be banned altogether and be done with it the only sort of standup scooter that should be allowed should be the humanpowered kind same goes for skateboards motorized skateboards should be banned also as even more hazardous to public safety    most people are too fat and weak anyway and should be pedaling a bike or walking or some other humanpowered transportation for health reasons its also better overall for the environment longterm    therefore the entire subject of helmets is irrelevant
  most people are too fat and weak anyway and should be pedaling a bike or walking or some other humanpowered transportation for health reasons its also better overall for the environment longterm  except they wont they will get a shitboxes and cause chaos on roads people are lazy     in reality those scooters are pretty safe what is really dangerous  is forcing cyclists and other slow vehicles 25 km/h on road
    and dont you fucking understand the original point bribery will always exist and people will manipulate the state for their own egotistical selfish reasons like insurance premiums meaning everyone has to walk around in a giant foam suit we cannot engineer human folly out of a centralized system that is why we need a decentralized system ie loose treaties between individuals you cannot stop lobbying state enterprise or donations    the road to hell is paved with good intentions as an ancap i am mature enough to accept that freedom may not be perfect better than letting some other man tell me what to do you fucking faggot
  infantile disorder
  property rights existing without the state
  what is castle doctrine  no human has ever protected his own property or hired security      reee grow up and become a slave like me   have fun letting your ego excuse your own cuckism deep down you know you are just sucking another mans dick you faggot
  actual insanity
  guy with the biggest gun makes you his property
    reee get the men in white coats this dangerous criminal wants freedom11       he still suffers massive losses and is incentivized to never pull a similar stunt again       repeating what i said earlier  no one is saying they want to get rid of the state tomorrow btw but the point is to have as little authoritarian violence as possible as we adapt to a free society then we can further shrink authority and eventually we will be colonizing planets and shiet and governments will be obsolete every authoritarian empire that forgot the virtue of limited government has fallen and someday our current empire which relies on locking people in cages for nonviolent crimes will also fall would you rather have children that require threats of punishment in order to behave or would you rather have children that learn to behave without being punished our system is holding humanity back like a crutch its preventing us from growing and adapting to freedom and responsibility
  shitposting this badly
  electric scooters should be forbidden if your bmi is over 25
  every authoritarian empire eventually collapses  yes as opposed to anarchies which are still around after millenias  good job on basically equating the nazis to both the modern western world and the ancient roman empire
  yeah but i didnt say we were ready for anarchism i said we have an obligation to have as little authoritarian violence as possible and someday that will be no authoritarian violence    and anarchies did exist for millennia you fucking dumbass that is why we are all here faggot
  look at this schizo ass writing
  reeee get the men in white coats this criminal wants freedom reeeeee
  meh they are quite strong they can 100 kilos no problem
  sure thing my property
  this is literally the same level logic as anarchocommunism
  counterpoint should it be mandatory not to shit in the streets
no you fucking idiot its a personal decision if fucktards want to put their own lives at risk let them be fucking idiots its not your place to force them to be responsible in ways that only affect themselves    i see these things all the fucking time in the city i live in and i have only once ever seen someone wearing a helmet while riding one it was a cute girl and i really wish i had a chance to meet her but alas not even a single word was exchanged between us
  that only affect themselves  if 99  of the population has a head trauma society is shit therefore it is mathematically false that the impact is 0 on the rest of society this is why sugary foods and drinks need to be banned or heavily controlled as well as everything dangerous this is why seat belts are mandatory this is why loan sharks and predatory scams must be banned
  thats 200  unrelated to what i meant i dont mean it for security but because it promotes a cagey lifestyle of having a machine move you around the city when you could use a bike or walk fat slobs must not be encouraged to keep being fat slobs
  fat slobs must not be encouraged to keep being fat slobs  exactly if you will ban scooters  they will buy cars just to drive 1 km
  do you know how cumbersome and expensive cars are
  yes 500 for a pretty decent car for 1 km ride
im against nanny government most cases but these things are a fucking menace you have fat dumpy white whores zooming around on them acting like hot shit nearly killing old grandmas and small children at every second you have them now two to a scooter some fuck with their fuckface friend squatting down at his feet so they dont have to pay for two have niggers weaving in and out of traffic wrong way down bike lanes swerving all over to show off riding through crowded sidewalks crossing at reds without looking because they suddenly think theyre a hotshot daredevil mostly the fat white whores because they have the most inertia and least spatial awareness theyre a menace to society everyone who rides one needs to be shot   but i dont want them to wear helmets the more that die the better
  no you fucking idiot its a personal decision if fucktards want to put their own lives at risk let them be fucking idiots its not your place to force them to be responsible in ways that only affect themselves  god youre stupid  what is informed consent  people are dumb  someone says i wonder if i should have a helmet on while im riding this scooter it looks like its a little dangerous then people around them who are also dumb say whats wrong with you are you a pussy nothing bad is going to happen to you ever its perfectly safe you dont need a helmet dummy just ride your scooter and stfu then that person says oh ok i didnt know goes off on the scooter gets in an accident and sustains head trauma  because an innocent that might have put on a goddamned helmet listened to some fucktard totally avoidable    many laws exist to prevent fucktard attitudes from causing injury to people who might listen to them  many laws exist because too many people are fucktards got injured or killed people got sued for it over and over again then the government steps in and makes a law to prevent fucktards from being fucktards  this is how civilization works    go be an anarchist somewhere else  if you think its funny to convince people to be fucktards and get injured and killed then go jump headfirst into a woodchipper you asshole we dont need any more of you dickheads on our planet    if youre so fucktarded yourself that you honestly believe nothing bad could ever happen to you hurr durr im too skilled and careful herp derp then youve been informed and warned you are stupid knock that off and do as youre told fucktard wear a goddamned helmet    click the pic it describes this entire fucking thread
  delusional cars are much more expensive than that factor in the insurance and all trips to the mechanic because a  500 dollars car is going to be a steaming pile of shit    no fat people shouldnt be allowed to ride electric scooters and that wont make them buy cars which they already have if theyre fat and not dirt poor in the first place
  delusional cars are much more expensive than that  i drove similar shitbox this is the biggest investment   factor in the insurance  cheap af since it is old rust bucket   and all trips to the mechanic because a  500 dollars car is going to be a steaming pile of shit  wrong you just buy other 500 shitbox if this fails badly just make sure you took your junk from trunk before recycling it   oil change is simple brakes is pretty easy to do as well and considering amount of rust it is a pretty good workout  everything that could broke is broken so nothing to worry about  no fat people shouldnt be allowed to ride electric scooters and that wont make them buy cars   so you want fat people get even fatter just compare riding a scooter that indeed requires some movement in order to drive it to a car which requires just pressing electronic gas pedal and turning steeringassisted wheel while sitting
  no  fuck you  unless government pays my hospital bills they have no right to stop me from smashing my brains out in any way i want
while you plebs sit on your bikes and in your cages i will be getting around using the best method of transport in existence how does that make you feel
  london
  tbh id like to ride him
the air quality here is pretty bad when i go along the main roads and im thinking about getting a pollution mask does anyone here use one which one should i get
  the best thing to do is avoid the main roads and go through the back roads it may be longer but its worth it the advantage of the bicycle is its agility and this should be utilized to avoid busy traffic as much as possible i always mapped out my routes via google maps like this it can get kinda fun to avoid as much traffic as possible its like a challenge my commute became 3 to 4 km longer but its worth it
  i try to do this too but sadly every road thats not a main road is in terrible condition where i live so i only go through those with my 90s rigid mtb
3m is pretty much your only serious choice thirdparties using 3m filters are also acceptable there is one serious drawback the effective ones do not allow sufficient airflow for physical exertion meaning you can only wear placebo ones while cycling there is no solution unfortunately
  there is no solution unfortunately    the solution would be to wear a mask that linked to an o2 tank on your back little hose under yer nose like grandma
  get an albuterol inhaler if you are having problems breathing while on your bike because of pollution and particulate matter triggering excercise induced asthma     an inhaler is 30 less if you have insurance
    i use a respro mask it works well enough
choose one with fan
  there is one anon on here who uses a small scuba tank he only uses it at red lights though fills it with a bike pump
here is solution     enclosed capsule close footholes wit spandex with slits use hood with sealing rubber circle close when car come by open when car far gone protect user full against irritant and pollution cut through air torpedo
  whatever you get be sure it has at least an n95 or higher rating and is washable/reusable
brap mask reporting in
  not a solution if you live in sk that fine dust is everywhere
  use something that opens up your airways so you can get the pollution and toxic shit even deeper into your lungs for maximum damage  leave
  stop being a pan y aqua fag
  close when car come by open when car far gone    there is never a time when cars are gone in a city
  idk what it is youre smoking but you should probably stay off the internet when you do you make no sense
  or just buy a car
  he claims to be knowledgeable enogh about cycling to deserve to be a tripfag but doesnt know one of the nost common slang phrases about the pro peloton    pan y aqua means you are riding 100 percent clean no ped gear and no tues for example an albuterol inhaler
  this respro are pretty nice they have shit designs tho
    you are still exposed to highly toxic levels of pollution inside a car
  sue your municipality like the deutsche umwelthilfe does for every fucking german city that exceeds the nox limits
are there any models that fit beard
  not if you expect it to work no
  no this is where the toothbrush moustache that hitler and others wore came from its one of the forms of facial hair that can fit under a gas mask important for a wwi soldier
mustard appreciation thread
they do make decent videos
  yes
  best channel format for youtube imo sparse but well crafted videos
clickbait shit  no thanks
one of my favorite channels for sure the mix of 3d animations and models on a table is so hnnnnnng tier    also this
  mustard just isnt my condiment man i personally prefer ketchup or ranch when served with chicken
  sparse but well crafted videos  someone doesnt know how the algorithm works

the following countries have no railway at all    andorra  bhutan  cyprus  timorleste  guineabissau  iceland  kuwait  libya   macau  malta  marshall islands  mauritius  micronesia  niger  oman  papua new guinea  qatar  rwanda  san marino  solomon islands  somalia  suriname  tonga  trinidad and tobago  tuvalu  vanuatu  yemen    imagine being trapped in such a cager hellhole i get that niger is too poor or that it doesnt make sense for sparse islands or even that everyone just lives in the capital as it happens with iceland doesnt excuse the lack of trams tho but a country like libya
trains in third world countries are awful anyway id much rather cage in those places waiting around for an overcrowded death trap that doesnt respect time tables and runs on rails put down by colonists 100 years ago sounds like a special kind of hell
  andorra qatar oman iceland or libya pre 2011 at least arent third world though
now that you mention it a train that went all around the island along route 1 would be pretty sweet i suppose theres no demand tho since literally every single person in iceland has a car and theres top tier highways to everywhere
define country do the british crown dependencies count
  most of those are either islands or tiny mountainous countries
  clearly you dont know what third world means
  literally none of these are third world
    i think he thinks andorra is the planet with purple skinned aliens and iceland is a grocery store
  micro nations  tiny islands  african shitholes
  literally none of these is an excuse
  one of those is literally 30 square kilometers just how many tens of millions usd do you suggest they spend to avoid 5minutes in a car just give everyone a bicycle
  tuvalu nauru and other pacific islands have an excuse ok micronations on land dont have an excuse though
if you (((need))) any other mode of transportation than just walking then irban planing has already failed
  malta  more cars than parking spaces  i have no spot and i must drive
  easter island  i have car but there is only 1km of paved road  yes there is car club  i can see him over there
andorra is just one small town and few villages in high mountains valleys
  do liechtenstein monaco and the vatican have some sort of rail service
  interestingly enough the vatican has a railroad station thats what most struck me when i visited rome it was sometimes used by popes or other dignitaries but doesnt have regular service  liechtenstein and monaco are probably serviced by swiss/austrian and french railways respectively but im to lazy to look it up right now
  but there have been longtime plans of bringing some sort of railway there since theres lots of tourism and the roads get clogged there are ongoing talks of a railway connection between pas de la casa andorra and porta france where it would connect to the mainline railway according to the latest reports this would require a 7 kilometer tunnel and it would be a rack railway    i think this would make sense but the rack railway should reach latourdecarol where it would meet the french mainline the spanish mainline to puigcerdàvicbarcelona and the popular yellow train it could just share the french railway alignment between porta and latourdecarol with dual gauge its a short stretch and the line doesnt have heavy traffic if the rack railway would end short at porta it would lose lots of potential with spain which is where the bulk of tourists come from  also imagine the glorious clusterfuck that would be latourdecarol currently  spanish iberian broad gauge  french standard gauge  yellow train meter gauge w/ third rail electrification  and then  andorra rack railway likely meter gauge w/ overhead line but no rack between porta and latour since it shares the regular alignment
    forgot link    this news item is from august of this year so the idea has certainly not been abandoned    pic related a shitty little map showing the situation  purple is french mainline std gauge  red is spanish mailine iberian  yellow is yellow train meter  brown is more or less this proposed connection
    you forgot    dominica  grenada  barbados  st vincent  st lucia  martinique  guadeloupe  st marten  stkitts  monsterrat
  not sovereign countries especially not martinique and guadeloupe which are france and do have a railway
  its a very frequented touristic population and the population of andorralavella is high enough to justify a regionallevel train station with connections to both france and spain        monaco also has a single train station and liechtenstein has a whopping four of them
gaddafi literally scrapped the railway lines and told everyone that they were the legacy of colonialism    obviously as a large country we built a very extensive road network one of the best in africa but even that obviously isnt enough so in the late 2000s plans were in motion to create a new rail network from scratch
  off the florida keeeyyyys  theres a place called kokomo  thats where you wanna go  to get away from it all
  lel
  macau  theyve spend 1400 million usd in building an agt light rail system but it still cannot open yet thats only the money for the first planned line entire system cost is projected to be over 6 billion usd  and now theyre talking about high speed train  good luck to them
iceland  theres a foamer on 1chan thats from iceland ive always thought it was the greatest irony
    st lucia grenada dominica and barbados are fully sovereign iirc  i wish martinique had proper rail as for guadeloupe i dont remember i think they have a tramway  st martin is too small  the rest idk
    macau is not a country macau is china rreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  rwanda    search for it on google and found it  
  did you read it too its not easy because its badly written but what it says is all those railroads are theoretical none exist yet
  andorra is the planet with purple skinned aliens  thats andoria and theyre blue skinned
  yeah i dit the first line seemd to say that there was some railways but after some reasearch i found out that they are about to begin the construction of the railway that was planned since 2000        at this rate they might have one by 2030
  holy fuck thats so fucking retarded i can understand a country like mongolia not having railways because everyone just lives in ulaanbaatar but a tripolibenghazi line sounds like a great idea maybe with connections to djerba and the cairo
  no railways on the seychelles either    really wouldnt mind living in such a hellhole though
  arent the seychelles a full islamic country thats going to disappear if the sea level increases by as little as 3 meters anyway
  iceland is working on something called the lava express
  damn that sounds metal
  that picture isnt stalin btw     he had pockmarks from child hood polie or smallpox or some shit
  idk man according to wikipedia from a soviet 1947 book this was indeed stalin  
  trinidad and tobago  we used to have a train back when the britbongs were here  but i dont really see a need for it anymore since everyone has a car
  you dont need trains when everyone has a car  peak boomerthink
  its also just ice
  san marino is a minuscule enclave inside italy which has railways you retard
  i know but we wee not really affected by that much the roads are good petrol is cheap and domestic flight tickets are very affordable but obviously business and industries need a railway network also an egypt to tunis network would be very handy even the plots for the tracks were selected but after 2001 everything got frozen or cancelled
rwanda has no rail system    fucking sucks man    you will never ride the railways with your hutu brethren getting off at every village with a tutsi to slaughter them  you will never take their tutsi cattle that they use to get the milk that gives them such satisfying to chop bones and push it in front of an approaching train  you will never steal food rations from the red cross and doctors without borders and joke with your hutu pals that the refreshments have arrived  you will never setup a railway checkpoint with your interahamwe brothers and get onto the train to inspect tickets but you actually inspect identity cards and kill every tutsi you see  you will never slice open the belly of a pregnant tutsi passenger then joke that he should have a junior ticket as she bleeds out holding her fetus in her disgusting gangly tutsi fingers  you will never sit in the first class quiet seats and loudly listen to the rtlm radio broadcast so loudly that the arrogant tutsi passengers with their rich cattle farm lifestyles get nervous and start to run for the exits  you will never laugh as the pathetic cuck romeo dallaire chases the train on foot with his fat canadian belly wobbling and his crybaby eyes on the verge of tears as he realises he cannot stop your murdering even more tutsi children  you will never guess with your hutu bros if the last bump was just the railway or a tutsi corpse its hard to tell because they are so thing it is like hitting a stick  you will never watch tutsi bump their heads as they enter the carriage then laugh as you chop it off    fucking tutsi scum we could have finished them all if we had good trains fucking kagame traitorous scum
  somalia rail would be kino
  there is a railway now in french somalia
  no youre thinking of the maldives which should also be on the list
  i know and thats no excuse for not having a railway station      rip libya train until at least 2030      meme made by the bagosora gang  meme made by hutu gang
  there is one in rimini from where you can take the bus into san marino in little above 30 minutes dont  me again
  san marino does not have railways  there is a railway station in rimini italy only a thirtyminute bus ride away from san marino  therefore san marino has railways   yikes bro
  you can be dense how much you want it does not make holes in my argument san marino does not need a railway and station nor can it afford one without italian subsidies i say this as an italian it has other issues like being a fucking enclave in the middle of italy yet relying on italian infrastructure and by consequence italian tax money just like those fucks at the vatican
  it does not make holes in my argument san marino does not need a railway and station  lets backtrack a bit here exhibit a       there is a railway station in rimini from where you can take the bus into san marino in little above 30 minutes dont  me again    exhibit b     san marino is a minuscule enclave inside italy which has railways you retard    which was in reply to op which read       the following countries have no railway at all  san marino    case closed you have made a complete fucking ass out of yourself your claim was that san marino has a railway station you have attempted to shift goalposts to san marino _not needing_ a railway station which is a completely different thing and which didnt work out     get the fuck out
  so it doesnt have a railway station sad even liechtenstein has four railway stations
  the vatican isnt a country or at the very least shouldnt be and should be collectively ignored till the un just deletes it
  its a sovereign country recognized by the international community dont be autistic    why should it not be
  interestingly enough the vatican has a railroad station  one guaranteed in the treaty affirming the vatican as separate to italy no less
  nor can it afford one  isnt san marino the place with three times more cars than people
  because it has literally no purpose no territorial claims no real population and only exists because mussolini wanted christian gibs
  it has a territorial claim of 044 km2 it exists because its a successor to the papal states so that the head of the catholic church ie the spiritual head of the western world is not subject to any man the holy see has always been independent the period going from italian unification to mussolinis treaty was the historic oddity
  the spiritual head of the western world  protestants like myself beg to differ more the the spiritual head of most things wrong with religion
  when i said this     it is implicit i meant that a station was never needed but you are free to argue a point you assume i made for imaginary brownie points maybe i didnt expose my point sufficiently to prevent debate artists such as yourself to argue semantics but this site is anonymous so really there is no repercussion for losing arguments except for those like you who choose to namefag or tripfag i digress anyway nobody here seems to consider the validity of building a train station for a nation positioned at an inconvenient place as it would end up serving san marino exclusively which is asinine it is simply not needed and in order to make it sensible it would need in my opinion a connenction with arezzo which definetly is not cost effective because of the mountain range between
  liechtenstein is   1not an enclave   2larger than san marino by almost three times in area  3so much richer and more favourably positioned to justify railway service
  comparably macau have a higher speed train station right next to their border connected via border and custom facility yet that still wont count as a train station of themselves and theyre still actively planning their own high speed railway station
    san marino used to have a railway until it got bombed by britbongs
  if you think papism is so wrong why do you regard a papistcreated book as a divinelyinspired scripture
  suck your dead nan you noodle nigger
  my sides
  there was in the earliest third of the 20th century in the french pyrenees a tramway line from st girons to some lost town in the mountains look up how small and unpopulated the area was and still is absolute proof that rail to every small town is in fact not an unrealistic demand
celebrity i like  find out theyre cager that hates cyclists
  tfw i just find out jennifer aniston was a messenger before friends and still loves to ride
  if thats true she just jumped a whole bunch of rungs in my esteem
  wow that pictures sure looks legit
  its tough but in general 999 of functioning human beings loathe cyclists with an intense passion
  celebrity i like  find out they had a tram named after them
even as a daily commuter i hate cyclists law breaking cunts 70
  thats understandable its not like motorists like other motorists very much either a lot of cyclists are just as bad as drivers when it comes to following traffic laws and being courteous on the road and because of that its easy to lump all of them together to demonize anyone on a bicycle
even i hate most cyclists i drive past particularly people who cant hold a line which includes normal people commuting by bike and especially double wide pacelines on busy roads
whats the most youve ever spent on a bike

1500 dm  750  back in the 90s
2500 on the bike itself then theres all the shit i just had to buy for it
  4700
  2 years in jail
  over 800 us but that was in 1995 dollars  i havent bought anything new since it was stolen  funnily enough ive got about the same price in racks and fenders on my current whip as what i paid for the bike plus other upgrades too
original purchase price excluding parts and upgrades 280  holy shit never really thought about that before  i mean i have probably a few thousand dollars worth of bikes but ive never actually paid more than 280 for one
spent about 400 in 1980 dollars on a 26 bmx cruiser so thats what 1300 in todays dollars
at once 600 usd probably   on a build 800  about to build a dura ace carbon wheelset with tubulars for 480
  50 hardtail 26 mtb and bout 10x that in wheels and service stuff over the years
have two bikes that probably cost over 8k each counting initial purchase and subsequent upgrades  bike i ride the most now is a 30 year old miyata in likenew condition that cost around 400 with around 100 of that being upgrades
  i got those feels
  lel
i got a rusty mountain bike that lied under a tree for a year or so for free paid 50 to make it safe again when i get money i will spend another 20 for tires so still far from 100 bucks spent
  about 500
  300 for a 3month old folding mountain bike that cost the original owner 1500 we were in afghanistan and he didnt want to spend even more money to ship it home an afghan working at a bakery on our base saw it and offered me a stack of bread for it i declined
7000 on my carbon enduro bike dunno if id do it again
    post that shit
  best i can find about now
  3k trail bike  2k dirt jumper  1k daily driver singlespeed
  leaning your bike against a sign that specifically states that bikes are not allowed   what a menace you are
  10/10 would bang
  ticknock
  wtf no dox
    what weakass costumekink is this
  260
  2800 on a carbon bianchi road bike and it got stolen bought a 1000 rose pro sl2000 for the insurance money and locks it in a shed every day
1400 on the bike    at least another 600 more if you include the bike fit and accessories
3100
1300
1400 for an ebike it was an ecomotion bike if i remember correctly sold it for 800 about two months after
    i too know this feel    i grew up on a gaspipe sekini and godamnit hiten just feels like home
i built a 550 bmx wheel for about 350 by getting stuff on sales
1600  1000 canukbuks    and the thing is its not even remotely sporting or competitive its just a lowperformance riding around and grocery getter bike but a really nice one the price comes from being reliable and safe at night and in winter and was surprisingly impossible to find in a prebuilt package not a richfag here it was a big sacrifice for me but im still pretty happy with it 7 years later i dont think i would be too comfortable with anything less riding on city streets is a difficult and safetycritical task that deserves serious attention    spot ajax frame is getting a bit beat up aluminum will never be as tough as steel can be but it looks nice  8speed alfine hub has always worked awesome  sp dynohub and philips lights have never given me any trouble  deore hydraulic disks have been a big pain in the ass but do the job  axa frame lock with heavy plugin chain had to come from europe its secure enough and very convenient why dont they them sell here  pinhead lock bolts allround seem like a good idea but the included ulock was a waste of time  evo brooklyn handlebar / basket randomly cracked on me a genuine jra   gates toothed belt worked but was not worth the effort    kinda weird that the bike shops will sell you a superspecialized tool for every obscure sport imaginable for as much as you want to pay but if you want a car replacement bike with the basic roadgoing equipment that comes standard on every motorcycle you have to chase around and build some custom project like this it seems bikes are considered toys albeit sometimes expensive ones and not practical vehicles even by the people who try and promote them as such
  3000 on a efat tire bike for winterso far its working pretty well was thinking of getting some studded tires for it as well
  you can get a nice used car for that much
  why do people always do this
  feeling this post like whoa  i didnt spend like you but turning my used steelie into a car replacement i spent more on aftermarket than the bike which was a bone stock 87 sport tourer just on racks and fenders i spent about what i paid for the bike plus bar baskets freewheel long cage rd pedals saddle etc to truly sort the gearing i still need a smaller bcd crank and id love to get a dyno hub but well see
  why didnt you just buy used i had a hardtail for years and years that did everything for 750 used
spent 3000 on an ebike a while ago fairly nice bike
  ignoring operation cost of the car as usual
  so far 2k on a meme machine and 400 in accessories
150 for a crashed alu bike both wheels buckled and cracked fork
  also comparing a brand new high end bike to a second hand shitty car i could buy a bike for less than it costs me to go out for dinner if i really cared about getting the cheapest option
  this is not relevant to what any of the anons said
  yfw gates carbon drive tm is patented    how the fuck can they patent a fucking belt     there is no such thing as informaiton property anyway fuck those marxist bastards         all patents do is create monopolies for corps it screws over the independent inventors that the leftist elite pretends they care about see nintendo suing indie dev for having a suction cup joystick that stuck to smart phones         also pic related is a socialist but i still like this meme
  preach it brother preach the gospel of open standards down with imaginary property    but im pretty sure gates doesnt have a patent on the idea of toothed belts per se or even the idea of using them on bicycles if they have patents they will be far more narrow i had trouble with mine and when it wore out i switched to plain chain hot paraffin wax 4lyfe the only place i would recommend gates belts is for fixies not a fixiefag myself but i suspect its zero backlash and slight rubbery feel would complement each other
  how much was the money exactly thats what the thread is about guessing you got quite a bit of bang for that buck    like the handlebar setup not conventional but looks comfie rear wheel reflector looks nice and retro but front should match folding wire panniers are very interesting but can the bike handle that weight i might have put them on the back do you carry the lock on your body somewhere usually some sort of mount for it on this genre of bike frame mounted friction shifters look cool but are totally impractical on the street are you really fiddling them with one hand in stopandgo city traffic good picture too technically competent and the bricks weeds and broken pavement really put it in its natural environment should have arranged the valve stems on the bottom the tire label on the top and the pedal at 300 for the classic bike portrait though
  word     haha im not a super l33t biker yet so thanks for the hot wax tip my chain is squeaky as shit
     wax for life    im still having trouble understanding how it took me 20 years of cycling to fucking find out about waxing the amount of shitty mess and expense i have spent on lubes makes my head spin    its literally a bike shop conspiracy to sell product
  how often do you clean and rewax do you simply soak in paint thinner or some other solvent first
  150  50 for a bike and 100 for shimano nexus 3 gear hube   i just like these nexus 3 hubs but they have a tendency to collect dust and die in result
    you only need to soak it in solvent once to remove the existing lube i just leave it overnight in a jar of acetone or kerosene and let it dry then dunk it in a rice cooker filled with candle wax i have also used a simple glass jar filled with wax on my kitchen stovetop i dunk it every 24 weeks depending on kms and conditions takes 15minues while im cleaning my frame no gunk no mess incredible    keep in mind this is possible because a chain has a quick link not really recommended if you have to constantly use a chain breaker     also pure candle wax is just fine to start with i since have added molybdenum and teflon to the pot as per the fred scriptures
  7k for a bike with outer cable routing what
  jar on stovetop
2051
      theres only 2 types of maintenance you should be doing on a chain   teflon lube when it squeaks   replace when its 75 stretched    anything else is just shortening the chains lifespan or at best not helping it plus unnecessary effort and expenses  a bottle of shimano brand lube that will last you a year is less than 10 do you really want to fuck about with boiling wax in a pot and skimming used solvent from the grime for no real benefit
  the serious cyclist completely dismantles his chain and soaks it for 5 months in heated wax
  20 on a mint 96 eros that sat in an enthusiasts garage and im assuming their parents just threw it away at a thrift store havent spent a penny on it or any other bike in my life
  post pic    also why are you here
  for people who spent a fair amount like 1k was it worth itdo you think its worth it if i just commute
burp
  yes/no
  based
    unironically this
  1100 on my first carbon light road bike got full 105 group and nice comfy frame and tires my old alloy frame was total trash although it looked pretty and aero both are chinese brands
  was it worth it  absolutely desu  commute  depends how your commute is and how secure it is at work/school/etc
  dont dis latex fgt
4200
  wanna stick it in that sticc
  i dont understand    and alright im home now ill have to look through backups for them ive done a lot of photography of it actually beautiful thing i dont ride it often recently as the frame is a little too small for me and i dont feel comfortable locking it up on the street i keep it in my closet some other hobbyism stuff has gotten in the way recently
  super_aero
  for a single item  banshee rune v2 frame for approx 1800 next is a mondraker crafty frame for approximately the same money
  my sensa trentino cost about 2000 euros
itt cool intersections interchanges and other road infrastructure ill start with a combination diverging diamond / roundabout intersection
  single point urban interchange
  new jersey jughandles
  swingdon mega roundabout
  edmonton ringroad
  nanpu bridge shanghai
  that must be a horror to navigate on the ground
  oh my fucking god im not driving through that
  that looks like a fucking death trap
    its not theyre way better than conventional intersections
left hand entrance/exit ramps 
  we have one of those near myself its a regular intersection with dotted guide lines because its lonnng  it doesnt seem particularly awesome or particularly sucky it just allows there to be one long intersection under an overpass instead of two traditional intersections on each side of the overpass which would be more of a pain for regulating traffic
  spuis have fewer points of conflict  death trap
dont know where this is but holy bajeezus
  japan near tokyo area im pretty sure    interchange between two tunnels
  takaosan ic
      really annoyed by these birdseye view comments on complex interchanges and intersections the humor/sarcasm runs out eventually   
  birdshit architecture these are birdshit views
    big intersection areas can be centered around obstacles    in japan rightturn traffic are separated by these hatch marks
  pic
    im   i wasnt being sarcastic or humorous my comment was entirely sincere
this place in canada is peak cager just imagine trying to navigate as a pedestrian or cyclist
  actually i imagine its like any other roundabout you dont cross through roundabouts you cross along the egdes in this case yes there are more crossings to do but the concept is the same the inside looks a mess but you dont walk through those islands in the center  theres only people on it in that pic because i believe this was taken at a car show type event
  i think pedestrian safety wise roundabouts are actually superior to regular intersections theres more crossings yeah but overall its safer the only thing in that pic the crossing at the end of the highway offramp looks dangerous i suspect cars would come flying off the ramp and not be totally ready to stop if you were crossing
cant remember where this is located
the original
  będzin poland
  just imagine trying to navigate as a pedestrian or cyclist  who fucking cares
  thats cool i always wondered if such a thing existed
  oh thats a cool overpass there arent any stairs to climb just the pavements smoothly rise up even the design of the overpass is itself beautiful unlike all these russian tubes
    most interesting    source  scroll down
mfw amerifats literally call this halfassed signalized traffic circle a hamburger intersection
  it is hot in those things during summer so hot that once one person just lost his consciousness in this thing and it was a challenge to get him down considering that elevators wasnt working and there were no slopes only stairs
  you have 2 options  actually contribute to the threads  go back to 
  whats the point of the loop they couldnt make the incline bigger it doesnt look like most of the loop is used for anything other than climbing
  it was a space concern iirc
  thank you ill update the picture name
  i have one like this near me wondered what made them pick this over other designs
  literally has spectators all around the edge watching the chaos unfold
  reminds me of this one in brisbane
  heres the road map
look upon my works ye mighty and despair
  im such an idiot and posted this   without realizing that your post is in cherry hill not even 3 miles away from this intersection    also /n/ behold the 76/295 interchange that has literally been under reconstruction for 10 years
enjoy
    kek the more i look at this the crazier it gets
  the 76/295 interchange that has literally been under reconstruction for 10 years  theres a lawsuit going on over the demolition of a historic building in that graveyard in the lower portion of your screenshot so itll probably take another ten years
  texas needs to be nuked
  with best regards    the bridge construction lobby
just south of downtown atlanta theres a small cemetery in the middle of a cloverleaf ramp to i75 the headstones represent slave graves from a plantation that was on the site but no ones sure about the number of people that could be buried thereone report says possibly a thousand the atlanta paper has a story about it from 2012 
  what is exactly the point of type c isnt that just a quarter of an atgrade cloverleaf
  its intended to eliminate the need for left turns
  its like the city planners played sim city 4 and couldnt figure out that highways can lead to other cities
  it is    a quarter   not every leftturn movement needs to this treatment space can be scarce
  god that shit is stupid are americans really too stupid to make a left turn safely
  if you would at least think about it many european and british street network has these kinds of intersection turn restriction that makes de facto jughandles a more pronounced analogy is the quadrant intersection
  now im imagining a long queue of left turning vehicles block itself and the entire intersection snakestyle in the type c
roundabouts are for cagers plebs this is now a trams bypassing roundabouts thread
all this tarmac is making me nauseous
  no they dont
  dont make me regret resurrecting this thread anons post your tram tracks in roundabouts
  rip sheffields old tram system
  
most expensive roundabout in the world still fills with cagers every morning its next to my university  two tram lines cross it  the ugly ass tower in the middle is abandoned and the fountains dont work anymore    valencia spain
is there anywhere in the world where a 3 level stacked roundabout has been distorted to fit onto 2 levels
  something from my city
  this looks like hell
parking on top of a shopping center and in the middle of its highway access roundabout
  tram w/ ads for cars wrapped on it    cager supremacy
  why does this look like a sim city screenshot
  better than retarded eurorotors      zagreb croatia
  there is a type c in a downriver detroit suburb as well as the oakland county offices in pontiac pure autism
/toronto/ thread  we need to keep this general going guys    post subwaysstreetcars buses roads trails bikes airports planes and anything else once its related to toronto
    i made a server where we can discuss transit and stuff if anyone is interested
  bro we got service every fuckin 2 minutes just get on the go  waiting at danforth for an hour because you missed the train by a minute    like what is metrolinx doing here is the 15 minute service actually happening because i havent experienced it at all in the handful of times ive taken the lakeshore east since it was implemented
  i believe they are going to try to implement 15 minute service on the line however there will be know meaningful change until electrification i believe the current plan is to toss some 6 car trains onto the line to increase service but they are diesel and diesel is shit for frequent service lines like i said dont expect anything meaningful until the line is electrified whenever that is
i made something
guess what just turn one years old and makes cagers rage
  dabs on all the cagers
somewhere near toronto i assume
  those are still rookie numbers boy gotta pump them numbers up
yus subway operator here    ask me questions
  how many people did you run over last week
  ill be mad if this doesnt go through
  fuck doug ford to be honest
we need that relief line built after the crosstown lrt is completed    until then i use my bike to get myself from home to work and anywhere else distance isnt ever a problem regardless of weather or temperature
    say goodbye to that high speed rail my dudes
  thats not even half of it they also announced the subway take over will allow them to expand the subway deeper into peel york and durham apparently go doesnt exist to these people i dont know how anyone could have expected anything different from the conservatives
  why does toronto have so many delays and stops on its subway compared to other cities i live in montreal and theres almost never a stop or delay with its trains but growing up in toronto almost every day taking the yu line id experience a delay or stop
  lazy incompetent unionized ttc workers who need to justify their jobs
  montreals subway could fit in my backyard bucko
tell me about the streetcars  why are they so based
  montréal and toronto have a similar number of km and stations and both transport over a million people a day not sure what youre tryna say bro
  operationally speaking theyre a fucking nightmare    aesthetically and experiencially speaking theyre classic and beautiful
ford uploading the subway good thing or bad thing are we just gonna get suburb subways now is relief line toast
  the highspeed rail was a liberal vote grab was completely unfeasible
  in oakville during the day we have 3 trains an hour now its pretty nice and soon it will be 4 trains an hour
  based jane jacobs saved them from the tory bus monster in the battle of 1972
  are we just gonna get suburb subways now   i think ford has already made that abundantly clear hell ford was even asked what about go rer since it would serve the suburbs with electrified service every 1015 minute his answer i kid you not was there not subways as for the drl who knows the environmental assessment is done so literally all that is missing now is money to build it
dude smart track
  are any extra go stations even being built under that brand
  lrc locos from the 80s still manage to look decades more modern than the massive freightlike engines we use across the board now
  via is currently in the market for new trains and all signs point to them having picked the siemens charger however it will be the standard version and not the ones used on brightline since i dont think you can strap a snow plow to them
  no literally absolutely nothing is being done with smart track and no one even gives a fuck because it was such a shitty idea in the first place
why are go busses so comfy
  whenever im standing or walking on the top floor of one of those things i have to bend my head 90 down just to fit
  the relief line is never going to be constructed the heat death of the universe will happen sooner
  tfw they have begun reinstalling the lights at yorkdale
  based and rainbowpilled
  i really want that subway i also want the sheppard line to be finished its incompleteness triggers me     or why doesnt the ttc operate trains from don mills to union station/ vaughan    during rush hour bypass sheppard yonge station and use the wye to get traffic downtown maybe relief some conjestion
went through pape station for the first time in forever the other day i was particularly struck by how clean and aesthetic it looks one of my favourite stations i think
instead of building parallel roads lets just add more and more lanes to this one existing freeway so that if one truck rolls over the entire city is shut down for 6 hours  lets build just one parallel freeway then sell it to a private operator with no restriction on how much they can jack up the price literally costs 5431 to drive 108 km one way    is there a city with worse transportation planning than toronto i think even bangladesh has better planned transportation than gta at this point
  you really cant fault the city for that since highways except the gardiner and dvp fall under the provinces mandate the city is no angel but the province since the 90s has been anything but helpful
why arent subways autonomous
  still using old technology once the system is converted to atc then we can talk about automation even then it wont be an easy sell because the public is filled with morons and the union wants to keep jobs line 3 is the only line that can be full automated however it isnt because the union put up a stink in the 80s and the public was afraid of trains without drivers
  im afraid of trains with drivers skytrain in van is flawless
  ttc union employees want to hold onto their redundant jobs
  we should outsource the staff
  perhaps doug ford will just hand over the entire gta public transportation to veolia
back by popular demand itt we discuss the greatest electrified railroad operation in world history the proven corporate conspiracy to dismantle and abandon this operation largely perpetrated from within the company itself by its own toplevel officials is one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever conceived and makes the great american streetcar scandal look like amateurish in comparison     gone before its time but not forgotten the milwaukee roads pacific coast extension lives on in the minds of all who encounter it this thread is dedicated to the men and women who built and maintained this system and the photographers who filmed and preserved this unique operation for posterity
some relevant background info to share before we get into the good stuff
its important to note that some of the railroads electric boxcab motors pictured dated from the beginning of electrified operations in the 1910s and lasted until the end of electrification in 1974 a continuous mainline service record of over 50 years i dare you to find a diesel that can beat that
pictured little joes right and boxcabs together in 1973
little joes chicago north shore also owned several of these nicknamed because they were originally ordered by the soviet union unable to be shipped there when completed by ge after the cold war heated up as a result a dozen of them were sold to milwaukee road
the milwaukee road had offered to buy all twenty plus the spare parts inventory for 1 million little more than scrap valuean offer which ge accepted however the milwaukees board of directors would not release the money1 after the start of the korean war the milwaukee needed more locomotives on their electrified mainline and was also beset by a coal strike which necessitated sending most diesels back east milwaukee lines east steam engines still burned coal unlike lines west steamers which were oilburning the board of directors returned to ge only to discover that eight locomotives and all the spare parts had been sold and that the price for the remaining twelve locomotives was 1 million1 of the eight sold three had gone to the chicago south shore and south bend railroad the south shore line and five to the companhia paulista de estradas de ferro of brazil    top management was already incompetent by the 1950s it seems
im done dumping for awhile hope you enjoy
  beautiful photos thank you very much
  they werent incompetent they were corrupt
  true had a momentary lapse of judgment by calling top management merely incompetent
never forget what was taken from us
    amen brother    spare a moment of your time to also remember cousins lost in the other side of the atlantic        sheffield must be the largest city on the planet to have had electrified trains and then have them ripped up on purple and not due to an act of war or natural disaster
i get that it was corporate sabotage but im still not entirely understanding motive
  by popular demand nobody was asking for this     trains are fucking horrible just went to montréal on a via rail train and it took 6 hours because of an hour delay this caused me to miss my next train meaning i missed the last buses in my home town i had to walk 7 kilometres at midnight i got home at 3 am what shouldve taken 78 hours was a 15 hour odyssey hungover as fuck too which made it all the more miserable not to mention the dumb kid kicking my seat the entire time the first time on my way there was decent though talked to a cool guy from japan
  thanks for the link britain really started going to shit in the 1970s didnt it then again so did the us      infiltration of topranks by bnassociated men who wanted to eliminate their only competition in the pnw aside from that greedy corporate shareholders wanted to divorce the railroads vast and valuable land and timber holdings from the railroad itself the easiest way to do that was to drive the road into bankruptcy and the easiest way to do that without it being blatant was to deelectrify neglect and eventually abandon the most profitable stretch of track the railroad owned     just read the image here  its all covered       by popular demand    i meant someone else on this board asked about a thread like this and no one cares about your degenerate drinking stories buddy take it up with the canadian government youve got a lot bigger problems to deal with up there than delayed trains
    sorry meant to link here 
  i actually miss your rampant shit posting of every thread with milw posts about 3 years ago especially now that i have an appreciation for second generation diesels  these photos are a real time capsule thank you milw shitposter  dont ever stop
  milwaukee road discussion is always in demand here there once was a time this board was not filled with lycra wearing manchildren riding pushbikes        sit back and watch the glory
    thank you for the support gentlemen im glad the milw truthposting had a lasting effect together we can make /n/ great again one little joe and boxcab at a time     and thanks for the great video reminds me that i made several milw webms ripped from a dvd i bought featuring the road making these is one of those skills you learn and then quicklyforget through lack of practice hope you enjoy these might be familiar to some of you but it also might be like seeing them for the first time
  and youre right about the diesel aspect milw was truly one of a kind in having electric locomotives seamlessly mud to diesels in their trains milw little joes  sd45s  godtier combo
  i find that idea pretty farfetched
  you are entitled to your opinion the important thing is to realize that you are wrong
  in other words it wasnt a cabal of bn personnel infiltrating the milwaukee road nor greedy shareholders forcing a selloff of valuable timber    the railroad neglected its own assets and suffered insurmountable longrun losses as a result just like the rock island and penn central got it
  fyi rob_l rob leachman on trainorders was an officer in up during the whole time this was going down in the 1970s and later became a transportation economics professor at uc berkeley i dare you to find a more credible source backing your position that its a conspiracy theory instead of a conspiracy fact
  in 1966 quinn left the milwaukee road to become president of the chicago burlington  quincy railroad in 1970 the railroad merged with three other lines based in the pacific northwest to form the burlington northern railroad and quinn was named the burlington northerns vice chairman    quinn returned in 1970 to his former employer the milwaukee road as its chairman one of his noteworthy actions was his 1972 decision to discontinue the electrification of the milwaukee roads lines in the pacific northwest and to sell the copper wires above those tracks and shift to diesel locomotives on those lines         umm try again sweetie
  youre taking this awfully personally      in other words he did what corporate executives in most industries do hop around from one company to another including competitors electrification didnt make sense in an era of cheap fuel    might be easier for me to believe there was a huge conspiracy to bankrupt the milw if it was the only one that went bankrupt during that time but its far more credible that market forces pushed them out this was a time of significant contraction in the railroad industry and like a handful of other railroads the milwaukee road was left without a chair when the music stopped
  youre taking this awfully personally  not really you seem oddly personally invested in an argument where you are bringing no actual evidence to support your position in the face of concrete evidence to the contrary     in other words he did what corporate executives in most industries do hop around from one company to another including competitors  yes its extremely common for a chief executive to hop into the management of his previous employers main rival and gut their most valuable asset happens all the time     electrification didnt make sense in an era of cheap fuel  yes the 1970s is a decade notorious for its cheap petroleum fuels keep in mind that the decision to deelectrify was made in 1972 was forcibly postponed due to the 1973 opec embargo and then it was still undertaken in spring of 1974 under quinns management really makes you think     might be easier for me to believe there was a huge conspiracy to bankrupt the milw if it was the only one that went bankrupt during that time but its far more credible that market forces pushed them out this was a time of significant contraction in the railroad industry and like a handful of other railroads the milwaukee road was left without a chair when the music stopped  you dont even know anything about the system and still make these claims the profitable part of the system was the electrified stretch out west the moneylosers were all the redundant lines in the cornbelt of the midwest pic related and yet at the end of the day the profitable portion was abandoned to maintain the midwestern moneypits those derailments referenced were entirely due to the poor experimental use of locotrol distributed power btw the actual physical plant was fine up to that point     just frustrated by your complete lack of argument backed by anything but conjecture about the failure of pc and ri that occurred around the same time despite much different circumstances between all of them
  anyway i think ive proved my case sufficiently so lets get back to posting awesome pics and videos im sure even you must agree that it was a pretty neat operation they had going for awhile
no hard feelings btw 
  not really  wall o text     its extremely common for a chief executive to hop into the management of his previous employers main rival  it is actually    the 1970s is a decade notorious for its cheap petroleum fuels  it was except for brief periods of opec embargoes    just frustrated by your complete lack of argument  industry contraction is a sound and legitimate argument conspiracies predicated upon hindsight and secondhand sources arent      anyway i think ive proved my case sufficiently  you havent otherwise id be convinced youre right and im not
  whatever its pretty obviously a waste of time arguing with a bad faith brainlet who doesnt even read the evidence provided why are you even in this thread if you are just gonna be a basic bitch corporate apologist not worth the wasted time and effort you have refuted nothing and bring nothing of interest
electrified circus train july 4 1973
  a different circus train from 1970
  hmu when you can substantiate your conspiracy theory
  those wooden poles those rails very poorly seated in wooden sleepers and deep in soil without stones  i would guess it is a colourised picture from 19th cetury if it wasnt for the electric traction really looks weirdly fascinating and super poor at the same time like it makes you realize why they abandoned it
  i would guess it is a colourised picture from 19th cetury if it wasnt for the electric traction really looks weirdly fascinating and super poor at the same time like it makes you realize why they abandoned it    i get that and one issue was that milw management had been trying to merge into another line since the mid1960s first up and then ri if i remember correctly and accordingly almost religiously deferred maintenance from that point onward so it was clearly a corporate policy to defer maintenance and this was true across the whole system    however in 1972 ge and several times earlier offered a very generous proposal to modernize the entire electrified sections and construct 200 new miles of electrified rail with very attractive financing they were directly competing for locomotive sales with emd milw was buying sd40s in large quantities at the time so there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the proposal the fact that this proposal was rejected demonstrates that it wasnt simply mere market conditions that determined the fate of the electrified sections corporate decisions at the top sealed the fate of the line by design     there are multiple documents dealing with these studies here      pic related has the fuller story there were multiple points at which electrification could have been expanded and improved and top management rejected them every time despite the recommendations of superintendents and engineers on the ground they had made their mind up to sink the system and nothing would change their mind about the ultimate outcome
  the fact that this proposal was rejected demonstrates that it wasnt simply mere market conditions that determined the fate of the electrified sections corporate decisions at the top sealed the fate of the line by design  pure speculation you just said maintenance was being deferred and the milw was buying new diesels from emd thats why they ended electrificationto trim costs no one else in the us was expanding their electrified lines and no new electrified lines had been constructed in many years on mainlines some had already been removed
  thats why they ended electrificationto trim costs  that makes zero sense the whole downside of electrification is high capital costs electrification has much lower recurring costs than diesel on any line that sees a modicum of use
  so it doesnt cost anything to maintain you dont have to buy electricity for it and you dont need to purchase locomotives for it that cant run anywhere else on the system
ah its good to see milwposting back again
  thanks fren glad you enjoy havent done this in years been too busy still am really so nice to see some people from past days who appreciate the effort
never to be seen again three little joes together on a high bridge traversing the rockies only the first two are powered however
this dog knows whats up
during the early part of 1974 the rumors became official  that the milwaukee road would terminate all electric operations countless railfans made impromptu pilgrimages covering many many miles all the while enduring the bleakness knowing that the shots they took would be irreplaceable the winter solstice and monochromatic weather simply added to the melancholy spring finally did come with better weather but the prognosis was as grim as every second that ticked off a clock come the month of june that clock struck twelve     my vacation plans were prearranged for august when we finally arrived at deer lodge we felt like latecomers to a graveside service the passenger joes e20 and e21 were parked up near the roundhouse along with the old ge steeple cab switchers all was eerily quiet the pans lowered but where were the rest of their rostermates     a drive down to the opposite end of the yard revealed the gutchecking view that was brutally hard to take to think we missed by mere months oh what might have been we stood in silent reverence  of these unique brutes of tonnage mastery a single photograph to bear witness to recall what their decades of faithful service meant to the bottom line let alone the people that were employed  specifically  to make sure they were in as good of shape as the day they left ge now stripped of their tilted rectangular iconic heralds one needed no further proof of the transient nature of everything on this planet     yes 1974 and now thirtysix years ago thank god for all who painstakingly persevered in documenting the halcyon days of what it all meant and especially to one richard steinheimer through the collective of their imagery the memories will never die
  god these guys make penn central look like it was wellmanaged i mean at least the people at pc actually tried to run a railroad the milwaukee people were either inordinately stupid or actively malicious  i mean their employees fucking knew they could do a better job and tried to buy it off them  and they still wouldnt do it  my guess it was a failed asset strip some bigwig probably bought into the trains are obsolete meme and wanted to get at the land without actually keeping the railroad
  much lower recurring costs  but anon electrification still costs money  yeah thats why i said much lower recurring costs
  memeing a chronically moneyhemorrhaging railway company this hard    kys
  the cost of maintaining buying power for and buying locomotives for the electrification system is higher than simply not having an electric system thats the decision executives faced and it was a pretty easy one to make at a time when growth was stagnant
  the milwaukee people were either inordinately stupid or actively malicious  a little bit of both more of the latter     my guess it was a failed asset strip some bigwig probably bought into the trains are obsolete meme and wanted to get at the land without actually keeping the railroad  this seems to be the case based on an actual understanding of the system and its politics although it was in the end a successful asset strip since they eventually sold their trees fro nearly 200 after the final bankruptcy well top management profited at least thousands of employees lost their jobs and dozens of communities permanently lost their rail connection to the outside world     after the bn merger milwaukee road lines west traffic more than doubled in three years rising to four trains each way by october 1973 even five when the grain rush was on during this 3year period the revenue growth rate for the milwaukee road system exceeded that of union pacific and all other class is nonetheless the overall financial situation of milwaukee road deteriorated because of declining traffic on its shorthaul fixedcost lines east network
  nearly 200 million
you are so asshurt the milw went out of business because it was the weakest link in the chain youre memeing excuses and hawking conspiracies
  although it was in the end a successful asset strip  not really i dont think they wanted to kill the railroad i mean i doubt they lost much sleep over it but they wouldve liked to get some money from selling that too probably the reason they were constantly trying to merge    they didnt care about the railroad and managed it like idiots but its uncharacteristic of businessmen to not try and sell as much stuff as they can as far as asset strips go ive seen far more successful ones
its kind of funny reading about the milwaukee road knowing about the florida east coast railway for those of you not familiar with the fec it basically had the polar opposite of the milwaukee road happen to it in the 70s place was run like shit back then the profitable mainline was being neglected in favor of the moneylosing branches the unions were operating diesels with 5 people and the track was deteriorating so badly that it would be uneconomical to repair in a few years    guy named ed ball came in and actually realized the railroad was going to die for good in a few years if nothing changed even though it had all the right ingredients for profitability he did a lot of reforms but the biggest fight came when he pissed off the unions    the unions wanted a pay raise normally theres nothing wrong with this but their business was dying around them ed ball said they couldnt afford a raise the unions went on strike it was a fucking nasty one there were actual bombings ed ball brought in scabs and got rid of the 5 workers per train policy reducing it to two he installed concrete ties automatic train control and cab signals he abandoned the moneylosing passenger service and the old branch lines took 10 years before the old fec crew gave up striking and the sabotage and bombings stopped but by the end the fec posted its first profit in years today still exists and is running an actual private passenger train service    how does this relate to the milwaukee well the fec people werent railroad people either they didnt much care for the industry and they really were more interested in the real estate unlike the milwaukee people they werent stupid and actually turned their moneylosing railway into a profitable asset thus proving how fucking incompetent the milwaukees management team was
  the unions were operating diesels with 5 people  5 man crews were the norm at all railroads until 1985
  interesting thanks for sharing milwaukee roads criminal corrupt and incompetent management cannot be understated but unlike fec most of the people on the ground were true believers in electrification and fought their hardest to keep it running smoothly and turning a profit despite all the setbacks and attempts to undermine it that management through at it they knew their livelihoods were at stake and so fought as though their lives depended on it they gave a valiant effort and deserve to be remembered for their sacrifices and struggles    on the rock mountain division the freight motors boxcabs did not go down without a fight but keeping them running was difficult in 1972 the mood of deer lodge shop foreman ralph hagemo was optimistic but worried  they told me that they are going to have some new motors for me if i can just keep these things running a few more years he said if the electrics go this shop will be closed and well all be out of work as long as i have anything to do with it these things are going to run until they cant turn another wheel    pic related these things were built in 1916 and when the last ones stopped operating with the end of electrification in 1974 they had served continuously for 58 years     even the diesel proponents had to admit they were superior runners as one prodiesel tacoma shop foreman noted in 1970  theyre worn out and theyre slow but ill give them one thing they can pull anything you can put behind them you cant overload them they just run slower if you overload a diesel youll burn up the traction motors
  but unlike fec most of the people on the ground were true believers in electrification and fought their hardest to keep it running smoothly and turning a profit  right they are different situations the fec had employees that didnt realize their demands would kill the railroad the milwaukee employees knew exactly how shitty a situation they were in and were trying desperately to fix it    i find it kinda ironic in a sad way
  yeah but the fec was an early adopter for better or for worse pretty much all moden railroad laborsaving practices were done there first they were the first class i they were the smallest class i at the time theyre the largest class ii today to go to two person train operation and abolish the 100 mile rule
  milwaukee roads criminal corrupt management  unsubstantiated
does anyone remember driving the averydrexel route in trs 2010 damn that was comfy
milw depot at beverly wa october 1971
  fortunately the hope valley line is getting electrified soon  its the same with a lot of other closures that should never have happened like the great central and varsity lines    the great central couldve been a hugely important link and possibly the first uk highspeed line  gcr starts up north between manchester/immingham  build london extension  infrastructure all built to very high standards low gradients room to expand  be renowned for fast running  profitable  boundary change by br to midland region  duplicates midland mainline  gcr/midland  lner/lms were rivals  top brass itching for excuses to close it  beeching cuts  closed land sold  talk about hs2 branch to sheffield     utter madness to do the same thing now would require billions and involve the destruction of thousands of homes but the line was already ready to go
  the unions wanted a pay raise normally theres nothing wrong with this but their business was dying around them ed ball said they couldnt afford a raise the unions went on strike it was a fucking nasty one there were actual bombings ed ball brought in scabs and got rid of the 5 workers per train policy reducing it to two  this shit really pisses me off im generally a believer in unions and think that overall theyve done a lot more good than harm in the history of industry and employment and doing shit like that just ruins the credibility of unions gives ammo to the unionbusters and their political allies and fucks over every decent union worker in the country
  every time a union wants a wage increase its met with resistance and disdain and is usually hard won even when business is good railroads fight every step of the way to avoid wage increases
  because the railroads want to increase their profit margins for shareholder dividends and/or reinvestment in the business
  no shit
  greatest electrified railroad operation in world history  why do you burgers always exaggerate shit like its the hurr greatest in the world and durr bestest ever ever jfc  ffs theres a shitload of other electrified railroad operations more impressive than that for example the 9000 km transsiberian railway
  9000 km    why do euros love to inflate numbers by using the metric system
  youre fucking retarded
  fuck the hyperbole the milw didnt have the longest electrified mainline in the world but it was the best chance at north american transcontinental electrified railroad  less optimistically it was the last hope for large scale electrified freight transport by rail in north america
  the milw was cool af it just irks me when things in burgerland are randomly branded as the greatest in the world  t autismo
  most of the time yeah but in that particular instance it wouldve killed the company im serious wed be talking about the fec as yet another fallen flag just like the milwaukee road  people still didnt realize the days where railroads could charge whatever they wanted and still rake in business were over and they werent coming back
  but in that particular instance it wouldve killed the company    good
  wouldve put thousands of workers out of their jobs  wouldve lead to the destruction/abandonment of a perfectly good rail corridor  wouldve lead to more trucks on the highway  good
    wouldve put thousands of workers out of their jobs  unprecedented    wouldve lead to the destruction/abandonment of a perfectly good rail corridor  more likely another railroad would have bought it    wouldve lead to more trucks on the highway  debatable    good  i stand by my assertion
  more likely another railroad would have bought it  in the 70s no way the big guys were barely solvent  they were shedding track like nobodys business  even good lines that could be profitable  the freight railroads are desperately trying to undo that nowdays unfortunately its a lot easier and cheaper to rip up tracks than to lay em down
  southeastern carriers werent as bad off on the whole as midwestern and western carriers the southern certainly wasnt    nobody wouldve bought the only route into south florida at a fire sale price    maybe but it seems more likely they would have if the fec had gone under and been ripped out for good it wouldnt be a big deal one way or the other
  its not the only route theres the exseaboard route which while not nearly as good of a routing as the fecs would be enough for the demand at the time
  fair enough
will be a great read
    required reading for the entire human race
utilitarian is an understatement even the windshield wiper was a bent wire operated by hand from the inside by the crewman sitting right behind it some got air wipers but not all you can see the cab air conditioning was full on heat had one output which was on or off line voltage to the grids perhaps it was ok when line voltage was 3000 v but it would cook you out when that was raised to 3300 and 3600 v that steel seen below the engineers window also formed the inside wall insulation was deemed by management as unnecessary which probably saved us all from asbestos injuries     trips on the pelicans were fond memories
  there are people who benefit from desecrated efficiency as it gives them more work to do  further up the chain does not make much sense as im sure petroleum companys will have investment in other sectors of energy production it would be stupid not to
just imagine a fleet of these on the milw
    some tragic footage of the pacific extension in the late 1970s after deelectrification the track really deteriorated after the wires were pulled down by design to get rid of the pacific extension entirely the entire route from washington to montana was finally abandoned in 1980
please let your thread die instead of bumping it once every week or two
  fuck off

has anyone here ever completely repainted a frame is it worth the hassle i have a pretty nice chromoly univega that i want to do up in some kind of artistic paint job
  whether its worth the hassle depends entirely on your need to personalize your belongings but keep in mind that if youve never done it before its highly unlikely that youll get it to be anywhere near a durable as the factory paint
steel and alu frames are easier to do than carbon  you can paint basically whatever you want so long as you prime them with an appropriate primer id also get a pro shop to do a clearcoat over the top preferably something hard wearing
yes but i was making a rattlecan/paintbrush sleeper so the nogs are less likely to steal my baby
  i have a pretty nice chromoly univega  a single color powdercoat might be a good investment but a fullon custom paint job is probably not worth it
  the nogs are less likely to steal my baby  i know this feel well i bike to my local library once in a while and those guys just camp out front hoping to snag anything thats not bolted down theyll even steal quick release skewers from wheels so i have an old hiten bike boom beater that i ride there now
  paint it with spray on bed liner paint or chalkboard paint      something memey if you are going to destroy the patina of an old bike at least be obnoxious about it    i bet you strip and refinish antique furniture you absolute monster
  chalkboard paint  that is the most hipster zoomer shit ive ever heard of and its going to sell like hotcakes in my college town thanks for the idea
  theres an old hippie who did it to his old ford 150 and he just has a pack of chalk in his bed got to admit it looks pretty rad kids in the neighborhood draw on it
  just my own personal 002 worth op    aesthetically speaking id think that if youre a legit track racer and do well at it ie youve upgraded past the novice level that a custom artistic paint job on your track bike would be kinda coollooking    similarly if youre a hipster the other hipsters might appreciate custom paint on you fixie  however in that case you cant get away from the fact that many people would consider it at least as pretentious as being a hipster on a fixie is anyway but if it was really good looking then it could carry itself on its own merits    on a regular dropbar road bike not so much would look cheesy and tryhard flatbar road bike even more so mountain bike especially if you rarely ride offroad doubly so  on the other hand if you have an old classic steel bike with fading finish on it and/or rust that needs to be addressed a tastefully done paint job on it would look classy if its a classic frameset and you go to the trouble of doing a replica paint job of the original thats classy too if its done well
old thread 404d a while ago figured id start a new one post all of your modeling pictures creations purchases layouts tips etc
  more weathering on the locos and this would be hard to distinguish from real life nice job      eventually when i have the room i want to make a northeast corridor set i already have the bachmann acela that i got awhile ago
  this is indeed a vague reference       nice when i have the room and time id love to build a small layout featuring locations from the ca central valley i already have quite a bit of relevant wp and sp rolling stock and even did some minor modeling to make an sn switcher
    bn  patrician taste      i wish i could have seen those roll through with the santa fe and bn had to settle for southern running long hood forward at least i got to wave to the guys in the caboose
  you have me curious where are these from did you make them yourself
  is that a motherfucking incredibles reference
are model trains the most white male boomer hobby to ever exist i dont see it lasting much longer just look at the demographics of this convention     
tfw no n scale milwaukee road little joes    feels bad man kato please make these
  early bn 19701975 is a great era to model with all the different predecessor paint schemes running around together and through trains with wp and even some leased locomotives from sp i have quite a bit of early bn rolling stock just no layout unfortunately i have a bn f45 whats funny is that bn used an f45 model on the cover of one of its annual reports
one of the crown jewels of my collection    the power axles are in the restaurant car
  is it the athearn genesis model i have it and its pretty dope comes with a speaker and everything
  its athearns n scale version just a dc one im not a fan of the extra costs of dcc and sound and dont really need those features since my layout is just temporary loops of kato unitrack i also have some milw fp45s great models theyre all in storage currently though otherwise i would share pics
  i used to go to the hobbytown usa near me and the boomers who worked there were dickheads id be standing by the counter trying to get one guys attention forever and hed ignore me or go help some boomer who came after me another time i asked a guy where something was and he rolled his eyes and exhaled sharply like it wasnt his fucking job maybe they like to keep it a boomeronly hobby
    actually just looked through my old pics and i found these that i took several years ago posed with the relevant annual reports
  yes    future generations will have significantly less disposable income than the boomers ever had i foresee a major contraction coming within the hobby once boomers really die out younger generations didnt grow up with passenger trains/steam engines like the boomers did and simply arent into trains
    those are some nice pieces where did you get the annual reports
  speaking as someone born in 1990 one major issue is that modern passenger and freight operations are very uninteresting to me at least all you ever see across the us are the same 4 or 5 modern ge and emd locomotive models in uninspired paint schemes pulling monotonous units trains or bland passenger cars and in any given region youll likely only see one or two class is on the road bnsf and up in the west this is why i focus my modeling and railroading interests on the 1960s and 1970s take bn for instance on that road a lone you could see four different predecessor paint schemes even more importantly there was a wide variety of locomotives and rolling stock 20 year old alcos alongside brand new sds on the mainline with everything from 40 foot boxcars to large cylindrical grain hoppers in tow passenger rail even in the early amtrak period was almost as diverse lots of interesting shit passing by on the rails everyday always something new to look out for nowadays its exciting to see an sd402 on the rails youll never see a 4axle geep in mainline service today    in addition to the modern railroad landscape being boring model manufacturers add to this problem by focusing much of their efforts on modern 1990s locomotives and operators as a result the period that would actually be interesting to many consumers is neglected in favor of modern shit that has oversaturated the market even newcomers like scale trains focus mostly on modern shit so the problem is both changing demographics and poor market decisions by model manufacturers     pic related this is the kind of shit that would get young people interested in model trains imo
  thanks they are great runners i got the annual reports from ebay about 5 years ago for pretty cheap a few bucks each usually it might be harder to find them nowadays you can see part of a bn system map in the pic also from ebay it dates from about 1971 iirc     pic related is from gns 1967 report
some poorly lit penn central action from years ago
and some milwaukee road note the telegraph poles thats about as detailed as i get that is until i have the time money and space for a proper layout
  neat is that a french train
  its a spanish ave high speed train out of my whole collection it has the smoothest acceleration i also have west german trains from the 50s american trains from the 70s and 90s and this slovakian 754 which is my favorite    god i would love to have that as a poster the design is so crisp
      is it depressing that i remember you posting these before it was probably 4 years ago i do love the annual reports now you have posted the milwaukee road one i think its time for another 200 reply post about its closure
  have you considered treating retail workers like shit
  is it depressing that i remember you posting these before it was probably 4 years ago  we are here forever friend not quite as active here as i was back then though the blw thread is the last remnant of that earlier period of /n/   now you have posted the milwaukee road one i think its time for another 200 reply post about its closure  its always time for such a thread
  yeah i get that thats a big reason why railfanning itself is dying imo same old shit everywhere you go    i dont understand building a layout prototypical to modern railroading 2000present there is just nothing exciting about it when i watch videos of people running dozens of ho scale aluminum coal hoppers i just think why this is lame as hell    i also see cost as a significant problem with the industry its not uncommon for locos to be 200 and up no new dummies are being made railcars used to be dirt cheap granted you had to build and detail them yourself but that really wasnt a big deal like i said younger generations wont have the disposable income to be spending that much cash on model trains i wonder if were already at the crest of the wave    as a sidenote i expect future locomotives to look even more similar to each other than they do now for example emd stopped using the teardrop windscreens on their early sd70s so they could fit the same sized glass thats used by ge units i think more interchangeability will mean locomotives that dont look very distinct from one another even compared to today
  i also see cost as a significant problem with the industry its not uncommon for locos to be 200 and up no new dummies are being made railcars used to be dirt cheap granted you had to build and detail them yourself but that really wasnt a big deal like i said younger generations wont have the disposable income to be spending that much cash on model trains i wonder if were already at the crest of the wave    true i forgot about the significant barrier for entry into the hobby cost per unit has been one of the reasons i stick with dc versions of locomotives the upfront cost of entering the hobby as a kid with no prior equipment can be upwards of 500 if buying new track a nice locomotive rolling stock and dcc equipment compare that with the cost of a game console or even the prices charged for pc train sim models and paint schemes along with the other issues already mentioned and it is obvious why new blood is not entering the hobby
to anyone who is new to the hobby    do not become a rivet counter beware otherwise youll end up being like me looking for brass models because most plastic locos that arent diesel dont even have a comparable amount of detail    get out while you still can
  i dont have the money to even consider getting into the brass market
    you have hit the nail on the head the model railway industry is living on borrowed time even second hand stuff in oo goes for silly money here in the uk if i was working for someone like hornby or bachmann and that was paying my mortgage id be worried long term the only new products they are bothered about flogging are 500 locos for boomers to blow their final salary pension on     as soon as god catches up with their entire customer base they are fucked
  yeah theres definitely not a viable market for this stuff in the future but as i said before a big part of the problem is that model manufacturers are wasting time and money on modern bullshit instead of delivering less expensive and more common models that they already have the molds for and that have more broad appeal take kato for example one of the few model companies i see remaining profitable due to their domination of the japan market they are releasing a model of this monstrosity this year not only that but broadway limited and fox valley models are also releasing a version of this ugly unit     meanwhile kato has great models of f units sw switchers sd402s sd45s u boats etc locomotives that were produced in the thousands in dozens of different paint schemes and yet they havent released new schemes of them in years or if they have very limited runs of 3 or 4 different schemes why they should be running these models continuously in a wide variety of schemes i guarantee they would make profits on every run and these are cheap units too averaging around 7080 apiece this is the kind of shitty business decision making that drives people away from new models and forces them to buy old runs on the secondhand market these manufacturers are shooting themselves in the foot and then have the audacity to blame the consumers for not buying modern shit that no one actually wants
  unless someone finds a cure for autism there will always be rail fans
  ironically at least the uk offers a rich contemporary rail environment to model relative to us rail with all the various different diesel and electric railcars out there in all those cool eclectic postprivatization liveries not to mention all the legacy br hardware like the 125s and 225s    the problem with english rail modeling is that hornby and bachmann should be going the kato/tomix route and autistically churning out every single railcar variety of the past 40 years so that the young railfan of today can model a south london suburban layout with the gatwick express class 377s and old networkers or model southern scottish service with virgin pendolinos scotrail 380s and the odd first transpennine class 185 or model merseyrail or model the east midlands etc etc etc but instead they keep cranking out legacy steam because all the boomers want to do is model the 1930s its the exact opposite of the us model railroading industry problem and its every bit as shitty    im an american btw
i attempted some light weathering on one of my locos after i in my opinion messed up repainting the smokebox though now looking at it it kinda looks like its been burnt a bit maybe let me know what you all think
is hon3 a solution to limited space
  depends same scale as ho but you can get tighter curves so if you want a loop or something maybe why not just n
  looks fine to me nice model what locomotive is that        like the other guy said just do n if you try to do hon3 your options are limited to industrial logging mining and narrow gauge roads theres not a big market for those specialized locomotives and rolling stock with n you get nearly all the same benefits of product variety and availability that ho has with the added bonus of being able to fit more action in less space n scales market share has increased dramatically in the last decade or so lots of new models from major manufacturers coming out all the time
  seems like autismos just channel their autism video games now
  cheers its a hornby d16/3 good runner  its my favorite locomotive shame none survive
  tfw want to do a nn3 layout but there is almost zero support for it
  see if you can open it up and disconnect or snip the wires to the speaker if you dont mind not having sound again
  i channel my autism into train simulator
  i can see those sticking around in the future
  427
  you could say the same for stamp collecting largely obsolete and probably coin collecting too
  they better drop the current dlc model and stop releasing a 2009 game every single year with the title of that year    the only coins worth collecting are silver eagles anyway
  427    but why would you pay over 400 for a bachmann starter set
  especially one where the passenger cars have those shitty silhouettes in the windows instead of a detailed interior    seriously  dont do it
        buy yourself a /comfy/ hornby 00 starter set of some classic english prototype like pic related and use an outlet adapter
  why not just n    your options are limited to industrial logging mining  was thinking of a small mountain type layout and found out about some of the bc narrow gauge railways thinking of something loosely based on the kaslo and slocan railway  1/2
2/2  this was a silver rush railway in the kootenays
rip ithaqua         f
  poor bastard  couldnt take a focused picture for shit but he contributed and didnt deserve all the shit he took
  he seemed like a genuinely good guy and he actually posted oc instead of the shitposters who contribute nothing but vitriol and to his credit he always took the unwarranted abuse in good humor i find it pretty funny that he worked at the national review i wonder if he ever met armond white
  its always going to be dominated by retirees because they have the time and money to spend on the hobby
  neat years ago i saw some guy who modelled a portion of that line in ho circa 1955 after it was standard gauged by the cpr it was basically a little shelf layout he could run an alco s4 around    i knew one person who models in hon3 and he did the white pass  yukon        i just stumbled on some 2 x 3 sheets of 1/4 cork at work im thinking of using it on top of that foam board they use as insulation is this worthwhile or should i just glue the track down on the foamboard instead
  boomer yes but ive encountered a surprisingly large number of black model railroaders     also my theory as to why is that trains these days are simply a lot less interesting than they were in the boomers days when they were kids they got to watch steam locos working and there was a huge variety of railroads with interesting paint schemes unique locos exciting luxurious passenger services specialized freight cars etc contrast that to anybody under 40 or so and all weve ever known were endless strings of intermodal containers hauled by nearly identical diesel locos from whichever single railroad was dominant in our region and shitty amtrak passenger trains that hardly anybody uses maybe if youre lucky youve got a local commuter service     i think thats also why model railroading is still much more popular in europe the average european kid is much more likely to grow up riding trains occasionally their trains themselves are a lot more interesting and family trips often involve taking a train to other eu countries and seeing whole different sets of rolling stock
    sup fellers    ive got a bunch of vintage athearn ho scale kits from the early and mid1990s my parents used to buy me i found them in the attic now and was curious if these things are worth any money or have any collectible value    mostly new i tried to assemble the rails on 1 of them and failed
  looks great anon
tfw ive always to do a uk based narrow gauge layout  no money or skills to make it happen  it hurts bros
  i know that feel i really want to do a line based on wwiiera los angeles running from the lockheed factory in burbank past grand central airport and through the taylor yard through downtown with union station off to the side and then down the alameda corridor with various wartime factories along the way and finally ending at the harbor in san pedro/long beach theres so many opportunities for a cool layout there with tons of interesting art deco and mission revival architecture along the way and lots of chances to put cool /k/ shit in the layout along with the /n/ shit but itd be so much time money and space
  if theyre in blue boxes theyre worth about 5 each if they are in yellow boxes or have some cool paint schemes they can be more
what are your guys thoughts about trains like these
  literally fantastic
  stacks of ready to run and kits available  really simple scenery  its money not skill thats the issue
has anyone made a model of the razor train from half life 2
  ive got enough ng stock to start something in 009 but i need to sort out some decent controllers and not be a complete ape when it comes to wiring
  somebody needs to try doing this in the us the routes are much longer and the scenery here is that much more spectacular than it is in japan it would be perfect if done right
  no ones been on it it only crashes into you
  stacks of ready to run and kits available  where most google searches just bring up expensive kits or thomas items
  theres a conversion kit for that that looks pretty straightforward  fourdees have a decent roster of locomotives bachmann branchline have recently entered the market peco or one of its subsiduaries has rolling stock and kits
  and heljans got the lb locos coming out and if you want something generic theres the minitrains bagnall
whats your favorite scale to model /n/    i personally would actually prefer to model in ho scale if i had the space and money to do so due to the wide variety of rolling stock and modeling kits available but i have invested heavily in n and enjoy it quite a bit due to the amount of action you can pack into small spaces
  no joke id buy a skarloey and convert it into an og do not steal talyllyn if it wasnt at least 100 i know thats relatively cheap for a 009 scale loco but id need track and coaches to go with it my wallet weeps at the thought of it all
some day the technology will exist where we can have little ho scale robot switchmen couple and uncouple cars on layouts to build trains locomotive speakers will still sound like shit tho lol
  i kind of like s scale but what i model is unavailable so i have ho n scale is pretty nice for getting long trains  big scenery in small spaces there was a time i thought the scale looked like shit but its improved so much over the years i follow 2 nscalers who do the kettle valley railway great stuff
  heljans got the lb locos coming out  no lyn though
  brain  n  heart  ho  dick  g
  i really like ho scale but i just dont have the needed space for those im currently collecting märklin zscale zscale is nice but size is really limiting digital lighting etc mods are quite tricky  maybe with hindsight if i would start now i would have gone with nscale
i have limited space and really wanna do like a foldable tabletop layout just to have a space to run my locos thinking of buying a 4x8 plywood plank cutting it in half and hinging it so i can fold it no scenic details just track and power
  im in a similar situation no space for a perminant fixture but im thinking of doing a 4x8 layout with folding legs/ tressles  having it in my garage lean it up against the walk when not in use what gauge are you running
  ho gauge track with oo scale stock my other issues is like i havent done this shit since i was a kid but i just bought those two locos and now i wanna run some trains the problem with that is the aforementioned lack of space and the only track i have is a very aged and basic layoutsworth of bachmann ez track trying to decide whether i wanna just get more ez track not a fan of permanent layouts anyway i like rearranging or toss it all and get standard track or kato unitrack
  ive heard excellent things about kato unitrack for temporary layouts and if you want to go permament it can be made to look good enough if youre not too fussed about realism
  dat pclass  so adorable im jelly anon
  i use to have ertl diecast trains when i was a little kid and i had this secr bluebell engine as soon as i saw hattons produced an actual model of it i had to have it my two favorites p class and 45xx just waiting on bachmann to finish their mcintosh for rails of sheffield       yeah i keep seeing nothing but praise for the unitrack just might bite the bullet and go for it a simple oval would only be like 60 realism doesnt strike me as something too important right now if i dont have the space to set up permanently i may as well ignore trying to model anything real just going for getting something i can set up and run
on the subject of unitrack if i buy one of the track sets with controller i just need a power supply for an sx controller right
heres what ive planned on scarm for my 8 x 4 idea its made of all the old hornby pieces i have lying around only problem is that one of the straight bits just after the level crossing doesnt align properly so ill have to do some modding thoughts ive got a few more curved bits but thats it
  put in a second crossover so trains can go from the outer loop to the inner loop without reversing assuming lefthand operation
  i had this secr bluebell engine  me too maybe one day ill get the hattons model it looks so good
  i agree with your theory japan was magical for me because of the huge variety of visibly different trainsets commuter subway intercity shinkansen the huge amount of liveries and howmuch old rolling stock is still used either close to its original form or refurbished heavily i got to ride a great deal of these and see working restored steamers in kyoto multiple companies run special sightseeing trains in cool oneofakind liveries and multiple companies literally across the country run restored steam excursion trains it helps the modeling scene tremendously because every era is beautiful and theres a ton of n scale support from kato tomix tomytec microace and smaller companies    id always liked model trains as a kid but aside from a christmas set modelling them was never an option due to both cost and the what do i model question id only rode one restored train somewhere in tennessee as a very small child and nearly all of the trains i remember seeing as a kid and young adult were the same boring brutalist freights and amusement park trains i never got to ride the old passenger trains boomers were so fond of so i had no memorable rail experiences japan gave me those experiences and now i have a collection of 90s00s kyushu passenger sets that ive actually gotten to ride and some i never did but wish i could have
  yeah thats what ive been thinking might play around with the points i have before going out to buy any more both lines will operate more or less independent any way some of my trains simply wont run on the inner line as some curves are 1st radius but ill see hopefully gonna get building in a couple weeks
  needs more curves in the upper part to make it less oval pic related
  thinking of trying to hide how oval it is with some scenery maybe some tunnels im limited on space/ track/ finances so ill see what i can do
  build kits if youre on a budget bro otherwise youve gotta be patient and wait for the right time    i myself want to do an o gauge/scale 7 layout 1435 but i dont have any space skills or money to do it
  if you ditch the right connection to the loop from the secondfromthetop station track and the bottomright siding youd have the pieces for a second crossover    id also recommend ditching the top platform its just too small to look convincing
  you could add a backdrop thats not behind the whole layout but on it the rail could enter a tunnel continue behind the backdrop and emerge on the other side
  you could even put the backdrop in the middle
  how about going singletrack youd have more track and room to work with also add a fiddle yard
  alright ive created basically the same thing but from the left side ill think about platforms etc though those buildings arent to scale they are just a rough guide of where im gonna put them i really want to have an island platform so i might just ditch the sidings  keep that
  ive been considering single track but i wanna run my trains side by side      good idea might look into it honestly im more concerned with actually running my trains making it look nice is 2nd on the agenda
  so i did some digging and there are a few lyn kits out there but they all seem out of print or hard to find theres one from langely and if you click add to cart their website breaks and the other is from backwoods its an all metal kit that seems to be ancient and expensive as hell
  bachmann usa did a g scale lyn didnt they
  oh so they did still thats garden scale fuck that noise
thoughts on my current plan for my new layout its meant to have oo9 track as well but im unsure if xtrackcad lets you have multiple gauges
  looks good maybe throw some bends in so its not completely the same all the way around northwest corner could work
  nice where can you find that
  tfw im the same way but with airplane models  well at least im not buying a shitload of anime figures yet
  
  19999  1760 shipping  mfw  i think ill stick to airplane models my cathay pacific a350900 is my most expensive one yet at 110 although i might break that record eventually
  tfw collect anime figures and trains  generally anywhere from 80200/item  getting the train suite shikishima soon 380    at least my alcohol taste is cheap sake rum and port wine
looking for tips whats the best scale models to buy for a model airport also regarding train layouts whats the best company to buy from i have lionel sets but my friend recommend mth
  several manufacturers make jet airliner models in 1/200 scale i think so n 1160 or z 1220 scales would work best if you want to go with 172 planes for your airport then ho 187 would be best it all depends on the type of airport you want to model
  the us rail modeling scene might be helped if the passenger rail revival were seeing actually pans out but i get what you mean us freight rail is extremely standardized these days all that separates one companys locos from the other is a coat of paint i can see why thatd be rather dull i kinda admit seeing all the unique american streamers my favorites are the nw 611 prr t1 and up big boy in that order makes me wish we saw that kind of diversity these days yeah it was inefficient but it was cool as hell and every railroad had locos that fit their own unique style not its just old emds and gevos    whats really funny is that the railfan and modelling communities should be booming right now overall this is the most railfriendly generation since the boomers came in and fucked everything up so why the fuck cant they manage to sell to us when they can sell to the boomers
  so why the fuck cant they manage to sell to us when they can sell to the boomers  boomers have money younger generations dont also younger people would rather play simulators than build layouts
  because boomers demand quality dcc onboard ready rivet counting sound smoke units exact replica down to the cab interior most boomers are salty they cant afford 5inch gauge live steam     younger gens dont have the space or funds for massive layouts either not that space matters though id honestly be satisfied with a simple 4x8 oval just to watch my shit run and you can find really sweet deals through model shops that do resales on preowned stuff and with the advent of 3dprinting you can basically craft any stock you want     us rail is boring as fuck and our locos are so unattractive there are some steamers and old school diesel/electrics that are nice but for the most part our locos have no personality
  this is why i love japanese companies n scale is the primary scale things are well detailed more affordable and infinitely customizeable with aftermarket parts much easier to build a basic layout with kato or tomix track pieces as well
  us rail is boring as fuck and our locos are so unattractive  fucking this ive always loved the uk and japanese trains much more than us ones despite living in the us
  i find the industrial brutality of us locos pretty appealing in a weird way its the complete lack of variety thats the issue    you got the old emds with the thin nose and the new emds and gevos with the wide ones thats it theres zero variety
  alcos and baldwins are very sexy in a utilitarian way love the brutal look of those c630s and c636s sd45s with the flared radiators are also a work of art
  theres zero variety  thats why i find layouts that model 1960searly 70s interesting they usually run 1st  2nd gen units from 3 or 4 builders
  theres zero variety    if you model today yeah but go back to the 50s70s and the variety increases significantly
  these anons bring up some good points about having an additional crossover and a fiddle yard       if you just want to watch trains run a 4x8 is ok but it is widely accepted that a 4x8 isnt the best use of space and restricts your curve radius rather severely this may restrict what you would like to run   i had a 4x8 for a while and i ended up disassembling it in favor of something about 6x9 feet i disassembled that layout too as after a while it kind of became a mess and needed some major reworking anything in the future will probably be a shelf or modular style layout
  to me theres very little on layout car storage you might want a run through track in the fiddle yard too
  to me theres very little on layout car storage  this is sort of forced by the fact that there has to be room for the oo9 track plus i dont want one of those layouts where every square inch is covered with track  you might want a run through track in the fiddle yard too  the fiddle yard isnt really a final design
  better than my jouef euromed
  the norfolk southern line paralleling us72 is on my commute to work its interesting because i see early narrow nose sds or even gps out on the main line
  bet they dont run them long hood forward though
heavy breathing
  persian trains
  another persian train
  im jelly as fuck anon
    11 scale is not allowed here
posting some pics of my gauge 1 steamer in action since someone asked for them in the last thread
  those are expensive
i was thinking of maybe getting a tiny scale n in my shelf but will 26cm in width be enough for a 180 turn if i keep the train pretty short and use flextracks or is that just plain impossible and i have to somehow deepen my shelf if i deside to get into this
      cute
ordered a couple of these kind of want to build a small n scale early twentieth century electrified switching layout now
  not without using the absolute tighest curves imaginable which would rule out pretty much all rolling stock how important is an oval to you
  love it what class is that any other steamers
  its an accucraft victory 060 its the only steamer i own but my dad has a couple more ill post pics of some of his tomorrow
how feasible would it be to have actual distance layouts like if someone wanted to build an actual route in (((whichever))) scale with realistic distances
  pretty unrealistic even in n gauge five miles is almost 14 feet and realistic radii curvature is impractical at best
  i did the math for a zgauge one and found i would need a 6 car garage to do a small branch line
went out to the welshpool  llanfair light railway this weekend and immediately decided to get back into my modelling went searching around the old shops i used to haunt and about 50 are closed or stripped back their ranges so stock next to no n gauge what they do have is 150200 the cost of what it was when i was last involved in 201213  existence is pain but im still going to build my brw layout if it kills me
  n seems like its mostly an american and japanese thing i dont think its very big anywhere in europe maybe germany
  there is a fairly big range of british n gauge between graham farish peco and dapol with a fair amount of peripherals like card kits out there im not quite advanced enough to look at loco kits but i know theyre out there    its definitely second fiddle to ho/oo but theres still plenty of it around it just seems that its being slowly pushed online
the us model railroad scene isnt dying its just underground i know tons of young people who are into the hobby     no one goes to the massive autism conventions anymore and for good reason its full of old spergs    no one shops at local hobby shops because if you cant be fucked to have things in stock then i cant be fucked to give you money    no one does train clubs anymore because i dont want some old prick thinking he can handle and run my 1500 dollar brass model nor do i wanna risk running my equipment on their poorly built and managed layout    no one posts on model railroad forums because its the same bitching and moaning and the same fucking ideas and articles that have been done to fucking death     no one railfans anymore because we live in a patriot act/ndaa era where being anywhere near railroad track or any other railroad property and taking pictures is considered terrorism and holding up commerce somehow    so yeah model railroading isnt dead dying or living on borrowed time you can still do it cheaply if you arent massively fucking retarded its just harder to actually connect with people who do it because no one talks about it when they do talk about it normies tend to be like lol toy trains maximum autisms lol its mostly women who flip out about it and insult it its the same with video games its why you dont tell bitches in general your hobbies to begin with
  it just seems that its being slowly pushed online  sos the rest of the hobby its cheaper and has more stock
  i feel like a lot of the issue is that many young people in the us have no love for us trains except the operating session autists who want more than a pc simulator as far as variety goes you pretty much have amtrak acela amtrak superliners and uniform boring freight with different loco paint jobs ive posted occasionally and read a lot on the jns model railroad forum and a couple of the members do set up japanese n gauge layouts at events like the dc sakura festival with a lot of interest shown by the attendees
  lol toy trains maximum autisms lol  well that is accurate train hobbyists are often autistic for a number of reasons   what we need socially is not so much to accept  understand train hobbyists as to accept  understand people with autism
  i have been involved with model railroading in some form or another since i was about 10 years old once i got to highschool i started visiting the forums and talking with other model railroaders by the time i finished college i had visited a few conventions and had a decent little collection of models around age 22 i pretty much stopped going to any forums because i was sick of hearing all of the same discussions over and over i was also sick of listening to unironic boomers complaining about how the hobby was too expensive for them on their fixed income/ssi now im 28 and unfortunately i dont have a model railroad anymore as i simply dont have the space for it i pretty much keep my interest to myself because like you say most discussions arent worth the trouble and cons are generally a waste
  its even more difficult when youre into foreign equipment the us/north american rail societies are full of boomers and rednecks its boring our rails are boring the commentary is boring its so monotone and serious id rather keep the hobby to myself talk to some select people online for advice and shit american rail is so lifeless
  honestly it sounds like youre the problem not everyone else
  its not a problem for me because i dont participate with the autists us rail is shit
us rail isnt shit its the fandom that is shit they take pictures and model the same exact fucking shit there is a couple hundred short line railroads in the us and they are all mostly fucking awesome including some that still use alcos and shit the problem is no one railfans them or takes pictures of them because everyone is so far up the ass of the big class 1 railroads like ns and up there is still a lot of cool stuff but most of the fandom is overwhelmingly autistic for heritage painted emd garbage whats worse is the faggots who try to point out all the differences on the multiple phases of sd70s and 80s like anyone even really gives a fuck     us rail is great but only if you are willing to dig for info and do your own research if you are looking for everything to be handed on a plate for you like all the up fags and the ns fags then you are shit out of luck if you want to model anything awesome you are basically on your own the boomers are unfortunately the norm and the mainstream and they are unfortunately the ones catered to by the modeling industry at large     athearn and them are still making the same shit they have for the past 10 years because retarded boomers continue to still buy the same shit there is over 300 locomotives that have never been made in plastic before and there is thousands upon thousands of freight and passenger cars that will never see the light of day in plastic boomers will continue to buy generic walthers and athearn bullshit and continue to hold the head of this hobby underwater and it will never get better until they all fucking die this is why high life expectancy was a mistake
  you know id buy 30s50s era southern crescent sets if they made any in n gauge please kato please until then jr kyushu rail for me
are us shows really that bad been to mostly regional shows here in aus but i was still pleasantly surprised at the quality and variety of exhibits sure there were a lot of weirdos walking about but the exhibitors themselves were mostly well adjusted and full of helpful information
  ive spent a fair amount of time in portland  western / central oregon  pacific territory    wwr is like a mile from where i used to live and still spend a fair amount of time driving that trackage theres a hole in the wall lng or other some such industry that takes about 4 tank cars every 3 weeks biggest building on it is a 10 x 20 construction trailer will be modeling that at some point
  i was into ho into my teens and early 20s then lost interest in model railroading i recently rediscovered my love of trains and have been making regular visits to heritage railroads in the area i also developed a fondness for three rail o gauge which is more toy railroading than model railroading but i like the big clunky feel of the older lionel and marx stuff and its getting cheap the boomers who coveted 50s and 60s lionel are retiring or dying off so they and their kids are selling off their collections at a fraction of the asking price of the 90s and 00s
  ive visited a few shows between 20102013 and they were alright there were just a lot of little things that added up against them my main problem isnt with maladjusted attendees but that i would usually find there wasnt really too much available or on display youd have a couple smallish modular layouts that looked nice and maybe one or two bigger layouts that were glorified loops of track with no scenery vendors were also hit or miss ive bought some nice models at shows but many vendors are just overpriced or selling junk
  the fandom is overwhelmingly autistic for heritage painted emd garbage  shit yes i dont understand why foamers sperg out over them its fake fucking shit and people go crazy for them even sadder are the modelers who collect all the heritage units just model the original even railroading 3 decades ago was light years more interesting than today      athearn and them are still making the same shit they have for the past 10 years  that company is for boomers by boomers i go through their product announcements a couple of times a year and its the seems like the same shit new road road numbers want an alco or fm or a steam engine tough want an ugly ns sd60e or an sd70 variant youre in luck if theres anything remotely unusual you have to preorder it a year or so in advance if its made at all or youll never get it      there is over 300 locomotives that have never been made in plastic  is there a list id be interested to see it      us rail is great but only if you are willing to dig for info and do your own research  it really isif youre willing to turn back the clock luckily all the information that would cost hundreds of dollars in hardtofind books years ago is mostly available for free now
  there is a couple hundred short line railroads in the us and they are all mostly fucking awesome    true i was able to see several locomotives of the coos bay railroad last year would be fun to model atlas makes gp30s they should do one in the cbr scheme     there is over 300 locomotives that have never been made in plastic before and there is thousands upon thousands of freight and passenger cars that will never see the light of day in plastic    true its awful interurbans are especially neglected shapeways is helping with that somewhat nowadays though but even then only a small niche of modelers are even interested in obscure models and roads the mainstream is all about ugly garish murica paint schemes on up sixaxle locos       to athearns credit they make some nice first and second generation diesels geeps fs sds and run them pretty consistently just bought a nice gn f45 and some 36 boxcars they still make quality stuff from the past just not as often as they should in comparison to ugly modern crap
    nice the top one looks like the bridge over the goat river near creston bc
  best to use z for that small of a shelf
  tfw i will never find any n scale lirr metro north or even mta rolling stock  p l e a s e
  rapid transit stuff doesnt seem to sell ive never seen too many models of it pic related being one of the few exceptions but maybe that is because of the lack of rtr stuff
  fuck forgot pic related
  i coulda sworn kato has made some rolling stock for at least one of those
  3d printing seems to be your best bet for rapid transit and traction stuff these days
  though the hobby and the industry refuse to accept it all the major uk manufacturers engage in price fixing in an attempt to protect the small shops against the big online retailers like hattons
  i doubt theres outright collusion in the us but the big manufacturers seem to exist in an oligopolic state ie no reason to start undercutting if boomers are perfectly willing to pay 250 per locomotive
  i recognize that layout thats the slocan river bridge on the nscale columbia  western awesome job i like how he did the snow scenes
  hattons are my goto and favorite online retailer their bargains are decent customer service is so damn good shipping time and packing are super quick too i live in east coast us and usually get my shit in like 23 days
  restaurant car    you mean the diner
reminder anything smaller then o scale is extra autism
  you
  some of us dont have mansions or can afford to spend 600 on a single loco
fucking finally economy shipping was a mistake
check out my diaphragm guys    
  nice doge but its diorama not diaphragm
i was at the local train fair this summer because my girlfriends dad runs in and the whole day pretty much summed up everything this threads been talking about six 60yr old men who laugh at anything that isnt an american built steam engine a 60yr old woman who laughed at anything that wasnt american and this really cool black kid and his dad who only do ns and nothing else i was listening to him talk to another group of teenagers about their fantasy layouts and him just going on about how he cant bring himself to do anything other then ns great kid though loved talking with him overall meanwhile theres my girlfriend who loves 1800s era steam engines regardless of where they came from because their cute and me repainting everything i can get my hands on to santa fe just for shins and attempting to kitbash steam engines that never existed simply because they never existed i always feel like were only tolerated because were related to the lead    spoilerim also trying to build the ponyville railroad in a way that isnt immediately obvious thats it pony but no one knows about that except for said gf/spoiler
  i can only imagine somebody like me showing up with japanese limited express trains and local/3rd sector 12 car passenger trains i fuckin love my 3 different liveries of seaside liner/huis ten bosch express
ive always felt the hobby in my area falls into one of two categories either you are too old to use a computer or are young and keep it hidden     case in point the largest train fair held twice a year in my area is organized by a club that you will find nothing about online except that they sponsor the show they seem to mostly consist of retirees and their relatives on the other end of the spectrum there was a club at the university that was in a dorms basement that was for students et al very few knew outside the club knew where it was at but it was in the same spot for about 50 years they had to relocate at the end of the last school year though and it seems to have fallen apart
  introduce your girlfriend to 1800s british steam theyre the cutest
    rip also what school am curious
  the mud looks like chocolate frosting
  you mean the cafeteria    
  university of illinois      that was a never finished project
  ugh nothing more sad than tearing up an old layout i once belonged to a club that spent 15 yrs building a 2000 sq ft ho layout before the lease expired the main yard came from an even older layout in the late 60s  you could see several of the abandoned switching leads etc    certainly wasnt pleasant pulling up all that rail that i spent hundreds of hours hand spiking not to mention the scratchbuilt switches
having just discovered this general and coming from only using forums/fb groups i must say its refreshing to see opinions that arent the usual muh hobby is dying or muh kits were the golden age of model railroading or other such boomer faggotry the atlas rescue forum for example is a hive of degenerate boomer shit lords where seem nothing is ever good enough for their patrician tastes
          i found some photos of the club track back in the 90s it was a good example of a layout that was never finished even with a 40 some odd year lifespan
  napoleon dont be jealous that ive been chatting online with trains all day
  pulling up all that rail that i spent hundreds of hours hand spiking not to mention the scratchbuilt switches  reeeeeeeeeee    id kill myself too bad you guys didnt make it in movable sections      welcome to 4chan  spoilerjust remember that youre here forever/spoiler    but yeah i cant imagine what horror shows those sites must be i just love being anonymous here and that saying faggot is acceptable      i went to a train show around last jan/feb and never got around to posting
  kek    fuck most of my pics are over 4mb from the show
  theres a hundred ways to compress images you know heres one compressed down from 80mb from my local show a couple of months ago
  theres a hundred ways to compress images you know  i realize that but im on my phone and lazy very lazy
  the depth of field and centre of this image is telling me this is actually an ad for roamtrees cocoa
so i moved back in with my parents after college i was super into model trains when i was a kid and my mom decided out of the blue to get one of those allinone layout kits pic related it actually could be kinda fun but ive never done anything like this before what am i in for here /n/
  wow nice newark airport station i recognized that immediately im this anon  do you have more pics of your/someones nec layout
  do you have more pics of your/someones nec layout  i believe i do i have a bunch of hires pics from the show but theyre over the 4mb limit whats the best way to compress them all at once
  what am i in for here /n/  no chance at sex until you move out  just do it its a kit ask questions as they come along      another pic
  those trucks look way too small
  looks about right to me
  im also trying to build the ponyville railroad in a way that isnt immediately obvious thats it pony  wait theres such a thing now i got off the ride at mid season 4 couldnt stand more of hasbros bullshit  i dont know if this counts as pony outside of /mlp/ so ill post a pic of one of my favorite pieces in my small collection
  the friendship express not to be confused with the 200511 istanbulthessaloniki rail service has been a thing since season 2 and gr15 only prohibits pony threads images flashes and avatars nothing about mentioning it
the dayton train show is next saturday how many of you /n/iggas are going
  i know about that but how are you making that into a railway there wasnt much of the stations shown much less the route or maybe i just forgot since i watched that damn six years ago already time sure does fly  anyways pic of my tiny pun intended z collection
  z scale is so goddamned cute makes want to hug something    as for ponys im making a model of ponyville and faking the rest might base it the canadian mountain railroads
want this caboose in ho  only available in brass  no passable kitbash possible  argh
  pregrouping british steam spawned the most iconic and beautiful steam engines of all time
this kills the foamer
  i like good art there are some very talented taggers out there as long as they dont cover important info and theyre actually good and its not degenerate 420 blaze it lol xd idgaf    theres a guy in my state that does really good work replicating graffiti on his models
  i guess im just use to the larger ones in the tv series
logging trains are cute
i dont know anything about ho scale anymore what are the pros and cons of each manufacturer these days havent had any model trains since the 80s when everything was athearn blue box
  i was in the same boat as you im lucky that one of the guys i meet for coffee every friday used to run a hobby shop until retirement so im able to pick his brains on particular items  hes happy to share info both good  bad for instance i have some lifelike p1k cliners beautiful models powerful could probably pull the paint off a wall turns out theres a weakness in the gears i was never aware of but he also supplied info on how to replace it if the gear eventually breaks little things like that i also lurk on some forums which supply some usefull insight i also get to draw on the experiences of several others at the weekly coffee meet
  that they certainly are
how come america never really painted its locomotives   i can only guess that british steam ran on a small isle in the north atlantic while america is half of a continent and it wasnt feasible with the larger fleets im guessing the britts had a more intimate relationship with their local locomotives which would explain thomas the tank engine
  they did paint their locomotives except it was mostly black usually the 19th century locos usually had some accents of color
  you know what i meant yes color accents and nice script especially on passenger trains but nothing like the vivid colors of the brits
  d16/3  i see you are a man of culture as well
  so elegant in every size
could someone answer me pls      i dont know anything about ho scale anymore what are the pros and cons of each manufacturer these days
  practicality coal is dirty
  all i know is to avoid bachmann track
also hattons is doing a pretty large bargain sale  nothing too crazy but theres some pretty good deals in here for coaches and wagons
  forgot link    
  you know what i meant yes color accents and nice script especially on passenger trains but nothing like the vivid colors of the brits  passenger trains  america
  black was predominant but several us railroads had bright livery in the first half of the 20th century southern favored a green color scheme for its passenger engines
  forgot pic
chicago and alton used a maroon color scheme
  new jersey central used a blue paint scheme for its blue comet locomotives
  as usual the british have better liveries
  the goat for nonstreamlined locomotives unfortunately the southern didnt paint many like that and didnt roster any impressive locomotives imo
  i like the pacifics and mountains they ran personally there were certainly bigger faster and more powerful locomotives in service but the pacific remained the quintessential passenger engine in the us until the end of steam southern rostered one streamlined pacific 1308 which was used to head up the tennessean
baltimore and ohio royal blue
imagine getting so excited about this ugly piece of shit that you make an unboxing/review video about it
  why do american trains need to loudly proclaim the fact that they are american
  because they are built and operated by americans
  google pride and find out stupid dumbass kid
  not even as a reference fuck you people post what the fuck they want
  nice i like that color  i never knew murica had colored locomotives i feel stupid desu      vomit    ignore that faggot
  colored locomotives  racist theyre locomotives of color
  ever price out the model of that express reefer 50 can nice model but wow that much for plastic oh and the company that makes it tlt is rumoured to be closed down
  kek    local hobby shop
whats the best manufacturer for ho scale american locomotives want to expand instead of just using marklin
  if you know the dimensions and can use cad software you could upload the design to shape ways and they could 3d print the shape for you main body only might be best and you could add extra details later
  want to expand instead of just using marklin  good luck getting out of their walled garden ecosystem it baffles me how a company can get away with using a fucking three rail system in 2018
  no its near the big sheffield hump yard so there is a weird mix of stuff coming through every few days a bnsf coal drag comes through heading east and you see up locomotives mixed in with the ns stuff sometimes
  compatability lionel has been using the same basic three rail o guage track since 1906 provided the curves are wide enough you can put a scale locomotive and rolling stock equipped with tmcc or legacy command built in this century on track and power from 100 years ago and the on board electronics will switch to transformer mode and run and 100 or 70 year old trains will run on modern lionel track and power case in point here
  but thats the thing märklins h0 stuff has never ever been compatible with anything else on the market and h0 is as diverse as a scale gets maybe just behind n o gauge is very rarely used outside the us and users stick to two or three vendors but h0 is used worldwide and has dozens and dozens of vendors yet the only one using märklins proprietary system is well märklin  seriously not too long ago a local spain toy store chain closed and they dumped all their model rail stuff onto second hand stores all the märklin stuff has been sitting on shelves unsold because nobody can run it they even lock down the nonpowered rolling stock into their ecosystem by not isolating the wheels from the axles so they short out other systems
  ecosystem  just say system when youre not talking about something thats alive
i went to the vancouver train expo today hoping to purchase some rolling stock  wrangle some deals had a shopping list of 5 or 6 items  a wallet full of cash didnt find a thing saw 3 other items but couldnt talk them down to more reasonable prices then i missed out on 3 bundles of 10 pieces of unused code70 flex track for 10 by seconds argh     oh well i saw some neat layouts  got some more modelling tips  finally met facetoface a couple of authors ive corresponded with in the past and some guy had a up gtel i heard it over all the crowd noise  other sound systems nice
  im used to saying ecosystem when talking about products from a company which only work with each other must be a /g/only thing i thought it applied to this too
  everyone uses ecosystem to talk about things that way
  i like this dont know what it is but i like it      dont be pedantic thats a correct use of the phrase in common everyday language      youre fine
anyone have a christmas layout for the holidays i have a really basic one i threw together but i need to assemble it every year i just want something i can dust off and display
  i like this dont know what it is but i like it  cut p1a my favorite electric locomotive there will never be one made in n gauge so i had to buy the ho brass version as a desk model
  i love n scale but i wish i didnt have hamhands im trying to rebuild an old concor j3a and its a bitch
        its a silicon valley tech faggot expression think about what the prefix eco means people used to just say closed system proprietary or simply system to describe what youre talking about but now everyone just wants to use a chic euphemism no matter how dumb it is
  closed system  proprietary mean different things to ecosystem language updates just like rolling stock you can be stuck in the 60s forever if you like
  closed system  proprietary mean different things to ecosystem  then just use the right terminology dipshit
  ah i see for three rail o everyone eventually adapted to the standards lionel set since theyve been around the longest in one form or another
  nice high rail layout
  this is what i want to do run three rail o gauge trains through fairly realistic scenery not scale but still looks nice
  dont be pedantic thats a correct use of the phrase    no its not  certainly not professional using that term in the way described i suspect its only used by teens  hobbyists i work for a major telecom firm and have contacts in the marine  aero biz as a test i asked from the old farts down to the new punks no one has ever heard that term being used like that could be regional for wherever you are or just a /g/ thing as previously mentioned    as a consumate professional i thought it best to correct you 
    the layout is from a local hobby store in an all the years i think ive only see it run once lol
  i cant tell if youre trolling or that asshole that everyone at work avoids either way you are one miserable son of a bitch go back to the bridge you crawled out from under troll
      cant even read the page you linked properly are you sure youre a professional
r8 my n layout design  the goal is dcc large curves to handle basically any locomotive/car length without looking dumb and a few interesting features so i can test new stuff as i buy it  i dont expect to have space or time to build a proper scenic layout for quite a while so this will just be code 55 on cork on mdf
  thats kind of a shame ive put the cart way a ahead of the horse and bought a bunch of engines and rolling stock before i even have a place to really run them ive got some new stuff but most of what i have are from ebay lots of lionel post war and mpc era stuff thats getting sold for cheap by the kids or grandkids of boomers that dont care how much granpa paid for it 20 years ago
  if youre not building a scenic layout you might as well have even more track
  but thatll decrease the minimum radius beyond acceptable  the reverse section and yard turnouts are already pushing it
  i didnt mean more loops i meant more sidings and is it that important for every train to have total access to the layout
  i mean where would i put them im already only leaving 25 at the edges and while there looks like theres a lot of space left on the inside its not really accessible  and if you mean alltracksconnected then yes if you mean not going below a given radius then no i already compromised in several places but 177 on the flex is pushing it for motive power i already own
  you could throw in a turntable near the yard  add some industry track on the left side
  unfortunately adding anything there makes the min curve on the flex way too small under 16 ive already tried  a turntable would be nice but this is going to be flat ¼½ cork on top of mdf and probably placed on the floor while operating so no cutouts
  see 
  im not going anywhere as long as youre around kid 
  me again bought a small japanese electric locomotive to stand in as a pacific electric yard switcher motor can only handle 1 boxcar reliably and it doesnt couple very well but its a start currently i have 5 pe boxcars by athearn and microtrains a tiger striped sp baldwin vo1000 historically these were leased to pe for operation on their lines but not always relettered i hope to get some catenary soon and might even try to model a period electric boxcab unit i want to build a permanent layout but still low on funds and space
  now convert it to dcc
  i saw two of these at the heart of dixie railroad museum in calera alabama they were on the far side of the museum yard away from the main building close to the shops
whats the essential reading for building a model railroad i was recently reintroduced to the hobby and am trying to figure out what to do
  figure out what scale you want based on space budget and desired nation/era/railway i have n scale japanese stuff because it fits well in an apartment theres good and relatively cheap models covering upwards of 70 years of japanese rail and i love japanese limited express and night trains     theres not really essential reading but once youve built your oval or oval derivative plopped down some structures and maybe a little scenery and want to get more complex youll need to read up more on wiring
if you build it with later scenery in mind it will save you time overall rather than building something then figuring out doing some basic landscaping is not that big a time investment and actually enjoyable
ive seen many dedicated us traction layouts but has anybody ever seen a layout incorporate both a diesel/steam mainline and an electric interurban mainline ive never seen a mixed layout like that with anything more than a little streetcar loop
 tyool 2018   not hand laying 2mm fine scale track    2mmorguk do it
  2mm1ft  thats basically n gauge tho  id be more impressed if it was z or t
  z or t are toys 2fs is a 2mm version of proto87 or p4 and looks much finer the rail in this pic is smaller than z scale rail for example
  no but you can if you make one   i dont want to be limited to what i can run so my plan is a modern layout that also has a company that gives stream train tourist rides like in essex connecticut   hell i can create a train museum if i want to its my world
i finally fuckin did it cunts i dropped like 500 on everything i need to build my first real proper layout n gauge mini layout planning a loop with one bridge a tunnel and a lake     been working on dioramas for a while this will be my first real trainset    wish me luck lads ill post progress as i do more
    good luck dont rush and be patient    also dont try to have everything in a mini layout this kills starters
  my arduino  some test track arrived  also bought a t1
  i am most scared of wiring the thing up i am going to try this today     the terrain making is the fun part i really wish i had a static grass applicator i may have to drive 1 hour to the hobby store to get one i am thinking i might be able to achieve the same effect with a balloon statically charged like the old stand your hair up trick
    test 1 complete i know the size of my layout and the train and transformer works fine
spent probably 1k over the last year on trains of various scales gauges kits track etc and im feeling like im getting bored and havent even finished a layout yet     fuck
    which size is it also are you using digital or how many isolated tracks you will use    im making a vintage basic ho marklin layout right now and im curious the dammn thing has no less than 6 isolated tracks
  lynfag here i just found out i can die happy now thanks to based heljan
  what locomotive is that behind the steamer
  thats the b unit in a prr permanent consist baldwin centipede also by broadway limited it works with my dcc setup just fine the t1 unfortunately does not all it does is make a faint clicking noise every time it receives a command
  as someone whos currently working on starting his own z scale setup i wholeheartedly approve of your collection
well you guys got nice collections
so what do you fags think happened to the ss baychimo im going to say its several hundred feet underwater
  whats the record for an untended metal hulled vessel to stay afloat in open seas cant imagine its over 50 years
  yes somewhere in the canada basin or chukchi plateau a couple thousand fathoms down would be my guess
steam engines are way cooler and if given a chance could be cleaner and better that diesel its just water boiling and rising up that stuff happens naturally to water after rain
  you forgot about the part where you have to heat said water
  steam engines had their day theyre not coming back whatever replaces the diesel wont be boiling water
inefficient  very high maintenance  takes more manpower than diesels  extremely polluting  terrible performance even compared to much smaller diesels
  steam engines are very widely used still just not on vehicles modern steam engines are extremely efficient more efficient than even the best internal combustion engines however they are huge and require an enormous amount of water to operate making them too heavy for practical use in any vehicle they were ok to use on trains when there was no alternative because trains themselves are huge and extremely heavy so rail systems are built to minimize how often a train has to speed up or slow down and they are never expected to accelerate quickly however for something like cars frequent stops and starts are required and they are expected to be able to accelerate up to cruising speed in seconds    for large scale stationary engines external combustion outperforms internal combustion by far which is why almost all modern power plants use their fuel to make high pressure steam and steam to power a steam turbine
  no shit thats why were talking about steam locomotives and not power plants in this thread
if only we could make stationary steam engines that power the moving part of the train from afar  hmmmm really makes you think
  ah carry on then
theres still a niche for steam locomotives just fireless ones which need to have steam loaded into them from some water superheater and then have the steam stored in the locomotive at low atmospheric pressure inside the loco  these fireless locos are useful for shunting operations since they have very high tractive effort but since theyre shunting electrification would be out of the question and the reason theyre fireless is because theyre operating around highly flamable or reactive materials fireless steam locomotives are still in limited use in chemical plants where they shunt in taker wagons from a mainline to the plant
  based although hydroelectricity is even more efficient as a power source for electrified rail
  a lot of them were used in pharmaceutical plants where a lot of steam would be generated already through chemical processes and the risk of chemical fires was too great  the uk highstreet chemist boots used to own pharmaceutical plants before they outsourced it to other companies for shunting operations inside plants they used fireless locos  smaller shunters such as those used for hauling 23 wagons of delicate materials have since been replaced with battery operated shunters such as in places like sellafield in the uk
  as said only a few fireless locos are still in use in chemical plants here the loco is hauling sodium carbonate but other chemicals which are far more reactive required specialist rolling stock
  he cares about where a trains electricity comes from
  theyre really fucking cool in a way that diesels can never be anon but theres a reason every railroad dropped them like a hot potato when the diesels came around theyre nowhere near as practical    still wish we had saved more of them latemodel steam especially latemodel steam was the fucking coolest you got all the crazy or elegant designs as a lastditch effort to compete with the diesels the big boys nw 611 prr t1 were all incredibly unique locomotive designs were amazingly lucky to 2/3 of them today
  its really a shame that of the steam locomotives that didnt get scrapped very few of them are operational and only a few of those could be feasibly made operational
  isnt there a group building a new t1 from the original plans
  yes and the chances of it happening are close to 0
  he doesnt
god i live this strange thing
why are there no diesel engines that just emulate steam engines using a small waterbox for show   i understand why there arent industrial/commercial ones but what about the luxury consumer train lines an art deco styled diesel would be badass or the rare steamdiesel hybrid    i swear the wrong assholes win the lottery if i had several hundred million dollars id immediately cement my position as the most autistic lottery winner by blowing half of it on making a single train
  there are tons of them on miniature railways minus the waterbox in fact the oldest working diesel locomotive is steamoutline
  there a quite a few floating around the united states there are the standard gauge eight coupled locos that get a lot of press but there are also quite a few smaller steam locomotives still running out there especially industrial tank locomotives made by h k porter and vulcan ironworks one of my favorites is a one off 462 pacific built for the little river railroad by baldwin the lrrr 110 is the smallest standard gauge pacific built in the us weighing in at 995 tons empty it was built in 1911 and has been in near continuous service except for a 20 year period of storage starting in the late 1950s its early life was spent hauling passenger trains on logging logging railroads in tennessee and was built with rough track and tight curves in mind the center drivers are blind and the 110 is particularly surefooted over rough track
    cramptons are basically steam dragsters
440 best steam
  mate have you looked out a window lately trumps the president private companies are running passenger trains and nothing makes sense anymore it has a chance

  tell that to the brits  theyve got several newbuild projects going on at the same time
100 years after one of the worst railroad disasters in sweden the locomotive of the train that derailed in a landslide returned to where it all happened  
    a nuke steam engine would be pretty neat
  shame hardly any survived it would make a nice change seeing some of them on heritage lines as opposed to standard 4 tanks  black 5s
victorian railways x class
    wtf
  they have the tender the cab some bits of the front a driving wheel and parts of the boiler it might just happen
bumping with gt 2 x 4/4 none of these absolute units survive just need a mad kraut rich enough to want to build one
these 0100t rack locomotives haul coal trains in west sumatra  they were ordered in 2 phases first in 1922 and the other in 1964 built by esslingen  pic shown depicts both phases   left  1st batch right  2nd batch  only 2 locomotives survived one of them is still running
did you know that nigel gresleys a1s were based off of the prr k4/29s
imma just going to leave this here
  i dont see it working at least not with current solar power tech however a hybrid steam/electric might work by putting drive trucks with electric motors under the tender and heating coils in the tender you could also add batteries to the tender to extend the range to stay green burn bio fuels like used cooking oil the side effect would be steam engine that smells like french fries pic sort of related grand canyon railroad steam engines run on used cooking oil
  i meant heating coils in the boiler
  fixed it for you
pic is from the strasburg railroad the strasburg is the oldest continuously operating railroad in t he western hemisphere hand has about seven miles of mainline between strasburg pennsylvania and the norfolk western mainline in paradise pennsylvania in the 1970s the strasburg became a purely heritage railroad offering steam excursions in 2010 local businesses approached the railroad about hauling freight after a cost analysis the railroad agreed a 100 year old bridge had to be replaced with a modern concrete span and portions of the track improved to accommodate modern 100 ton freight cars most freight moves are with diesels but on days when one or more of the five steam engines are fired for excursion runs revenue freight is moved by steam
santa fe 3751 based in san bernardino california currently down since last year for her fifteen year inspection
  favorite pic of sf 3751 this was january of 1999 3751 was traveling from san bernardino to la to pic up her passenger consist for an excursion rather than have it dead head on the mainline the railroad assigned it to pull a 47 car intermodal consist to the la yards
  
  
  that video would have been perfect if the guy had shut up  just me
  wtf kinda abomination is this
  thats an example of maine 2 ft gauge the one in the pic is now in edaville a small mass amusement park the state of maine had a large 2 ft gauge common carrier network at the turn of the 20th century
  i dont disagree
  incedentally that pic was the prototype for bachmanns 260 on30 locomotive that comes with their starter sets
this one is kind of unique leviathan is a new build completed in 2012 i believe her owner david kloke wanted a 440 american type and when he couldnt find one he founded kloke locomotive works and built her

thomas before the rebuild
and after
  alright im going to need some explanation here because is that a german engine on a baltimore and maryland mainline
  the oversized smokebox articulates with the front engine  you got a source for that
  its the london midland and scottish lms railway princess coronation class no 6229 duchess of hamilton imported for the 1939 worlds fair it did a 3000 mile tour of the us before returning to the uk currently displayed at the national railway museum in york
  wikipedia take it for what its worth  this class of ten 210102 locomotives were actually rebuilt from more conventional 2102 baldwinbuilt locomotives by the atchison topeka and santa fe railway in 1911 to 1912    although they appeared to have exceedingly long boilers the barrel in front of the rear set of cylinders actually contained first a primitive firetube superheater for further heating the steam before use the steam was carried forward from the boiler proper by outside steam pipes as shown in the photograph also in this space was a reheater for the highpressure exhaust before it was fed to the forward lowpressure cylinders    in front of that there was a feedwater heater a space where cold water from the tender could be warmed before being injected into the water proper this worked similarly to the boiler itself the firetubes passed through the feedwater tank the atsf 210102s 3000 class locomotives were the largest locomotives in the world from 1911 till possibly early 1914
when you need so many drivers you stick them under the tender
  yeah i looked that article up but it doesnt say that the smokebox articulated with the front engine
  i read it somewhere else hang on a second leviathan being hauled to a heritage railroad
  that awkward moment when you build want a full sized steam engine so bad you found a company to fabricate it but you end up building a basic bitch 440    guess you gotta start somewhere
  here we go         the second locomotive has an articulated boiler with each section rigidly mounted on its respective frames the flexible joint consists of fifty rings of high carbon steel which are ten inches wide and formed with a slight set so that when placed adjacent to one another they form a series of vshaped joints the rings have an outside diameter of seventyfive and onehalf inches they are riveted together at their inner and outer edges and form a bellowsshaped structure which is fortyfour and threequarters inches in length this is bolted into place between the front and rear boiler sections an internal flue fortyfour inches in diameter traverses the flexible connection and is flared out at the back to fit into the rear boiler section this flue prevents ashes and cinders from lodging in the flexible joints
  he wanted a actual 1860s historic 440 but nobody would sell him one so he built it and he founded a company that builds steam locomotives theyre supposedly working on larger designs now    pic is john bulls 1980 live steam run it was 149 years old at the time
for reasons known only to themselves someone built a streamlined fireless locomotive
union pacific steam turbine electric locomotives
and im off to bed
whats your guys opinion on the western maryland scenic railroad restoring co 1309
  pretty much any preserved locomotive being brought back to steam is a good thing as far as im concerned one of the things you get from reading about the transition from stream to diesels was that the railroads were in a big hurry in 19581960 to scrap everything and that by 1970 everyone was like holy crap we should have saved some of those i look at things like the fact that none of the 285 new york central j type hudsons survive and am thankful for everything we do havein the us a lot of smaller locomotives that ended sold off to branch lines or industrial mining and logging operations survive but not many of the thousands of mainline giants are still around much less running
    actually its an indonesian sugar hauler that hauls tourists on an old 2ft gauge loop in carver massachusetts    getting the engine through customs must have been a bitch
          i believe it was only 2662s that got the hinged boilers of which there were two types not the 210102s    
  yeah i was going to say that it didnt look american kind of like prr 1515 or prr 1320
  prr 1515
  prr 1320
2 gauge forney 044
name a better looking locomotive     ill wait
sometimes we go too far
well i just learned about something i didnt know before norfolk and western k2 class 482
another nw k2
  why the fuck would they want one of webbs hideously complicated compounds
  the a4s
  because pennsylvania is weird
    youre both wrong
  there were plans to go further
  how about a 210101010102
    thats utterly bonkers
fuck you whyte
question about firebox sizes was the xx4 simply a more powerful development of the xx2 configuration likewise why did xxx2 mallets exist rather than xxx4
  pretty much it basically comes down to what you want a specific locomotive to do the xx4 allowed for a deeper wider firebox but at the cost of unsprung weight that wasnt putting power to the rails most of those xxx2 mallets were creeping along at 30 to 40 miles per hour dragging massive freight trains the firebox supported by a single axle trailing truck was enough to keep up a full head of steam if you want to go fast with a big boiler though youre going to need that big firebox take eight coupled freight locomotives the 280 consolidation type was the freight locomotive of choice at the end of the 19th century it was capable of hauling pretty massive loads for the time at speeds 30 to 40 miles per hour the next step up was the 282 mikado in the first decade of the 20th century more firebox better ability to maintain a head of steam able to sustain speeds in the 50 to 60 mile per hour range in the 1920s frieght trains wwre getting longer cars were geting heavier and traffic demanded more speed so the 282 mikado was expanded into the 284 berkshire type with an even larger firebox capable of sustaining speeds of 90 miles per hour six coupled passenger locomotives followed a similar evolution with the 460 ten wheeler evolving into the 462 pacific and finally the 464 hudson with each evolution adding power and speed
  thousands of tons at 90mph  calling bullshit on that  only express passenger engines got to those sorts of speeds with any regularity
  not the ano youre replying to but theres a difference between producing enough power to be theoretically capable of hitting 90 mph and actually doing so with regularity in revenue service
  that is kind of wrong    the xxx2 mallets rode on very small drivers so you could put the firebox above them even y6b had it in such a way big boy was kind of an oddball in comparison    on the other hand passanger locomotives had huge drivers so the only way to put more firebox was to suspend it on a four wheel truck
  fair enough of course there were the 4664 challenger 4882 cab forward firebox up front and 2666 allegheny
  berks were fast freight engines you didnt put them in front of a drag freight they usually headed up an express freight train
  most of them shared the feature of 80inch  or something like that drivers so they needed that truck under the firebox    cab forwards also used their truck for guiding the locomotive in curves
  of course some railways did try putting xx4 locos on drag freights which was really a waste high horsepower is great for fast trains but for slow ones its tractive effort that matters
  thanks likewise why would you have 2xx over a 4xx arrangement what were the advantages and disadvantages of each for example why would a railroad order a berkshire instead of a northern or vice versa
furthermore what is limited cutoff what is the advantage of a belpaire firebox
  well again it depends on what the primary use of the locomotive will be and what sort of track and terrain it will be running on as a general rule 4xx were used as passenger locomotives because the extra axle on the pilot truck offered better stability at high speeds and the two axle pilot truck also supported more out past the drivers meaning you could have a larger heavier smoke box which would help the draw through the boiler at speed thats not to say a 4xx couldnt haul frieght many of them did but locomotives like the 462 pacific 464 hudson 482 mountain and 484 northern were used as passenger locomotives the fastest 4xx like the hudsons and northerns were 100 mph locomotives nice having that extra axle guiding while hurtling along at 100 mph
  sorry didnt answer about the 2xx they were largely freight engines the berks were unusual in they were 2xx and were fast by any measure the evolution of the berkshire the 2104 texas types were more typical and initially had top speeds of 40 mph though some were later modified to reach higher speeds
  limited cutoff sort of has me scratching my head its part of the super power concept by lima if i understand it correctly it means shorter valve travel meaning more horsepower and less torque the advantage was supposed to be less fuel used because there was less steam used at lower speeds it also meant you didnt want to put   a locomotive with limited cutoff in front of a drag frieght again im not sure i fully grasp the concept i do know it was largely abandoned by the mid 30s the belpaire fireboxs rectangular top offered better flow through the boiler because heat likes to rise the disadvantage of the design was that the stay bolts that keep the boiler from flying apart cant be arranged in the optimum radial pattern for strength as long as you compensate for it it generally isnt a problem pennsylvania was famous for using belpaire fireboxes on pretty much everything they ran and did well with them
could a steam engine offer any kind of engine braking
  an approaching cacophony of rattles and blasts of steam tore through the silence of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region noises from another era    then it appeared clattering and shuddering at 30 kilometers per hourone of chinas few surviving steam trains at the sandaoling coal mine in hami prefecture currently the biggest steam locomotive operation in the country    china literally literally has steam operations in the current year
  yes its called counter steam braking it can only be done on locomotives with cylinder type valves and has to be done by someone who knows the specific locomotive its being done on well the engineer effectively reverses the locomotive while still moving this requires a skilled touch on the throttle and knowing exactly when to reverse someone who doesnt know what theyre doing can break things pretty badly
  sounds like just using air is preferable then
  thats true but the anon i was replying to suggested that 90mph revenue runs were a regular thing      yeah i know that but fast freights were in the 5070mph range not 90mph
  as steam locomotives were always purpose built whence there are now 3 locomotive models where then you would have 50 on the same railroad  it always comes down to horsepower and traction    4xx allows you to carry some extra length of a boiler while still maintaining fairly flexible frame more boiler means more horsepower if you dont need extra traction from drivers then 482 arrangement makes more sense then 2102 when they carry the same boiler
  the engine centipede
color photo of nw k2
  built in 2009 guy also built a second called the york
    this is lightly more sane though one wonders if you could hybridize some of the design aspects of a garratt and bullieds leader have a deep firebox and the coal bunker hang in the middle and have the boiler and a water tank/freedwater heater/condenser on top of the drivers could be a bogie style could be more mallet like but the point would be to put the highest variable weight in the center and fixed weight over the drivers
why are locomotive pistons generally located ahead of the drivers i know sp cab forwards had them the wrong way because of the reversed cab orientation but that didnt seem to affect their operationbut in us they were an anomaly
  having the mechanical operations facing forward caused excessive wear on the q1
  thanks
  someone answer me
  because of the locomotive layout you essentially have    firebox  boiler  chimney  for the exhaust gases   boiler  collector  oveheater  cylinders  for steam     if you take a look at how these are arranged it assures shortest possible runs for the high pressure pipes so least mechanical troubles and most efficiency
  so theres no mechanical disadvantage to having the pistons aft of the drivers
  depends if you consider loss of pressure to be a mechanical disadvantage if you provide the same pressure into the cylinders then they would be no disadvantage     by moving the pistons away from the collector they will loose pressure so for the same system a rear piston will be less efficient
could the 844 beat the mallards speed record if given the chance
  so theres no reason any steam engine couldnt run full speed/power in reverse except for the tender being in the way right
  nope some were used in reverse  such as german class 42s  but with a speed limit riding gear  especially the nondriven trucks  were almost always designed for riding in one direction front truck was to lead the locomotive _into_ a curve and the rear was to get it out and to carry the firebox    two exceptions are tank engines of course and garatts        no        there is thermal one longer pipes  more sealing issues  live steam goes into cylinders at full pressure so in the range of 200300 psi  more dirt issues and heat loss moreover  having a reprocating sliding mass next to a source of dirt and dust which the firebox is is not a good thing    mechanically however  there is no issue garratts are an example
  no  the big american haulers and dualuse locomotives arent optimized for speed enough even back when the class is did both passenger and freight their dualuse locomotives would sacrifice some speed for power as to not be completely useless in freight operation    if you want to look for american locomotives that could possibly beat the mallard you need to look east at the dedicated passenger locomotives     the prrs a goldmine of experimental steam technology baldwin threw out all the conventional wisdom and went allin with unconventional designs in the twilight of the steam era as a lastditch effort to keep steam on the rails the prr optimistic about its future and unaware of their approaching doom was more than willing to bankroll these efforts thus you got crazy offthewall designs that represented the apex of fast steam technology     if anyone couldve cooked the duck they could
  it still might if the t1 trust gets their way
    its just that i saw this train simulator race between 844 and mallard and when 844 broke its steam chest it started accelerating and overtaking mallard thats why i asked
  calling bullshit on that  only express passenger engines got to those sorts of speeds with any regularity      built for 90 did 6070 in actual service design performance versus practice and there were places where they could find their performance cap out west in the us and canada the potential was often limited by the rolling stock and how much load they had    now days you are lucky if you have a passenger train that can go over 79mph
  since this is the only board that would care about this kind of thing    that model for the fallout 4 steam engine was taken from the artists existing portfolio like circa 2010 and just got cleaned up dont try to read anything off the model its not like they looked at existing concepts or tried to design their own atomic loco from scratch    adam adamowicz would have god i miss him
  the cutest kind
  would anyone actually let them
  theres a recorded fine for the pennsylvania 6446 s1 class traveling at 140 mph on the mainline this not an official speed record but the pennsy did pay the fine
  there is an issue with accuracy here and for pennsy it was a matter of prestige in the form of oopsie look how fast we are going kind of prestige    there are apocryphal reports of steam engines breaking all kinds of records in the us railroads and it is quite possible that the actual record is above the 126mph those weird pennsy and nyc locomotives could probably speed up to 126    that being said  no dyno measurement means no reward bongs were dilligent thus they get the trophy
  publicity is a good thing and quality of infrastructure now is much higher then in the forties so  yeah they might especially if they sell it as some sort of charity
  yeah but theyd want halfadozen safety systems and youd have to shut down most of whatever line they were on plus theres only 33 miles at the moment where you can actually go above 125 mph
  i simply dont care about the speed record official or not american locomotives were better in every way than their british counterparts
  quality of infrastructure now is much higher then in the forties  absolutely untrue with the exception of welded rail
  except looks and they were built for different countries with different needs and requirements so comparing them is rather stupid horses for courses after all
  except looks  nope not even there british locomotives look like toys to me
  they look elegant
  at a minimum this would give new meaning to the phrase train wreck
whats the feasibility of nuclear steam turbine engine locomotive
  zero
  dont forget britain having a stupidly tiny loading gauge      i prefer the french ones in that regard
  chapélon was one of the best steam engine designers ever  id love to see his 6000hp steam engine range be built especially the 2104
    there was a semiserious proposal using an aqueous reactor type the x12    atomicskiesblogspotcom/2012/07/topeoriabyatomhtml
    more recently sandia nationa labs work on krusty is leading to a new heat pipe based design called kilopower the next step after kilopower is megapower a roughly container sized reactor using a combo of heatpipes and supercritical co2 power cycles sco2 turbines are stupid small for their rated power and due to the hot sco2 cycle direct air cooling is readily feasible arguably if someone wanted to try megapower isnt a bad start    at least compared to holos which is all sorts of strange    osfio/c2ur8/    not to mention the crazy boeing patent for a pulsed laser fusion jet engine which could be used as a turboshaft i suppose
  well the t1 trust is going to equip ptc like basically all of the steam operators are required to do now so that takes care of the safety system requirement    ive been told that the only exception steam locomotives will get for ptc implementation is that they will not be required to have an automatic throttle cutoff thatll be up to the engineer the brakes will still deploy automatically but not the throttle this is apparently due to some quirk of steam engine design where pulling the throttle to zero so quickly can cause equipment damage    if amtrak continues to be an ass about excursions in the year 202x they can always try the pueblo train testing facility im pretty sure they have a testing loop with a large enough radius to being the t1 to top speed      eh it varies most track maintenance is nowhere near the old standards yes but in the areas where speed has remained a priority modern computer precision kicks the ass of the precision they had back then    one of my favorite railroads the fec has track on their mainline that would absolutely blow away anything they ran back in the streamliner days course the fecs such a freaking oddball of a railroad that its not really a fair comparison theyre basically an oldfashioned class i thats managed to survive intact without being merged
  modern trackage carries fourfive times the tonnage the old stick rail did and still remains well done where machines laid the track  so every mainline these days  the quality of the track is superb    in yeolde times maintenance of fixed plant was done so dilligently because rails ballast and other stuff were pure garbage in comparison to what gets laid today
    the machines are better and more precise if you can get track  time to fix the problem the undercutter comes through once a year if that on most subdivisions and is only there for a week before it goes to the next only the worst mud spots get it habitual spots reappear not to mention new spots that get a 25 slow order slapped on them for months or more    we definitely carry more tonnage now and it shows there is no emphasis on keeping speeds up or minimizing the slow orders the mantra is to do as little as possible to get your annual bonus
  in the old times railroads were doing the same goddamn thing its called capitalism where you want to get most  in profits for least  in investments
  epic response good sir    even though trains ran faster years ago and there were double or triple the number of track gangs fixing bad spots quickly and no one was deferring maintenance to get a bonus at the end of the year    post paystub or stfu
  like basically all of the steam operators are required to do now  even on heritage lines in the uk you can get an exemption if youre one and all of them do
  if youre hauling passengers no exception  its a big contributor to the difficulties steam excursions have been facing recently second only to amtraks stonewalling of them    to put it into uk terms the excursions arent being allowed to use the passenger mainlines anymore they can negotiate with the private freight railways with varying success but the national passenger rail networks offlimits now thanks to anderson
why does amtrak owe you space on their mainlines
  it doesnt noone says that amtrak cant kick off the operators  they clearly have the authority to do so what people are asking is why    anderson claims its for capacity but i dont buy that were not talking about the nec here these are lightlyscheduled longdistance trains the freight companies are really the ones that should be grumbling not amtrak    theres some logic in the discontinuance of hitching private cars to the back of trains  there are actual time penalties that incurs but ive yet to understand the justification for preventing excursions independently of regular amtrak service    the one good thing to come out of the disastrous privatization of br is the openaccess mandate as long as you can pay the cost you get a time slot doesnt matter if your trains steam diesel or electric if it can physically run on the tracks you paid for you can run it there
  ah are you talking about steam operators on the mainline you cant get an exemption for that in the uk but do heritage lines separate from the main network need ptc
  you would need to deal with the owners of the mainlines then not amtrak
  yes    if youre carrying passengers in the us after december 31st you must have ptc there are no exceptions for any type of passenger operation    small freight lines class iis and iiis do get an exception as long as they dont have amtrak or carry certain amounts of hazardous freight on that particular line but no passenger railroad under fra jurisdiction will be allowed to go ptcless
video of union pacific 3985 4664 challenger pulling 143 double stack well cars up archer hill at 35 mph in 2008  
  britain having a stupidly tiny loading gauge  they always look so much bigger when people arent in the photo
  pulling the lightest trains with the exception of empties and pigs    thats supposed to impress me
  i really dont give two shits what you think its a steam locomotive operating on a modern mainline hauling modern frieght i think its pretty cool you can go beat off to the forty billion variants of the sd70 for all i care have fun
  i chuckled
  huh in the uk heritage lines dont even have to stuff like aws or meet disabillity legislation but they are nearly always restricted to a maximum of 25mph theres also no sign of it changing but then i dont think america really has the conception of a railway run by amateurs for the sake of historical preservation the same way the uk
  its not impressive if it was hauling 100 cars of coal that would be impressive
  and
  we do there are a number of heritage railroads around the country the one closest to me is the north alabama railroad museum they have 7 miles of line north of the city of huntsville and run excursions theyre not connected to any other railroad so they get all kinds of exemptions and thief operations are entirely by volunteers
  i hope you dont expect a six axle steam locomotive to outpull a modern diesel big boy would get owned by a current 4400hp diesel challenger even more so    also  8 images of captcha in a row fuck you google
  sounds pretty small fry compared to the volunteerrun operations in the uk  they get all kinds of exemptions  but presumably not an exemption from ptc
digital ptc screens in a steam locomotive
  for the most part theres very little that can be done with regards to this  in the uk steam locomotives have to fitted with aws and tpws to be legally allowed to run on the mainlines  in ireland the law allows for steam locomotives to be exempted from having caws  in germany steam locomotives have to be fitted with pzb 90 and while a lot of steam locomotives were initally fitted with induzi which was a precusor system pzb 90 is a software upgrade to the system  in france steam locomotives have to be fitted with kvb in order to operate on the conventional lines even though le crocodile is still in use in some parts of france as a form of redundancy    in scotland the radio electronic token block systems implementation meant that any trains going into scottish highland lines needed to have a radio system and retb system as well this includes steam locomotives which have managed to fit both inside  in wales the cambrian line replaced its retb system with a etcs level 2 system in order to allow for a modernised signalling system no steam locomotive has run on the cambrian line since the introduction of the etcs system as it would mandate not only the metrification of the dials and instruments on board for km/h but would also necessitate a digital display system to be able to indicate cab signalling for movement authority and speed limits    with the modernisation of train protection systems its going to be much harder to have steam trains which dont have some kind of modern cab signalling especially in europe as etcs starts taking over etcs level 1 is being implemented across several rail corridors in europe but new lines are getting level 2 its only a matter of time before level 3 starts being implemented
  this is how british loading gauge feels to an american
the germans who else had to come up with an insane and completely megalomaniac scheme to build the biggest and most badass train ever with a 3000mm gauge gauges up to 4 meters were considered there were even ideas with 9meter gauge with 4storey waggons
  whats wrong with that its just some small screens and that in the cab the actual operation of the locomotive doesnt change a bit besides in the uk at least preserved lines can operate without it      do you have a source on this i cant find anything about us heritage railroads fitting ptc except one article about two locomotive owners doing it to continue operating on the mainline not doing it to continue operating on heritage railroads
  there isnt really a distinction between mainline and heritage railroads in the us narrowgauge steam railroads like the durango and silverton are the exception not the rule    most american steam operations run over active railroads still in commercial use whether they contract with amtrak or negotiate directly with the owner of the rightofway these are active rail lines if perhaps lightlyused and are treated as such the mainline vs heritage distinction as exists in the uk has no direct american counterpart
    mainly having any kind of digital control system in a steam engine is lame and gay
  its got precedence for example the pennsylvania railroad was a world leader in electronic signals and equipped many of their steam engines with them    this is the same idea just with more advanced technology
  narrowgauge steam railroads like the durango and silverton are the exception not the rule  do these have to fit ptc though
  nigga thats a gg1
  so i went and looked it up and youre right there does appear to be an exemption for nonmainline operators     the reason i put that term in quotes is i feel like the term mainline has a different connotation here in the us than in the uk union pacifics steamers may not run on the mainline of the railroad but they still need ptc if theyre pulling passengers over union pacific tracks on the other hand nobodys going to be breaking down the doors of disneylands headhouse demanding their railroad become ptc compliant any time soon
  i found one with the signals on the right side of the cab
  i knew you were correct but i wanted to give you a hard time
  im not even the one that posted the gg1 but thanks
  i was the one that posted the gg1 and i found the exact same picture as you only to get the duplicate image error message because you posted it a few seconds earlier
  mainline in the uk when talking about these matters usually means network rail there isnt really a different connotation it still means the proper rail lines in this context
  modern locomotives outperform 70 year old designs this is an amazing insight maybe next you could tell us how modern turbofan engine jetliners out preform 70 year old piston powered aircraft and how a modern honda civic is superior to a ford model t
  ill ask the next time im over there
why didnt garratts catch on in the us
  same way that tank engines didnt catch on  long distances and heavy loads need big fuel and water supplies far more than a locomotive could carry without a tender
type c62largest and strongest steam loco in japan
  garratts had tenders though
by the way everyone  a little cool event happened a while ago that steam locomotive and shinkansen run in parallel  people who want to know more can search twitter or something slこまちsl komachi  people who love steam locomotives should have seen it
  coal is one of the most polluting fuels there is  never going to be as efficient as diesel although later steam engines managed to improve their efficiency  takes 3 hours to start up diesels you just press a button  got to rake out the ashes at the end of the day as well generally just more labour intensive  yes i love steam as much as anyone but if youre trying to run a business diesel or electric makes much more sense
  strongest steam loco  isnt that a bit like winning the special olympics
  up just finished the front half of the 4014
  they had water tenders so they still didnt have enough coal capacity  you need the coal close to the firebox as it doesnt flow like water does though oil feeling would solve this
  have you seen a garratt before
  yeah  just wondering how you would propose to get coal from the front to the back or how youd get 3040 tons of coal on the rear power unit
  rear tender next to the cab holds the coal    do you think they never existed anon
  thats not a tender a tender is a separate wagon
  oh youre just autistic my bad
    get btfo  just call the other guy autistic
  literally being this autistic about terminology while also being a complete dumbass about garratts    nothing personnel
  do you understand the concept of a context
    jet pulverizer and air pipe blast feed as in some late steam age prototypes
  as in a separate container with its own wheels or are you talking about the bunker over the rear set of driving wheels
  actually what would work is mechanical stoker from a separate container into the rear bunker which then has a stoker into the firebox  at that point you may as well have a mallet
  stop sperging faggot      theres no reason why the bunker couldnt be enlarged to north american standards
    in france steam locomotives have to be fitted with kvb in order to operate on the conventional lines even though le crocodile is still in use in some parts of france as a form of redundancy    for the few steam locomotives still allowed to run on conventional lines in france none have been equipped with kvb and good luck to fit one
let me try this again is there any reason why the garratt was never tested or used in north america
  probably notinventedhere syndrome same with condensing tenders
  well either that or being the valedictorian of your graduating class since they amount to the same thing
  pretty good reason shame it would have been cool to see a ussized garratt
anyone here like articulateds
  mallets werent invented in the us either though
  i pronounce it with a hard t at the end b/c thats how i grew up saying it malley just doesnt sound right even though it is
    wonder why prr didnt try though in late era steam
  just reading over the wikipedia page and i think it wasnt adopted in the us because there wasnt any real advantage to the design on american railroads    so the idea seems to be that by putting more power into an engine you could cram more engine into the same space and save costs by not doubleheading and having to pay two crews    thats not a very big advantage in the us as outside of the northeast very few railways were sizeconstrained weve always had a very generous loading gauge so when we needed more power we just made the locomotive bigger curve radius was a bigger deal to us than trackside clearance      ironically the t1 came about to replace the rising costs the pennsy was incurring by doubleheading k4s and i think it proves my point not only is it a huge engine its not even articulated even in the northeast track clearance was never that big a deal for us
  oh also axle loadings huge issue in europe barely even cared about in america    typical axle load limit in america is roughly 36 us tons 33 tonnes but theres a push to upgrade to 39 us tons 36 tonnes in comparison the uic spec is rouhly 22 us tons 20 tonnes    so weights never been that big a deal for us burgers either which is not surprising
  well disneyland uses a dieselsteam loco on its railway which it has because disney was a massive autist pioneer of american anime built a personal railroad in his backyard built a railway at disneyland despite being called foolish for doing so and memed monorails into reality so theres that
  the problem with any nuclear vehicle is the shielding both to prevent irradiation during operation and to prevent disaster in case of a crash we have designs for nuclear trains planes and rockets but the shielding required to make them safe kills them
  only the wildlife express and hong kongs railroad are steamoutline diesel the rest land world tokyo and paris are legitimate steam
  uic max axle load is 225 tonnes so 248 short tons
  for small heritage lines out here where i live they manage to make it economical plenty of fat tourists to haul up the mountain the engines burn recycled oil and they have their own machine shop on site
  you could probably make a steam engine as efficient as a diesel  porta inspired modified hunslet austerities could reach close to 900hp      its an old website but has a lot of good info
union pacific 4014 rebuild update  
have you guys heard about the coalition for sustainable rail  theyve got a project to restore  soup up an old santa fe 464 using new methods and theories  if youre interested in the theory theyre using to improve performance give these a read over        very nice will be glorious to see it steaming again
  baldwin built santa fe hudsons were beasts they werent so much stretched pacifics as they were cut down northerns
what were the reputations of alco baldwin and lima who was considered the best were there any defining characteristics of each
  i heard that alco was the worst of them
  its definitely got an aura of power  csr are looking at boosting the power so they can get up to 130mph or more
  the c62 steam locomotive has a maximum speed record of 129 km / h  this is the fastest record as a steam locomotive running on a 1064 mm gauge track
  it honestly depends on the era and the locomotives themselves alco was a conglomeration of smaller locomotive builders that came together as a single company so early in the 20th century the quality of an alco locomotive varied according to which formerly independent shop it came from by the 1920s older designs had been phased out older shops had been closed or relegated to manufacturing components and designs had been standardized across the seven formerly independent companies lima was the biggest steam manufacturer alco was second ad baldwin the third largest new york central chose alco to build the j class hudsons and ended up buying 265 j1 j2 and j3 class locomotives baldwin vwas more focused on high quality and small orders of specialized locomotives often designing and building small runs of a class designed specifically for a customer that were as small as a single custom built unit lima churned out massive powerhouse locomotives using their super power design principles for the class one railroads
patiently waiting until this canadian beauty gets to steam again 
heres the sncf 160a1  rebuilt from an old compound 2100 chapelon added an extra set of drivers and new cylinders making it a 6 cylinder behemoth 2 hp cylinders drove the 4th axle 2 outside lp drove the 3rd axle and 2 inside lp drove the 2nd axle  this locomotive was designed so well that the fuel and coal consumption dropped below 20mph something that doesnt happen in conventionally designed locomotives and making it perfect for drag freights  it was no slouch either being able to reach 59mph and output 2750hp
bump
    this one  link is a spec sheet and diagram all in metric and i had to go digging through a french forum to find it  pretty interesting as it shows a 0º/90º/135º pattern for the lp/lp/hp cylinders would have thought that the balance would be a bit off      a belpaire originally meant a perpendicular stay connection between the inner firebox and outer firebox meaning a stronger connection that was easier to manufacture  the belpaire firebox also had more steam space and surface area at the firebox crown allowing for greater steam production in a given space  lima were even planning on making a double belpaire with the lower half of the combustion chamber being squared off to allow for more flues and tubes and increase steam rates pic related    however the belpaire was far more difficult and complicated to fit to the boiler and the square shoulders dont allow boilers near to the maximum loading gauge which is why many rrs didnt bother with them
anyone like the jgr class 7100
  absolutely this was my favourite steamer in my childhood
  the locomotives were outfitted with cow catchers smokestacks bell oil lamp headlights and a wooden cab all typical of american locomotive design practice     no wonder they look so much like american 260 moguls never heard of this class but now i love it more pics
jgr the pre jnr    also the three year old thread is listing
my favourite is benkei
this is a replica running a diesel engine in the tender it was the main locomotive at the now demolished nara dreamland opened 1961 theme park which was once going to be the japanese disneyland and was essentially a clone of the original disneyland    anyway the park closed in 2006 and demolition started late 2016 everything left in the park was destroyed rides equipment vehicles including a pink cadillac and fire truck however i belive this locomotive was saved as it was hauled out of its storage location inside a tunnel placed near a road entry and covered in a tarp    im trying to find out what happened to it did it get moved to a park or museum or something maybe theyre going to put into the new housing estate they build on the land in a park or shopping area or something i dont know does anyone have any connections with japanese train fans that might know or atleast have a better idea of what to search for or where online
  full size replica
  it also had 2 replica carriages but i fear they may have been destroyed
  the park also had a replica of locomotive number 1 and 2 carriages but from what little information i could find on a japanese forum i got the impression they were destroyed from the wording of the translation
the brits have better aesthetic sense as usual
  its a steam engine so on principle i cant not like it
hello fellows i was curious if there are anyone who could guide me i am btech mechanical engineer and want to get into seagoing shipping industry specifically to become cadet engineer and then in the future rank up to 3rd or 2nd engineer is it worth doing masters degree in marine engineering as far as i understand it is more managment level not operational
  what did you say
soon
a video i live in ridgely and was able to hear this beautiful sound do you have any idea when she will be complete
what is this where is this
this is the western maryland scenic railways restoration of 1309 a co mallet
  look at this qt anon mother of god
  thats cool when do they think it will be completed and where will they run it
  where will they run it  from cumberland maryland to frostburg maryland no idea on when it will be finished though
shouldnt they focus on dragging america into the first world before restoring obsolete relics
  dang bro sorry your parents dis owned youwhats the reason you hate steam engines
  because history and heritage is important to the identity of a nation    also theyre fucking aesthetic
  fuck thats hot
  but why is the identity of a nation important
  implying us isnt first world  lets just get the shitflinging over with so we can get back to the thread
  since the first item is impossible so the focus is the second one now
childhood is thinking that steam engines and trolleys are boring adulthood is realizing theyre superior
any of you into it i recently bought a skateboard and im just starting to land ollies but i had a cruiser for a very long time what brands do you like the most any tricks youve been trying to land specifically
these are my two boards by the way
  any of you into it  not anymore since im old now but i still follow it a little andy anderson is the new goat      
  never too old to pick it up again anon unless youre ashamed to skate in public or something
get a board from a deluxe brand krooked anti hero or real in size 825 mob griptape independent trucks size 149 54 mm spitfire formula 4s 99a durometer and 1 inch hardware of whatever brand dont long board its a fucking cop out for frat boys and stoners go to your local skate shop or order from socal skates or ccs dont support zumiez its corporate mall tier bullshit thats spreading corny trap music and hood culture like a disease throughout skateboarding and society as a whole go to the skatepark to learn stay out the way watch skatevideos to determine whos legit and who is a kook if youre into /out/ stuff i recommend watching anti hero videos they go on cool trips to skateparks in remote places and sleep in tents destination unknown tent city and the beauty and the beast tour videos are all /out/ as fuck
  desu i only have my cruiser because its my only way to get around the citynot really invested on it and yeah ive gone to the skatepark and also on some roads where no car passes cause im embarassed
 ergers syndrome
  so is darkstar bad tought they were decent
  darkstar has been cheaply made in china for big box store retail for 15 years they still have real hard rock maple boards for their pros who skate for them but those are not lately available for the consumer market if you buy a complete skateboard out of a box chances are its not legit no single skate company or distrobution makes all of the best parts so no company can sell a legit pre packaged board the parts i listed above are the most popular parts and would make for the best beginner skateboard there are plenty of other quality brands making each parts and a million other tweaks you can make to each part that is all for you to find out after your own experiments
  nothing wrong with a nice cruiser as long as it turns well and has nice wheels i love riding my cruiser to the liquor store to pick up a six pack
  ive skated for a long time i normally go spitfire 54s indy hollows swiss bearings and whatever deck has a shape i like there are so many deck companies right now so it makes more sense to go by manufacturer i typically only get decks manufactured by bbs mfg but ps stix makes some good decks theories of atlantis distro company that made a few limited run decks so i just copped on of those because the shape is great and i loved my traffic and polar decks i had a 917 deck last yer that might have been my favorite of all time i am pretty sure ps stix manufactured that one my last deck was a fancylad also a really great deck       fakie fs heel is something ive been trying a lot recently but i have to admit ive kind of been ignoring my deck for other interests that happens sometimes
  sometimes you are just not feeling it anon
  917 quasi fa and all other new hip brands besides polar and doomsayers tend to be ps stix wow its like the slap messages boards moved to /out/
  slap of highspeed
  landyachtz or nothing  but skatings for literal faggots
  imagine thinking landyachtz boards are good
  dont long board its a fucking cop out for frat boys and stoners  i for one dont agree with you hating on longboards but then i put my mind into it a bit more   if i want to get to places faster should i just buy wheels and trucks made for longboards and put them on a regular board  i bet longboards are faster but only by a little you know the whole being straight so it cuts through the wind so not enough for me to care so what do you think
  if you were going that route youd need risers and to make sure that the width of the deck isnt too far off from the width of the trucks but you have the right idea speed is really dependent on the wheel size small  more acceleration low max speed big  less acceleration high max speed longboards tend to be heavier and a bigger pain in the ass to carry around
  thanks i knew about the risers but damn im going to have to book up on correct truck sizes relative to the boards  thanks anon i wouldve bought whatever trucks someone recommends for their board size
hey /n/ do you guys have regular skate threads
  no those go on /asp/
  the skate general thread in /asp/ is /esg/
  thats gonna be really hard to push if you want something efficient to ride go for a drop through deck with big wheels
  how is it hard to push i have a regular skate deck with longboard trucks and wheels and its fine
should cager expressways be placed underground and out of sight
  yes it will reduce number of idiots driving significantly
ideally but that would surely be prohibitively expensive
  thats not really underground its just a typical trenched highway that happened to be capped
   hates them    spends a lot of money to let them enjoy an exclusive space below you still there   hence a meme    pic   loks like simply at ground level covered with overhead landscape deck might be a more acceptable solution but the same can be achieved with noise barriers on the sides and a simple roof thats not burying them as what you implied using noise barriers instead of retaining walls would be easier for construction and maintenance and the structural requirement and complexity will be less with a plain concrete structure without more elaborate tunnel support rooftop greening would be a significant load due to soil trees and permeation   would love to cover sunken roads more but personally i like elevated and embanked roads the most
  oh you might be right i  only paid attention to the slope on the right and assumed its at groundlevel
  the point is the let the two sides of the expressway be reunited
  hopefully it traps all the pollution in and they die while passing through when they dont have the entire planets atmosphere to absorb their mess
no they should simply be eliminated
  honestly with the amount of exhaust and ventilation required would mean more power plants and thus a ton more pollution for everyone    here i have a unique idea lets just burn the entire earth and kill everyone and be done with it
  we can build it as a pilot project and say all future projects will be like this then because it was so expensive we toll it massively so either it ends up only being used by the rich or closes entirely      this highways as built are just being filled up by induced demand perhaps not eliminated but vastly reduced
no costs too much
  i think we should put you underground and out of sight op about six feet under to be precise
old thread no longer updating     ive riden 36 km today including my commute and my 2 hours of deliveroo riding it was a good day trying to make my best of the early autumn conditions before shit gets flandrigan
  i fucked up heres the link    
77km getting groceries here  went to maastricht did ride a little there and went back    downsides  lost inner tube strapped to saddle rail  25mm tires and cobble are no fun    upsides  bikeshop on route was open  most of the bikepaths where great  practised descending position    what position except for superman should i try for descending next time
snow in the forecast for tomorrow fucking snow high of 3c 3 solid weeks of shit weather aside from thursday which was at least sunny ive been taking my rigid mtb out more lately since i dont mind as much getting that one muddy
  sit on top tube legs crossed around steering tube be sure to film it
  that sounds rather unstable
  get 30mm tires bud
saw a pupper get hit by a car today    there was a litterof about 15 puppers with their momma crossing a road 3 cars had stopped the litter crossed then there was one straggler slowly meandering along one of the cars hit the gas to try to get across before the straggler made it ran right into him    it was a chevy too fucking chevy owners are cunts
riding the other day
that was a good race there was really good riders there a dixie guy beat all the road bikers you know how i knew there was good riders more people got hit by cars and ran into walls and managed to pedal out of it than the people who are shit from it i got cut off while experienceing speedwobble and sent into a wall and rode out of it and later on the guy who cut me off got his rear end hit by a car but his giant basket was full of beer and acted as a weight to keep the front end going straight as his backend got knocked out
  
  is that a gun holster bacon
  not going to happen since i like to go fast and most roads are good enough to go down to 23 or 19 mm although my frame fits 35 mm
  you can go just as fast on 35mm tires
  no because they have significantly higher deformation losses and aerodynamic drag than 25mm while offering only marginaly lower suspension losses on a normal road  by adjusting pressure on my 25mm tires i can alter the ballance between deformation and suspensionlosses to a certain degree for different roads    9 bar  perfectly smooth  5 bar  rather smooth  4 bar  little rough  3 bar  verry rough some risk of pinchflats  2 bar  only good for gravel high risk of pinchflats    5 bar is my goto pressure as it is the fastest on most roads  however if i was riding mainly on cobble you might be correct since here the much higher suspension losses outweight the deformation losses  but at that point my 26/225 hardtail would probably be more appropriate anyway

25 miles in the suburbs rolling through two neighborhoods where the roads are built but not the houses yet    60 degrees cool enough thst it was the first time since april ive had to take a pee break on a normal ride luckily i found a mexican space shuttle at one of the homesites    half built neighborhoods are so comfy to ride in
  oh yeah i had favorable winds and maxpressure got a top ten on a well travelled sprint segment 2 other prs on longer flat segments
  and now we know that you are new around here

  it wouldnt be late summer if you didnt pick a whole bunch of apples that arent yours then eat way too many in one sitting and get the apple shits
swap out shitass panaracer tour tires for slightly less shitass skinwall pasela pts that i had lying around  go on a 13 mile ride with 1500 of climbing  demolish previous times set on the same bike on the same segments  was it the tires or the tasty fried chicken i mashed down my face last night
  was the tailwind generated by said fried chicken
ahhhhh springs here
  dont be talking shit about panaracer ive got good tyres from then that ive done 315 km brevets on without any flats and doing a decent pace    my shitty news is it looks like i have an infected ingrown toenail so i may not be able to ride for a few weeks in the near future 
  chill brah they make good tires but you get what you pay for tour is the lowest of their low end made in china wouldnt be shocked to find that theyre rebranded csts roll extremely poorly and have little puncture protection pasela pts are ok as fuck gravelkings are only 10 more and are much better their race evo3 tires are outstanding they make a lot of good mtb tires too then theres the grand bois/jack brown/compass stuff which are nice although in the case of the compass el maaaaaybe not worth 80 per

  love you bro
i was contemplating getting another ice spiker pro for my mtb to replace the schwalbe winter in the rear but since ive got a fat bike fork on the bike i decided to get a bontrager gnarwhal 38 tire for winter fun and put my current ice spiker in the back i have plenty of salvaged studs from old tires so i got the unstudded version to save some bucks    chainreaction has a pretty good price on 26 x 21 ice spiker pros great tire for uneven ice that forms on side streets    sunny and 8c for tomorrow which is fantastic weather compared to the shit we had the past week
went out trail grinding today ended up with 75 miles but my drivetrain was begging for mercy at the end found a great brewery along the way    first 30 miles no problem aside from a flooded section from an earlier rain  wet trail grit getting kicked up past the fenders when the trail went to gravel at mile 30 no bueno   find a brewery off the trail with 24 beers on tap pic related was solid  10 chance of rain got shit on around mile 50 the one shelter i found was flooded recently with several inches of mud on everything figure riding in the shit is better than standing in it   the last 25 miles were a horror of grinding sounds    and that kids is how you burn your only day off this week
  took the boomer machine for a spin at a local park i had a very interesting conversation with a homeless man about his bike and how he uses it
  true that chevy owners are all dicks
50k comfy ride through ultra flat deserted rural roads to camp in a nearby pond   its spring here so beautyful absolutely no one in the place so great because i love solitude  bikebags and no bikepacking because it was a short trip and i like to carry a bottle of wine a little grill and some meat for a one person barbecue  coming back for a longer road its still dry season so dusty as fuck but great anyway
          i love that baconator loves horseys always delivering the sweet horse pics

  also this place 
  looks extremely comfy
  it is but also located in the middle of an ethernal plane a green desert of basedbean fields flat and green as a billiard table  so to get to a decent uneveness of the ground you have to ride at least 200km through mad traffic highways or an alternate 300km through rural roads and it can get a little boring  so dayly rides are flat and always look the same and theres no relatively close interesting place to go but this pond    but i dont complain too much at least now i can get out of the small city i live in in no more that 15 min go to a river watch beautiful sunsets everyday   used to live in buenos aires and riding there was hell to get out of the city you have to ride tens of km throuhg super dangerous traffic and bike thiefs are a thing all the time
  basedbean  basedbean wtf
    wtf /n/    im trying to type porotos de soja in english

   getting owned  well im not posting too often and i think is the first time i write soya in 4chan
i didnt have to stop once on my commute today 2 miles of riding through nyc graceful and without any encumbrance i had some music on then got a bacon egg and cheese from the deli across from campus bliss/10

have good job  awesome bike commute 25 miles daily  get kind of bored of job after 6 years  quit job get a new one  enjoy the work get along well with the guys  quickly realize new commute is boring as hell  too short and uninspiring  dont look forward to riding anymore  start driving and taking the ferry  getting weak  getting tired  getting depressed    6 months later cant do it anymore  get old job back  start bike commuting again  seeing those same old sights  the bluejays on the trail  the old man walking his dog  the jogger  the guy waiting at the bus stop  getting strong again  having energy  feelsgoodmanpng    i quit my job because i missed my old commute i realized that the ride was what got me through the week more than anything its like being reunited with an old friend im happy and comfy again even if a bit bored nothing that a couple of rides at 630am and 4pm cant take care of
did a 65km mtb tour today with 1150m elevation also saw this train pass by are trainfags even in this thread anyways forgot to bring enough water and started feeling shit at km52 or so also

its that time of the year again boys i love raiding abandoned orchards
temperature has only reached 10c 3 times since midseptember today its only getting up to 0 the middle of this week is looking pretty nice and saturday is supposed to hit 18c it looks like 30 kph  winds though
  give them back tyrone
  i dont think anyones going to mind
  fond memories of biking up in my blue roadmaster as a kid and picking apples at the abandoned orchard

  burgers n bikes
sure enough there were 2 more segments before these that i happened to miss very windy ride it was much warmer but didnt really feel it
  thatll do pig     thatll do
  i was thinking more    where a isa da pizza    and briek is like i fuckin swear bruv
i was doing some maintenance yesterday waiting for it to warm up i saw the rd guide pulley teeth on my old rigid mtb had worn down to sharp points again there dont seem to be many places online where you can get small parts like that a few amazon sellers had it for a very rapey price and as in 9 times out of 10 i ended up having to order it on ebay    until then im using a guide pulley from a bbb universal kit i bought last time i wore it out unlike the shimano part the universal one has not lateral play last time i tried that one it didnt shift well no issue this time though
  thats a short giraffe
  nah its a regular sized giraffe youre just used to seeing bacon sitting down
how the hell do my fellow burgers ride to the grocery store and around town where i live there are pretty much zero bike lanes off campus but i want to start hauling my groceries since i dont have a car and want to stay active on my off days
  most people use a big ass wald style wire basket attached to the front frame and a milk crate attached to the back rack thats good for 4 full grocery bags
  if i understand your question correctly the answer is that riding on most roads in us cities sucks but we do it anyways claim your lane
did some light touring

got up to 20c both yesterday at today but it was windy both days used up the last of my stock of chains yesterday and ordered some more reached 10000 km for the year today toward the end of next year i should reach 100000 logged km    the few remaining unharvested fields look ok despite having been snowed on a few times

i went around and rode 75 miles today looping around and around my neighborhood and covering some new roads they just built loosed the legs a bit    it felt good to go out and just ride without any sort of goal in mind and without expecting to go for 20 miles    i was feeling cooped up and bored and now i feel great the bike may be magic bros
  horses   xd
finally had some higher temps than 45 degrees so i got a nice ride in i really should get some warmer kit so i can go out on the colder days    went up this pretty popular climb just outside of town for the first time it was great but going down again was terribly cold also the lighting when i got to the top was awful so please excuse the terrible photo
  here are the stats from strava in case anyone cares
      looks like a fun climb i miss big long hills none where im at is that an m30
  nah its a 2008 onix i believe i got a really good deal on it from a guy in my dads cycling club and its still running well the guy who owned it took very good care of it     also i see i wasnt very clear in my original post the ride wasnt just the climb the climb itself is only like 5kms long pretty steep though some small sections of like 1315 i just tacked that on to one of my normal routes pic related is the profile
rode over to a soon to open costco to verify my mapping of the parking lot by riding up and down the lanes clearly the site diagram on the developers website was drawn to scale because the roads i laid out a few months back are nearly perfect    wind was picking up to 50 km/h again on the way back home unlike yesterdays ride i decided to stay in town where there was some shelter tomorrow is the first time in a week with a very light wind
  i like this autism very much do you contribute to openstreetmap
  yes the picture is the josm desktop editor which is much more powerful and fast than the web editor once you get past the learning curve    the fall is a fun time as all the construction projects start wrapping up and there is plenty of new stuff to go map since satellite imagery only gets updated every couple of years gps traces are needed for new roads most of the time    i started editing the local area after i put osm on my edge 800 and could as i was riding how much was missing or wrong very poorly drawn roads would make the garmin go crazy when navigating i found a government repository of road data and ended up doing a ton of cleanup for a few hundred thousand sq km
came up to some guy with carbon rims and dura ace so i wheel sucked a bit made sure to announce before i did this at a stoplight i attempt to strike up a conversation yet he only responds in single word answers mind you this guy is at least 10 years my senior light turns red 1 mile later i pass him and he never gets back what is it that makes cycling such a magnet to anti social losers i though the older generation might be more social but even they are prunes
  man finally some time to myself  ok this guy wants to draft ok whatever   shit now he wants to talk  better let him go on his way before he invites me to dinner
  yeah cept we were both commuting if he wasnt on his morning routine maybe id understand his timidity
  u inspri me
  does the edge 800 automatically update the installed maps im assuming it doesnt but you never know i got my dads old 800 when he replaced it with a wahoo and i havent bothered with the maps yet but id wager its well overdue for an update
  to update the map you have to replace the img file with a newer one the edge 800 is a usb 1 device so file copies are super slow for maps over 50 mb you are better off removing the micro sd card and putting it in a card reader    i usually just generate a map for my area since i dont travel much
    i ride way out in the country so the few times i run into a roadie they always want to talk ill even adjust my route so we can ride together for a bit midwest winds can be brutal and its nice to have a second to split the leadout duty     plus old dudes are funny to ride with nobody under 40 rides a modern road bike im mid 30s and ride one but ive never seen anyone my age or younger
  yeah thats what i thought i dont personally use the maps that much but if the time comes where ill actually need to it would be nice to have updated maps ill look into it soon i guess
mighty marathon gt penetrated    im a bit surprised the replacement tube stayed up but it seems to be ok so much for leaving work early though

  good grief    ive only done deliveroo and commutes for the past few weeks but have scheduled a bike ride with some    friends    on sunday i havent done a ride in a bike with gears in what seems like forever well see how it goes
this was supposed to be a 300km brevet with 3k elevation but we ended up doing it on two rides saturday and sunday back to back it was a good decision shit was pretty brutal
seemly simple things end up frustrating the hell out of me i was trying to measure my saddle height but kept getting different measurements each time i tried due to lining up differently with the seat tube each time  fuck you parallax i think the solution to this one is to buy a 3 ft straight edge and attach a guide in the middle that rests against the seat tube so i get consistent measurements
went for a nice ride on monday after a big storm on sunday and found some lightning blasted a huge hole in our 90 million dollar over river bikeway /

25 miles in the chilly mist today here in kc autumn colors are out in full force despite us having a ton of rain this month
i just rode to the store and purchased some cannabis from my new local drug dealer the federal government    now we can all be numb to the never ending flood of fake refugees and migrants
got a wind assisted kom on a road new enough that a faster rider hasnt got a wind assisted kom yet also got 2nd place missing first by 2 seconds on a segment close enough that its in my privacy zone next time the wind is mostly west ill make an effort to go kom that one in order to get that one to register i have to go down a gravel road about 100 meters to get out of my privacy zone
dearfish
  solid tires wins again
went riding today in chilly weather and it started raining the parts of my body that got wet are all pink since they got really cold my arms and legs look like i have sunburn wrapped up warm and cosy now though
first brevet of the 2019 season is coming up this saturday forecast has 3c for overnight low and 3c for the daytime high im not sure i want to do 200 km at that temperature the wind forecast later this week will end up being the deciding factor    i find riding solo in the cold easier since i can adjust exertion level to bring up body temp riding with other people my exertion level is usually much lower and i end up under dressed and cold
went to my old highschool to vote and be the functional citizen im expected to be  decided to put on more air on the front tire so i stopped at a gás station to use the air pump there were some girls on a car trying to figure out how to use the pump i decided to help them só i asked what psi is the tires on and they didnt know either i taught them how to do it and let them fill the rear tires as i went my way one of them reached out of the window and asked if i had a gf  i said no and sprinted out of the scène as fast as possible into the road  i bet they were drunk stupid murderous cagers
  not quite yet they are pretty hard on your spokes because they arent very good at distributing load
  went to my old highschool to vote and be the functional citizen im expected to be    fyi if you go and vote on nov 6th and ride your bike youll get a strava medal its under this months challenges     so you medalbois will like that no riding 150km to get bling
  thats good to hear i usually struggle to complete the 150 km over two week challenges
  rather brutal straight west wind yesterday so i went to go collect my kom averaged 47 km/h on a flat 14 km section with a max speed of 53 km/h there is a 90 degree turn before the start of the segment so you cant get up to cruising speed before it start next year a new bridge off ramp will lead into the segment providing a nice boost at the start    i went out again today and the wind was pushing 60 km/h but the direction was not conducive to speed runs i watched an old factory getting demolished for a while until i started freezing tomorrow will be a better day to watch and they should switch to the bigger machine to tackle the second story    the jack rabbits are starting to turn from brown to white starting saturday every day in the forecast is below freezing
warmmmmm
i wanted some spooky vibes yesterday so i went to high bridge after class where edgar allan poe took his walks it wasnt very spooky in the midday sun

tried out my new winter tire and made some seasonal saddle adjustments to accommodate my winter clipless boots still need to install the rear studded tire but ill wait until it snows
  hey i have that same downtube mudguard  whered you find a fat sized rear full fender
  the back of the bike isnt fat the front fender is a pdw origami as well not the fat bike version both the origami and mud shovel use the same snap pattern so i can swap in the wider deflector that i have in the garage    on a side note full rear fenders and horizontal dropouts are a shitty combination the fender gets in the way when removing the wheel i just leave the fender sitting high enough that i can just barely get the rear wheel off the new surly frames have a modular rear dropout so you dont have to deal with that when running a geared qr setup
  only reason to have a track fork is to run single speed    looking at your picture again i realise i also have that same bottle
  took it out for my first snow ride of the season the snow was getting slushy as i headed back home    the 7 speed mega range cassette i installed is really starting to annoy me the huge jump between cogs 5 and 6 messes with my cadence ive got a sram 9 speed shifter i accidentally ordered and a spare 9 speed cassette so i think ill order a sram 9 speed rd and crank
  seems i can cheap out and only buy an rd no need for new crank
i rode 70 km today and picked pumpkins and then got the train home it was a fun day out i will get back to my studies tomorrow    
  you are supposed to pick the pumpkins before halloween
the roads dried up after yesterdays snow so i decided to go for a ride on my touring bike without studs i only encountered a little ice on shaded parts of bridges the wind was 30 gusting to 55 km/h and the temperature only got up to 1c aside from my feet i wasnt cold but my nose ran a lot    snow and high winds forecast for tomorrow followed by daytime highs right around 10c so its definitely time to put the studded tires on
  thats the point m8 it was picking up the ones that werent collected for soup kitchens to use

went on a little biking/urbanexploration trip to the old decommissioned richardsgebauer afb heres a few pics    its mostly abandoned now with parts being used as an intermodal rail storage area and a little part used by the army reserve    tinfoil hatters think richardsgebaur will be one of those fema camps used to detain us citizens thats clearly not the case from the look of things of course

got some snow last night the 50 kph wind should die down this evening so i can do a little fat biking the snow was fairly moist when it came down and now the temp is dropping so the roads should be extra slick my studded tires handle that no problem its out of control cars i need to watch for    winter night rides involved a lot of battery charging 4 batteries for heated gloves / insoles 1 battery for helmet light 12 batteries for handlebars depending if im going long enough to need a spare periodic tail light phone and garmin recharge
  u should get a dynamo
the mist falls down in a light drizzle and refracts the light of sodium lamps of nearby towns giving the cloudy sky a soft orange glow  leaves fall all around you  everything is cold wet and slippery  except for you who in your technical clothes are warm wet and slippery instead    autumn night rides are top comfy
  autumn night rides are top comfy  certainly and i enjoy them a lot     but to me for dayly rides nothing beats an exhilarating run through woods and fields in full green spring with cool shadows warm breezes and sun eating super sweet wild mulberries and finishing swimming in a cool river
on my way home today
once it snows the bunnies just chill out in the open the older ones are much better at the if i dont move they cant see me game little ones will run off and often the larger ones wont budge    i think the one that lived under our deck during the winter for several years died during the spring it was very territorial chasing out any other rabbit that came in the yard looking for food a younger rabbit has taken its place
  stop resisting
  who was chasing you do you use your feet to type or do you peck
  this reminded me i met this guy a couple of weeks ago this is by a relatively busy road i made a sound to get his attention but he just looked at me and kept lying there  im guessing he was really sick or just ran out of fucks to give
  that epileptic headlamp  i hate you anon
      sadly no pics but in the past month a pack of coyotes has moved into the open space area i ride through on my way to and from work riding home at dawn or dusk i seem to spot them crossing/near at least once per week and a few times now ive chased them up the trail with my headlights
  people who hate their sad lives tend to hate strange things
took the gravel thing up through a local national park had a pretty good time ended up having to hikeabike some of the more ridiculous sections saw some dudes going down the trail on mtbs and they were walking some of that shit too      look im not going to deny that but its really obnoxious just put it on solid and actually see where ur goin
  is that a guinea hen

i organised a mini club ride today with a grill and a dude the experience was so different to my usual ride im still shocked the amount of abuse coal rolling horn leaning was way way higher than what i usually get unreal man
504km rolled since i got a new cyclecomputer for the bso three weeks ago  average speed at 245km/h and max recorded at 618km/h  i want to up my average speed game
im snowed in today 2 inches of snow has brought the city to a halt was shoveling the driveway and went to put back the shovel next to the old 26er mtb with xc tires so i decided to take a ride    went out today for a 5 miler just to be the first person to run a track through the snowy park path    its getting cold so it was strictly winter coat and winter gloves with a ski hat no bike gear today    yesterday was beautiful and i went 40 miles across the rural suburbs of kansas city and visited each towns little war memorial for veterans day i saw lots of angus cattle cows like the bike bell
did a casual century yesterday with a friend and a grl i know from school she bailed at mile 70
  we know horses are /n/ but are goats /n/ thats the real question
get on a bike for commute to work  wet  cold  dark  heavy headwind  riding easily at 25 km/h  get passed by a qt on an ebike  she has a 10/10 ass and is wearing skintight clothing  jump into her draft  now getting sprayed by wet dirt as well from her rear tire  consider dropping back from the draft in order to not eat dirt constantly  the ass and draft into headwind outweigh the dirt  ride behind her for 10 km  get to work covered in dirt  jerk off  shower  all smiles as i get to my desk

warmed up to above freezing today last 1/3 of ride every time i put my foot down my cleat got packed full of stick snow and wouldnt clip back into the pedal without some tapping    i usually keep tabs on local edits to openstreetmap to see if anything stupid is being done a guy in the area is going full retard mapping every little puddle in the satellite imagery i mentioned to him that most of those are intermittent and dried up over the past 2 years now hes moved on to mapping every farmyard including trees weirdo
i went out for 2 hours tonight to enjoy some of my favorite fat biking conditions packed snow and refrozen slush the packed snow is fast and the studs dig in easily enough grip is never a problem it was just below freezing with almost no wind    i must have come across well over 100 rabbits while i was out including a group of about a dozen 2 groups of annoying partridges that stay hidden until you get really close then all fly away at once also came across an owl sitting on a bridge railing
passed someone walking a doggo while riding a horse on a mup
no ride today because were all dying of smoke inhalation
  man carry a rifle on your back and come home with a sling of rabbits and birds in your basket
commute home today was a pain in my ass  realise i hadnt locked the bike cage properly that or someones tampered with it might have a look at the camera files on monday  get 1 km out before realising i forgot my bottle  get maybe 2 out again before getting a fucking stick straight through my tyre    couldnt pull it out so i had to unseat the tyre and pull it through surprisingly enough couldnt reseat the bead with my hand pump    am i supposed to carry a co2 thingy in case of events like this while running tubeless tube went in fine but im pretty sure it wouldve sealed
i was a huge dumbass last night went to remove a square taper crankset  without removing the crank bolt ripped those threads right out of the crank arm going to have to dig around for my 3 arm puller to get the drive side crank arm off
had a good deliveroo shift last night made 16/hour and it wasnt raining     i just confirmed my registration for paris roubaix 2019 pray for my forearms anons
  what bike are you riding the pr on

  sounds good make sure to jam in the biggest tyres you can fit
ive done a bit more work on a heated glove i started last winter the carbon heating rope frays very easily and weave is forced open when closing my hand having the heating elements touch each other could also create a short which would be bad causing localized heating in excess of 100c to deal with those issues and ensure permanent attachment i coated the carbon with a flowable silicone the silicone is stretchy but does make the glove somewhat stiff a lower viscosity silicone would be ideal as i could achieve a thinner coating now that i think about it precoating the rope with silicone then wiping most of it off would probably yield a better result as long as i could keep both ends of each of the 3 loops free of silicone to make the electrical connection    the carbon rope im using is 3 mm wide which is extreme overkill for the application i just noticed that the rope is made from a loose weave of 12 bundles of fibers which i should be able to separate the pair of heated gloves i bought last year appear to use just a single one of those bundles so for my 2nd glove im going to use just 1 or 2 of the 12 which should be a lot easier to work with and i can use much less silicone
  im sure you know what youre doing and that the gloves will work but holy fuck isnt that design just something to say the least im impressed youve made it this far
the past two days brought 4 very different commute rides  saturday to work sunny and warm usual 15 minute ride  saturday home from work ice storm impossible to stay upright very difficult to walk even 1 hour home  sunday morning with studded tires fun 20 minute cruise to work  sunday back home after the ice melted 45 minute slog with studs on dry pavement and climbing up a trail with icy ruts
  i bought heated gloves last year one thing i didnt like was the placement of heating elements on the back of the hand making them less effective also they are a bit bulky one of the heated gloves failed so they sent me a replacement and didnt want the dead one back so i took it apart to see how it was constructed they have 3 loops of heating fiber 1 for the thumb 1 for index / middle finger and 1 for ring / pinky with the loop connected to the power source in parallel    since i have some spare battery packs from a similar heater all i have to do is connect 3 of the wires to the positive and 3 wires to the negative terminal of a dc connector i dont have to make a switch or temperature control the most difficult thing has been getting the rope tacked in place as it kept wanting to lift back up before the fabric glue dried    i got the heat rope from a guy selling it from russia accepting paypal he has a bunch of tutorials on his website making heated gloves based on his tutorials would probably be harder because if you dont do it right you wont be able to close your hand the last diy section is the epitome of crazy russian i want to make the carbon fiber torch from that section   
i went for a 4 hour fat bike ride yesterday half of that was getting to / from a group ride we rode along a frozen creek and came across 2 tall traffic cones but there wasnt any indication as to why they were there one of them was in the same spot last year too the second cone was resting on the bottom of the creek so you could only see the top 10 of a 4 foot cone

  that fucking sucks but glad youre ok otherwise

  geiger counter  pls explain
bicycle pump reads 40 always  still been pumping tires to recommended pressure  just came to realization ive been under inflating my tires by 40 ftlbs  for the first time ever pump tires to correct pressure gauge reads 40  ride four miles suddenly rear wheel feels rough  its a flat  change out inner tube   finally have excuse to use co2 pump  tire feels full instantly    glad i bought that pump i couldnt figure out what caused the flat once i do should i patch the old inner tube and reuse or just toss it
  i like to patch no point throwing out a perfectly good tube instead of using up your patch kit glue / patches get a box of good quality patches online and a big tube or can of rubber cement from an auto store
    or just get patches with glue already on them makes repairing tubes a breeze and they work pretty well nowadays on butyl tubes
  ive had problems with glueless patch reliability in the past desu never had a problem with glueons tho
i fear my yearly riding is almost done lads i waited all week until it was 42 degrees with 16 mile an hour winds and it froze me to the core wearing baselayers gloveliners balaclava ski hat under helmet    20 miles felt like 50 there are no qts on the road or garden watering milfs anymore my ankles hurt like an old woman this morning    im going togo the the gym cybex until i can sneak in a 50 degree ride llads ill probably take a spin class or two they are free but it isnt the same you boys know its not the same    saw thousands of canadian geese in their international flightpath that goes right above my riding area they were headed south and fast    im going to miss my bikesan first season switching to a real road bike and i put on 2000 miles
  a windproof breathable jacket goes a long way to making colder temperatures tolerable but i do find it easier to bike in the cold when there is snow on the ground you go slower and work harder which generates a lot of heat cold bare pavement and slicks you just get a lot of wind chill
some nice overnight lows around 2c the next few nights so im going to take the opportunity to ride along some unopened sections of a new highway in the dark after the remaining construction crews stop work for the day i did the first stretch last night which would have been more pleasant if the wind wasnt pushing 40 km/h they ran out of paving time in the fall so the full length is 95 paved with no cars
  i invited people to group ride tonight but no one showed up  the roads were a slushy mess and there was another ride going on out of town so i wasnt too surprised so i just continued on and did the next section of highway i hadnt intended to do it tonight so i didnt check the length first ended up being 33 km making for a total ride length of 62 km on a fat bike with studded tires    a tailwind most of the way back so i was cruising along at 28 km/h which is pretty fast for a 45 lb beast with 48 tires started catching more of a crosswind on the last leg so i was forced to zip up my jacket which i had left open most of the ride due to the sweltering 2c temp
  seriously you stop riding at 42 jfc
  second attempt went much faster and made some improvements as far as wire routing was concerned with just 2 of the 12 fiber bundles it was much easier to make tight bends to get all the wires to the back of the hand plus i only need to use 1/6 as much of the heating material now to make another left hand glove using the newer technique apply the silicone and attach a dc plug    if i was thinking when attaching the wires to the carbon rope i could have used 2 less wires the 2 reds at the top and 2 yellow at the left can be combined
gud ride  almost ate shit on the descent though took a curve too wide and ended up riding through a bunch of rocks managed to stay upright didnt even pinch flat pretty surprised rest of the descent wasnt too enjoyable as youd imagine goddamn hairpins
  what kind of weather are you riding in ive ridden in subzero cold and never felt the need for more than liner  ski gloves i kind of get it if youre motorcycling or efagging
freezing fog and wind over 40 km/h while i was out for just over an hour tonight visibility was extremely poor but i was on closed road so it wasnt a problem my glasses kept icing over brake rotors iced over too making for somewhat unresponsive braking until the ice broke up even my headlight got dimmer as ice built up on it helmet light was unusable due to reflected glare
  ill usually go out as low as 20c ive got raynauds so my body randomly decides to cut off all circulation to my hands and feet my fingers will all go white to the knuckle so even its above 10c i occasionally need heat to get circulation moving again i have problems more frequently with my feet im good for up to an hour then need to turn on the heat even if its just below freezing despite warm boots
  oh shit man that sucks i have a friend with that except it kicks in at way higher temps for her shes a vampire or some shit    sounds like fun man glad you made it alive
25 mile ride in glorious 50 degree weather would have ridden longer but met up with my old connection and bought a bag since we just passed medical mj now i just need to not eat so much food i cant ride a bike thursday
  i was doing some testing today with a multimeter to determine the amperage the gloves would draw from a 74v battery and discovered a few interesting things the version 2 glove with 1/6 the heating material draws 053 amps 39w which would be good for a bit under 3 hours on high with my 1500 mah battery the first glove draws 26 amps 192w gets much hotter and would only last 30 minutes    i also tested the 3 settings on the power pack for the glove i bought last year on high the current is identical to having the glove connected directly to the battery medium and low dont reduce the current it just cycles the power on and off at different short intervals
i was out mapping some new roads tonight and at one point noticed my garmin had a blank screen it wasnt off but locked up i only happened to me once before but at least this time i knew i had to press and hold a 3 buttons to force it to power down when it came back on i saw i lost the last 2 km of my ride so i had to backtrack to record the parts of the road i lost my annual distance rolled over to 3rd highest ever 2nd highest is another 3300 km and well out of reach

i was waffling on whether to go on a ride tonight that i mapped out to be 68 km since i hadnt ridden the bike i wanted to take for a month and had just put the studded tires on today but i did end up going a decision i rarely regret the ride ended up being 71 km and taking 3 h 15 it started off at 1c and dropped to 5c by the time i got back during the last 15 km i had a 22 km headwind which was a little less pleasant than rest of the ride had been i started running out of juice the last 10 km so did my headlights first my handlebar light dropped into low power mode then my helmet light    its sad to see how few people in the local strava clubs have ridden outside this week there have been some very nice evenings ive ridden in the dark every night this week 4/5 rides were on my fat bike and i managed to put in more km than the zwifters even before tonights ride
  fuck indoor riding the entire reason i switched from rowing to cycling was no more monotonous indoor sweatbollocking motherfuckers would do well to harden the fuck up
got out for 6th night ride in a row but kept it to under 2 hours i switched to a thicker base layer because it was colder than it had been all week but i was too warm ive been riding all the parts of an under construction motorway i havent been on yet including the ramps so i can map them based on the construction camera i was confused as to which of bridges was tented in for concrete curing and found myself riding right up to it one of the joys of trying to map stuff in the dark fortunately there was a trail down the embankment one side of the bridge and back up on the other side a nice short 25 climb just 2 more spots left to map out the entire motorway    its been quite easy to get a good center line gps trace even in the dark just follow the pavement seam

just about finished mapping the new motorway i went to cover the last ramp at a partially open interchange last night but the closest bridge to where i started was tented for heating during concrete pours i should be able to cover most of the ramp from the other side which will be adequate for mapping but at 10c i didnt want to extend my ride to go do it last night
midwest had a bilizzard yesterday with a few inches but lots of blown snow from 50mph winds took the hardtail mtb out for a couple miles in the ice and snow riding in the snow on a mtb is highly underrated activity    im at 1968 miles for the year want to get to 2018 i have 35 days to make that last 50 miles i dont know if im going to make it if we have one or two nice days in ill make it but december is pretty cold around here    its my first year riding road bikes so im super happy to have gotten this far on my claris al road bike bought it for 39999 last years black friday

got a flat on my way home today well i would have but the sealant worked within 5 seconds    schwalbe winter marathons rolled a stud on a pothole and it went through the tire they are only 6 weeks old seems like a design flaw to me
reddit r/bicycling  see normies praising low tire pressure  deflate to 60psi road bike  spend weeks wondering how i lost fitness  decide to pump up to 90 today  instant 3mph faster  how did i let reddit meme me
  looks like slag from an old iron works
    my favorite kind of rides where was it 
  where did you get the idea that low tire pressure would make you go faster its supposed to make your ride more comfortable thats all you didnt lose fitness you simply had slightly higher rolling resistance
  that subreddit is the land of endurance geometry massive spacer stacks and metric centuries dont go there looking for advice to go fast
  whether low pressure helps or not depends on the tire particularly the sidewall with a rigid sidewall the flexing sucks up your energy the schwalbe winter tires are among the worst for this full pressure all the time on those
  80 or 85 could easily be faster if the road isnt perfectly smooth dropping from 90 to 60 is retarded

i hadnt gone for a ride since sunday evening so i decided to go out last night but only went for 30 minutes should have worn my heavier tights forgot my overmitts at home and the freezing mist was messing up my glasses    did better tonight getting out for 2 hours also managed to ride the last of the ramps i was trying to map last week even with several light snows this week there were quite a few tire tracks on the unopened motorway so i likely wont be able to ride on it during the day
rode 36 miles today in mist and fog to reach 2020 miles for the year i had planned on trying to hit 2000 when i first got the road bike last christmas
  nice one anon
  i also had a strange thing happen while i was going down the ramp with the wind behind me as id exhale my breath illuminated by my headlight was just hung around me as i was moving some of it just off to the side was going a little faster than me which was all quite interesting until my glasses started fogging over and i realized i was going down hill with a concrete barrier quickly approaching
i initially thought this cone was for indicating an ice problem but considering how much of it is below the ice i think its actually for indicating an under water hazard for canoers the water is very shallow in that area    tomorrow it is supposed to be 11c with a 30 km/h wind all day and into the night might be too cold for the tuesday group ride id be more likely to go if i wouldnt have a headwind the entire trip home

  that webcomic  libtard cyclists destroyed by facts and logics from benjamin shapiro
  implying bikes arent just light cages and their owners dont have an uber cager mentality  theyre only bearable because they dont pollute dont endanger kids and pets and dont make noise
  wait a second ive heard that line before
beep beeep
    cagers get fucking btfo thats what you get when you dont have bike lanes
  bikes arent cages because they dont put a big wall of glass and metal in between you and the rest of the world going outside without taking your cage is amazing you see more and you get to say hi to the people around you
i was preparing to build an electric fat bike   ordered the kit and build the bbattery  fited it to my cheapo riverside 100 beater bike for testing and noticed the q factor is to big  220mm to be precise  what kind of pedals and cranks can i buy do to reduce my q factor   i want pedals that screw in closer to the crank and straight cranks and not these l shaped ones that came with the kit
  electric bike  enjoy the explosions
forgot to mention the motor is for 100mm botom brackets i made some spacers using a aluminum pipe for plumbing
  thred is about bike fit  i ofered some context to my situation to avoid unecesery questions
  as long as you have a good well built pack and do the bare minimum of research like amp ratings youre fine    lunacycle makes worthwhile kits albeit kinda overpriced
  get a hollowtech ii crank and spdsl pedals
  thanks man
  maybe if you didnt have that giant motor sticking out from your bottom bracket you wouldnt have such a ridiculous q factor youre not going to get below 200 mm just accept youre riding a pile of concessions
  to add youre putting that on a fatbike think about how much wider those chainstays are going to be and whether or not you should have started this thread in the first place
  your first mistake was making an ebike
  im a roadie at heart  my plan is to sell them to people

  we removed a railway that could carry lots of people and freight  and installed a bike trail for gentrifying yuppies
    this is an outrage  you could renovate it and run passenger trains    hurr durr muh gentrified downtown token lightrail route 1 mile long
  but   then everyone happy
    fuck off foamers
  why not combine concrete and railway
  i dont want rail and i post on /n/  why
  people shouldnt have money  tunion goon    the problem with so many railroads is the entitled awful lazy ungrateful employees we should bring back the good old days and just import chinese people to do railroad work
  the line was basically abandoned   better to turn it into pedestrian and bike way quickly then some pie in the sky commuter heavy rail thatll be finished in 2025 and wont stop where people want to go
path becomes popular  cant bike commute fast anymore  reeeee
    rails to trails is a pile of shit concept dont get me wrong    but on the flip side at least rails to trails means the right of way doesnt disappear completely     the land owner could do worse like abandoning the property entirely then ceding control of the row to the city which would inevitably deed the thousands of parcels to nearby land owners in which case rail would never see the light of day there ever again
  rails to trails is a pile of shit concept dont get me wrong  why
  because it means replacing a railway row with a pedestrian trail
  and
  tram line  in atlanta  being used by anyone
  yeah but the railway is gone anyway  its not as if it was removed by the 30 year effort of lobbying cyclists and it isnt as if its ever coming back so
  fuck off rails to trails is a great idea especially if its a defunct line
  all the gentrifying transplants will use it
  yup its official atlanta isnt atlanta anymore grady babies are like unicorns nowadays unless youre in the west side
they should add separated bike lane/path from piedmont park/beltine to gatech down 10th street
  fucking this end stage is when you get police presence on your bike paths for speeding too bad if you pass them they cant do anything about it
  also pretty much a very visible point that with the amount of development in most areas its impossible to find or seize the corridor for a bike path an old rail corridor is a valuable thing
  spring makes things green how about that
things white people like 573 railstotrails    seriously though look at the people in the photographs
  im looking what exactly is it you want me to take note of
not posting the original
  i dont see a tram line though
lol this is the 50s all over again rip out a railway right of way to pour concrete
  except its not for cars
  based and redpilled
  its for a less efficient and less accessible means of transportation than rail
not that n cares but i manage a hotel and we have dozes of people eoing our state long rails to trails thing they are always nice mamils so not only are they good guests vut good revenue
hello /n/ i question pop up in my head a while back and for the life of me i cant find an appropriate answer in a postapocalyptic world how would private transportation or public transportation reemerge into a citystate society also how would urban planning be like
90s rigid mtbs everywhere
  this i am ready for the apocalypse the war most begin soon
common sense would suggest that you clear the roads of car wrecks and obstacles in general and reuse the already existing roads
  my uninformed opinion  aviation would be like bush pilots in alaska  rail would be heavily contested until powers emerge and come to some sort of agreement  roads will deteriorate into strips of rubble quite quickly if roads are maintained they would likely just be replaced with gravel or dirt bridges would likely be maintained by locals due to thier importance large tunnels and subways unless powered up relatively quickly would likely become so damaged that they wouldnt be worth resserecting  fishing and shipping would likely be almost unaffected even with fuel being hard to get it would probably still be worth it
  in a postapocalyptic world how would private transportation  due to lack of ressources most people would walk ride their bikes or horses  public transportation  probably some ancient steam locos fired by wood but it would take some time to see trains again since they require a lot of ressources and work to run wich is not worth it untill you have a good reason to transport something  a citystate society  citys would litterlay die during the apocalypse only the rural population would be left and barely sustain itself for the first few years  also how would urban planning be like  pretty much nonexistant without electricity water and industrial food production a modern city is simply not sustainable  best light rail we could do would be horsetrams or draisines before steam power makes a comeback    rigid and hardtail mtb would indeed be pretty usefull when there are no useable roads anymore    aviation would be nonexistant since fuel would be nonexistant
keep in mind that population density would be lower and a less industrialized economy means more people living in farms instead of cities so you would probably see cities shrink and walkability become a lot more of a thing    in terms of technology id expect to see horses make at least some comeback because they dont require motor oil/gaskets/sare parts and other things that have a big supply chain in terms of public transportation they might eventually become supplemented by salvaged engines running biogas/ethanol/woodgas/biodiesel but fuel prices and the scarcity of serviceable engines would mean that few people would own there own so it would mainly be buses taxis and a handful of rich assholes who can probably afford their own private mechanic on staff to keep it running    railways and especially electric railways would make a lot of sense for urban transport because energy costs would be so much higher with a much more limited trade system cities might go from mainly using horses and foot transportation directly to electric railways without building any carexclusive roads    id expect urban planning to look like western europe midrise construction because you dont want to go too high with only wood building materials and no proper structural engineers mixed use zoning because most people are walking to and from absolutely everything and the roads being a clusterfuck of pedestrians bicycles horses cars and buses all unsegregated both because you cant chase pedestrians out of the road without an enormous outcry and because road work is too expensive given all of the preapocalypse buildings lying around a lot of cities would pop up in the ruins of old cities using whatever buildings hadnt collapsed from neglect    oh and city walls depending on the political situation
  postapocalyptic transportation  tfw you will never conduct bike bys slaying raiders and degenerates with hickok45 using fully automatic suppressed uzis  why even live 
  i think the fuel situation depends on how many people were talking about there are a lot of pretty decently sized stocks of fuel at places like regional and rural airports and theyd go a pretty long way with only a few bush planes using it     its also a lot easier than people think to extract and refine oil in small quantities if youre in the right region you could tap into existing wells and build a smallscale refinery and have a supply thatd keep a few hundred or thousand people going for quite a while
  fuel would not be non existant those who produced fuel before would continue to produce fuel it would simply be very hard to get because large governments would collapse and the factions that form afterwards would seek to control the supply for thier faction alone factions who posses both planes and fuel would still use them what i dont understand is that when people think of post apocalyptic senario they assume those that remain will forget how to civilization there will still be people that know how to do most anything and they will teach others and thier offspring those skills unless you kill everyone and engineer a new adam civilization will never truly start from scratch
  bush planes run on avgas airports dont have much of it just jeta1  and even that would run out rather fast  the main issue to restablish civilisation is to recreate order you will have many rivaling fractions that kind of recreate civilisation within their border but tend to not be friendly to other groups    of course this depends much on the society before the apocalypse some will recreate a funktional society faster than others
  those who produced fuel before would continue to produce fuel  in a total collapse nobody will produce fuel you need platforms as source for crude oil you need refineries to destill the different fractions you need hydrocracking to reform the heavy fractions you need additives to get usefull octane ratings you need spare parts for the heavy machinery and so on    it is not nearly as simple as throwing wood into steam loco
  diesel engines can run on some god awful fuel and refining is a pretty simple process if you dont care about high waste emissions or quality most oil drilling platform both pump and refine not to mention the increased incentive to do so due to demand ingenious people will find a way and they will have more wives and goats than anyone else those with fuel and ships will be next rulers of society 20 just as they are in the current one
  diesel engines can run on some god awful fuel  indeed old diesel engines can do that but planes tend to not use diesel engines  refining is a pretty simple process if you dont care about high waste emissions or quality   indeed but to run aircraft engines you need a minimum of about 100 octane wich requires high quality base fuel and additives  most cars require simmilar octane raings as well  most oil drilling platform both pump and refine   actualy most just remove gasses before sending the oil to refineries  not to mention the increased incentive to do so due to demand  there is nothing the consumer could trade with and the platform refinery and required chemical industry dont run with thin air
  are you delusional or just dumb
  you have to remember the people who establish a functional society the fastest will conquer the people who havent done it yet and bring the same level of technological and social development with them    picture western europe in between 1500 and 1900 where all of the powers are constantly improving technologically and economically just to continue to exist and the net result is a steady increase in societal development across the entire region
      
  we need fossil fuel not a liberals wet dream that will never happen
  so not why shift over as much energy consumption like electricity to renewables so we can save that fossil fuel for the good stuff instead of wasting it on shit like commuters and electricity
  cant get gas  people still want cars  people use more expensive solutions and drive less    basic supply and demand if supply goes down and demand remains constant price will go up and quantity sold will go down
  i can answer the urban planning question kind of    overall it always depends on the scenario if its possible for thieves and raiders to exist without permanent infrastructure which seems dumb given their life expectancy in mad max then your first urban planning issue is walls and how to pay the people walking them    if there are guards there are taxes if there are taxes then there is property where theres property there are laws and where there are laws theres usually a public space where everyone gathers to agree a law is good or bad    in early societies and colonial/ wild west societies this is why the gallows are in the public square unless your society is complex enough and has enough public trust to let someone else decide who to kill who to exile and who to put in stocks then everyone in society either needs to agree or see most of everyone else agree to most punishments    so youve got walls a town square gallows and probably some kind of reinforced tax vault everything else in planning requires people willing to build where theyre told to build unlikely ask any minecraft admin or so much population that people will give up a little freedom for a little order
  renewables  renewables energies is a myth it doesnt work fossil fuel is our only hope
  hope for what fossil fuel is running out were using it up faster than the earth can produce it and then what
  doesnt asphalt degrade relatively quickly    i guess it wouldnt be getting used nearly as much
  what sort of postap  people with resources will start fitting extra seats onto their own cars to carry people and freight around at a price
  what do you mean it doesnt work    my friend built wind farms all summer before quitting due to heat stroke and he says the wind industry doesnt even need subsidies anymore theyre just milking it but financially wind is on par with subsidized coal now    also no seriously what do you mean it doesnt work like solar power isnt just a scam its a conspiracy every homeowner running one is pretending to make electricity while running a generator out in the shed or does charcoal somehow make steam but its uncooperative and wont make electricity like steam from honest hardworking natural gas    what should i assume when you call something that not only is proven not only is built but is actively making money as we speak a myth
  and he says the wind industry doesnt even need subsidies anymore  your friend is lying wind power is too weak solar power has more cons than pros dont get me started on water power fossil fuel is our only hope not the alternative
  thank you for keeping this thread bumped with troll posts
  the answer is no no transportation or cities/towns will rise except for animal transportation like donkeys mules and horses    most people will follow this survival plan instead    isolated farmstead  self sustaining water supply and food  decades of experiencing farming  large catholic family  guns    that is basically it live somewhere with a good aquifer that is out of the way so starving people dont kill you have a big family to help work the farm    goat locations are mt valleys where agriculture is sustainable but not good enough to compete with kansas    yfw motorized transportation will die in your lifetime  feels good man they will no longer harm the earth    remember to stay /fit/ /n/ the strong survive while the weak die
  implying the isolated farmsteads wont eventually be conquered by trading empires with superior economic and industrial resources
  we need fossil fuel not a liberals wet dream that will never happen  you are now the japanese prime minister in year 1944 supply lines for fossil fuel have been cut off but you have 21st century technology at your disposal how will you power your military equipment
  1 switch planes from gas to leuna  2 switch steam powered ships from oil to wood/coal fire  3 bikesteam trains are now only way of transport  4 steam trucks replace diesel powered ones
  good luck fighting against tanks with bikes  and japan tried synthetic fuel back then too but that didnt exactly work out  and i dont think coal engine offer necessary performance for warships
  surprise motherfucker
  not fighting
  describe your apocalypse describe with one word each what tech levels are before and after the disaster how many people are surviving and how long theyve had to build ill spend friday afternoon making a map then post it with a breakdown of why every building/road is where it is itll be more fun than arguing about bikes
  3 bikesteam trains are now only way of transport  too comfy
  describe your apocalypse   takes place after an unidentified event which led to the collapse of civilization big cities and large towns are abandoned and reduced to ruins with only a few of them still standing bandits marauders and looters still a major threat communities are a thing but they are extremely xenophobic to constant raider attacks       describe with one word each what tech levels are before and after the disaster   before the collapse fairly advance after the collapse archaic with the surviving cities being cyberpunkesque     how many people are surviving   need a clarification on this       and how long theyve had to build   need a clarification on this       ill spend friday afternoon making a map then post it with a breakdown of why every building/road is where it is itll be more fun than arguing about bikes  good luck and thanks for taking your time for this
    /n/ takes a note from /tg/  fascinating
each metro station becomes a city state each station finds its own niche to fill whether it be military needs farming trade etc the only food is livestock and mushroom farming the power structures are ran by ex railway employees and military personel who managed to find refuge in the tunnels     eventually the mutants start to come and the metro becomes even more dangerous not to mention the surface elite soldiers make trips to the surface stripping it of everything useful the currency in the metro is bullets each region of the metro follows its own beliefs and morals which sometimes leads to warfare between different groups eventually the dark ones come and the chosen one must gain contact with them so that humans and this particular breed of mutants can join together to wrestle the new world filled with monsters
  the new transportation will be the carcass of old transportation until some rudimentary solutions are found
  horse powered subways under the rubble pile that is nyc    its a beautiful dream
  that smell
  rip anon
      im not doing this for an unidentified event or cyberpunk tech levels with no actual explanation the hell you mean archaic but cyberpunkesque     of survivors  y2k everyone is alive but all tech is dead and starvation is imminent  nuclear armageddon small rural towns that endured a nuclear winter are alive often in the hundreds   seveneves earths surface is scrubbed and the dozens of survivors are in the hundreds and either in space or deep underground  mad max world is comically ruined survivors are in the dozens rarely hundreds per site    how long theyve had to build  mad max 10s of years  fallout 100s of years  seveneves 1000s of years    postapocalyptic is not a setting its a theme the theme is if we fell down the staircase of progress and wound up a pile of broken bones at the bottom could we get back up and would we repeat the same mistakes    the setting is important because it establishes exactly what was wrong before and how far we have to climb back    mad max is about greed and power lord humongus immortan joe and master blaster are willing to waste whats left of society to maintain their power the implication is that men like them were responsible for the apocalypse you dont have to explain why theres no water why there are megastorms or what happened to the rest of the world you just have to point at the cause    im going overboard since i forgot this was /n/ and this is all vaguely academic putputtering but it just gets my goat when someone acts like postapocalyptic is something everyone should know    better question for the thread what affect will venezuelas imminent collapse have on urban planning in the country i think people are going to be more interested in growing their own food when this is over and people are going to flee to the suburbs
  if lagos is any indication weak states are not good for urban planning    expect a shitload of shantytowns a large number of poorly maintained cars not obeying any sort of traffic rules and generally the city growing horizontally instead of vertically because the technology to build multiple stories is mostly gone
  public transport in postapocalyptic societies      i work for an ngo that removes explosive remnants of war landmines grenades bombs rockets that sort of stuff from civilian areas in conflict and postconflict zones    having been stationed all over the middle east and the horn of africa i think i know a little bit about transport more or less apocalyptic societies  what strikes me is that i have never seen transport services break down even in occupied mosul there was plenty of intracity transport option though intercity was more a less stopped by isis im somalia and south sudan transport between cities is as easy as going to a road flag down the first car and pay whatever the driver asks    however what i think fits our western idea of real romantic postapocalypse is probably the contact zone in ukraine nagorno karabakh in armenia/azerbaijan or abkhazia in georgia/russia pic related i mean those places got abandonded infrastructure and buildings enough to make chernobyl look like the overlypolished simcity 2013    anyway what happens in those places is that even local government and public transport agencies collapses there are always some entrepeneuristic soul who know how to buy a minibus paint its destination in the front window and start going back and forth that same route every day thus connecting every town within the same economic zone    remember transport is quite a cheap commodity and one which there will always be a demand for     seriously one of the least believable aspects of the walking dead is the lack of an independent and privately run intercity bus company
  if the global industrial economy collapses itll be different than a localized societal collapse due to warfare    fuel and spare parts will become nonexistent    the best example would be cuba during the embargo and the third reich    youd see wood gas cars running off of what ever jury rigged parts are available to keep things running    presumably these vehicles will be used for trade caravans intercity bus transport and tractors
  if lagos is any indication weak states are not good for urban planning  residents of lagos have one of the highest standards of living in nigeria and in africa
  metropolitan area of 16000000  only transportation is buses  metro still in development hell    being the best city in africa is like being in the coldest section of hell
  metro is an oldfashioned form of transportation its best if lagos doesnt finish it
  the hell you mean archaic but cyberpunkesque  i thought he meant that outside the cities everything regress to the point they were using bows and swords or muskets
  remember to stay /fit/ /n/ the strong survive while the weak die  do people not believe this its one of the fundamental truth of our world the strong survive while the weak die
  dumb evolution atheist the meek shall inherit the earth
  i remember there was a /k/ thread a while ago on what postapocalyptic weaponry would look like    it would be a pretty neat setting youd have room for everything from wooden pikes to repeating crossbows to matchlocks to prewar revolvers and shotguns that have been hastily converted to black powder to sten guns and homemade mac 10s depending on how much infrastructure survives in a specific area     needless to say whatever postapocalyptic polity develops enough electricity and steelmaking capability to set up trams in their cities will probably also be able to make smokeless powder and simple open bolt submachineguns and conquer all of their neighbors    the guys with horse chariots and longbows wont last very long if somebody is running around with an uzi
  everyone dies that is the fundamental truth of our world
  if someone remembers how to do the fritzhaber process theres gonna be a lot of gunpowder
  thats what i was presuming would happen    one band of survivors gets the hoover dam or something and gets the power running again  begins to set up fertilizer factors based on the haber process  begins to set up steel mills based on the electrical arc furnace process  absolutely rapes all of their neighbors with their superior population transportation and weapons  at some point after the first steel mills become operational but before they run into an equally truculent batch of chinamen based around the three gorges dam they develop 1890s style streetcar suburbs and reactivate cahsr to connect them together    we can only hope that the mormons dont get there first
  the guys with horse chariots and longbows wont last very long if somebody is running around with an uzi  this is so stupid     swords and bows are easier and more simpler to make than guns and armored vehicles besides bows and sword requires skill which would give then an edge over those who prefer guns
draisines and rail bikes could allow you to cruise the wastelands on the railways of the old world and avoid the cannibal gangs on the roads
  teleports behind you
  anon you arent suggesting that an army with insufficient munitions insufficient gas and insufficient resources can beat an army using the old methods eventually anything that requires a resource that isnt easily renewable or practically inexhaustible in the area will be lost and well have to restart civilization in the practically biblical era ie swords and bows
  eventually anything that requires a resource that isnt easily renewable or practically inexhaustible    you can make firearms out of resources that are practically inexhaustible    iron ore is very very common and even if it wasnt postapocalyptic societies could just melt down cars and beams from collapsed buildings and things like that    the ingredients of single base gunpowder are cellulose read sawdust and nitric acid which you can literally make out of air    so at least really shitty firearms will always be available to any group of people who are capable of ferrous metallurgy either blacksmithing or machining and basic chemistry    the good news is that if you have enough electricity to make nitric acid and steel in large quantities you can also make some pretty dank public transportation
  you need good quality steel to make a pressurised container large enough for the fritzhaber process 19th century steel is pretty much what youre after you could get there quite quickly but it wont be instant crossbows will be the primary weapon until we get nice steel again
  confine self to railways  rubber tires have higher rolling resistance than metal on metal train wheels  whyyy
  crossbows will be the primary weapon  absolutely pleb tier
  ive always wondered how do the wheels stay on the tracks are there guide wheels on the inside or something to stop any lateral movement
  plus the foamer answer  
  this is what triggers me about apms and monorail
  monorail
  a shit
  rubber tired metro
  you have such shit taste
  i could see caravans of merchants using woodgas trucks
  inb4 they take the one tractor trailer engine that still works and use it to carry australia style road trains filled with traders and mercenaries
pic related    its genuinely a good film too
something dawned on me and im embarrassed it took this long to realize    boats nigga rivers canals and coasts are going to survive the end of the world way better than railways and asphalt roads and you can use anything from dugout canoes to 1850s opium clippers to tramp steamers to modern container ships    so youd expect a huge amount of cargo and people to be transported via strategic waterways like the coasts the mississippi and the great lakes the first cities to emerge after the collapse would probably emerge by these waterways because bulk cargo from water would be so much more efficient than the handful of nigger rigged automobiles that are still functioning once the economy regenerated to the point of widespread trade across the country youd expect to see waterways acting as the trunk lines of a cargo and passenger system that also includes land caravans powered by the few remaining tractor trailers in functional condition and maybe even wagon trains for the truly remote and impoverished areas    does /n/ do ferries and cruise ships
  canals need maintenance particularly shit like locks isnt going to operate itself  rivers arent perfect either and wont be easy to navigate once nature takes over
  i was thinking the bulk of merchant traffic would be on either the coasts or very big rivers or lakes to make it less likely that they get fucked by sandbars or submerged shipwrecks or navigational hazards in general    plus youre going to have a very hard time tacking your way up a canal if youre using a sailing ship but id expect most people to be using wood gas and internal combustion engines
  burlak you let your barge get pulled by beasts of burden
  but then you have to have usable trails on the sides of the canals and there arent that many people around to do that kind of work
  i have fantasized about this rebuilding america with boats as rivers become the highways of new nationsthe mississippi river basin becomes the veins and heart of a new empire
  which city/town will be the capital of this rising empire chicago
  the mississippi river basin becomes the veins and heart of a new empire  it already was in our current empire just superseded by rail which was superseded by automobile but for a long time the us relied on the mississippi river and its veins/related waterways thats why a lot of major cities and state lines today are based around the river
  i always imagine chicago become completely destroyed in the event of social strife because they have a violent poor underclass and a disarmed complacent upper class    that or they turn into a mesopotamia style despotism under the godking rahm the first    this might be the one and only scenario where st louis wins at something
  i would honest to god led a horde of marauders to burn down st louis no way is that shitty city is going to win in any way or form
  consider    missouri has no gun laws so everybody owns and uses guns  chicago has gun laws that are so strict that the supreme court had to paperfuck them and then they passed new gun laws so that theyd be as harsh as they possibly could be without immediately being struck down by the federal courts  st louis is a dangerous shithole for literally everyone not just working class so people are more likely to be well armed and prepared  missouri is near arkansas and louisiana which are also filled with heavily armed inbred weirdos  trade in the gulf coast will probably pick up faster than trade in the great lakes so st louis will be closer to the action than chicago    really its a question of whether chicagos gestapo tier police can do a better job of rebuilding society than the u loot we shoot crowd
  depends on quality and how well its built anon  if fundament drainage and materials are nice you could go 20 years between patching the asphalt even longer if there is no more wear from heavy trucks    the main issue is that if fundament/backbone is poor it takes extreme damage from highly changing temperatures meaning damage between summer and fall and winter and summer water getting into the ores and exploding into icy veins is a big issue  nature reclaiming it is not a big issue because nature needs to reclaim the ditches around it before it can start reclaiming the fundament and then the road
  dont know why i laughed
  chicago is already a police state might as well give them the benefit of the doubt
  the question is whether pigs will do a better job than rednecks at rebuilding society
  because youre scum
    looks like seven empires will rise up in that basin alone
i was thinking about this the other day and it occurred to me that woodfired steam locomotives would be a pretty good candidate for rebuilding transportation since their fuel is so easy to get
                candidates for the new mississippi empire capital  chicago biggest city near the river system but the bigger they are the harder they fall  st louis central location still a shitty city  new orleans major seaport through which all traffic must pass to reach the gulf will repeatedly suffer hurricanes no matter what happens  not a lot of good options here maybe not one city dominates the whole river system
  maybe not one city dominates the whole river system  i could see citystates rising but the issue is that sooner or later they are going to expand for resources and they are going to be an empire
  i was thinking people would try to have another constitutional convention and reunite the united states but without a common enemy to unify the different citystates it would turn into a half assed clusterfuck like the hre or the eu
  i was thinking people would try to have another constitutional convention and reunite the united states  i could see that happening but i could also see a many of them resisting to remain independent or forge their own nation     but without a common enemy to unify the different citystates it would turn into a half assed clusterfuck like the hre or the eu  dont forget that a few might have some discrepancy when it comes to industrial and technological placement
  im picturing it like europe after rome fell    everybody wants to bring back rome nobody is big enough to fill those shoes    so you have a lot of places that have warlords declaring themselves presidents and maybe even flying the stars and stripes but none of them are actually the same thing under the surface and over time the culture morphs into something completely different    that or itll be like china where one warlord eventually gets powerful enough to conquer all of the others and a new dynasty starts
  pls do nuclear winter simulation thx
  was thinking the same thing
  nuclear winter aint happening all the models are based on faulty or vastly exaggerated data  global dimming from a nuclear war with currently available arsenals will be less than ww2 firebombing
  what makes u think u have accurate data on the worlds current available arsenal
  salt and start
  and theres absolutely 0 chance someones producing arms on the sly
  anyways fine fuck u    do a volcano creates severe nuclear winter effect simulation
  not in relevant numbers
  possible but difficult since production of fissile nuclear material creates airborne radioactive traces that would be picked up by strategically placed highly sensitive instruments detecting for radioactive particles around the globe those instruments dont even need to be remotely near a production facility since radioactive particles can travel long distances once airborne think geiger counter but much more sensitive backed by data maps and computer processing to find anomalies
  looks like seven empires will rise up in that basin alone  dont forget indianapolis etc
    you were born just in time to witness combat between weaponized battle steamers over who can control shipping from the gulf of mexico to the great lakes
  1hp  when black people finally can afford bikes to race in the tdf and put out 750w compared to 400w whitey
  steamships coordinating with horsemounted raiding parties and biplane scouts to cut off enemies from reinforcements arriving by rail
  entire regiments worth of bike infantry commuting to the front via regional rail and then cycling the last view miles along a nice bike path the combat engineers laid down
  mfw a fleet of rigid mtbs with slicks
  bike mounted cavalry units
railways could continue to be used for draisines and railbikes  might be the only way to move around long distance as the roads break down
  you can remove the outrigger frame and go off the rail with it  a draisine would have dedicated metal wheels
  nonexistent of spare part wouldnt be a problem in really short term and if it is only societal collapse and oneoff apocalypse then hopefully society order can be restored before too many units become inoperative due to lack of spare parts  energy source would be a real problem through really without energy for such transportation the global food delivery chain would immediately collapse and this in itself is already an apocalyptical event
     mounted cavalry units  no swedish infantry and being a crack shot my self and the embarrassment of being out shot by one of these i am not that good     they ride they shoot and they shoot well
  wouldnt bicycle infantry be closer to dragoons
  precollapse dragoon
  postcollapse dragoon
  how the mighty have fallen
  transportation would be a thing of the past men women and children will walk with their own legs
  i wanna be that guy when im 70
  i cant imagine a world in which people wouldnt at least be using horses and bicycles
  the old way is better
  who will win
  im just hoping anybody other than chicago
  not supporting the gestapo policestate chicago  tell me how great democracy is how the will of the people will triumph or other liberal bullshit
  i just know that if saint louis or new orleans wins everything will be comically fucked up and itll be really funny
  horses will be eaten for food while no one will know how to make bicycles
  i will go concede that rover trade will help in a post apocalyptic s  world but will it be a game changer
  fucking help i cant even begin to imagine how the rest of the world will be
  rivers arent perfect either and wont be easy to navigate once nature takes over  in the middle ages river transport was a thing in europe
  it was also a thing in america and continues to be a thing in europe thats why you have all those straightened and broadened rivers and channels everywhere dunno how long it would take for nature to make navigation impossible again small boats can probably be used for quite a while
  so we vikings now
  inb4 alaskans turn into the next vikings and rek califags shit on a seasonal basis
  who are the haida people
  an extinct group of people
  arent they still alice
  woodard car will finally jave their time to shine
  soon also whats /n/ views on alternative gas
  crossbows are easier for the common man to learn while bows take time to learn
  in other words  absolutely pleb tier
   also whats /n/ views on alternative gas  not feasible
  i wonder how car will be design in a post apocalyptic world
  horses make sense only for carts you can ride much farther with higher sustained speed on a bike if you are a pro you can even outsprint most horses hampered by a rider
local   donkeys oxen horses and waggons bicycles handcarts boats    long range   horses and occasional trains like one per week boats/ships and maybe zeppelins     elite military police etc   electric cars electric bikes bio fuel    occassional agricultural vehicle   bio fuel
  
  someone throws a bunch of rocks  breaks the solar panels  no infrastructure to manufacture replacements
  maybe zeppelins  why zeppelind
  they are very efficient at transporting cargo or people and dont need much infrastructure compared to planes and trains
  most smart people would ride bicycles since they dont make noise can get past blocked roads and you dont risk your life trying to get some fuel also bikes dont make you a target most people would kill for a car without doubt
  physics is a myth it doesnt work    lol
  fixd that for you
  this  some hardtail/rigid mtb with baskets/bags would probably the best choice
  refute me nigger
  which nation woul recover the fastest in a postapocalyptic world
  depends on the scenario obviously
  depends on the scenario obviously  sun turns into a red giant
  giant trains with buzzsaws
  will the military have some vehicles
  the moon colonies
  new orleans would have a solid jumpstart by owning the delta plus its new orleans the people who survived the initial postapocalyptic looting will likely be battle hardened vets acustomed to aquatic warfare   crazy bayou cajuns who didnt even notice anything happened until the direct tv went out  mandingos from the lower 9th  exnavy and marines from the base down there providing training  nobody down there gives enough fucks about hurricanes to do anything but plan a party  take all of this and load it up on a fleet of steam converted patrol boats and fan boats
  norway and germany
  people think this but its wrong    landing a zeppelin is way harder than landing an airplane you need a huge ground crew    also in most cases theyre less fuel efficient than planes because aerodynamic drag eats up way more energy than lift does
  source
you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like
  but its wrong    no it isnt    huge ground crew    human resources wont be a problem in post apocalyptic society settings people will be willing to work just for food and water     aerodynamic drag    only relevant at higher speeds  also by using the surface of the zeppelin for solar energy you can make it a mostly self sufficient vehicle hell you can even tow the zeppelin with horses slaves tractor or whatever from the ground and still move a huge cargo with it
  whoever would have control over the regional militia would also have control over vehicles and other resources in that area so yes
  stand still stay silent supernatural plagues kills everyone but iceland some swedes norwegians finns and danes magic returns to the world transport is only by boat armored train and armored car because the plague turned every infected human or nonquarantined nonfeline mammal on the planet into awful zombie shit also pagan magic n shit but also christian salvation for the souls of the damned zombies
  sounds neat
  thats just a motorized tachanka
  shit is out of a action movie
  the only semiplausible thing you posted is the return of horsecar lines in the city streets
  i mean i guess
  i think that hydropower would unironically be a vital part of reconstruction efforts because it doesnt require the same elaborate supply chain as fossil fuels    im exaggerating a bit for shits and giggles but the fundamentals society rebuilds using renewable energy resources that are already in place and havent been destroyed like dams seem reasonable to me    if theres a collapse of global supply chains but the underlying technical knowhow doesnt change youll see some really weird shit
  renewable and alternative energy is a sham
  do small towns or villages have the potential to have firearms or will they be reliant on melee wrapons
  literally just look at any eternal war country like afghanistan or somalia and you have your answer on postapocalyptic weaponry protip its automatic rifles and rocket launchers
  but those rely on faraway weapon factories foreign military surplus and atms dealers and smugglers with all the modern technology and infrastructure to bring them into the country guns wont last more than a few decades once they arent produced and traded anymore
  guns wont last more than a few decades once they arent produced and traded anymore    m1911 45 acp  m1891 mosinnagant    i could go on
  fancy clubs once they run out of ammo
  due to lack of ressources most people would walk ride their bikes or horses  youre a nigger weve got decades worth of plastic buried in conveniently placed mines within 100 feet of the surface nonchloro and nonfluro plastics are easily processable into fuel add to the fact that propanol yeast are highly prevalent and that you can build a multiton oil press with 5 pieces of wood and a rope niggers like you are going to continue to be niggers but people with marginally human level intellects like myself will prosper    probably some ancient steam locos fired by wood but it would take some time to see trains again since they require a lot of ressources and work to run wich is not worth it untill you have a good reason to transport something  train nigger here is a nigger motorized bikes will be back almost instantly engines are simple and fuel is easy to produce the biggest barrier is going to be tires but all that means is solid tires will make a comeback    barely sustain itself for the first few years  t citynigger    best light rail we could do would be horsetrams or draisines before steam power makes a comeback  all the communists would be dead so there would be no public transportation also steam power would only be used for power generation not transportation it is a trivial matter to set up a solar parabolic trough powering a simple heat engine that then hydrolizes water for browns gas to be separated and sent into gasometers and then used to produce ammonia in the haber process using a simple iron catalyst to make ammonia two stroke engines yes its idiotic but it requires virtually zero resources
  stone bullets work quite well if you have piss straw wood ash and alcohol then you have modern smokeless
  also once you get your ammonia production up and running its childs play to produce nitric acid and then you just need plant biomass alcohol and bullets
  kill yourself
  but anon why would i kill myself there would be an abundance of resources and no communists it doesnt get much better than that  a fresh start with the retards dead and only those with marginally human intelligence surviving a world of only the upper half of whites and nonchinese orientals utopia
  being this deluded
  theyd go a pretty long way with only a few bush planes using it  high octane fuel goes bad pretty quickly it will drop a couple of octane numbers within a first year of storage and then it will deteriorate even faster aircraft engines which were designed to run on 100ll have a very high chance of detonation when running on a stale fuel you will also need to get aviation oil from somewhere ideally you should change your oil once per 50 hours
  imagine not knowing about nitrate fermentation acetone fermentation peroxide fermentation nitration or acetone peroxide  youre a nigger
kill yourself
  you will obtain very impure chemicals and they wont work as well
  no
  black powder firearms definitely once you know how to make saltpeter its not all that more complicated than making a regular sword    but it seems likely that the industry would centralize fairly quickly because one guy with a machine shop can make guns way more cheaply quickly and with better quality than a village smith can id expect villages to grow cash crops and then use the money to buy factory made guns from traders
  youre the type of faggot that doesnt even know what the three plates method is but insists making machinery by hand isnt possible
  not an argument
  my point was that you are a faggot and are wrong that you lack even the most fundamental knowledge related to the the claims that you are making  the yields sensitivities and efficiencies will be lower but that is irrelevant there is something called a separation process what this means is that it doesnt matter that you produce 6 purity while modern industrial methods produce 12 purity because either way you have to concentrate your product and recycle streams are a thing and side products for fundamental chemicals are incredibly easy to separate this means your raw materials can be almost endlessly recycled until you have enough product basically youre a faggot who doesnt know what hes talking about
  i dont know what youre talking about either but it sounds interesting
  sensitivities should be selectivities
  dont they deterioate
    correct me if im wrong but wouldnt it be easier to just make black powder    like i really really wouldnt want to be doing a nitration reaction without proper glassware and temperature control and i also wouldnt want to be mixing high chamber pressures with homemade firearms      it depends on where the road is but generally the big thing that degrades roads is repeated loading and unloading stress caused by 18 wheelers    so if everyone suddenly stopped driving on a road it might survive relatively intact especially if you only need it to be good enough for horses
  am i a nigger if i dont know chemistry
  yes
discussion thread for /n/ related anime yowamushi is still airing   last thread 
long riders
i want to die
    are they cosplayers or did they make a live action yowapedal
golden boy 
  yes
no new yowapeda today
  
  tomorrow
  
rape imminent
2 flashbacks in one episode  fug
  it is a real drama show aired in japan a year ago its decent if you like seeing real people cycling in anime style
based
literally an entire season of hakone wins everything always
  watashi wa tsuyoi
        probably the only interesting part was teshima hardening the fuck up he tried his best and got tired and then didnt got strenght from an unknown source to sprint every minute like the rest of the cast at this point i think sugimoto would be a better choice for the show watching him struggling and riding hard would be really nice
  probably the only interesting part was teshima hardening the fuck up he tried his best and got tired      the interesting part was the entire rest of the team going holy fuck teshima is just mediocre we must be gods      and then absolutely nothing happening as a result of his effort    its utterly sterile pointless writing   if teshima puts his blood on the pavement and the team reads what he wrote that should actually have consequence    nothing happened season over
    and then motherfucking naruko is just randomly like yeah im going to real in everyone like 12v1 plus or minus midosuji no prob    result back to status quo    fuck that bullshit
  more yotsuba bikes
      based yotsuba poster    also episode is delayed again
as far as anime directly related to realistic or semirealistic road cycling theres the two moe cycling anime yowapeda overdrive and two films one being a sequel to the other called nasu summer in andalusia and nasu migratory bird with a suitcase the first nasu is about a stage in la vuelta a españa and the second is a race which takes place in japan and features some characters who are not the same people but are intended to look exactly like characters in the first movie as if theyre doppelgangers or some shit but those characters are only there for comedic relief so it doesnt matter too much but is difficult to figure out until youre like half way through the second movie so i figured i should mention that the main character is the same hes a pro cyclist for the fictional team pao pao beer
  wow i didnt know we had a such an anime expert posting on /n/
cute
  that last episode was just bizarre midou goes on this huge sore winner speech and the crowd at first horrified ends up being on his side and cheering
  i know right whos writing this anime anyway i swear its like its been written by someone who hasnt quite got a firm idea how human beings think and behave
  imoezumi
  world is full of autists
        where can i find this show
fucking savage
  wait a minute that brand is subaru and not subuta
  
midousuji best girl
  yes  finally midousuji redemption
      whoa nostalgiaboner
  win once  lol i am the best  then why do you usually lose
i just started watching yowamushi last weak i almost shit myself every time i see the slightly misspelled bike brands
  midousuji is probably the strongest and hardest working rider in the interhigh he just keeps getting fucked over by the power of friendship tm as well as the fact that he doesnt have a stacked team like souhoku and hakogake
  but half of souhoku is useless though that still puts them ahead of midousuji in numbers
what a great episode    if it was another tie id be very upset    this is the smile i want to protect
not so based
when do you suppose well get onodas backstory id like to know hat made him such a neurotic mess
  how do you go from this
  to this
  notwithstanding he still goes into total panic mode whenever anyone so much as speaks to him
  wheres onodas dad
  good question maybe onodas mother killed him for being uppity and onoda witnessed the whole thing that would explain a lot
  jesus    also what about kinjous backstory never knew why he started cycling
  only difference between those two pics are a jersy and a good nights sleep
  at work
  just pedal faster
  onoda gre up is a lot more confident speaking with other people he knows he had to work on it
  are there only 7 episodes
is long riders ever coming back 
  only in our hearts
i cannot believe no one mentioned it yet but mumen rider from the hilarious anime that pillories other anime one punch manit is like the deadpool of anime is a hero without powers who just rides a bike   mumen rider vs deep sea kingepisode 9         lol that is comedy gold and weird as fuck only the japanese is that anime series golden boy any good it seems to have a good imdb rating   but alot of highly touted animeberserk code geass lelouch of the rebellion neon genesis evangelion in my experience have been hot garbage since alot of anime fans are plain weirdos and will tolerate alot
  no
  soon  
is ggo /n/ now
  he has a whole side manga thats his backstory  
  unfortunately only season 1 7 episodes is uploaded for the time being i have no idea if season 2 will be uploaded in streaming sites
nice night view
how many episodes left i dont want it to end 
  one      end yourself
  so they wont finish the inter high fucking hell
  they will next season that might be in january or april or whenever
  they havent even finished it in the manga
  thats not true
      at least theyre ending on a high note with midousujis well deserved and long overdue victory
episode was filled with a dose of gay
  not only that onoda seems to have had no trouble at all keeping up with them as they had their monumentally earthshattering badass racetoendallraces
  idiot
this episode was awkward gay and even had cuckolding why is onoda so cringey
  because he doesnt know how to do a uturn if he perfected that move i feel hed finally evolve into his final form
  races up mountain 5 times plus rides up a 6th to get drinks instead of resting for last day of interhigh  and his race with manami will probably be down to inches
  to be honest i forgot it is not summer season yet it might be this autumn but i think they would have announced by now but who knows
  onoda is just so strong that he has to be tired out or else the race wouldnt even be a contest its more dramatic this way
i wanted more of hiroshimas team
so yowapeda season ended today im still watching because at this point im invested but godamn did this season have zero respect for the viewers time pacing was horrendous and we reached some dragonball z tier levels of stalling at times i dont know whats going on in the manga but why the fuck is the season ending here show us wholl fucking win you godamn nips
    also what the fuck is up with showing that kinjou and the other graduates are now on new teams in college but then fucking forget about it for god knows how many episodes hack fucking author
the pacing in this yowamushi pedal season was pretty poor at times but i still derive at weird comfyness from the show its always high sun and perfect conditions for riding and it has that standard sportsanime trope of effort and will winning out in the end
  the art in anime was much better in the 90s
  maybe someday
  i do miss the handpainted cels but it does make sense the industry has moved in its current direction
they had to cut /ourguy/ hair
watching through tatami galaxy and the main character really captures the essence of fredding in the third episode
so we all agree for yowamushi  s1  s2  s4  s3
  i prefer uncut midosuji
  its always high sun and perfect conditions for riding  i do kind of wish they threw in some random weather events to add a bit of variety to the days
  yes got so hyped when this came
how the hell was imaizumi some kind of hot shot through middle school  any minimum problem and the dude falls apart mentally
dont know about you but i would 100 ride this where do i get a stem this long
  classic big fish in a small pond syndrome his ego has basically never recovered from his first loss to midousuji at the very beginning of the series
  im sure you can special order something from chinkland
is midosuji a mother con
    has he delivered even once in the two inter high tournaments
  ask peter sagan
                
  he attacked and broke kimoisuji on the 3rd day of the 1st inter high and thats literally it
you didnt forget us right /n/
  of course not
  literally who
  how could i
  here   180 mm 35  i have the 150 mm model on my bike
  how could i after all of the image training ive done with them
                yokohama kaidashi kikouwebm  90s sci fi slice of life  thank you anon
long riders is getting a bluray release with a bunch of extras   
  aw shit  i was just watching the reair     also ddi yall know that theres a long riders strava club need to search for らいだす though
  ろんぐらいだす i mean rakaichamp decided to select some text for me and i was still typing rongu could also mean wrong now that i think about it   also search aliexpress for anime jersey and you can find long riders jerseys you can find the fortuna ones of which i have too many theres a black fortuna one which looks great and theres miko cycling ones which i have coming in the mail
  18000円  i should if only to to upload it for the rest of you fucks
  anon saves the day once again
  anon always saves the day
i miss long riders even though 25 of every episode consisted of panning across still images
  dudes literally living my dream  bike around the country   work odd jobs to survive  social interaction
  does it come with bottled scent of anime girl ass in spandex
    i keep getting zero results when i search for fortuna cycling kits 
  like i said you need to search for anime jersey      theyre sold as miku jerseys confusingly enough go down to from other sellers and you can see more long riders stuff on aliexpress somewhere are the full set   as a bonus miko cycling ie the jerseys the girls wear before switching to fortuna      then my personal favourite a dopeass black design      like again go to related goods/from other sellers to find winter gear
    thanks senpai they really dont make this too easy do they     ill just pick up a few short sleeve kits and ill worry about the winter ones when the time comes
  i have like 5 of the fucking things i love them i dont actually have higherend sets to compare them to but i recommend getting them tighter rather than looser measure your chest a few cm too tight is comfortable but a few 23 cm too loose is also comfortable but seems baggy
    i ended up getting all three of the jerseys
say hi to your anal queen
hur increasing cadence makes you go faster  its the exact same as watching a car racing show and having performance based on overrevving the engine i had to drop it after 3 episodes
does anyone have the screenshot of that dude that caculated oonodas power output
  increasing cadence does make you go faster the human body isnt like an engine spinning lets you go fast with less pedal load / reduced lactic acid the tradeoff being a higher cardio load
  this but you can only do it for a rather short time before you blow up
  well yeah but this is japan they cant exactly have one of the characters pull a froome and spin up zoncolan in 53x11 while fucked up on a million dollar a day gear habit and revving a hidden motor to the max tho i guess thats kinda what a yowapeda character sprouting wings and powering past everyone on a climb imples winku winku nadoju nadoju desu nya
  just pedal faster  secret technique of standing up in the saddle  homosexuality  clipless adds 200 power     its full of dumb shit
no one posted this motherfucker  im disappointed
  fuyune is love
  she is basically a female fred though
  nadoju  what is that suppose to be/mean
  date a female fred  she always has the latest gear  down to ride just about whenever  she gets you discounts from the lbs  how is this a bad thing
  you also forgot cute
  you have to wait for her midride constantly  you have to fix and maintain her bike  she takes forever to get ready  you cant discuss bikes with her
   will this be related
  looks like its romanceshit on the meiji era and not directly related to transportation
explain this
  no
this is my wife say something nice to her
  shes a nice lady
  is rail wars worth watching
  its pretty shit i rarely drop a show and watch shit until the end but i couldnt watch more than 5 episodes of that it had good designs for girls but the rest was extremely boring and bad i think most people remember the show for that epic quality screen with cars all over trees and buildings
  can you even drive power into the pedals from this position
  i thought it had a decent amount of /n/ content between all the pantyshots
so do we have anything to look forward to next year i think yowa pedas popularity is dying
  how about the way they presented the trains i mean it did explain a good amount of detail about them but id like to hear your say on it
  fuck its been 12 years since ykk got cancelled and im still heartbroken about it
  yes
  hes one of the best sprinters in the world m8
is there an anime about airline captains being morons i just finished cabin pressure and i want more
  not exactly what you are asking about but years ago i watched this jdrama about pilots in training  miss pilot it is called as the main character is an airheaded woman it was being translated as it was coming out so it has subs for sure
go back in time  see a series named rail wars airing soon  oh neat its an anime about the japanese railway in an alternative world where they never got privatized  mfw the series is actually full of shit and trains are just minor accessories to give it a shallow background    the disappointment was immesurable
today is hinakos birthday make sure to celebrate it by going on a long ride with your bikefu
wew      happy birthday hinakochan
  classic anime
  watched that was kawaii as fuck senpai
  because of my recommendation or just someone that happened to have seen it before if the it is the first i am actually kind of shocked but happy i helped you and made your day or i guess few days
  cause you said so im always in the mood for cute girls doing aviation things
  im always in the mood for cute girls doing aviation things  sora no woto s2 never _
  is lain riding the accela express
  is there an anime about pilots
  hisomaso there are a few more about/featuring spaceship pilots the most down to earth present daythemed one being rocket girls and theres an older cg series about plane pilots area 88 then the ghibli porco rosso
  i wouldnt recommend hisomaso if you want pilots since theres the implication that theyre piloting planes and not dragons
  the dragons cosplay as airplanes though close enough
a question for everyone if your bike was an anime girl what kind of anime girl would they be   i think my 1980s peugeot would be a hot christmas cake
  my bike  31  85kg  imagine
  size 52 frame so i guess some small girl
soon
  2kg over uci weight minimum  thinks it would be a girl he could imagine
  sexy italian custom with campy record  would be a hot sassy bitch whose tubes are made to feel the best only when im in them
this thread is on real thin ice cunts
  well i own a fatbike you tell me
  nice
blocks your path
this guys artwork is so good
      he takes commissions but i bet they cost a fortune
  some people think that high heel clipless shoes is a stupid idea i think its genius
  actualy a higher cadence helps you to push more watts  yes 150200 rpm is a little much but depending on rider and crank length 100150 rpm can help you to reduce the load on your muscles since you need less force for the same power that way    problem is you also increase the load on cardiovascular and respiratory system and blow up verry fast  it requires a lot of willpower to keep the cadence that high while suffering on a climb
just got in my aliexpress jersey so i thought id compare     official jap version on the left chinkshit on the right
  what kind of pedals are those supposed to be it looks like singlesided spds but ive never seen singlesided ones that dont also have a platform the little bit we can see of her left undersole doesnt look like she even has cleats installed on those shoes maybe shes wearing covers and is she seriously climbing in like 50x13 no wonder shes taking a break also im pretty sure that bike doesnt come with mechanical disk brakes only hydros
  theyre doublesided spd pedals the plate on the outside is the giveaway but we dont see the details on the undersides because of the way the artist has manipulated the color/outline of the bike      just got in my aliexpress jersey  almost two years after the amazing quality anime aired  de gustibus non est disputandem
  no lycra clad gf to go for rides with    whats even the point
  noalpacacycles  why even live
  but how do they compare in feel to ride in
bump
let me just point you all in the direction of the best and probably only hentai doujin involving bicycles
  
  tfw this gonna never happen to me
  theres this one too 
    yamatogawas is better    
  karen araragi
are bike itasha a thing
    yeah they are itachari is the word
  itarodoreisaa
  that man is the chad of the anime bycicle riders
any love for trains here
  we love trains
  watsisname got a new bike  i only watched the first season how many are they up to now
  jesus its like /out/ had a sunday fling with /n/ and had this estranged child of all the high quality activities this girl could be doing shes sampling noise and getting a boner from it
  youre speaking as if shes a real girl consider the type of person who would draw that almost certainly not a girl
i follow a couple of japanese cyclists and one of them posted something about a tour de tohoku ride with yowapeda images attached did a new movie come out that im not aware of or were those just promos
  he smol
say something nice to ami
  she has a cute sister
  i like her meidofuku
    golden boy is great its one of the few comedy anime i can recommend to anybody as long as they dont mind pervy humor
  it also helps that the original audio and the dub are both hilarious
  looks like she had to get a jersey several sizes too big so she could fit her tits in it
  her friend is cuter
school rumble 
  is this hentai
so what bike irl would be the one that each one of the girls from long riders have
        i tried this and it works to a serious advantage when you have only platform pedals unsure about clips/clipless      mine is a black and green big box fatbike with a heavy steel frame that ive crashed several times the worst is it getting some scratches and breaking a plastic piece i had to melt back together she can also carry a lot of stuff has a huge rear rack and i put a homemade light on her hooked up to a dynamo some chrome bars i took off an abandoned rusted piece of junk too    giant thicc lowclass amazon girl with dark skin rubber electrical tape headband scars a huge butt green pants electric eyepatch and chrome gauntlets
  id love to be her customer
  my wife
  shes my wife now sorry
  shes my wife 
professional weeb spotted    
  nice
  fuck i was worried itd be someone recording one of my rides
what did she mean by this
mirai no mirai has a lot of /n/ stuff  many train references because mc is a train otaku in training so we get models namedrops and tokyo railways plus theres bicycle and motorbikes
dont know how how many still remember baccano but anyone know what train the flying pussyfoot was supposed to be based on  best guess i have is an engine from the the old penn roiling stock since the route was from chicago to penn station in the original novel anime changes it to grand central
  he also fucks like an animal in the manga  they only chose the nonpornographic stories for the anime but in most cases he has very explicit sex in the manga hes even been a masochistic cuckold once
  from the wiki what i understand is that maybe inuniverse even it is claimed that it is designed based on british royal train but it has its own functionalities too
  prr never ran a 464 loco might just be based on the k4 but with an extra axle
  could be only suggested something from the prr because i assume they would have a complete monopoly on express trains from chicago to penn station
new season when
  2022
i miss them bros
  post the nude version bro
  theyll always be riding with you
anyone else go as the forth bridge on halloween
  crunchyroll grabbed them  
i heop you faggfotds hgabve posted this sat least 1000 time already
any good airplane anime out there
  just want to see pic related animated
  i second these numbers is there anything worth watching
    last exile  macross serieszero and plus for earth based  yukikaze  skycrawlers    all of them are military based though
  hisone to masotan   dragons are real and the japanese airforce looks after them at an airbase and camoflauges them as airplanes and has awkward teenage girls fly them around and stuff     its pretty gud
  awkward teenage girls  in the sense women never grow up sure i guess they are teenagers otherwise they are all adults
  the protagonist is   not used to having friends   has no experience with boys  has little self confidence   is not used to drinking or socializing   has no work experience   is only just discovering independence   is finding herself    i mean yeah shes one year out of high school so maybe 19 not 17 but what is the difference really its a coming of age story the way shes characterized for all intensive purposes shes a teenager there are many 16 year olds who are more mature with more life experience than her
  i wanted to like it but its so damn boring
  for all intensive purposes
finally found that long riders porn

  spend at least 75 goy
looks like we got two airplane anime next season cgi one looks like it can it fun kind of reminds me of sora no woto      the other one looks like haremshit but it can fun too i guess probably mostly drama  
  the cgi one is animeoriginal and has a nice premise indeed im not one to hate on 3dcg when its done well too bad its the studio for the latest berserk series    the latter is less interesting but at least looks better
  i havent animed in a long time is that fan made material the animation is so low quality theres like no weight feel at all the lack of natural twitching/movement on the foreground and the natural features in the background lack wind sway leaving that scene very dead looking
    isnt the cgi one by the same guy who made gup
rail wars was so bad    it was off the rails    badum tss
which one /n/
  lets all love lain
  yep plus shirobako and prison school ive got high hopes for it
  better than average cgi but still stiff jp 3d animators still cant into squash and stretch not that western can do it except aaa budget films and still do everything with skeleton rigging only
christmas edition
ive got some foam inclines like pic related in n scale any advice on how to landscape it to look more like an irl embankment

do airplane pilots post on this board if so what advice would you give to a new student pilot
always try to land into wind and dirty side down
  338 hours student here  dont be a faggot in the atc and remember who what and where  your logbook is your best friend  stick to renting headsets until probably after or just before your solo since david clarks and bose the best ones are expensive  land and take off towards the wind  time is everything build your time as quickly as you can  learn to round out and flare and to do cross wind corrections  a cessna 172 will be the most forgiving aircraft you will ever fly  stick to one plane  buy the most expensive equipment you can afford aviation is proprietary as fuck  get foreflight on your phone and ipad  listen to your instructor  actually study your shit and get the books
  advice would you give to a new student pilot  dont die
stick to one plane  meh if you have a choice to start with something extremely basic and cheap instead of forgiving and expensive  go with the first option you will get more experience for the same amount of money and when the time comes to do your xcountries conversion to something faster and fancier will be easy as
  more right rudder
  yes    yes     buy a cheap set and then youll have a backup/passenger headset when you buy a nice sets    yes    yes    i think you meant piper cherokee there  unless you like dropping your wings in stalls    kinda agree but dont be afraid to branch out    theres plenty of decent stuff at a decent price my flight bag is a pistol range bag i got from walmart for 15 bucks fits my headset chart backup radio ipad and odds and kneeboard    get a ipad and get foreflight immediately and save for a stratus    yes    yes and watch a ton of youtube

how many years before flying the real thing
  this guy gets it    meet people and talk to people at the flight line you can learn alot that way not to mention networking with other pilots at various points in career and skill levels    foreflight is legit    try to knock things out in one fell swoop flying and aeronautical knowledge is a perishable skill     best of luck to you m8
  define the real thing
  try to knock things out in one fell swoop  i know it is quite common for students to struggle until it just clicks and everything suddenly works but it does not work for everyone   i was only able to make a consistent progress when i was concentrating on a single thing getting this thing to a stage when it becomes automatic and require minimum effort and only then start with the next thing  keeping that in mind it is important to pick an instructor which is right for you some students learn best when under stress and being yelled at like me others must feel relaxed to be able to learn something
  that is an excellent point too the instructor can make or break an experience it helps to go up with different instructors at times especially before a check ride

can i go to flight school instead of college  starting out doing regional work sounds fine with me until i can stack up the cash to get a bachelors every worth while college demands 15000 but we wage sucks cant do that without going into autodept
  afaik in us airlines require 4yr degree so no  anyway it is good to have a degree since there are a lot of pilots saying that employment is not guaranteed just dont fall for meme degree
  sorry bud but you need a degree to fly for the airlines best thing to do is cc and then finish it in a bigger uni so that the cost isnt as bad also just fly once a week to make sure youre not entirely behind and can do school   at least thats what im doing
    absolute lie you do not need a degree to fly for the big boys they are getting desperate for pilots in the regionals
  they are getting desperate for pilots in the regionals  if they were desperate theyd be paying for your hours to get atp
  gonna need sauce dude i dont believe you
  more like airlines are desperate for experienced pics theyre not going to start hiring a shit ton of new copilots because theres a pilot shortage
  yes dont listen to these guys saying you must do college first just know that the trap in going to the regionals first is you may delay the degree forever by then you have to stay committed     or you could do a degree and flying at the same school any school that offers a ratp is good enough cheaper is better
im an airline pilot what do you want to hear    i like this one my friend died years back on a schoolflight    work for your dream took me over 10 years from the first flight to get to fly shiny jets

on 26 november barcelona will roll out the final phase of the new bus network  qrd for those who dont know  this new network is essentially just a partial rearrangement of the bus network  operating schemes have not changed at all other than line names and designating names for shitty bus interchanges  conventional bus lines will still coexist  new lines designated with a v or h are all trunk lines but there are also conventional trunk lines    overall this whole concept has been pretty shit it barely improved anything the main issues with buses were and are slow speed and lack of reliability the new lines also werent really designed taking metro lines into account so it partly just overlaps the metro instead of properly complementing it the new schematic map doesnt just omit conventional bus lines it also omits metro and train stations so much for intermodality
a suburban train outside barcelona derailed this morning killing 1 and injuring 5 recent rainfall caused a small landslide onto the track this is the direct result of the bad state of conventional nonhsr rail infrastructure especially in and around barcelona precisely the area where the derailment happened is known for the bad state of the infrastructure with loads of temporary permanently temporary speed restrictions some months ago an anonymous railway worker was quoted saying you guys in catalonia have the worst rails in spain as tracks were being renovated with old used tracks from around the country    once again railway infrastructure administration adif has blood on their hands     
  was this towards the northeast of the city around badalona or in the southwest around the llobregat  ive only been to the city once but i must say that i have used the rodalies trains a lot when i was there
  this was to the northwest towards the hills the derailment occurred between vacarisses and vacarissestorreblanca on the r4 line
bus transfers
  buses are only suitable as a feeder service for areas to connect to a train or some kind of rapid transit  anything more than that is a failure to properly understand what a bus is for  having to transfer from one bus to another bus just to get from a to b is a failure to properly implement buses  its one thing to have to get a bus from a to transfer onto a train and then transfer onto a bus again after getting off the train as thats last mile sort of stuff but when youre then going from bus to bus something is wrong
  getting across town takes almost 2 hours by bus because of transfers  45 minutes by bicycle
your train has been replaced by a bus service
  plan on taking my bike with me to the city using the train  your train has been replaced by a bus service  bikes arent allowed on the bus    thanks for ruining my weekend you fucking assholes
your train has been replaced by a tram service
    where is this sounds remote amd underpopulated not even a bus bike rack geeze
  pooh fag here in ny buses dont have bike racks and i was taking the lirr not the subway
  nice joke but thats not the odeg
  be hamburg tram  senate what we call the city government of hamburg decides to kill you  your last line got replaced by bus route 102 in 1978  bus route 102 was quickly one of the most used bus routes of the city  30 years later that same bus route now rebranded metrobus 5 is over capacity to the point that they ran doublearticulated buses for a decade and today run up to 18 buses per hour for the main portion  literally is considered the most used bus route in europe besides the istanbul metrobüs which is half in asia  because the doublearticulated buses proved to be prone to failure all got replaced by capacity l buses that desperately lack seating  bus priority signalling literally doesnt give buses priority  new underground metro line to replace metrobus 5 will not be finished before 2033  our former mayor now minister of finances in the federal government literally seethed every time a journalist uttered the words straßenbahn or stadtbahn
  18 buses per hour for the main portion  for one line  this must be a lobbyists wet dream
  it gets better around the university it shares its corridor with another bus line line 4 for a total of 30 buses per hour during peak times but they never serve in a steady frequency mainly because of the already mentioned failed bus priority    its the same in kiel abolished the trams in the 80s now we get like 25 buses per hour on the main street of the campus i mean i like it i just need to leave my dorm and a bus is arriving but imagine actually choosing those dirty diesel buses over energypowered trams
  west berlin did the same thing though i have no idea if berlin is planning to reopen old dismantled tram lines though i think theyve already spent huge amounts modernising the tram lines in the east of the city though  if theres one thing the gdr got right it was that trams were the way to go
  how about when buses are faster than rapid transit and i am talking about completely parallel route
  i think thats the case in many large cities like hong kong and tokyo and then new york as the other anon mentioned
  imagine actually choosing those dirty diesel buses over energypowered trams  as if electricity transmitted over powerlines arent generated by fossil fuel  as if diesels arent energy  as if there are actually any real effect from this other than slight decade in air quality
  and if youre traveling only about 25km why would you take any train that would in most places be way more expensive and more difficult to do as well if however you live in more rural areas and not the city center
  tfw my city just spent the last couple of years revamping the bus system into a network based on bus transfers  but lines havent even been sped up nor frequencies improved over previous trunk line service  its shit doesnt work everyone hates it but politicians still try to pass it off as a success  j u s t  u  s  t
  sauce
  stadtbahn hamburg would have been excellent    i have no idea if berlin is planning to reopen old dismantled tram lines though  they already reextended the present tram lines into the west and are currently building tram lines everywhere stillsort of makes you wonder why they had to close them in the first place a lot of it had to do with the cold war and the separation of the city      if electricity transmitted over powerlines arent generated by fossil fuel   if there are actually any real effect from this other than slight decade in air quality  renewable energies accounted for 404 of all electricity generated in germany this year that is a significant decrease in fossil fuel use and all the associated problems if you compare diesel busses with trams   and you shouldnt underestimate the improvement in air quality the central square and bus hub of my city currently suffers from extreme particle pollution because there are fucktons of busses and cars coming through id hate to see how it would be if there werent four tram lines running right underneath it
  i had the pleasure to go to barcelona for a week about 6 years ago and also use some of the public transport there what exactly did they change is this a separate network of lines just for the city center and everything else stops at the border honestly cant understand what that plan is supposed to show
exactly a 20 minute walk to the metro  feeder bus comes every 20 minutes
  renewable energies accounted for 404 of all electricity generated in germany this year that is a significant decrease in fossil fuel use and all the associated problems if you compare diesel busses with trams   however if you switch from tram to buses then for sure electric companies would be cutting their fossil fuel sourced electricity generation first instead of cutting renewable energy therefore the energy source for those tram line can still be described as dependent on fossil fuel    and you shouldnt underestimate the improvement in air quality the central square and bus hub of my city currently suffers from extreme particle pollution because there are fucktons of busses and cars coming through id hate to see how it would be if there werent four tram lines running right underneath it  underground tram line  what  why not metro  not enough demand
  this fuck buses
  bus transfer is only practical in three situation   bus service interval are less than 10 minutes   the bus service was actually planned with connection in mind and schedule would change according to when the buses arrive   the area is closed so bus transfer is the only way to get to the destination
i do first and last miles by bike in order to avoid transfers
  bus transfer is only practical in three situation   bus service interval are less than 10 minutes   the bus service was actually planned with connection in mind and schedule would change according to when the buses arrive   the area is closed so bus transfer is the only way to get to the destination  you know somewhere out there there is a once every hour bus that has a timed transfer that it always shows up a minute late for
  if the bus thats supposed to take connecting passenger would wait for the lated buses before departing then thats okay
  however if you switch from tram to buses then for sure electric companies would be cutting their fossil fuel sourced electricity generation first instead of cutting renewable energy therefore the energy source for those tram line can still be described as dependent on fossil fuel  i dont understand this argument can you explain it to me as if i were five years old      tram line  what  why not metro  not enough demand  its western germany the cities here all either fell for the stadtbahn meme or switched to busses entirely   yes there would be more than enough demand for a metro by now  at least during peak hours and considering the fact that busses and especially cars are causing huge traffic and pollution problems in the city there will probably soon be more than enough demand for either  converting the stadtbahn into a goddamn metro  or  building the same number of new tram lines overground     but you have to consider the historical context you know prior to 1990 when the city finally got its stadtbahn there was only a tinyass system of three tram lines and they still decided to do it certainly a huge upgrade over what it used to be     another solution to the air and traffic problems to build a functional bike path network but nobody to the right of the greens can be assed to do that
   if you switch from tram to buses then for sure electric companies would be cutting their fossil fuel sourced electricity generation first instead of cutting renewable energy therefore the energy source for those tram line can still be described as dependent on fossil fuel  i dont understand this argument can you explain it to me as if i were five years old   for instance if a place us generating 100gw electricity 50gw from renewable 50gw from fossil fuel including maybe 10gw coal 20gw petroleum 20gw natural gas generator now you take 10gw electricity load away from the network by using internal combustion engines instead which generators would you shut down to remove the excess capacity would you shut down those renewable energy source proportionally or would you shut down all the coal generators first
  the fossil fuel generators obviously the wind keeps blowing and the sun keeps shining even if there is lower demand in electricity
  yeah so fossil fuel engine vs fossil fuel electric generator
  the map shows bus lines but only some bus lines which are part of the new bus network and they arent faster or more frequent than regular trunk bus lines they mostly replaced other lines with these lines in practice it was just changing around bus lines sometimes combining parts of other lines or altering the route somewhat it was a fucking retarded idea since day 1 in the beginning the idea was to create a series of brt lines which would branch out outside the city centre eventually that idea which was pretty retarded in its own right got watered down into that abomination
      the re4 was a short lived train line in 1995/96 between potsdam and cottbus in potsdam it used the berlin outer ring and terminated in potsdam pirschheide which it outside the actual city and has no direct rail connection to the central station potsdam stadt today hbf a tram feeder was set up that was labeled as re4 to cottbus in the map its the thin green line
  thank you for this piece of trivia
  tfw even buckower kleinbahn is listed as a rb    i love studying old /n/ network plans we should seriously have a thread for that
im pissed that septa got rid of paper transfers
  or you just dont live in a big city duh
your train line has been replaced by a bike path 
   for areas   your area
  tuen mun road interchange is better   with route 301 you see its about east rail transfers from necessity of crossharbour   shatincentral link isnt going to open up in full till the disaster gets fixed its back to the pre eastern harbour crossing and tung chung line days
  i think there are about 80 passengers connecting to/from rail while the other 20 connect between different bus lines
while here you could go anywhere for only 35 cents as long as you dont exit the system
  is this separated from regular buses
  currently yes but the new card system might change that soon that allows free transfers between minivans regular buses and brt within 3 hours for only 35 cents  it is currently being tested
american railroads almost exclusively use track circuits to detect trains with widespread use of axle counters limited to defect detectors    european railways almost exclusively use axle counters to detect trains with use of track circuits limited to station platforms and brokenrail detection    from what ive read axle counters are cheaper to install than track circuits but require more maintenance this seems backwards to me if thats true why arent american railroads leaping to get their hands on that shit
  its true though in my hump when they used axle counters for the electric switches youd have switches acting up all the time when the signal maintainers changed them to a cip circuit it started working flawlessly after they got it all dialed in    axle counters are also fairly expensive sensors and when they break and they break some what frequently youre just throwing away money
  track circuit just seems like the most logical path youre just using the infrastructure already present instead of additional equipment that has to be installed and maintained
  they really are it takes a bit of effort and fine tuning to set up but it is much more robust and reliable than axle counters in my experience
it maybe is a result of americans mostly using diesel traction once you want to combine track circuits with electric traction you need additional expensive trackside electric equipment likely to be stolen also track circuits are not reliable when the rails have accumulated a layer of rust or a train has used sand for braking weve had a lot of serious accidents in europe caused by that common not stateoftheart and thus affordable track circuits also need insulated rail sections where you have to cut the rails creating a new weakness easy to install for nonwelded rails though     a big advantage of axle counters is the unlimited distance they can cover which is not the case for track circuits where the maximum length is limited by the resistance of the rails as an european im not an expert about how the american railways work but afaik there are a lot of long stretches that dont have any detector systems installed at all where axle counter would come in very handy     also axle counters have proven to be very safe and reliable in operation during the first decades they had some serious issues like frequent miscountings etc so that the german railway insfrastructure company db netz is exclusively installing axle counters by now
  unlimited distance  track circuits routinely span miles give you broken rail detection and are way more durable than axle counters    every signal maintainer ive talked to prefers the simplicity longevity and ruggedness of track circuits over axle counters all the late night callouts ive seen for malfunctioning axle counters is painful
are axle counters mainly an european thing like do the japanese use them too or do they use track circuits like the americans
  actually track circuits are much more commonly in use in europe than you might think this is primarily since many signalling systems in europe has modernised  also many european countries use balise and gsmr with both axle and track circuits being backup legacy systems    for the most part with etcs coming in it looks like trains will soon be reporting their location directly to the signalling systems with a mix of gps/galilleo and passive balise over gsmr perhaps later a variation of edge or gprs technology as gsm is phased out by the telecommunications regulators
weird trains thread
that valve gear tho mmmmmhmmm
look at the size of this unit
this beauty was converted from a doubledecker bus onto rails
wouldnt say the shay is excessively weird but i like its vertical pistons and gear driven wheels      is that an edit or was it designed to go through tunnels or something
  intended for use in a factory thats track had heavily restricted clearance where it ran under the main line
    i like trains but i dont know much about the mechanics so bear with me while i ask what is probably a stupid question    if its possible to make a train that small that still works fine why dont they make all trains that size to be more space efficient
  check out this unit  mwahaaaahahahaha
  because they wouldnt be as powerful or fast or anything really its not just a matter of works or does not work

  not even trolling legitimate thread     i see the way you cyclefags talk on this board     you need to know that the whole world hates you you are the problem you have intruded into a world not built for you then blame the problems you cause on everyone but yourselves     youre the most entitled self righteous aggressive and disgusting group of faggots on planet earth     your hobby is basically a cult
spot the burger
  bikes came first
  you need to know that the whole world hates you  better to be hated and right than loved and wrong  you are the problem  no you are the problem by protesting having any changes done to separate bicycles out from cars you are just creating more cyclists on the road to slow you down because there will always be people willing to give cycling a go  by protesting the construction of high density housing you are forcing the car on people instead of making it their choice  you have intruded into a world not built for you  and wed all love to abuse the people who made sure the world was rebuilt this way to suit the car because the damage theyve done is immeasurable  then blame the problems you cause on everyone but yourselves  sounds like you are blaming the problem on cyclists being in your road instead of massive reliance on the car for creating traffic problems  youre the most entitled self righteous aggressive and disgusting group of faggots on planet earth  people who think the government should build massive clogged highways that you can use for free are some of the most entitled people on earth  people who disparage others just for trying to use a bicycle to get around and for practical purposes are some of the most selfrighteous people on earth  people who run cyclists off roads and deliberately try to scare and kill them who yell out car windows to get off the road who honk a horn at 3s of traffic delay are some of the most aggressive people on earth  fat people who never get any exercise and sit on their couches and car seats all day are some of the most disgusting people on earth  people who believe that everyone on earth should own a car to drive to walmart and pick up groceries for a we  your hobby is basically a cult  mass driving of cars isnt a cult youre not allowed to leave the driving cult people will think youre weird nobody cares if you leave cycling
    the world isnt america     in europe road exist for a long time and people have been using bike on them before car existed
holy fucin damn dont mess with op hes a straight up badass who could take any of us down
  bicycles are for faggots  driving massive pickup trucks and rolling coal while achieving zero work is for people who are massively insecure about themselves  get the fuck off the road and get out of the way  slow your roll you have the wrong view about what roads are for theyre not for cars theyre for all forms of transport you know what happened when the automobile took over our streets people started dying en masse from collisions with cars weve created a massive amount of dangerous murder cages patrolling our roads at high speed and made pedestrians second class citizens weve created places that nobody cares about and that are not worth caring about massive six lane roads double digit lane highways carparks bigger than football fields and its never enough  if you wear lycra you are confirmed unrecoverable and should commit not living  imagine being upset that someone wants to wear specialist clothing for something they love doing that keeps them comfortable and is practical for use during exercise

  get a load of this nigga
considering were mostly the products of english convicts/settlers and europeans youd think wed have a comfy af public transport system yet its terrible    in my city of adelaide we have like six train lines and one of those the tonsley line doesnt even count cos it goes along the seaford line before splitting away for like three stops before terminating only one of them is electrified the others are diesel powered and the train cars look like theyre straight out of the soviet union unlike in england where i could take a comfy train from london to york or some shit and see all sorts of countryside or whatever in adelaide its nothing but concrete jungle and derroland unless youre on the belair line but no one cares about that line honestly wanna live in england for a year or two all id do is take kino as fuck trains everywhere and go all over the country    on top of that the stations are all run down and disgusting the pic is of the station im going from or to regularly theres derros everywhere the lift is broken and smells like piss and shit and its fucking disgusting why cant us aussies have a kino train experience    also australian transport thread talk about aussie trains trams buses and other things about public transport in straya
shit population density
  well you cant do much about the geography lol no point complaining about that    as for the trains themselves lack of investment really governments in sydeny and melbourne are only starting to invest massively in it now because of population pressures
  sydney sorry    victoria would have some decent scenery along the bendigo line since it passes through the macedon ranges but i havent used it so im not 100 sure i just know the macedon ranges are pretty kino    i didnt know that adelaide had only one electrified line is it that underused
  the electrified line is always pretty full ive taken it in peak hour at the end of a work day and its been like sardines packed into a tin    northern lines get hectic too belair isnt that packed tonsley is barely used
  products of english convicts/settlers and euros  youd be surprised how much of an american touch we have to our urban planning and attitudes to public transport seems like everyone in this country wants their own backyard and space to park 5 cars out away from their cbd using public transport and not owning a car is seen as something only the poor do unless youre part of a specific niche like the hipsters in the north of melbourne    intuition tells me that the culture ive described above means that not enough people are willing to put the effort into making our public transport run like clockwork a lot of people using it are just saving for a car or something then we have a rotten bunch of pollies who are disinterested in investing in public transport that works see le brisbane bus stacking and metro basically blame the boomers as usual    people really arent willing to make public transport work for their commute either if you have to take a bus at one end god forbid both ends of your commute then people just give up and would rather take a car too many people live too far from the stations and figure why catch a bus to the station when they have a convenient car just sitting in their driveway    talked to a lady at work who said she lived about a kilometre away from a busway station in brisbanes southeast but when i said she would probably have to change buses to get to our office in the inner north her interest just shut down like paraphrase no way thatd never work for me id rather just drive my car    never underestimate the laziness of people who own cars
at least adelaide city has functioning tram lines running throughout the city    rip old sydney tram lines
  desu im guilty of not wanting to take the bus too in my case its too infrequent where i live so i dont bother and some buses take ridiculously long routes for a short distance then youve got that catch 22 where you can add more services to entice people to catch the bus or risk wasting a lot of money because the demand isnt there    i do see a lot of people complaining about the public transport here in melbourne and im not an inner north hipster so there is a significant amount of people who give a shit which is a promising sign plus since the election is next month a lot of cool shit is being announced your gut reaction is probably going to be oh they wont do half that shit anyway but our current premier has delivered on the vast majority of his promises so far so things look good
  have fun watching all that crumble cos labor are gonna get voted out thanks to the antiafrican migrant hysteria
  daniel andrews can always convince the population that the airport rail is being built solely to transport them back home
  interesting have they looked at adding extra services for that line i assume electrification will come with demand
  dont quote me on this but with three lines to seaford and departures from the city every 15 minutes at least at clock off time they might be a bit maxed out    tbh its not like we can really have much of a national network apart from nsw and victoria most of the nation doesnt even bother pretending that there isnt fucking shitloads of empty uninhabitable space inbetween each major population area    if england wasnt such a cucked orwellian nightmare id move over there asap
  queensland has multiple decent sized cities along the coast i can see something working there    as with south australia unfortunately there is pretty much nothing apart from adelaide the barossa valley and mt gambier    if you want super dense cities and towns packed together then yeah europes your best shot best of luck to you
post your local railway station past or present  used to love auburn melbourne catch alamein trains home and avoid the peakhour rush plus 5 minute headways going to the city until 900
  that station looked vaguely irish to me until i realised that broad gauge in australia is identical to irish gauge 5 foot 3 inches  after looking it up though it seems to be isolated to victoria parts of southern australia and new south wales
  will england ever get uncucked i just wanna ride some kino trains through some quaint villages without being spied on
  i dont know why youre asking me lol
  well as a european do you think england will ever uncuck itself
can you smell the diesel fumes from here anons
  lmao im not european im australian
  ah fuck    i might go over anyway if i can do an exchange
  go for it man     the only european public transport i used was in croatia trams in zagreb were alright but the buses around the country were god awful obviously in most other european countries it would be way better
/laborshill/ here but hes done it again        25 additional level crossing removals  more bona fide electrified sixcar skyrail    at least theyre finally getting rid of union/mont albert roads in surrey hills fuck the nimbys but theyre an absolute nightmare in peak
  sky rail is going over all the inner north which is full of lefties so they probably wont care
  op talking about a city    muh small national population density
  im englishask away
  how frequent are your diesel lines  im on a mission to prove that my local diesel line uk is the only line like it in the world
  in victoria youll find theres a big difference in frequency depending how far out from melbourne you go    south geelong/waurn ponds services are very frequent but the albury service only runs 3 times a day 6 times if you count up and down as a locohauled service and another additional up/down pair as a dmu between seymour and melbourne and coach between seymour and albury    contrast that with 32 waurn ponds up services on weekdays or even more from geelong or wyndham vale    do some work yourself too you can get all of v/lines timetables from their website
  thanks
  will england ever uncuck itself
  desu that looks like one of them jap chink stations and them chinks have great trains so that must be a great train station imo
  is that a cheeky spanish solution perhaps you south australians are slightly more civilised than i thought
  melbourne has 453 people per square kilometer london has 1500 per square kilometer    only sydney is properly populated at 1200 per square kilometer
at least australia has trains at all that station looks gorgeous compared to anything in the us
  melbourne is 500km/2 and sydney is 415km/2 as per wikipedia both very low
  living in noarlunga  calling other people derros  ha good one anon
what do you guys think about skyrail personally im all for it because the view is better and overall passenger experience is far superior to being stuck underground in a trench
  welp someone got fucking murdered there yesterday    gr8 job noarlunga
  itll be good when they run the high capacity trains with the new signaling because its separate from the road now they will be able to run every 2/3 minutes    f
  good as long as it has continuous bike paths beneath it and it doesnt end up full of graffiti and junkies maybe add some playgrounds and parks around it too to help that
  thats what they said they were going to do put a bunch of parks underneath it
  only countries with very high population density and concentration benefit from hsr
  a case can be made for sydneymelbourne since its one of the busiest air routes in the world there are also towns/cities along the line that can benefit from it
all the transportation money for melbourne went to trams so you have to use cheapo soviet union gulag transport trans
  soon
  its called the xpt are you willing to spend the money to get the 960 km of track between sydney and melbourne up to a decent high speed rail standard how will improving the speed between the two ends help the majority of its users at a guess id say most passengers are people living in towns without airports people who can get discounted fares  like pensionors  or people bringing a lot of luggage for cheap compared to the air fare its not really people who are looking to save a lot of time  theyre the ones who catch planes    the main argument i could see behind upgrading the xpt is to fund regional development and decentralisation away from the capitals by giving people access to public transport outside of them unfortunately contrary to the goal of increasing urban density higher speed rail may have the opposite effect  making outlying towns like seymour wangaratta mittagong goulburn newcastle woolongong into commuter dormitories for sydney and melbourne    itd take a lot of push to convince people to take the train all the way between sydney and melbourne when flying is so much faster politicians would rather spend money on airport expansion than funding high speed rail interstate rail is really a bit of a dead concept in this country and youd have to find some exceptional reasons to bring it back to mainstream use
  so disappointed that they keep lumping for the chinese manufacturers
  s o o n
  why does it trigger you if people express themselves artistically around the stations
  not him but 95 of it is shitty tags not everything looks like hosier lane
  fucking always with the great looking imagery and then looking like shit when it comes in to reality    exposed aircon units  messy underfloor electronics    the original designs looked so good
  i dont mind if its street art murals etc i just dont want garish black tags in understand that people will want to decorate the concrete and leave their mark but i want it to not be garbage thanks
the only train line ive ridden here that might be considered kino is the blue mountains line west of sydney and thats from a purely scenic perspective the v set cars they run or were running when i rode it eight or so years ago were showing their age back then when the zig zag line also servicing lithgow reopens next year it will be the best line in australia once again in my opinion as for everything past penrith or richmond into sydney central its shit slow and often filled with rubbish graffiti and lebs perth rail is far from kino but at least its cleaner and being a small city doesnt take forever to get to all the hubs
literally 1 minute walk from the outha line  basically never use it ever    feels odd man      grafitti  artistic    kek
  they also managed to fuck up the stickers on the second car the blue should point towards the ends like  not like       i agree that proper street art is far preferable to shitty tags but ironically wouldnt trenches provide much more available real estate to tag and with 1000 pax/train in peak more people would see it than the comparatively few living next to the rail line
  london is disgustingly overcrowded nothing hong kong tier but definitely too much   your numbers are slightly wrong    london 5590/km2  melbourne 500/km2  sydney 415/km2    your point is correct but its not a very good one in response to mine if i dumped london in australia i shouldnt be able to use a poor national density as justification for shit public transport
  upgrading the xpt  no build a new line   fucking around trying to retro upgrade old lines never works look at germany and the uk      probably not but its still liveable
legit cant find any train services apart from the six metro options and the interstate lines almost impossible to find bus services that operate outside of the metro that sucks
more skyrail more skyrail        assuming pakenham will be rebuilt as an elevated station ala the cd9 im interested to see how the 3 track layout will work    feat rampant nimbyism by the lnp of course
  your numbers are slightly wrong  population density numbers are affected very much by where you draw the city boundaries yet thats bs for working out public transit requirement instead ask how many people are within say a mile of each station including where they live and where they work thats still an imperfect measure but its got nothing like the mountain of bs that overall city population density has
  you aussies think you have it bad try our train system here in the usa which is full of niggers
lmfao get a load of the chump above me
it must be sad being so pathetically racist    but here in a more civilised part of the world is puffing billy definitely a kino heritage railway
  ours have many non whites as well it doesnt say anything about the quality of the service as it wouldnt change no matter who is riding it it depends on the infrastructure dont care if this is a bait post i have to say it because a lot of americans actually think the reason their public transport sucks is because of black people not the physical infrastructure
  forgot to add good examples are london and paris both great systems but are full of nonwhites
  youre thinking of melbourne there is only one 1 tram line remaining in adelaide despite it being nearly perfect for trams the 1950s vandals tore most of them out
  i still find it hilarious that i live extremely close to puffing billy but i havent traveled on it in like 10 years    i can see why the tourists love it to bits though
    well it matters to me because i want to be safe you can have the best transport system in the world but when you are riding with nonwhites who are generally low class and uncivilized drug addicts and wiggers it does affect the quality of the service thats why i enjoy european infrastructure because besides the capitals theres only civilized whites there and i feel safe  t american who goes between south florida and galicia a lot
  youre an idiot and missing the point australian race relations and north american race relations are different in na youre segregated a lot australia is multicultural theres probably more white bogans on the public transport than misbehaving africans and aboriginal people stop applying what happens in your country to our country    captcha select all crosswalks  yup its official merica owns the internet and the english language
  city of adelaide  found your problem
  what happened was that sa vic and nsw in the early days of rail agreed upon irish broad gauge then some autistic scottish engineer in nsw came along and ruined everything for the next 200 years
  sois that a test train or something
  this is some powerful fear    i bet you look like a muggable little bitch too
  what an ignorant and unqualified statement between philly nyc and boston ive probably seen 100 stations exactly like this
  why do americans make everything sound worse than it really is
  grass is always greener / i enjoyed the study abroad semester daddy paid for therefore europe is superior / bashing america is cool for liberals / internet karma
tfw i cant catch a train from adelaide to victor  people have a giant boner for going to victor in the summer and considering how main south rd and victor harbor rd tend to get clogged up with retard boomers towing boats and caravans at 60 or 70kmh a train alternative would be nice    its a shame they closed the line i reckon if they reopened it these days after spending quadrillions relaying the track with modern concrete sleepers itd see a lot of use in summer plus itd probably see yearround use for people commuting to and from strathalbyn
  its also a case of people from a specific region speaking on behalf of the entire country
  what sorry for being off topic but why is there an anti african migrant histeria in the place farthest from africa
  im in brisbane and it takes about 45 minutes to bus into the city in the morning and around 55 minutes in the afternoon  it takes 30 minutes by bike and 45 on the way homei take a longer way home to avoid a really annoying hill so its not worth my time to take a bus even though it is direct to the city even with a ten minute shower/ironing at the end    i dont mind the bus but i need the exercise however when going to other parts of the city for work which would require more than one bus/train i usually just drive or get a lift and ride home the rules about not taking a bike on the trains during peak hour also sucki understand the logic/need for them obviously because id love to take a train to the other side of the city work all day and then ride 40kms home     they are updating the train stations on the ipswich line but theyre not making them look much nicer than they did before just rebuilding the shelters and painting them
  some ended up migrating here and they got involved in robberies and now literally everything an african does ends up on the news      fair enough i always find that shit cringe i know america has similar systems to aus in their big cities although apart from nyc ours cover more suburbs
    fast rail is looking more likely    also general bump
  but are full of nonwhites  hmmmm  i dont know about paris but i can certainly say in the case of london that the tube is far whiter than the city
  shame on the lnp for not committing to as many crossing removals as labor and pressing for their intersection removals instead what a completely braindead idea that would destroy the local amenity of the area even more than skyrail ever could i hope the three sunshinedeer park crossing removals also include grade separation of the rrl junction with sparks soon on the way for wyndham vale and melton i dont think a flat junction would provide enough capacity for metrov/line as well as fast regional rail    speaking of which its good that labor has a plan for increasing capacity out to sunshine for more regional services with their tunnel idea something the lnp is lacking with their badly thought out europeanstyle plans for example traralgon in an hour is just out of the question without quadding to dandy or another rrl style line altogether theres nothing costed or even planned for that probably because guy knows it would have to be skyrail because a full length tunnel would be prohibitively expensive     lastly shame on dandrews plan for ne link that includes using the eastern freeway reservation for a busway and not rail though i suppose srl will end up serving doncaster anyway  better 30 years in the future than never i suppose     complete /laborshill/ here but i hope they get reelected tomorrow and that the lnps african gangs and antiskyrail hysteria doesnt carry the sandbelt and city seats for them the pork barelling going on down the frankston line is just silly at this point even with polls favouring a labor victory tomorrow will be one to watch if they have to form minority government with the greens maybe well see an announcement for metro 2 as well
  im on the sunshine coast  firstly  maroochydore rail link fuckin when    secondly   i took the train from nambour in to the airport the other day it was surprisingly convenient and comfortable though slow until landsborough  7/10 would do again when reasonable to do so
  we did it lads  time for trains
  inner paris is more european but the rer is kenya
  paris is white as fuck dont listen to scared basement dwellers who saw one brown person and soiled their pants from fear
  no paris isnt white as fuck only the very center and the 92
  lmao stfu naïve piece of shit australia is basically an american colony at this point   your aboriginals and blacks make up less than half of what blacks in the us does and most aboriginals live far away from any public transport i can already tell you browse reddit and cant grow a beard
  ive never been to paris in my life but the way the population spread is expansive surburbs past the city limit leads me to believe that the inside isnt very white at all
    they extended the tram line recently so its a bit better but yeah cage companies trashed the trams
  why are americans so fucking dumb and think the whole world is either america or 3rd world war zone
  your aboriginals and blacks make up less than half of what blacks in the us does  i didnt make any claims about the proportion of the population  most aboriginals live far away from public transport  81 of aboriginal people live in cities and nonremote areas 42 of aboriginal people in nsw live in urban areas a lot of them look white or half just like a lot of african americans i never meant to imply that there were a lot of aboriginals on public transport and that they were mostly well behaved i was making the point that people who behave poorly dont do so because theyre black you yanks seem intent on thinking race relations are the same in australia as in the us but theyre simply not    i can already tell you browse reddit and cant grow a beard  nice adhominem this is probably reflection too im not defending reddit there are heaps of circlejerking sheep on it but there are heaps of them on facebook and even you guesed it on 4chan as well the circlejerk on 4chan is from the racist /pol/tards like you who think all black people want to steal your purse on the bus
  yes i can still prefer the stench of the occasional r class though
the victorian railways had very little forward vision towards population growth the lines they closed 50 years ago are getting reopened again    but on the other hand the government has to stop taking credit for these reversals of decisions made by the vr and claiming it as their own genius ideas    also they need to stop destroying our heritage they are starting to get very good at that
  the victorian railways had very little forward vision towards population growth  the lines they closed 50 years ago are getting reopened again  dont think it was the victorians closing trainlines 50 years ago m8
  i was more thinking about the mernda extension how the vr closed it in 59 and they reopened it this year
  1969 melbourne transportation plan  that is where the rot set in  ten freeways planned in it  no rail  built from 1969 to 2005  rail neglected budget cut maintenance and improvement works forestalled    id like to see these sorts of developments going on instead of the shitbox apartment blocks and mcmansions built on farmland 50 km away  tram route  commercial and business block along the street  medium density housing  highly efficient designs
  getting mad because the government actually cares enough to reopen old lines  wew
  actually being mad they got closed in the first place the vr should have been smart enough to see population growth
the la times published this massive article a couple of days ago about the high rate of fatal accidents with robinson helicopters id initially been of the same opinion that robinson states that their accident record is a function of the number of amateur and lowhour pilots that fly them but there are some pretty convincing points presented about airframe breakups delaminating rotors etc thoughts    
no one cares
  lots of factors if a place has them in a sizeable fleet issues may get overlooked in maintenance just going off of that chart the only other model listed that strikes me as a trainer is the schweizer everything else is either a utility helicopter frequently utilized by groups such as news agencies or law enforcement or transport helicopters owned principally by corporations for vip transport both of those categories generally have deeper pockets for quality upkeep as well as more skilled experienced and professional maintainers    flight schools and sightseeing tours never struck me as bigdollar operators that can cater to every little blemish/potential issue that a mechanic might catch especially when those are the easiest operators for a brandnew ap to get a job at    seems like theres way too many variables to make a clearcut definitive claim
  what a terrible animation the la times should hire whoever the ny times uses for those kinds of things

  you can be the richest faggot in the world and still be a faggot
why are recumbentfags so autistic
itt a bunch of anons bash a man having a fun ride because he doesnt fit their idea of what kind of bicycle he should ride or their concept of masculinity even if hes being a massive fred at least hes still enjoying himself unlike you sorry individuals
  itp an anon white knights for an autistic youtuber
  imblying autism is a bad thing  where do you think you are
  you are stupid your whiteknighting and being a youtuber are both far worse now get the fuck off my board and back to r/bicycling
this looks like fun
this guy fucks
  clearly he doesnt dude
  clearly he does btfo friend
  no one is having sex in that photo were you trying to prove something
  no one is having sex in that photo  you dont know that

can we get an sitting in an airport feels thread

  planned in 2010 the 85 billion plan set to finish in 2025 was widely critizised as unfeasible construction has not yet begun    the plan was to locate government areas in the brain army barracks in the horn restaurants in the belly sewage plants in the ass etc    another plan to rebuilt the countrys second largest city in the shape of a giraffe has not materialized either
  i dont know it sounds awesome to live in some animals body part
  what would they put in the legs housing would they do anything with the dick or pussy is that the red light district
  good luck
nnnniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimmmmmmbbbbbbyyyyyyssssss
  i could see this plan working out obviously the city would continue to grow past the rhinoceros shape if it is successful     this plan i can not see working out a giraffe is a stupid shape for a city its too stretched out with too much space inbetween even if you have rail transport down the throat and legs of the giraffe suburbs would more naturally form in bulbs around the stations not in long slender stretches
ah yes the esteemed animal cracker model of town planning
  all the public transport of course
      its always a bad idea to strictly define functional districts of a city this way see for example brasilia
  not sure if you mean public transit for the legs or for the genitals
  good luck pal
here to complain  in major us city espoused as pedestrian friendly  just have to head west on a street for a few miles  in residential and mixeduse area some small apartments some restaurants coffee shops single families etc  suddenly an impassable highway of death and cement barriers in the middle of the neighborhood  no way to cross  go several blocks south still no way across  have to walk back 5 blocks north to get to a cross  more residential area on other side  will there ever come a time when the us will correct its obsession with building interstates highways freeways and 8 lane wide high speed roads in the middle of cities what an absolute abortion
  plus point of living at lower floor   no need to walk too much to get into/out of building when elevator fail   easier evacuation during emergency  fair enough   less likely to experience strong wind due to high floor  how high is this building come on   if you accidentally drop something put of window then its more likely to be broken and more likely to hurt someone  ridiculous   price  ok   no need to worry about height  i dont understand  minus points   view   lower survival chance when building collapse  ridiculous shouldnt be a factor   more likely to have insect at home  agree   during tropical cyclone or tornado hit kore likely to receive damage due to debris  come on where the fuck do you live to worry about disasters and wind   water pressure might be a problem depends on structure of the building water supply system also more vulnerable when sewage system fail  do you live in the 3rd world   air pollution noise pollution and light pollution etc due to street activity  which is a big one   more prone to flooding  okau   its less likely to be able to complete suicide by just hopping out of window   ventilation and sun light  what about it   might be difficult to get into elevator during rush hour  rush hour for an elevator come on    1/10 shitty list
going to apply to study urban planning at concordia university starting next september    wish me luck everyone
were cities better before horses were replaced
  good luck in canada i assume
  no there was huge piles of shit all over the place
  cities peaked right after horses were replaced by trams and cars were just starting out
  will there ever come a time when the us will correct its obsession with building interstates highways freeways and 8 lane wide high speed roads in the middle of cities  muhhh bluhhh theres not infrastructure exactly where and how i want it
  no horses are filthy      based and redpilled
   were cities better before horses were introduced   better nonshitty question   perhaps horses should only be transporting cargo inside the city   if somehow bicycles can be invented before industrialization with stream engines it would make for an amusing scene
 less likely to experience strong wind due to high floor  how high is this building come on  thirty or forty floors high you can already feel your building shaking due to high wind when extreme weather occurs not to mention those that are actually high floors     if you accidentally drop something put of window then its more likely to be broken and more likely to hurt someone  ridiculous  what     no need to worry about height  i dont understand  some people would get scared when they stand next to window on high floor     during tropical cyclone or tornado hit kore likely to receive damage due to debris  come on where the fuck do you live to worry about disasters and wind  coastal asian city     water pressure might be a problem depends on structure of the building water supply system also more vulnerable when sewage system fail  do you live in the 3rd world  not really but failures would still occur once in a blue moon or so even when the system is properly maintained     ventilation and sun light  what about it  shadow of other nearby building would affect you more if youre at lower floor     might be difficult to get into elevator during rush hour  rush hour for an elevator come on  1/10 shitty list  well its true that for people living in lower floors it would be easier to simply walk downstairs during rush hour instead of waiting for an elevator thats mot full to come
  meant to reply
  what this anon said you guys ever go to brasilia  if you live anywhere within the original city you cant go out to eat or have fun without having a car in fact the whole city was built on the then presidents wish to expand the auto industry and with it came a lot a lot of stupid highways they have a metro system but its kind of like an afterthought  by the way why is it that cagers being a thing is always the governments fault  theyre always building roads nobody asked for and in this case some dude built a whole bizarro epcot with no public transportation in mind just to satisfy his ego
  governmental automobile support is actually due to popular pressure petroleum was really cheap in the early 20th century environmental consciousness didnt exist population size was much lower and there were a large number of dirtpoor family farmers with little mobility outside of a couple miles/km from home unless they lived near a rail line and even then they had to travel on somebody elses schedule with onerous shipping/riding fees    t suburban middleburgerstani
how do you decide a bus route  for instance you have three residential district on one side and then a commercial area on another side each of them have some demands should you make a single bus line to capture all the service which would be more frequent however that would be slower for the further away towns due to the detour needed or should you provide a direct service from each of those three towns to the commercial district despite that would mean less frequent services what are some deciding factors
   for instance   thats not enough as an example
  my local system has some guidelines that i think answer some of your question in short i dont think there is an easy answer and many things must be balanced and optimized
chicago man owns and parks 38 cars on the public street outside his home         should public streets have free parking
  absolutely not every square foot used for parking could be used for something else more productive and so they should have to pay for their occupancy of the space if i have to 25/sqft to rent housing for a year that same rate should be applied to a parking space if not more due to supply shortage
    how about this way  if each town get a direct route to the commercial district then from the forecasted passenger demand the bus line can only run hourly however each towns can get their most direct bus service to get into the commercial area which would be about 2030 minutes for each of them  another alternative would be get a single bus route to link up all of them advantage would be it can offer a frequency of up to 46 buses per hour which would cut the waiting time by quite a bit however the further away residential district would need more than an hour to be reached by this bus route because of detour taken to serve the other districts  which of the two scenario would be better and which of the two scenario can attract more passengers
  no but if theyre for public to rent then a different regulation shall apply that should be more lenient to them
  redpilled opinion    what could have been will always be a great tragedy
  if gasoline ever runs out cages will die and be replaced with lrt    we just need to wait for that glorious day
  cities like dallas and atlanta are building walkable parks on top of those freeways to connect the two sides the damage has already been done but we can at least bury it underground
  why not kill cages now
  he doesnt know about electric cages
  nothing like taking a walk in the park while getting your healthy dose of highwaylevel car exhaust
  my god no wonder why no one like cyclist      you do realize that trucks planes trains and boats also use gas right
not enough housing  property developer decided to subdivide luxurious houses into smaller units to rent them out  government no it would be a violation against the rule especially they would now have not enough parking spot for each unit restore them immediately or we would confiscate them  fuck you hong kong government
  gasoline is 40 times as energy dense as current batteries its never going to be a viable solution      this is correct trains will have to be electrified planes will become a rare luxury trucks will be replaced with trains and boats will become vastly less common    itll be a gradual process but unless theres some dramatic change in energy storage technology its inevitable over the long term
  inshallah cars will be replaced and the streets will once again be covered by plants and socialisation
    based
  inshallah our countries will never run out of oil and the kuffar will always be dependent on us making us wealthier than any semite can imagine
thoughts on toronto guys
    trains will have to be electrified  this could be vary feasible in a high population density area like europe or us northeast also see here   the only problem i could see is with route that go thought the literal ass end of nowhere with installation and maintenance    planes will become a rare luxury  this i would not mind considering how much pollution aircraft make also a sky clear of contrail would be nice    trucks will be replaced with trains  this is a major problem since the majority store and factory are no where near a rail line    boats will become vastly less common  unless all world trade stop all of a sudden this is not going to happen
best us cities to live in without a car how is seattle in particular really want a city with water features and humidity arid climates are depressing only been there once but it seemed pretty dense generally walkable and the rail system was convenient
  subway is far too crowded with people who dont speak english riding the lrt in calgary is much more comfy
  very cool looks like the definition of tramtrain do they split these up and run 1/2 units offpeak
  they are always 34 cars all the stations got upgraded to fit 4 cars over the past few years but we may need to use 3 car trains anyways as the 1988 olympics trains get retired and no funding to replace them
   boats will become vastly less common  do you know what you are talking about
  its more likely for shipborne nuclear reactor to mature than they disappear
appearently hamburg considers a hyperloop to transport cargo from the harbour    meanwhile munich wants to roll with maglev regional trains based off the transrapid but slower
   hyperloop to transport cargo from the harbour   obviously they have only heard about hyperloop not inductrack hyperloop cargo makes little sense outside mixed operation and hamburgh port distance doesnt warrant hyperloop   up to 4100 containers per day could reach hamburgs hinterland within seconds and would only have to be loaded onto trucks there a large part of the truck journeys to the port of hamburg would become superfluous   topkek iso container hyperloop was never serious an aviationhyperloop intermodal cargo model transporting ulds would actually work with the great distances to airports and potential for intermodal passenger transfer in mind   mail isnt that big of a market now its integrated into air cargo on top of the packages and parcels of postal services    maglev regional trains based off the transrapid but slower  why are they trying again and something worse still interconnection with the conventional rail network is needed while an airport link is less important
   aviationhyperloop intermodal cargo    aside from allout competition as substitutes in freight   weight concern is ever more sensitive to the maglevs of hyperloop and inductrack in general than airplanes being permanent magnet eds overweight could mean more than overrunning or failure to levitate padwheel wear and damage hasnt been explored much outside passenger application in rubbertyred metro or people movers and the scmaglev chuo shinkansen need to look at inductrack freight researches and see how applicable it is to the hyperloop lowpressure tube
  appearently if you limit the speed to 150km its cheaper than overhead wires
board touristt here  isnt a squared grid the best design if you can design it like that from the start  everything is parallel and perpendicular so things are intuitively easy to find and traffic flows smoothly  whats the advantage of a weird animal shape
  streets feel homelier and communities grow tighter when they dont stretch until the horizon
  so its basically a grid with wiggles/curves instead of straight lines  does this apply to suburbs only or to cities too

    depends they only work in flat places    adapted to terrain is best a grid but not fully rectangular
  you need main artery roads cutting some of the hex blocks in half   otherwise there is no transit corridor to efficiently cross the city
  they only work in flat places  why so
   transit corridor  personal nb the most ideal alignment for any underground railway or anything underground really is to cut through the surface street network go where buses nor cars sometimes even pedestrian cant no need to follow the grid
   gradeseparated railway    in fact this applies to surface transit as well a mainline railway busway or tramway can do with sidewalk and cycling paths etc
  how about cost  and are you talking about underground railway for such low density community
     make a twolane busway then you have transit
a few days ago guangzhou performed a construction inauguration ceremony for six metro lines at the same time including line 3 eastern extension line 5 eastern extension line 7 phase 2 line 10 line 12 and line 14 the inauguration of six metro lines construction at the sane time have broken record of the guangzhou city itself  according to plan in year 2023 the total network length for metro in the city of guangzhou will exceed 800km
  also known as barcelona
  depending on how steep a hill is you may not be able to put a road going straight up but do curved roads instead
  go where buses nor cars sometimes even pedestrian cant  uuh how are people gonna get to the station then   i think aligning gradeseparated transport with main artery roads has many advantages relieving traffic on said road same points of interest available no stations in the middle of suburban nowhere     that said it really depends on the cityscape in question on the terrain method of construction and so on if youre drilling a tunnel or building a higher up elevated rail instead of say cut and cover you can of course build wherever you want     no barcelona has square shaped blocks and superblocks no hexagons as far as im aware
  hexagon  not just slapping a bunch of roundabouts together
  would be absolutely hellish to navigate
whats the different
  the arrows painted on the roundabout tell you what direction to travel thats all i can see
  this   once most cars become electric even the liberals who are anticar/protransit for enviornmental reasons will become complacent and will gladly start taking their cars every so long as they are electric
  its not exactly the most efficient method of development though
  hi hong kong poster again hk is very backwards in roundabouts despite its prevalence     conventional concentric conventional roundabout vs concentric spiral spiral roundabout vs full spiral markings then theres the divided turboroundabout
  by relocating the combustion process from internal combustion engine to power plants theyll suddenly become environmentally friendly
  do you develop for people to live or do people live so that you can have efficient development
  power plant  combustion  whats it like living in the third world
  actually it does since you can trap all emissions at a single choking point rather than using materials on individual cars
  most world trade is pernicious the only legit thing to move around is mineral resources because theres only a few places on earth that have them the rest is shit you buy on aliexpress or amazon machinery that should have been built in your country or fruits that dont grow in your area in the current season but that you dont need
  people live for prosperity of their society each individuals are just a component for the machine known as society
  unless your country achieved 100 yearround fossilfuelfree electricity generation otherwise any additional load convert from other energy source will always mean the addition of most polluting most easily added and most easily switched according to demand type of generator as power source which mean fossil fuel generator and in most places that would even be coal
  unless your country achieved 100 yearround fossilfuelfree electricity generation  hydro  nuclear
  hydro destroys ecosystems tho
   fossilfuel  combustion of biofuel and renewablestoring synthetic fuel including hydrogen doesnt count as fossil fuel alright   i long for a day when fossil fuel isnt synonymous with hydrocarbon fuel
  yeah but biofuel production eat into human food production system
    what are your favourite projects  are any of these projects undeserving of federal funds
  you would be surprised by the amount of environmentalists who dont really think that far into the consequences    and for many people being an environmentalist and driving an electric car is a status symbol there was a study that people will put solar panels on the most visible side of even if the other side would be more effective because they mainly care about people seeing that they have solar panels
  there are efficiencies to power production and pollution control     why dont we all just use generators to power our houses then we dont need to build any new power plants
  wait really source
  so do beaver dams
  no barcelona has square shaped blocks and superblocks no hexagons as far as im aware  no im talking about the arterial roads cutting the city the idea is just like barcelona
  okay i was talking about the hexagon idea exclusively though the problem with that idea is that you dont have any straight roads through the whole thing so id propose cutting some of the blocks in half to achieve that     barcelona has a square/rectangular grid which does allow for straight roads so the basic problem doesnt exist you can still have fast transport corridors in a straight line the diagonal alley or whatever it is called is there for different reasons
who else is stockpiling parts for their over winter builds    post pics link black friday deals ask questions etc
  how much did you pay for that crank im about to sell mine but i have no idea whats a fair asking price
/upg/ is already reserved by /urbanplanninggeneral/  get your own thread name
  damn threads too old to delete sorry      box fresh 250  minimal wear like mine 150  high tooth wear scruffed cranks destroyed spindle stripped pedal thread etc 50150    ive been watching ebay prices for these for a while and this is about what id expect
  its okay we can coexist peacefully 3    theres lots of things in the urban environment that can be upgraded 
i upgraded my dick brakes to deore recently i dont know what more to do to my bike my alivio 9 speed rear derailer is working satisfactorly
  build another one
  whats the spec on the bike any pics  do you just want to make it more comfy and rideable or something else
im currently thinking of getting a second pair of wheels for my meme gravel bike that i can switch to for pure road use  problem is i have no clue what to pick but i do have some requirements    must support thruaxle   disk break ready   fairly lightweight but not necessarily carbon   fairly slim as ill probably slap on some slick 23/25mm tires    dont really care about tubeless ill probably run a tube    lastly id much prefer a high quality pair of hubs/bearings   hoping i can get away with spending around 500 but could go higher if needed
going to change cranks and bb this winter  bsa bb and lightweight reasonably priced and good looking crankset not that easy to find have som kcnc chainrings lying about so maybe could use them on something  suggestions welcome
  why go with such narrow tyres when you can clear good size ones on that bikehow much do you even weigh  seriously though why not put some 38 or 42 mm slicks on the wheels you have
  already have 35mm tires  wheels for gravel abuse the point is to get something with low rolling resistance for a different setup while also upgrading from the somewhat mediocre current rim/hubs
  lol dude just buy a cheap road bike
  used sram/truvativ gxp crank  wheels mfg bb
  no need to go down to 23 mm try 25 or 28 with a set of hightpi tires
suprise upgrade     i was moving between houses and staying at my parents for the week when i found a shortcage ultegra derailer i bought for an echo trials bike in 2007  it took it off when i sold the trials bike and its been in a box of parts forgotten ever since     fast foward to 2018 and i have an aluminium road bike equiped with sora the sora was heavy had plastic parts and the jockey wheels were shit and it dinged my spokes on first gear under load     5 minute upgrade shifts are crisper and its lighter and it looks great trimmed the cable too what a score
what can i upgrade campagnolo veloce to was thinking about 105 but used costs around the same as i paid for the bike
  i already have a bike just need a second pair of high quality light road specific wheels that will fit on my disk/thruaxle frame      yes 25 is more what im leaning to thanks for the feedback     any go to pair of wheels that would fit the other constrains
  veloce and 105 are at about the same level  either go ultegra or potenza/athena
  oh sorry ive got campagnolo xenon not veloce but upgrading to 105 isnt worth it and just go straight for something higher
  i would look at wheels instead of the absolutely marginal gains you would net from a new groupset
  if youve got campy already you may as well upgrade to other campy components
  shimanos rs370 series aka their 105 groupset wheels are 199 euro for the set    shimano whrs370tl    they say they fit 28mm to 45mm wide tires     i spent a lot of time trying to figure out what wheelset to buy and unless you are buying super high end handmade shimano is best bang for the buck maybe its the economy of scale or something    
  how would you compare the shimano wheelset to something twice the price from a top brand  would something like this     show any real advantages
  absolutely not shimano wheelsets are dog shit youd be better off with alex
  dt pr 1600 is the best wheelset for your application    if youre looking for budget wheels get the alex rxd3 or novatec 30 disc
  the main difference is weight which matters a lot to some people and none at all to others the hubs might sound different but both will be smooth shimano has usually been more reliable than mavic one of the problems that everyone has with competing against shimano is that theyre so fucking big that they can take advantage of economies of scale that nobody else can and still make a profit while selling good albeit fucking ugly shit for prices that have gotten them in legal hot water for dumping
  how are they dog shit
  nice upgrade  modern plastic to retro metal  no competition
planning on throwing these on my bike come summer when i change the cables and shit cant wait
/upg/ is already urban planning general cunts
      
  idle curiosity what did those pulleys run you
  20 from ebay chinese knock offs but theyre actually pretty solid quality wise and have ceramic bearings so for use in the dry they should do the job just fine
  my brakes dont even work i use my feet
which brakes is better in general  disk brakes or rim brakes   i want to buy a new road bike  but what brakes should i get  im confused
  is it possible to install both types of brakes
  sure bro   doesnt make sense though
  disc for mtb  rim for road  disc if you will be riding in the rain a lot daily commuting in seattle for instance
are burgers even trying
        
  no they arent trying thats the point
  your selection these days for international flights are basically american united delta or a foreign airline  your selection for domestic flights are essentially spirit jetblue southwest the big 3 or some regional airline with small regional jets/turboprops
  nope its all about the bottom line these days
  thats actually a lot of choice
  compare it to europe though  for shorthaul flights youre looking at one of several airlines  ryanair and easyjet dominate the budget airline sector with additional competitors in the form of wizz air norwegian air shuttle and flybe depending on your location  once you start opening it up to flag carriers you have a huge variety of airlines some operating a budget model some not plus those budget airlines which are focussed on certain countries like eurowings lauda air iberia express aer lingus joon hop transavia vueling air europa airbaltic and so on there are too many to mention    going from london heathrow to franfurt am main youll have a selection of several flag carriers direct youll just have british airways and lufthansa but take a connecting flight and it opens up several more airlines leave from gatwick and your options change again and from stanstead luton or southend your options are still really diverse    dont start with transcontinental flights because the sheer number of options from both european flag carriers for direct flights or through a hub in europe is joined by budget airlines as well as the us middle eastern and asian carriers
  they are literally fine i have no idea why pieces of shit like you complain
  you can solve the problem by creating more countries in whats currently part of the united states
  frontier
theyre shit because the us is shit
  inb4 another merger coming soon
    america has no state owned carrier and now even low cost airlines are finding serious competition from ultra low cost airlines like frontier this happens even though frontier is hot garbage who cancels at least a quarter of their booked flights and will often mail luggage if weight restrictions are exceeded due to weather    its shit but its cheap americans would prefer flying buses to what people normally conceive of air travel if only because the former has no security checks
  international flights burgers is eh tier but domestic burgers btfo anybody in terms of choice quality and price barely anybody else can even compete  i mean flying in japan international is awesome but domestic is horrible isnt it great that you can get on a 777 with 513 other people but you have only one small airline that has more than 30 inches of pitch for a domestic flight
optimus primes face looks like a gp38

  discussion of peterbilt trucks belongs on 
an argument between retrogrouches and freds died for this
  
  and thats a good thing
how many noncar transitformers are there
about to pick this up anybody have any idea what its worth
  free
ad said its a latelate 70s huffy 700cc
offer 350  tree fiddy
  nah breh is about free tiddy not tree fiddy
50 bucks assuming you dont have to replace anything on there that codts more than 25 bucks    huffys usually dont look cool but this one is fairly /fa/     realize that this would be a fun/townie bike as it has no gears and weighs 40 lbs
  its not really worth anything but could be a cool bike with some love and maybe upgrades but beware of throwing money at this  huffy is department store brand a walmart bso of its day  frame willl be heavy that saddle probably weighs what 4 modern saddles weigh   the light and dynamo are heavy and running the dynamo creates friction and feels like riding thru molasses  5050 chance the wheels are steel heavy and braking in wet conditions is nil   im not saying not to get it you should get it but do not pay a lot and be aware what youre getting  most markets have great old 90s mtbs and light steel alloy or aluminum road bikes for 100200  do not pay a lot but its a cool bike
one piece crank  steel rims    worth
op here was looking for pic related or atleast something similar anyone identify it or know where to get something simlar in the us as this pic is taken somewheres in germany
  a linus roadster is probably the most similiar thing you can get that will give you a 3 or 8 speed internal geared hub like that bike has fenders upright bars reasonably wide tires and a rear rack its nothing very high quality but theyre decent enough ive ridden one and somewhere quite flat i think theyre decent you could upgrade to a dynamo hub wheel  led running lights later if you wanted     if you wanted something special more aesthetic to a discerning eye i would look for a high end sporttouring bike used something with decent tire clearance and then convert it to upright bars and bar end shifters velo orange have a wide range of reasonably priced upright bars you could use     and nitto make fancier ones youd need new bar end shifters cables possibly a stem and possibly brake levers also plus just generally overhauling the bike if you managed to find a good enough project frame youd have something much sexier than a tig welded linus
  not just hurling your empties into the neighboring cornfield  nice anarchy youve got there
gear hube
3 speed hub design is almost 120 years old
i have the nexus 8 and i absolutely love it its especially convenient when hauling something heavy and a wild red light appears you just change gears while stopped
  nexuse
  prioritizing practicality over grams and drivetrain efficiency    i bet you use fenders and a dyno hub to boot
  implying you cant change gears while stopped with derailleur
  replace the grease and oil lube that bitch after a year or two or else itll start to eat itself alive slowly but surely
  i think rollerbrakes are nice they work in every weather and last forever
  spot on very comfy riding
  unless you let em run dry in which case theyll be fucked in 2 years
torque conversion for work bikes with a sram dual drive    modified cog was fitted to the other side for the chain to the differential    insane output on hills and with massive loads it sits perfectly in a raised saddle for generating momentum in the steepest stuff
  i liked my nexus 3 why do you need more gears
  and theyll stop eventually
  i use my nexuse 3 more that i use my 8  its bretty nice
  what the fuck is happening here
  i have a nexus 7 for about ten years now in 2016 i opened it for the first time and all gearwheels were looking fine i cant really say how much ive driven but it is well beyond ten thousand kilometers    it doesnt really need maintenance if it jumps out of gear just adjust the adjusting screw until it doesnt and youre fine
  a wild red light  not an issue if you know how to use your eyes
  most nexus 8 hubs ive seen are internally rusted in 5 years  but those problably have been stored outside
  they want you to buy an alfine 8 with proper sealing
    this is from a trike i designed so there is a split axle and differential that is installed in the rear    to get there you have to throw a mid drive on it to create the interface of the variable gear ratios of the dual drive two chains are usedone for a 9 speed sram component set with the rear is fitted to its own style of chain 25 i believe    maxed out with a bb30 pressfit mtb racing bottom bracket and mounted with the stylo 33 oct in the front and a dual drive in the rear it acts as a torque converter on a trike when you are offered 81 speeds to work through    most dont know the advantages of this in the capacity that it can help you maintain a pace in hills whereas the regular direct drive systems to a hub/wheel will make it somewhat hard to maintain constant in the most steep climbs    i created a trike that carries people on the back and climbs the hills faster than a regular bike doesnot lying
  i made one mistake in the design of an estimate of clearance related to the measurement of the middle seatstay in the rear and the fear during assembly of the chain dragging if left as is made me combine the middle seatstay into one bar the new second gen features a rear riser plate that the three pieces all seat flat to bridging the hub design    thats the reason the mounting plate shows a bit of extra over the edgesits not to control wind at high speed lol
  if i feel im in a bad gear at a light i just shift lift the rear wheel and pedal once
  you cant
  
  you can do all sorts of things including holding patterns but with a hub you just click through all gears and youre set im not saying everything else is impossible a hub is just super convenient do your way if its important to you
  weird mine got its fair share of rain but there was no rust
  i love your work anon 
i had a dream about riding a hug gear bike  theyre that good
  maxed out with a bb30 pressfit mtb racing bottom bracket and mounted with the stylo 33 oct in the front and a dual drive in the rear it acts as a torque converter on a trike when you are offered 81 speeds to work through  fuck man thats some crazy ass engineering i really want to ride that thing man
there can be only one
  indeed  the sg3r40
why have you forsaken me
  bad quality untill not priduced by original manufacturer and not realy competitive lineup compared to shimano and rohloff
  80s and 90s sa hubs were good
    nvm i have the dumbs and cannot reads
  gear lube
heavy internallygeared hub  fufufu
  das note a hube  das a brakeet
    also hubs go along well with utility bikes for daily errands and getting groceries and its much more inconvenient to lift the rear tire with panniers
  affordable    ill take pinion seriously when i see one on a mamachari
  youre not welcome here
  a challenger appears
  its shit
  i read a review of a nuvinci crt hub by an actual cyclist  iirc he said it performed very nicely but from a weight and cost perspective it just didnt make sense
      its used widely on ebikes in germany it makes perfect sense in this combination      pinion is not for the masses also do you only take things seriously when they are on a mamachari
  nuvinci is horribly inefficient
  my shop builds and services a number of bikes with these the hub is ok  weve only seen a handlful of issues     the shifter however it a totally piece of garbage  its almost entirely made of plastic and any sort of hamhanding has a high likelihood of breaking the mechanism entirely
  i thought the whole point to cvt was that you dont have to shift it
  any way to jerryrig a setup with twin thumbies/barcons
  cvts have low effiency    dutch manufacturers have tried em  they floperinood
  the point of a cvt is not that you dont need to shift a cvt is so youre always in the most efficient rpm and gearing range for a situation unfortunately the drivetrain loses make being in the most efficient gearing range irrelevant
  9kph xd
  rollerbrakes  hmm i have a 90s mtb fitted with a nexus 8 igh and my shitty brakes are what bothered me most on my daily commute could i install a shimano rollerbrake on that one or do i need a special frame for that how about the front hub
clonks loudly for no reason
alfine 11 gates belt masterrace
  no need for special frame it should come with a band clamp that goes on the chainstay where you bolt the torque arm to
  i hate those band clamps they make it so annoying to fix flats
  tfw nobody makes quickrelease clamps for hub brake reaction arms
  i have a lot of flats  kek
  rattles quietly like a cricket
  my nigga  i have alfine 11 with gates belt drive on my commuter and it works pretty well best combination for daily urban riding
  meant for 
destroys ur shit
  i wonder if the taiwan made aws are made better than the 7090s nottingham build ones
  claris sucks that badly huh
  never tried the 2400 or r2000 claris  must suck to have never ridden a bike keyboard cyclist
  r2000 is crazy good not just a good value but really good full stop dunno why shimano suddenly decided to make all of their road groupsets really good but its appreciated
  trickle down shit the modern claris is like an old duraace these days  sora has been a great deal for a bit longer  shame they dont have subcompact optionsiirc
  may it be duncan macleod the highlander
  yeah but it used to be that they would come up with wacky new ways to make anything under 105 demonstrably inferior but now its the same quality level the whole way through with the only difference being number of cogs until 105 and then some slight materials upgrades the cynical side of me thinks that its because the road market is in decline and that theyre focusing their rd time on ebike like everyone else in the industry i bet that within 10 years bicycles without motors will be looked down upon as ossified retrogrouchmobiles like a steelie with downtube shifters is today
        shimano plastic crap
  assmad that shimano will forever be 1 and has machines and tools thar shuuram and campyniggerpizzanolo could only dream of  campy coulnt make a proper gear hub if their lives depended on it  as for sramwhat a rediculous name they bought out sachs who have been making gear hubs for over a 100 years and managed to run it into the ground in a decade
  ive heard mostly good opinions on sram g8/g9 too bad they stopped making them  also in my country sram means literally im taking shit no wonder its not very popular brand here
  he doesnt like campys loudass freehubs  stop coasting so much fag
  hello borat    stop coasting so much fag  nah you nigger its normal to do in a city with lots of traffic lights
  how much does it weigh
  the base frame with the drivetrain and components is around 40 lbs max    but i slapped a seat on this one afterwards to test a load outeven then its fast and light in the hills    this is the frame up stage
  nuvinchi was adopted by some dutch bike manufacturers  the efficiency was just too low to make it successful  that says a lot since we use nexus 37 and 8 hubs here which all have the lowest efficiency in their class
  
    
  fuck you special snowflake whtoid  this is not some safespace for you to to be a little bitch  get fucked by big turkroack cock
  
      i dont liiiiike  go to /pol/ pls racist1
  sure showed me shitskin  how about you a actually contribute to this board your braindead faggot
  
  great argument faggot
  
  sells you special cables and housing  its just noncompressionless brake housing  normal shift cables with their heads machined into hexagons for no decreeable reason
  hey /n/ what hub would you recommend for touring ive heard of people doing long distance off road touring with internally geared hubs what do yall think
  yeah rohloff i dont think that ive ever seen a rohloff on /n/ sheldon used one for offroad touring and wrote about it there is a weight penalty     i dont think you get the range with anything else and they are the goat durability     schmidt dynamo is king for the front hub i cant recommend it enough and i think thats where your money should go first if youre looking for an expensive meme german hub of the highest quality     a nice pair of handbuilt rohloff  schmidt hub wheels is easily going to be 2000
  its used widely on ebikes in germany it makes perfect sense in this combination    igh will have a major resurgence with the uptake of ebikes considering that they recommend to throttle off the motor whenever you shift on a derailer system   it was the most clumsy part of the middrive kit bike i rode for a bit made the assist almost useless and the throttle somewhat awkward it almost should have had a clutch type motor kill switch for shifting with but thats just beyond what most people want to think about i imagine it wouldnt be an issue at all for igh systems
  i hear theyre great for flatbar road bikes those are the best with generously spiked flat pedals and 47c tyres preferably you can go on all sorts of roads on such a road bike
  whoa holy shit those are pricey could a nexus do the job
  you can tour on anything bro     but a nexus for touring especially on dirt is not ideal or for purpose in any way
  heres a bad idea combine a 3speed nexus with that 350 fsa pattersontype 2speed crank setup
  the rohloff has a transmisson range the ratio of lowest to highest gear of 500 spread evenly over the 14 gears thus the name speedhub 500/14 a nexus 8 speed has a 307 transmission range    for a 42t chainring and a 17t cog youd get for the rohloff 15m in lowest and 8m in highest gear vs 29m and 88m with the nexus meaning serious climbing is out of the question with the nexus if you want 15m lowest gear with the nexus your highest gear will be reduced to 44m and youd have no adequate cruising gear
  for touring always a rohloff if you have the money it has a decent range and is very durable there have been avoidable issues with brokes flanges so read up on that a rohloff will outlive your frame you can expect it to live 100000km easily
  any hub you dont need internal gears at all i did 3000 kilometres on this piece of shit dont even know what make the frame is the wheel buckled and had to get a 80 new one from decathlon halfway through you can literally tour on anything
  rear lube
  what the fuck  post youtube video of it
  youre right but thats actually a pretty nice bike
  k im off to the alps on my 2speed kickshift gear hub equipped bike  dumbass
  have fun lol    youd be hardpressed to find a bike shitter than the ones 100 years ago and cunts were riding in the alps back then just fine     be thankful youve got a fucking freewheel lol
  pretty much this  there was a guy on /out/ last year who went crosscountry usa on a walmart bike he obviously knew nothing about bikes but he was just fine he had to replace a wheel he fucked somehow maybe a few other little things hed just tell whatever bike shop he was near to replace it with whatever was the cheapest option and kept on rolling  he wouldve had a better experience if hed had more riding knowledge and was more savvy with choosing a bike but he still made it just fine and was totally happy
  send diagrams and instructions
  this is what i always bear in mind when im moaning about my bike or my kit or whatever i will never be as tough as those cunts literally racing 300 km a day for a month just to get some pocket money
  i had one of this fuckers self destruct on me at 30kph
  how the fuck do you manage that
  unless youre in 1 kw combined power ranges you dont need to lift gas while shifting on derailleur drivetrains it may not be recommended but a well adjusted derailleur drivetrain will shift well under even quite high power as long as you have plenty of speed the problems begin when you try to shift under high power while going slowly
  to put it more succinctly theres a torque limitation not a power limitation
succ  succ
      at my shop most of the ebikes we carry have bosch systems they detect when you shift and cut the power a bit
  i have panniers what do
  shift before stopping at lights or get igh
  this autism  whew lad
annual reminder that its getting cold  be sure to ease of the pedal even more when shifting that usual  and keep an eye out on any frozen cables and such
how about a 6 speed shifter like on motobikes did someone ever make that
  on a canyon commuter what kind of bike it is the best combination for daily urban riding tho
  looks dope anon like the drive belt
  yea its almost as if there are 2 location to change the gearing
  dont encourage him hes not one of us
  hublet
  its bergamont sweep this is the most actual picture ive got i bought it few months ago used for equivalent of 500 it was in good condition and my size so i think it was a good deal im in the middle of upgrading it with some new parts ill post the picture in /pybt/ and maybe itt if thread will be still alive when its ready    pinion p118 on the front  rohloff 500/14 on the rear  252 possible gear combinations  3345 effective gear ratio  i want to see that happen dont forget the belt drive too
  are you saying this because of dirt entering the hub or because of inadequate gearing for dirt road touring
  wheel buckled  on a 700c wheel  with all that shityourself over the rear wheel    i can tell you why that happened anon
using a shifter
  thats not that much shit tho
  having 2 gears
  inadequate gearing and inadequate reliability   touring on roads you can generally hitch a ride or bus out of trouble but if youre on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere thats not always an option so you need more reliable gear it also sees more abuse and yeah the gearing is not nearly wide enough     ive done some pretty crazy dirt routes where id have been completely fucked if my bike broke down dying fucked
the president of the peoples republic of china prc xi jinpingprc peoples republic of china decided to wash his boeing 7478 b2479 from air china before flying to the g20 in buenos aires we all know that the first impression is the one that counts and that it is convenient to go to these events with the airplane very clean  
  looks like deice to me and a cursory glance at the weather in spain shows a low temp below 0c
  spain  below 0c

  wwhy not fly over the pacific to australia for a technical stop and then continue to argentina why is he going the long way around
  degrees fahrenheit
  even if it is 0 on the ground slightly higher it might get below 0 and very moist and this is dangerous so take some antifreeze with you if you dont want your fuel consumption to sky rocket
  quit posting selfies the point remains
  pacific is the long way round argentina isnt chile
  i just checked it and youre right  but it seems that flying over the pacific just off the coast of the us would only be 700km extra to the journey and flying over russia canada and the us on the way there would only be 400km extra  i guess south america is pretty much the opposite side of the world for the chinese
  its shorter to fly all the way to europe and then continue on to south america singapore used to stop in barcelona before going on to sao paulo while air china stops in madrid with the a330 and then continues on to sao paulo via the atlantic
what kind of food is good to eat while riding    
gotta go fast to go fast
  2 hours or less of nothing too intense just water  more than 2 hours of nottoointense riding/commuting whatever you want really doesnt matter much  intense riding/training/racing sports drinks with carbohydrates and electrolytes
    if the antistall system indeed ran away with the stabilizer control only a fast sequence of steps by the pilot and first officer could have saved the aircraft instructions later issued by boeing show    on the outside of the yoke in front of both the pilot and the first officer there is a switch for electrically controlling the trim  the angle of the stabilizers if the pilot understood what was happening he could have used that switch for a few seconds at a time to counteract what the mcas was doing to the stabilizers but that would have been only a temporary solution the pilot has to release the switch or the nose could go too high but if he releases the switch the antistall system would reactivate a few seconds later according to a bulletin issued by boeing    this is looking more and more like stoppage of delivery  fleet grounding  global recall    rip boeing
looks like boeing isnt going anywhere now
why airplanes dont have breaker that turns off/disconnects everything automatic not dozens of different breakers located in absolutely random place but in one place
afaik turning off trim is a memory item  but yeah shit design
its a msm tries to understand how airplanes work episode  literally the same process for every other aircraft  trained in the simulator for every pilot and  the first and important step is required to be memorized by every airline    msm being retarded as usual
if its boeing im not going
if it isnt boeing  im not going
  oh please if the msm cant even deduce a fucking video game how the fuck can they deduce an aircraft i only have around 3334 flight hours and im still learning a lot of new things
  its literally in the checklist from 2017 you nonflying brainlet    this is looking more and more like stoppage of delivery  fleet grounding  global recall  keep dreaming just because you read an article on some tabloid newssite doesnt mean you have any idea what youre talking about
  complicated manual override steps  literally just turn it off and manually trim its nothing new the pilots fucked up
  global recall is realistic though boeing issued one for the 787 when they kept on catching fire boeing issued one for the 757 when the flaps system kept engaging asymmetrically and then boeing issued one for the 737 classic when the rudder cable kept snapping
  in boeing aircraft the flight envelope protection can be overridden by aggressive control input airbus alpha protection is always on afaik
  the aggressive control input is made difficult by the real feel system on boeing aircraft which can make certain inputs next to impossible to make with human strength and certain inputs basically effortless  the airbus protections are lost when the aircraft enters alternate law which if all 3 aoa vanes on the airbus were malfunctioning would trigger
if it aint boeing i aint goeing
  i aint goering either
  how to enter into direct mode on perfectly working airbus just curious
  global recall  hardly patch the software and the plane is back in the air
  start pulling breakers
  how many and where
do you own a cycling cap are they cringe or esse/n/tial
no i dont
  fuck you
  my helmet has a visor
i find a regular hat performs sufficiently
i own a dozen or so  great for keeping sun / rain out of your eyes and offers a classic cycling aesthetic
i own two plain merino caps essential
  i own one they arent cringe if you wear them with a helmet when riding and on no other occasions
  why the fuck wouldnt you wear one without a helmet
i really want one but i got a gigantic head so the only brand who fits me are the hipster tweedride core ones like wald    it also doesnt really work for me from a functional perspective its hot as balls during the summer and i have a full head of hair so no cycling cap needed i live in the midwest so we have like 2 weeks of fall and this part of the year i end up wearing a skull cap that has ear coverage    this year i found the wonder of the walmart hunting section those fat fucks have giant heads and know how to stay warm pic related comfy as hell but you look like a murderous hillbilly in hunting camo    huntworth victor hat  realtree balaclava  20 for full coverage deer will never even hear you pedal up on there dumb asses
i have two total hipster cinelli caps and two other caps with bananas and ice creams on em with baby color backgrounds  i wear them all the time because theyre functional when cycling and they keep my hair in place
i wear a cycling cap everyday its part of my usual ride attire i have a wool walz cap with earflaps and its great for winter riding also for skiing/snowboarding
  i have one mostly to wear under my helmet when its raining or very hot
  essential    yep keeps the sweat out of your eyes a place to put your sunglasses when they arent needed looks coolandgoodjpg i have a couple vintagestyled remakes  classic team designs like 7eleven san pelligrino etc a good wool one with flappy bois for your ears is important for the cold
since we are talking bike /fa/ post some links boys
  
      
  nashbar usually has decent deals on retro caps  
  i wear one everyday under my helmet i just recently found one with jellyfish
  man that label is so obnoxious
  i dont have a cyclingspecific cap but ive worn a headsweat under my helmet since ive had road bikes and i leave it on if i take the helmet off while im out
  that looks like some gay sm orgy costume
  how old r u
  cringe af
  nah i prefer to look like a normal person that doesnt have an unhealthy obsession with bikes and cycling
facial hair poll    clean shaven full beard stache what are you sporting sport
  full beard is the only true mans style
      4 each
  t fragile masculinity
yes several  for cold weather they warm your head a bit and keep rain from your eyes  for hot weather they trap sweat and block sunlight to your eyes  plus you avoid helmet hair and helmet forehead sunburns  whats not to like
  some of us just cant its ok anon
  if you have problems with sweat dripping into your eyes on long rides a cycling cap will be a revelation     also you dont have completely goofy looking helmet hair when you stop in the middle of the day for lunch/get coffee/whatever
  i have a beard ive thought about shaving it just to mix it up then i ride my bike /out/ when its below freezing and i appreciate the extra insulation
  i dont have one  im fairly ambivalent about them on one hand i think it can be a good look but its not my personal style in terms of function i dont have sweat problems and my cold weather hat is wool with a brim so warmth and rain are not a problem  otoh i think on some people it comes off as douchey
i have several thousand of them they have a very specific use and thats while riding under certain weather conditions not ever rider or ride needs them     traditional roadie fashion asshole rules are very specific     notice how the fashion model in ops pic isnt riding doesnt have riding sunglasses and appears to spend more time on mustache waxing than hill climbs
  i bet you look like a right cunt
  i bet youre one of those weird fucking beard obsessives who gets beard oil and spends hours online messaging other lunatics about grooming methods its just disgusting i wont date a man with a beard more than an inch long    tfw beard boys are still stuck in 2012
i started riding with nothing they i got a bandanna for the sweat then i bought a cycling cap for the sweat and the sun on a tour i left it in my helmet one night and my gloves too when i woke up i saw a chipmunk chewing on it enjoying the salt my gloves were totally destroyed but my cap had survived it might look shabby now but ive worn it for nearly every one of the 35000 miles ive ridden since
  you bet wrong snowflake i shave my neck every 2 or 3 days and thats it apart from the monthly trim i leave the products to basedboys such as yourself
  i hope this is irony
  full beard no shaping or faggoty beard oil or weird shit like that trimed to 6mm length every month or so
  you look like a murderous hillbilly in hunting camo  i fail to see a downside
  i want a mustache like that someday
cycling caps are easier to clean than the inside of your helmet    if you dont ride much then you dont need one its kinda like bib tights or cycling jerseys they seem superfluous until you need them at which point life sucks without othem
  as someone who has that exact same stache  idk if its worth it honestly its pretty nasty
its a fact that girls look qt in them
  regular hat  like a baseball cap i wear those but the visor partially blocks the wiev of road far ahead witch is annoying cycling caps have shorter visors so i assume they dont have that problem or am i wrong
  more of a problem if youre on a road bike if youre a fatty on a mtb the long visor is good because youre sitting bolt upright on your suspension seatpost
  no a regular beanie if i need to keep the sun out of my eyes ill wear sunglasses
  t beardlet
  youre right they also dont blow off your head if its windy    cycling caps also double as headbands i like how they soak up sweat before it gets into my eyes
  if youre on a road bike if youre a fatty on a mtb  well thats obvious    sounds really nice i think ill get a couple cycling caps next summer
  i like them because it stops sweat from dripping into my eyes
  unshaven given up on life
why dont more places have jughandles for left turns
  because they require a lot of real estate and land is expensive in the kinds of places that have enough traffic to need things like the interchange in your picture
  fpbp
because theyre stupid
  this diagram confuses me since i come from a left hand traffic country    at any rate the main reason why theyre probably not in use is because of either signalled junctions with dedicated lanes for changing direction or roundabouts  the more i think about it the more im confused as to how not normal roundabouts are outside of europe roundabouts are everywhere in europe and theyre so mundane yet everything has to be complex and convoluted it seems elsewhere
  thanks for telling us that youre from europe
  complex and convoluted    you mean like this
  no those are just 5 miniroundabouts with really simple rules  giveway to traffic on your right keep in the right lane for the direction youre going in and dont drive into anyone else
   come from a left hand traffic country  thanks for telling us that youre from europe  excuse me what i mean you can argue until the cows come home over whether the uk is in europe but for all we know hes from australia since we have heaps of roundabouts here too
  ireland cyprus and malta are all in europe and are left hand traffic as well
  thanks for telling us that youre from the usa
  the more i think about it the more im confused as to how not normal roundabouts are outside of europe
  australia new zealand and a few others are exceptions  roundabouts are rare to find in north america you might come across some in singapore and hong kong in asia maybe india but those were former british colonies and traffic policy more or less copied the uk for as long as they could  i think south africa has roundabouts in the larger built up cities but again thats more for them mirroring the uks traffic policies for a long time    overall the countries which have embraced roundabouts are either european countries or the former colonies of european countries north america has experimented with them but doesnt quite get them and asia just doesnt like them preferring to go with signalled junctions  africa isnt known for infrastructure  south america will probably have them in the large cities of rio sao paulo santiago and buenos aires
  quadrant intersection is the wellintegrated solution formal version of a threerightsmakealeft   if you want famous us designs michigan left and texas uturns are more generally applicable in a variety of space requirement       theres a big gap between land cost and cost of gradeseparation    the kinds of places that have enough traffic to need things like the interchange in your picture   we have something called a road hierarchy the us has the more extreme street hierarchy ie intentionally designed traffic bottlenecks   also op posted the cloverleafstyle reverse jughandle type c forward jughandle type a looks less interchangeesque and provides a slip lane for free
  what would a city look like if all left turns were forbidden
pardon my poor additions but this is an intersection near me the lights are timed to allow the left turns to cross the oncoming traffic at a staggered pace
thats in swindon uk and it almost never backs up
  its fortunate parallelflow intersections perform close to continuousflow intersections that we dont necessarily have to build such misnamed monstrosity   dont get me wrong its still impressive and very amazing       no roundabouts or lots of roundabouts lots of uturns for sure   the biggest problem would be the lost of connectivity from smaller intersections between twolane twoway side streets
   loss of connectivity from smaller intersections between twolane twoway side streets  because not every one needs a miniroundabout treatment
  whats interesting is that whenever i use that intersection i cheat by using the service road on the bottom right to turn right theres no stop light to exit the service road and enter the highway but instead a stop sign
  because raised clovers are cooler    have you ever walked on one like 100ft up shits neat that one near atlanta is a hell of a view
excuse me we celebrate ours here
anyone here who rides bikes has not broken a bone    ive broken 3 and all were on a bicycle
never broken anything and im a mamil who rides about 10k miles a year had a few spills and crashes helps to not be an edgelord who thinks crashing is manly and riding brakeless fixies with no lights at night going the wrong way is a smart idea
been riding my whole life bicycle i my main and practically only mode of transportation never had anything worse than some scratches no broken bones
  ive broken my elbow but not riding i also got a hairline fracture in the arch of my foot but that was while running
never broken a bone in my life but i dont ride my bike terribly often
ive only ever broken one bone in my life and it was because some jackass crashed into me on a group ride now i am a bionic man with a steelreinforced collarbone cycling is pretty safe though really ive been road and mountain biking for decades at this point and never had anything worse than a sprained shoulder despite plenty of crashes and almost all of those crashes could have been avoided if i hadnt been going for it on technical features or riding home at night after drinking
  nothing broken but if i took up mountain biking i think it would just be a matter of time since my reaction time sucks
60k miles over the last 7 years and a few scrapes and bruises have been the worst injuries suffered on my bike
  i have never broken a bone in my life and i had a lot of crashes that should have seriously injured if not killed me on bicycles and motorcycles  highest crash velocity was about 70 km/h while wearing just helmet shorts and a tshirt
never broken a bone lost plenty of skin to sliding on tarmac though fulltime cycle commuter with long rides on weekend and summer full of amateur races and sportives
i broke my collar bone by falling out of bed or something when i was a child took a while to get fixed because the first time my parents sought medical attention regarding my injury the wrong collar bone was investigated ive fallen from my bikes many times mostly offroad ive never suffered an injury requiring professional attention as the result of an accident on my bikes on one occasion however a motorist maliciously applied the brakes causing me to collide with his vehicle and damage several teeth
  collar bones suck i just broke mine black out drunk riding this halloween still havent been back on the bike yet
  its actually pretty much the best bone to break provided it doesnt pierce the protective sack that its in its basically designed to be broken
also currently shacked up due to a collar bone not by any means the first fracture ive had but out of the 6 bones ive broken this is the first one because of a bicycle i rode freestyle bmx for years as a kid then i commuted to class on a roadie in college and have been goofing off on road and mtb for the last couple years since then i figure 20 years of really consistent riding is worth one solid injury
  its what now  thank god it was my nondomiant side  but i did have to push my bike over 50 blocks
only a finger luckily
my freind broke his arm because we disconnected his brakes at a party lol
   i just broke mine black out drunk riding this halloween    the amount of times i have had no recollection of riding 10km home after 2 bottles of wine  dope is frightening     i did bike trials and huge ass drops and just plain crazy shit when i younger pictured 2005     i dropped inner city escalators and big stair gaps on my dualy when i was younger      no broken bones not even any gnarly scars i am one truly lucky motherfucker     now you got me thinking about it i have done some really dumb shit i should not be here
  its all adding up to a single death blow
i ride my xc mountain bike several times a week weather permitting and have done so for about seven years ive also done a little touring but dont do any regular road riding ive fallen dozens of times and never broken anything just today i bashed my face into a tree and cut my arm up a little and the bruises from the fall before that havent even healed yet its pretty rare that i feel like i had a close call and might have injured myself if id been less lucky i can think of four times that thats happened including today because its the only time ive ever hit my face and i was lucky not to have injured my right eye im generally pretty confident in my ability to fall without seriously hurting myself    i did break my arm in a skiing accident once
  agreed ive fallen/crashed plenty of times but its always because of me being reckless or others being stupid
  theres a few times ive crashed when i should have broken a bone but i didnt just got massive hematomas and soft tissue damage instead my bone density is at the top of what a dxa scan can measure for some reason
never broken a bone on my bike  sprained an ankle/wrist  cut my arm up really bad this was actually way worse than when i did break my wrist as a kid
i think i might have cracked a rib when i was a kid we were jumping off of drops on bmxes and i stabbed myself in the chest with the handlebars on a landing couldnt breathe in for a good half minute and my side hurt like a bitch for a while but i never told my parents about it or went to the doctor  now i have a hard lump sticking out under my right nipple
  so thats what my lump is
  never broke a bone riding bled from the back of my head once but never broke a bone in like 24 years of cycling and crashing
  you know theres a special hospital chauffeur called an ambulance right
never broken a bone while cycling broke my wrist once playing soccer though and have scars on both my knees from dumb shit i did on a bike as a kid
  i lost my phone and didnt want to leave the bike did ja miss the drunk part  i always thought if i broke a bone id fucking know it so i thought i really just fuckolated myself maybe pulled something and that if i just got home it would feel better in the morning   walked from the delaware all the way out to west philly just kinda moaning softly good times thank god i dont remember the actual break
do you drink milk im paranoid my bones might be weak because i havent drank a lot of milk since i was like 14 years old 24 now   never broken a bone but i only cycle to work and dont have to use cager roads so i dont have accidents
  doesnt really work that way dont worry
  i drink a shit ton of milk    as long as theres another source of calcium
  been biking my whole life and i love mountain biking but ive never broken a bone which is a miracle considering i fall off my bike in some stupid accident about once a year
  youre supposed to stop drinking milk when your childhood ends
  maybe if youre nonwhite most white europeans have consumed dairy products for ages and are therefore not lactose intolerant
  tell me about lactosefree meme and thirdworlders
  apparently india brazil turkey china and pakistan are white countries
  tonnes per capita would be a far more revealing graph
  top 10 milk producing countries  learn proper text understanding    maybe if youre nonwhite  talking about lactose intolerance  it has nothing to do with color it has to do with being a mammal retard  just because your body doesnt reject lactose it doesnt mean your organism needs it    you should have enough calcium from a decent diet with grains nuts seeds etc
why do cagers sit in traffic hardly moving for over an hour when there is a perfectly good bike path that takes less time than driving
implying streets have bike paths    in north america youre lucky to get a painted 5foot bike lane in the door zone
  thats enough reason to move country desu
  i have a bike path and i live in north america stop living in a slave state i guess
a d e l a i d e   d   e  l  a  i  d  e
  cagers are the laziest people around theyd rather have the car do the moving even if it takes longer to get around at the worst times in the worst times theyll probably just think of all the times traffic was good    all major highways should be paralleled by bikeways hate bikepaths in the middle of nowhere away from the actual traffic corridors which is where the pollies in this country seem to like putting them from experience
  paralleled by high speed passenger rail and high speed freight  fixed that for you it wouldnt be hard either other than for (((boomers))) et al
  have a high speed rail and bike path no more highways
  tfw we have a couple of bikeways next to highways but they are substantially more hilly due to not being cut out     i guess its good for fitness and fun but not the most practical
turn a few roads into bikeways     roads are almost always the best/ most direct route     do it where theres an alternate route road
  because sometimes the police might fine you and theres a few dumb bikers there that might not notice you coming and if you run them over theyll sue you
  bicycle riding usually simply isnt fun  sure if your path is flat and the weather is nice then it might be  good for you that it works out where you live
  vo2maxlet detected
  im healthy fit and could pull it off but its not something id willingly do  if you enjoy the pain thats good for you im not belittling you for that  im not a cager mind you public transit gets the job done where i live
  how is bicycle riding not fun its like flying goddammit how can you prefer sitting in traffic to that
  based what road is this
  pain  mate youre doing it wrong  bikes are the funnest transport of all maybe horseback riding or flying an opencockpit plane is funner but otherwise bike
  bicycle riding usually simply isnt fun
  implying a flat path is fun
  how is bicycle riding not fun  to name a few things  steep climbs bad weather bicycle defects  its like flying goddammit  if that was true you wouldnt have the situation op describes  how can you prefer sitting in traffic to that  well when im on a bus or train i can read watch movies and simply relax    continue biking by all means if thats your thing you are easing the load on the i/n/frastructure we all profit from that stop claiming that all people who are not following your example are missing out though  it takes a certain type of person to truly enjoy cycling like you do
  why do cagers sit in traffic hardly moving for over an hour when there is a perfectly good bike path that takes less time than driving  why does your mom let total strangers cum in her anus every day
biking is fun   come on now lads biking is good exercise and can be enjoyable but a fun way to commute playing mobile vidya in public transportation is fun riding a motorcycle is fun biking just gets the job done most times
  riding a bike is more fun than filthy casual mobile games
  i live in a union state and moved from another union state cunt      i would love this bridges too  not so much in my city but up until i moved and any time i go back to the burbs i find myself going way the fuck out of my way because there isnt a viable route  it gets even worse when you realize the speed limits are rarely enforced and a 25mph can be easily 40mph      it was fine in pittsburgh fatass      it takes a certain type of person to truly enjoy cycling like you do  its not a certain kind of person its a certain kind of infrastructure   theres no question as to why everybody suddenly seems to have a bike once you hit the city limits even the fatties even non butch women even the blacks  cars dont have free reign there its more comfortable to bike there and as a result of cars not having free reign there for a long enough time everything is within a nice distance    cycling isnt the problem its the capitulation to the car industry and those whove been marketed to to the point of brainwashing
  its a certain kind of infrastructure  this even more so if the city is considered a megalopolis/supercity
  its a certain kind of infrastructure  its also the infrastructure but by far not only that  theres no question as to why everybody suddenly seems to have a bike once you hit the city limits  here in continental europe practically everyone has a bicycle but a lot of times it simply rots away in garage or basement  i gave up on cycling about 4 years ago neither my mobility nor my health has worsened but the commute has become a lot more relaxed  wouldnt consider going back even if the bicycle lanes got covered in gold
  playing mobile vidya in public transportation is fun  id insult you but this is 4channel so have a nice day friend
  in euroland i imagine your public transport actually goes where you want it with consistency  beyond cycling just being fun as fuck i like not having to wait on anybody or anything if i want to go now i can go now where id be waiting at patco anywhere from 5min to over and hour for a train with no bathrooms and nothing to look at but ads  on a bike if i see something cool i can just stop might catching something cool out the window of a train but id have to take it a stop further than i want then walk back then start the whole waiting process over again    no offense friend but you strike me as the adult version of a kid who must have an ipad full of games in his face the moment he sits down at a restaurant or hell throw a fit
    crafers bikeway south australia tbh this is actually a really hard path unless you have a ebike but there are so many good flat bikeways here that are underused
  i appreciate your honesty despite the included slander  the costvalue ratio still works out in favor of notcycling for me    i imagine your public transport actually goes where you want it with consistency  a lot of people will object to that statement but its probably a lot better than in the new world  works for me though and thats all i really care about at the moment  if cycling works for you then by all means continue to do so im not trying to proselytize you  unlike cagers you are doing the right thing
  you died
     eh   what are   the disabled   the elderly   the children   the pregnant   the loads of food  consumer todos   the sick or injured   the dressed up for a formal event   the turists just off the boat   the guys who just wanna ger hammered  dancing
   the disabled  bents   the elderly  dutch bikes   the children  what   the pregnant  how far along   the loads of food  consumer todos  ive shopped and delivered by bike   the sick or injured  you gotta be real fucked   the dressed up for a formal event  what is backpack   the turists just off the boat  yeah cause if its one thing new people understand  its unfamilar local transport    the guys who just wanna ger hammered  dancing  bikes
  hanging on to your preconceived notions this desperately no matter how nonsensical it becomes  cope harder
  horses are scum
  youre right no one has fun on bikes especially not kids kids hate bikes
  attempts to refute arguments against biking that include adults and realworld concerns  reverts to a no one has fun argument when called out on his bullshit  could you please just leave and go be a fucktard somewhere else the adults are trying to have a real conversation here
  if those were the only people on the road minus children they dont drive lol i doubt traffic jams would exist
its so easy for you amerifucks to get on your high horse about bikes trying living in a cuntry where narrow roads pissing rain and steep hills are the norm
  do you live in mordor or something lmao
  yeah dude how dare i stay on topic      how is bicycle riding not fun its like flying goddammit how can you prefer sitting in traffic to that       op  bicycle riding usually simply isnt fun  sure if your path is flat and the weather is nice then it might be    sure you can follow a chain of posts kiddo
  union states  not the real slaves
  good thing cars have existed since the beginning of time how could children and people buying food possibly get around without the cage
  youre so fucking stupid    in precivilization people moved to where the food was they walked to do that if their tribe was better off than others they might have horses    when farming was invented you still lived where the food was but you arranged to grow it yourself again if you were better off you had a horse to ride or if less better off an ox if you were really better off you had horses pulling a wagon suspiciously like a car or truck now isnt that what a coincidence    as civilization and technology progressed eventually we have cars and truck that are motordriven poor people still walk you dont have the choice anymore of riding a horse anywhere in a city or most places for that matter poor people walk they might take a bus which is just a very large car or a subway or train which is just a very large car that runs on a track but people who can afford their own motorized transportation do own one thats how the overall standard of living is improved    so you see youre a stupid fucktard who should shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about go ride your little bikey if thats what you like right now therell be cars waiting for you to buy them when you decide to grow up and be an adult hopefully thatll be long before youre allowed to reproduce we dont need overgrown manchildren influencing another generation in negative ways
  not that guy but show me any civilization where the majority of city dwellers owned wagons carriages or even horses what we have today is the equivalent of near every household with their own stable and a freight wagon akin to what a farmer would have needed in the past  except most people arent farmers and dont need that kind of cargo capacity or the ability to travel long distances at speed or at least they wouldnt if we didnt build infrastructure that penalizes anyone who doesnt participate in the orgy of wasteful consumerism the cars themselves arent the problem its the infrastructure and social norms that obligate people to buy machines that are oversized overpowered and overpriced relative to the actual needs of the people who use them
  pinched nerve in my neck means i cant bike for more than 5 minutes anymore _
    wow i think i can actually smell the burgers leaking out of this post     you dont have the choice anymore of riding a horse anywhere in a city or most places for that matter poor people walk they might take a bus which is just a very large car     maybe in your shithole city that might be the case but there is actually a world outside of it and its not all a direct copy of where you live i know you might be too fat and lazy to walk but many of us can actually afford a car and chose to walk/bike    but people who can afford their own motorized transportation do own one    again not representative of much of the population many people i know can afford a car but dont use it because spending an hour stopped in traffic is less pleasant than a short bike/train ride
  exactly food doesnt need to be grown outside my doorstep farmers can grow it way out and transport it by truck but there is literally no reason people shouldnt walk/bike to the store which should be within 10 minutes walking distance from your house    unfortunately cage ownership has meant stores have all combined in to mega walmarts that are ages away and probably take 10 minutes of walking just to get past the carpark to the front door
  ou dont have the choice anymore of riding a horse anywhere in a city  meanwhile in my city
    lol no you clearly cant see the reality of it  people want them regardless of anything you say  nobody wants to ride a bike in the rain or when theyre sick or when theyre dressed up nice and so on and so on and so on no mother wants to pedal a bike dragging her 3 kids somewhere in the freezing cold or the snow or the rain and sure as fuck when theyre sick thats just stupid nobody wants to be inconvenienced nobody wants to be uncomfortable noboyd wants to do unnecessary work if theres a way you can avoid it  you are the outlier you are the exception you are the weirdo that rides a bike everywhere your perspective your worldview theyre skewed from reality youre fighting a flood with a broom youre wasting your time you can scream and cry all you want about cager this and cager that and public transit the other and so on and so on and it accomplishes nothing other than showing what a weirdo you are to the rest of the world  and that just ensures nothing you say is taken seriously    just accept it people want personal motorized transportation if they can afford it period you cannot refute this in any rational logical way it simply is you can insult me all you want you can ridicule me all you want you can sperg out all you want but it will change nothing just give up and accept the way things are the 99999999999 of the world that does not share your strange backwards vision of what you think the world should be are not going to change the world to suit you just fucking give up already sooner or later you will give up and you will own a car and you will like it
  because it is all part of the plan
  wtf where
  if this is true why do i ride my bike to the grocery store instead of driving when it takes the exact same amount of time either way given the right infrastructure bikes are a lot more convenient for short trips grow up
  you are just the dumbest shit
  more people would walk or bike if they didnt have to do it along a 55mph mega road to shop at a giant shopping center this is where the real hate for cars comes from because of the way it influences city planning
  refute my point then dumbass
  why the fuck should i be restricted to buying my groceries at one store only instead of multiple stores so i get the best prices on everything    why should i have to spend all day doing all my shopping errands because im not allowed to drive myself why shoud i be forced to take smelly slow buses and shit like that and still have to walk all over because it doesnt stop exactly where i need it to    why should i have to make multiple trips on a bus or a bike or anything other than driving because i cant fucking carry it all at the same time    why should i have to risk getting robbed of my shopping by some asshole because im on a goddamned bus with all my shopping    why the actual fuck should i or anyone else have to put up with this stupid fucking shit just because some faggots like you are big manchildren who wont grow up and accept that cars are practical useful and thats why people want them    you and people like you are fucking freaks and you will never speak for the majority or youre just a poorfag who knows nothing else and hates people who can actually afford nice things    any way you cut it you should just shut the fuck up your opinions are about as accepted as the average vegan and their extremist bullshit    go ride your fucking bike i hope a cement truck flattens you meanwhile the rest of us will be leading productive lives with plenty of leisure time because we wont be spending whole days just to cover the basics necessary to live in a modern society go move into an amish community or something
  hey guess what the fact that you need to drive between multiple locations to all of what you need indicates that those locations are too far apart and should be more centralised maybe if they didnt have such massive carparks they could all fit together closer    seriously though are you telling me that every week you need to drive between multiple distant locations just to survive sounds like your environment was designed by someone with your level of intellect who thought that massive carparks were the top priority and that footpaths cycleways train lines buses are all just a waste of space since you dont use them and you probably dont know anyone that does    dont delude yourself you want to live in the country but have access to everything the city has to offer as well in creating your environment this way based around the car youve precluded any thoughts about getting around any other way and your little slice of country your yard probably sucks anyway and it isnt even that big or that private
  spend all day going to twelve different shops to save 12 cents an item    hmm
  its like you didnt even read my post lol when did i say anything about riding a bus and please dont tell me youve bought into spending all day running around to different grocery stores to save 50 cents on a few select items with the coupons your wifes son clipped out of the newspaper that morning i asked   why do i ride my bike to the grocery store instead of driving when it takes the exact same amount of time either way  and your answer is some autistic fit about how you dont want to spend all day riding a bike and how its productive to drive instead i dont understand at all please reread the post and try again please    by the way i own a car its useful for some things but i only drive it once or twice per month because its more of a hassle to use it for daily errands than a bicycle maybe next time dont buy a house in a shitty development in the suburbs and you wont be so angry at everything all the time
  no idea what its like where you live but i have a large supermarket center in walking distance  regular supermarket discounter diy store a market specializing in beverages and a toy store  i can do all the shopping i need in one go without a car wouldnt want it any other way    why shoud i be forced to take smelly slow buses and shit like that  no one is forcing you to  if the car fits your mobility needs best given your current circumstances then there is nothing we can do anymore  everything was lost the second you moved where you currently live without giving a second thought about mobility    that said im on your side when you complain about bicyclers being annoying in assuming that just because it works for them it will work for everyone  i hope a cement truck flattens you  this is not okay though
  i think you might be inhaling a bit too much exhaust fumes buddy its clearly lowered your iq severely and your ability to interact with others
  lmao nice reddit spacing makes you wonder how humans were even able to survive before cars were invented i bet youre completely dependent on your car every time you walk out your front door to go anywhere grow up thats pathetic
  why do you cager shitposters always capitalize car when talking down to cyclists
  why the fuck should i be restricted to buying my groceries at one store only instead of multiple stores so i get the best prices on everything  not sure what you are talking about high density allows me to reach 4 supermarkets within less than 5 minutes of walking and hardware stores a mall photography shop multiple bike shops and lots of other stuff withing less than 15 minutes on the bike
  why should i have to spend all day doing all my shopping errands because im not allowed to drive myself  good question high density solves that issue   why shoud i be forced to take smelly slow buses and shit like that and still have to walk all over because it doesnt stop exactly where i need it to  not sure what you are talking about  why should i have to make multiple trips on a bus or a bike or anything other than driving because i cant fucking carry it all at the same time  if you know what you are doing you can carry quite a lot on a bike with panniers and baskets  why should i have to risk getting robbed of my shopping by some asshole because im on a goddamned bus with all my shopping  that isnt realy a thing besides someone could as well steal a car  why the actual fuck should i or anyone else have to put up with this stupid fucking shit just because some faggots like you are big manchildren who wont grow up and accept that cars are practical useful and thats why people want them  because high density  public/bike transport infrastructure is far more efficient and cars are inefficient and not practical in a city  you and people like you are fucking freaks and you will never speak for the majority or youre just a poorfag who knows nothing else and hates people who can actually afford nice things  kek many people already favor the bike over the car when sufficient infrastructure is available  when goverment subsidies for cars end the public oppinion will change further  also my bike vault is probably worth more than your cars
  any way you cut it you should just shut the fuck up your opinions are about as accepted as the average vegan and their extremist bullshit  not an argument  go ride your fucking bike i hope a cement truck flattens you meanwhile the rest of us will be leading productive lives with plenty of leisure time because we wont be spending whole days just to cover the basics necessary to live in a modern society  car centric infrastructure is so 20th century   go move into an amish community or something  at least there would be no niggers
  you should be careful not to get too worked up cagerkun your heart might explode
  fattass
although i agree with all the brocyclers here i think youre all missing a point your average joe is stupid lazy and ignorant  theres a dude on my job who refuses to commute by bike because theres a 5 hill on the way that goes for about 400m the whole trip would be little more than 1km and because muh bike isnt up to the task lol hes also always swearing because his license hasnt arrived yet and stays until 1 am waiting for the boss to take him home if his dad cant  as far i can tell most people are like that
  i pretty much agree with this but im less pessimistic about humanity when people are trained that its normal and therefore necessary to drive cars most wont even consider that there might be any alternative we should not scorn such people but treat them with compassion because they are blind    i have worked with or managed countless people who complain about being poor and not having enough money to pay their bills each month but then insist on driving everywhere buying premade food for every meal and buying a new smartphone every year and theyre not stupid people just blind to the fact that theyre choosing behaviors that contribute to their problems
  corporate interests are pushing for people to act this way non stop advertisements are brainwashing them in to thinking they need to do things this way its important to help these people live better lives and escape the capitalism cycle
  bullshit
  nice rebuttal i love how you addressed the issue marvelous
  princes highway is comfy m8 especially if you cut across greenhill and marble hill to go down montacute then to glenelg and back pretty fun century ride    fix your bartape man
nuff said
if i run the stop sign you get mad and complain to the internet if i stop for the stop sign you start road raging before my foot even touches the ground like you supposedly wanted i think you need to just accept the fact that we dont like each other and nothing will ever change that until the cager menace is eradicated once and for all
  feminism is ruining western culture
  to be fair its kind of annoying when they use the road in general one time i was waiting at a t intersection that connects to a main road and some lycra clad faggot on a bike was in front of me so the sensor that changes the light didnt see my car so the light was red for ten minutes this guy was so retarded he didnt move out of the way because apparently he didnt even know how traffic sensors work i rolled my window down and shouted at him to move aside so i could make the light turn green for the both of us but he didnt even turn his faggot head around and i knew he heard me because he didnt have his headphones in only thing that stopped me from knocking him over and pulling off to the right was the fact that i didnt want to scratch my car
  only thing that stopped me from knocking him over and pulling off to the right was the fact that i didnt want to scratch my car  gay
why do all you bicycle queers talk about sharing the road and then never do it yourselves
  on my bike i always pull way forward in left turn lanes with signals and try to wave cars behind me to get closer so they activate the sensor but only half the time people understand what im trying to do because theyre dumb or wont roll their windows down so i can explain instead of autisticly pointing at the traffic light and the ground right behind me a lot of people on the road are idiots doesnt matter if theyre on a bike or in a car
  op is a fatass hamplanet in a gasguzzling suv who is jelly and massively butthurt about svelte nonfat nondiseased strong fast based cyclists try getting the fork out of your mouth and moving your fat ass more than just from the couch to the fridge and back maybe if you werent such a disgusting blob of shit women would actually talk to you like the female cyclist you said hello to who curled her lip at you in disgust
some driver has to actually apply some minimal amount of brainpower to figuring out a situation instead of just texting while following lines lights and signs  freaks the fuck out    /o/n/ fusion master race only shit drivers are upset about cyclists
  in my experience its usually shit cyclists who rant about cars online too i see a pattern starting to develop
    where i live the sensors detect bikes
troll thread but dont drivers ever see the hypocrisy when most of their complaints apply to drivers but on a much larger scale with much higher consequences    i rarely see more than 510 of vehicles stop at stop signs the percentage is even lower at stop signs / red lights for right turns most of the time they have their heads cranked left to see if they need to stop completely ignoring any pedestrians to their right that might be about to cross    also ops picture is a mental bowel movement a car is an inanimate object as such has no inherent rights or responsibilities the car doesnt get in trouble if it breaks the law the rest is just a random collection of words with no specific argument
  the worst a cyclist can do is annoy the worst a motorist can do is kill thats why
  thanks for sharing
  the worst a cyclist can do is annoy  or cause a car accident you retard
  right so its still the cars that make the situation dangerous and thus they need to be held to a higher standard and in my experience as a cyclist and a motorist youre not being held to any standard unless a cop gets off his ass decides youre a problem and catches you red handed    i dont want to hear it mister
  every road user needs to be held to the same standard of responsibility when using the road you dont get to some special entitlement just because youre on a bike you faggot    t cyclist
  thats already literally not how it works considering i have a little plastic card in my pocket that allows me to drive
  so just because you didnt have to pass a cycling test the laws of the road dont apply to you
  dude it isnt unheard of for cyclists to kill pedestrians or cause accidents with other cyclists      no whomever is the cause of the accident/crash is the one that made the situation dangerous
  the rules dont apply to me not really because the circumstances are widly different im not always going to stop at a stop sign im not going to sit at a redlight like a fucking jackass unless traffic forces me to i dont have the same acceleration protection blindspots or weight to justify it die mad  cycling laws are motor laws retrofitted without my safety or best interest in mind    however im not really mad about that im mad about the focus on cyclists not following the laws not for any real reason but because of not fwair feelings which is fucking laughable consider the amount of shit cars get away with every second with far more disastrous results not to mention that few motorists actually know what the laws are regarding cyclists or honestly motorists as well  i drive deliveries in sububiura and if i had just a dollar for every retarded thing i see during just one shift id be a fucking millionaire in no time      dude it isnt unheard of for cyclists to kill pedestrians  it is however nearly that    or cause accidents with other cyclists  alright fair however its more easily avoidable and unless youre riding in a pack youre not going to be braindead on the center line while the dude who hit you gets three states over unharmed like a car accident him his bike or both is going to be fucked up enough to place blame    no whomever is the cause of the accident/crash is the one that made the situation dangerous  im not saying be a wheelie kid and ride straight toward traffic in the wrong direction or swerve or whatever what im saying is the mixing of cars with cycles is what turns a safe activity into a dangerous one and not the other way around and thats why there are signs and lines and lanes and lights in the first place introduction of cars threatens my life introduction of cycles just pisses off driving boomers    everyone should pay attention but until motorist need extra care
  sometimes i forget how nonidaho cucks have to ride lmao stay mad and stay criminal you entitled idiot
  its not about any kind of not fwair its a bout being predictable not following the rules makes you unpredictable being unpredictable in traffic makes you dangerous    and i say this as a cyclist
  i dont get to decide what my state does i dont even think of myself as being in my state since the city culture is so distinct and honestly is fairly good with cyclists i have a lot less problems here than i do when i bike in the suburbs visiting there  we usually win our fights against nimbys
  its not about any kind of not fwair  it is youre making fair points though youre exaggerating if slowing checking and going is considered extreme and unpredictable  im talking about the fucks that think its unfair that i can lane split or that i can skip a light when no one is coming or that i get my own lane when motorists literally can drive anywhere dont think twice about turning right on red when there is a sign telling them not to do so have no problem speeding to the point where my driving teacher told me to do 5 over in town and 10 over on the high way as a rule of thumb dont signal the whole nine yards    motorists or the cager subset arent really concerned about fairness or the law theyre just appealing to authority in their petty little culture war explain what is and isnt fair or what is and isnt safe is a waste of time with that lot because it was never about those things in the first place
  wants to be treated as a car  no your premise is false and retarded
  what kind of shithole do you live in where the sensors dont detect bikes and they dont have buttons for bikes to activate the lights
btw how you should clear stop signs
you could make the same picture but with a car instead just replace minimum speed with maximum
  i live in canada and ive never seen a button like that
beep beep honk honk op
  based on this post i would recommend necking yourself
  good one
rules designed for cars lmao fuck off cager
please look up deaths caused via car accidents vs deaths caused via cyclists its a fucking drop in the ocean retards making a massive issue out of literally nothing common sense regulations slow and yield to peds are sufficient
  length of the leash an operator of a vehicle is to be held to is inversly proportional to amount of damage they can cause    pedestrians are less of an issue then cyclists which are less of an issue then cars then trucks and so on
  exactly which is why there is no such thing as walking speed limits or pedestrian right of way while on a footpath the worst they can do is they might headbutt each other    the road rules were written for cars and often make no sense on a bike the road near me had a no u turns sign purely because cars cant turn sharp enough to do a u turn in that spot it makes no sense to follow these rules when they dont make sense
it means youre on the wrong board   is that way
something about the lner
  kek    but yup despite the normandy spoilersr1/spoiler being the most aesthetic ship on the citadel youre going to have to go to   commander
  it makes me think of 
what does /n/ wear when riding  i dont think i could ever bring myself to wear faggy stuff like this but i dont race
  i wear faggy stuff like that because i do race
  depends on how much im going to sweat jeans/tshirt/flannel if its coolish rapha stuff that looks like regular clothes if its hot i dont race so i see no need to larp in traditional lycra
usually just some nonrestrictive shorts with a drawstring and a tshirt   if its colder a merino or poly thermal layer   if its colder a thin windproof layer as well   then leggings  gloves   then a neck muff  more layered merino thermals     i mostly ride for 30120 minutes and its reasonably comfy for that     lycra is amazing though
  i wear faggy stuff like that for my 20minute commute 
  i ride for transportatio/n/ so just my normal clothes for whatever the weather is doing  if i rode for training or long pleasure rides id probably make some concessions towards more faggy stuff i suppose
  70s mtb aesthetic for modern city and road cruisin  feels rad af
  so you wear jeans and a shirt epic
  op if youre not going to use cyclingspecific clothing to ride why do you even care what anyone else wears just wear whatever and dont waste a thread on this or at least use the general thread instead nobody cares what you wear either
  on a completely unrelated note whats your bmi
for leisure riding full faggot attire  for food delivery bibs under jogging shorts and a nonskintight jersey  for casual short rides anything
  last year i woke up in the er and one of my minor diagnosis was insufficient body fat single digits of i remember correctly low enough to start having hormonal and health problems i was like 125lbs at 56 biking like 2550 miles a day 4 days a week shit sucked had to force myself to eat and gain 25lbs to be healthy but last year i felt fast as shit at 125lbs and can throw down 16kw peak and 250ish ftp now im 150 and feel so chunky and slow but at least im not starving all day everyday
  185 ftp is 370w i could be on a pro team but id rather deliver sandwiches
  a lot of pros arent that fast if you remove the world class gear and efficiencies from riding middle of the pack i think a few long time deliver riders are some of the fastest on the street
  yeah i know it really doesnt take that much to go pro honestly cycling has got to be one of the easiest sports there is you could throw together a team of nyc messengers and steamroll the tdf
  depends verry much on my ride  summer roadbike  cycling shorts and jersey sometimes no jersey  mtb  cycling shorts and tshirt maybe shorts over the cycling shorts  commute  jeans and tshirt/sweater  winter riding  multiple layers and motorcyclegloves
  they should do that id like to see that
  i want to see the bike messenger keep up for the entire stage
  you do you
  waste a thread on a board that moves slower than /ck/
  op here not really sure but ive lost a fuck ton of weight over the past few years
  maybe the barrier regarding entry into the pro scene is less about physical condition and gear and more about networking and team dynamics just like other noncycling sports the money involved to get your foot into the door is so high i doubt any couriers could afford it without real contracts and sponsorships really    id watch just to see the outcome  inb4 uci bans couriers    i think tdf tier distances is the humble couriers weakness due to poor diet and teamwork to properly conserve/attack at the right times i see couriers doing quite well in the velodrome instead of the peloton
  for leisure riding full faggot attire  for food delivery bibs under jogging shorts and a nonskintight jersey  for casual short rides anything  this is a perfect example of advice you should completely ignore
non bib chamois shorts  yellow and black short sleeve tall mens jersey    if cold  add baselayer bottoms  baselayer top  cycing jacket really just a running jacket  glove liners under cycling gloves  skull cap under helmet  one of those neck foreskin things you pull up over your mouth when it gets cold    i dont find the cycling outfit very restricting or revealing didnt any of you guys ever play football rugby or wrestle
  where does one draw the line for this     i used to ride about 1015 minutes each way in normal clothes and the pants wore down on the butt in what felt like weeks    these days im doing 40 minutes each way and id rather not get there in sweaty slacks or wear them out early so im going to be changing and if im going to be changing what else but lycra
  what does /n/ wear when riding  something like this and a tee or woolie baseflannel
  how come
  you dont wear anything under cycling shorts it literally defeats the purpose and function of them  a nonskintight jersey doesnt wick sweat away from your body therefore you just stew in stale sweat and never get any cooling  you should not wear jeans and shit like that to ride ever unless you enjoy saddle sores on your crotch from friction and sweat accumulation  whoever that guy is he has no fucking idea what hes doing
  they didnt say they wore anything under the bibs they said bibs go under running shorts    i wear jeans for casual/commute never had a saddle sore in years of riding enjoy your autism costumes
you can wear literally anything for jackass slow durdles that 95 of this board typically does its like asking what specialty clothing you wear to walk down the block fucking stupid
  
  that show was terrible why would you admit to watching it
pic attached i live in cali
  i said bibs under shorts  a loose jersey wicks sweat just fine its not like im wearing a jersey two sizes too big just a loose fit  and come the fuck on do you put on your full kit to ride 2km to a party or something  in any case i was just answering ops question not offering advice
  i think this is the first time i see someone say they dont like mitm
teamkit especially since i live about an hours ride away from where we are based so looks like im on a pretty decent ride even if im only doing hill repeats
  this anon is a zoomer too young for gud taste or too dumb to relate
  50 says youre a coffee snob
  tshirt instead of jersey  coffee snob  damn the bar get lower every year dont it
  its the tiny hat
  a cheap piece of useful cycling attire my last statement stands
  your mom is useful
  your posting is not
  your moms posting is not
  what brand of flappy cappy is that i could only find a camo one in time for cold weather riding this year
  girls look qt in cycling caps and only guys with tiny narrow heads look good in cycling caps i look like kent dorfman in animal house in one
lycra and a skin tight jersey but i cut a hole in the chamois and pull my dick out during critical mass rides
  that fat guy on the bench
  legit lold in public
  never watched that show other than that single episode that episode was pretty funny making fun of freds    also not 
 not wearing this like an unashamed man  faggots
when i occasionally use the train i buy two tickets for myself so i dont have to sit next to anyone due to my social anixety here the trains normally have two seats next to each other and are quite tightly packed so the additional comfort is appreciated     yet by the time the train starts getting busy theres always someone who insists i move over or move my bag i tell them i have paid for two tickets therefore have taken these two seats and that they must stand women always get pissed off by this and sometimes make a scene    who is in the wrong here ive paid for two tickets so technically can take two standard seats when available one for me one for my bag i never sit in disabled areas so thats not the issue
this has to be bait    if you take up an extra seat on a train especially a busy one you are garbage and and an asshole sure i put my bag on the seat next to me when i get on trains but if someone asks to sit in that seat then ill move my bag because im not an asshole
  thats fine if you only purchased one ticket however i purchased two tickets normally i avoid rush hour trains but sometimes i have appointments out of town i need to arrive early for whats the point paying for another ticket if someone is going to claim that seat from you i am not a very good person socially and find it awkward sitting next to people
it depends on rule and customs of each particular railway some explicitly allow it while others explicitly ban it
  depends if its assigned seating youre right  if the ticket doesnt imply seating youre wrong and have no right to occupy a seat as the ticket doesnt imply any right to a seat and youd usually not be allowed to occupy a seat like that
  just in case that this is not bait you are in the wrong if you have this bad of a social anxiety that you freak out over some wagie sitting next to you you should honestly never leave the house i would even go so far to say that you should leave the house only once more to buy some good rope that is
this fucking board
  hows that relevant
  i guess op was expecting some kind of women are dumb fuck everyone youre in the right and everyone else is wrong answer
  an unassigned ticket does not guarantee you a seat only if it has the seat number on it can you actually block a seat like that
  if you can show two tickets you are in your right     just wanted to add you are my hero always wanted to do this but dont get the budget to buy double tickets
  depends if its assigned seating youre right  no still wrong resource hording garbage
the rules are not godly perfect mandates or something like that its like when you where in school and it was not allowed to speak or draw or whatever     what im trying to say is that it doesnt really matter about the rules or who is technically wrong and right its a seat people will seat if you got those problems im sorry but you will need to find another way to deal with them get a car and ride alone i dont know or get over it with therapy    btw fuck the rules i get on trains and sometimes i dont even pay my ticket and just evade and i use seats thats how life goes bro the one that can do it will do it peace out
  what i want to know is why the other people on the train who demand to sit next to you have not purchased a ticket and how come theyre on the train in the first place if they have not
  reserve your seats next time you narcissistic npc
sounds like bullshit  plz kys
  having to give up a seat i paid for to a degenerate like you who didnt even pay anything    great post really highlights why people hate funding and using mass transit and why no one trusts anyone else or wants to help strangers
  thats life bro fuck the system  peaceeee
  are you a false flagger
  fuck the system  meanwhile insists that everyone follow his rules
  im sorry i think the peaceeee bit was too much
  i would have thought the potential to cause conflict would cause more anxiety than just buying one ticket like everyone else
get the fuck over your social anxiety you fucking weakling
  if you can show two tickets you are in your right  not if theres no assigned seating in that case ticket  seat so you cant withhold seats from anyone else for no apparent reason
  wait why are there seatbelts in this train
man what a dick
  im a degenerate for not paying   its not about money mate its about humans sharing and living together this goes before rules and money the ability to coexist in a nice way with others    it cant be more simple 2 seats  2 persons the seat is meant to be used money makes us forget stuff like this like ethipia having huge hunger problems but at the same time it exports food to china that makes no sense by money logic it makes sense but by human and natural logic no sense and stuff like that is why the planet is fucked up    on the other hand i can understand that you have a mental issue but you should try fixing that or looking for other solutions before expecting the world around you will adapt and doing it by using money logic    good luck  and btw    that was not me
  honestly youre right imo if the adjacent seats were reserved but the company likely wouldnt side with you and would require a person be sat in the seat check the fine print and then just get the conductor to back you up youll look like a dick though    alternatively my suggestion is to make up you have an illness which requires the seat look like a creep bark at people who try to sit next to you talk to yourself stink and act crazy that way you dont need to buy another ticket protip nobody wants to sit next to a drunk or a junkie
  its not about money mate its about humans sharing and living together this goes before rules and money the ability to coexist in a nice way with others    if everyone who rode the train was like you and didnt pay the train would not exist due to lack of funding so yeah it is about money mate or are you the only special snowflake who gets to ride for free and is above the law sounds like a nice society for you
    youre in the wrong here unless there isnt anywhere else that you could put your bag because someone sitting should come before your social anxiety the unspoken rule is 1 seat per person besides one of the methods of weakening mental illnesses is often to confront them so as to benefit the psyche by informing it that the mental state is flawed so sitting next to other people should actually be beneficial    if you insist on continuing to do this at least dont insist on it when its busy
  youre burning coal to complain on the internet while children in africa are starving i bet you never thought once to send them some coal to eat
  your logic is flawed bro your thinking in a too strict way life grows widely    for instance going back to the school classroom if everyone speaks or draws yeah of course the class wont work no one will learn and prob the class wouldnt even go on but if one guy draws maybe later he turns out to be an important artist its known most geniuses didnt fit well in a classroom maybe someone talked and lighted the spark of love and a powerfull relationship was born 2 persons shared their whole life had kids etc and they didnt disrupt the class    the system has its order and some people follow it completly and believe everyone should reality is that its never follown 100 and never will look at street grffity most people hate it but its everywhere at the same time the question you might be thinking of why i dont pay and that it aint fair for the payersonly thing that i can say is that the world is like that a bunch of stuff happens and we may agree or not on it so i can feel abused by the system and taken advantage and my way of living involves not using money so much and using the system as the system pissed on me and my ancestors    one thing i must be clear as hell im a kind person and im not an aggressive fuck the total opposite if i see you with problems in the street i will stop and try to help you    now i was just trying to explain a lil of a different way of thinking not discussed so much on the nets cheers and yes peace for all
  wow man so deep powerful stuff rips bong
  this get the fuck over it dude and stop being an asshole
  i dont do drugs try to keep away from stimulants also no coffee for instance been clean for some years i also dont have any tattoos d
perhaps you can find another way to manage your anxiety
  that is when you buy one ticket faggot he bought two for this express purpose
fuck everyone in this thread op  you paid money to keep bitches away and if you did pay the money then the bitches should stay away  i would advise if people harass you a lot and dont let you keep that seat empty figure out a way where you just keep them away without even needing the second ticket    look like a creep of some sort or dangerous or keep twitching or doing retarded shit whenever people come to sit near you lmao theyll fuck off like a raped giraffe
  theyll fuck off like a raped giraffe  that is brilliant
  hes just trolling lol   because really how is getting into an argument with strangers easier to deal with than having to sit next to one  social anxiety doesnt often cause confrontational behavior
  yeah i reckon hed just sit there and mumble to himself once they leave
  t commie
  train
  youre a dork
  no youre just as much an asshole albeit an asshole whos out for twice as much money
  lol go live in a commie shithole faggot
  the plight of african children wasnt caused by me  the discomfort of the passengers is caused by op  its not about trying to save everyone from suffering its about not causing it in the first place
  being decent to other people isnt exclusive to communists
seats are for passangers not baggage if you bought 2 tickets but you are only a single passanger to use it then you are simply just an idiot and the train crew should kick you out if you do not allow other passangers to sit
  anon the trick here is to gain so much weight that you take up two seats naturally that way when a pregnant or elderly lady asks you to give up your seats you respond that youre literally too fat to move problem solved
  youre just a fucking thief by not paying your fare you are stealing from your neighbors your town the people you share the train with the employees that operates the trains from everyone    you disgust me fuckin cheater
  hurr durr what is first class for
  based redpilled and extremely autistic
work on your anxiety it will save you money in the long run also as a tip on trains with 3 seats in a row if you sit on the outside seat many people will hesitate to ask to get in your row especially if its only the middle seat left
im hideous so even on packed trains nobody tries to sit beside me anyway  get on my level
people who you tell to stand didnt also pay  
  commiiiiie
if the seats are reserved like in a shinkansen its ok if seats are not reserved like in a local train or subway you cant do that also depends on the rules of the railway
  doesnt matter if its allowed its garbage behavior
  this    if there is no assigned seat in most inner city transport like ttc toronto transit commission part of the ride has actually been subsidized your ticket buys you a ride not seat just towards the cost    if op is buying an actual seat then op is entitled but it doesnt sound like it as other people who brought their way in would have their own seat then    i have social anxiety so i understand op my suggestion is to bring something so bulky but light that other people wont ask you to move it because there is no way to move it and certainly not on your lap    i only use the ttc during off peak hours and i always have my personal shopping cart with me  very often though i end up standing up for pregnant women old people and then i just stand in a corner with my cart in front of me    op can also try bringing big newspaper i read this even though i get my news online its a sneeze guard and gives me personal space    if you are really desperate you can pretend to cough
  because really how is getting into an argument with strangers easier to deal with than having to sit next to one    well for me not op i have social anxiety and germphobia and i just get twitchy about people being in my personal space esepcially all those reports about stabbings on the ttc etc    i rather confront and be stressed out short term than feel stressed out long term during the trip with someone next to me especially someone who spreads into my seat or touches me    i get really wigged out by someone touching me i hate it when i cross my legs and hunch up and the person next to me spreads out more    even though i prefer no one next to me even when there are empty seat sometimes i seat next to a skinny old person at the beginning of a trip so i dont end up with someone next to me that spreads into my airspace
  i just get twitchy about people being in my personal space  its not your personal space though
  so if im really rich i should be allowed to buy all seats in a cart block the entries against the plebes
  so you are afraid of stabbings and willingly provoke the scum that uses public transport i hope itll be over for you soon
tfw the only trains id ever ride with guaranteed seating amtrak have such fuck huge seats youd have to be an agoraphobic to have trouble with someone sitting next to you  on all other trains seating isnt guaranteed and youd be an asshole take an extra seat if you have such serious issues buy a car otherwise deal
 only faggots go in bus
  nothing wrong with this      correct but that is irrelevant to this train thread
  no because you can only reserve the seats obv
  become a bloatmaxxer thick enough to require two seats with just your body and see wholl try to fuck with you then
  so if im really rich i should be allowed to buy all seats in a cart block the entries against the plebes  you should just contact the rail company and rent the train you can probably get some discount by doing so also
  sorry public transportation is not for you please endure driving your own car
  can anyone identify the type of vehicle/mode of transport in the ops pic it has automotive seatbelts but it looks like its four seats across and theres a door right next to a passenger
  look like a creep bark at people who try to sit next to you talk to yourself stink and act crazy  i unironically do this and can confirm people wouldnt sit next to me win
  look like a creep of some sort or dangerous or keep twitching   i do this i talk loud to myself and stink people dont sit anymore next to me fuck them
  in denmark in intercity trains you buy a train ticket and then have to buy a reservation for a seat could be the situation op is in
  its quite clear from the op that there is no assigned seating and standing passengers are considered normal in such cases no passenger ought to feel entitled to take up more space than necessary at the expense of the comfort of others regardless of how many tickets they may have purchased
  place an inflatable sex doll on the seat    see if any broads bother you    pro tip make simulated semen by boiling rice in just enough water to remain free flowing convincing wet or dried     you are welcome
   op  based redpilled and extremely autistic    because of social anxiety he has to do weird shit that brings him into conflict with random strangers and women at that on a constant basis    shit if i get in any conflict on a train with any random person im rattled for a week and im a 250lb construction worker id be wondering if someone got me on video and gonna make me a youtube star or someone called cops for next stop or their boyfriend is gonna jump me etc
fake and gay ops intention supposedly is to relive themselves from social anxiety but clearly knowingly subjects themselves to hostility and confrontation
  i never sit in disabled areas so thats not the issue  you should though
  sorry public transportation is not for you please endure driving your own car    if im the driver therell be no survivor not unless there are alternative to the foot operated gas and brake pedals i confuse left and right when im nervous and i cant control my foot enough to use it to control speed and definitely not at the same time as steering    i had problems with the sewing machines during home economics because of the pedals i really need something where i can just pull a gear to a perset speed
  have you never taken a bus with emergency door and seatbelt and there are other transports that have samething
  get a disability certificate
  side dicks on car literally when   we need airbus to design a car
  iirc there are cars that can be operated without legs thats how some disabled people drive their car check it
  oh that seat is occupied  im saving it for a friend  they just went to the dining car
  just kill yourself  dude
itt defunct airlines thread lets remember the great airlines of the past that are no longer with us ill start with eastern airlines
  nothin personal kid
cp air
not the greatest but the first airline i ever flew with so they hold a special place in my heart
swiss air swissair 111 bursting into flames and craashing into the ocean at the speed of sound doesnt tend to help and airlines reputation    pic related
i will never not be mad about what happened to them
never flew with them but im a flfag
technically not defunct but they dont exist anymore
  carl icahn is a monster for how he treated twa
  the worst part is that it wasnt just twa that cunt went on the sabatoge more rail projects then i want to remember
air berlin now lufthansa has a complete monopoly in central europe
i always thought their livery was awesome their commercials seemed classier to me than air canada
  damn shame though was looking forward to flying with them from mia and i remember seeing one of their a330s in ord
nah nah nah    enya    nah nah nah             you had to be aussie in the 90s to appreciate these intense feels
     this gave me quite intense feels despite not being aussie i used to like enya when i was a kid around 90s and the air to air footage is beautiful
  its really too bad it died canada really needs more competition on international routes
were going to win were going to win so much were going to win at trade were going to win at the border were going to win so much youre going to be so sick and tired of winning youre going to come to me and go please please we cant win any more
 not much chance to be great
   not given a chance to be great
  kek
any other lakers on here
  i have plenty of friends that were saw them all the time at kden when i was working ramp
  malév hungarian airlines    like a childhood sweetheart lost to cancer not the most perfect of all but for you she was all that and some more and now even though you have become an old ugly hairy man and you only truly remember her nose and that blessed feeling when you were with herwhen you think of her that  old ancient did it really happen just a few years ago  scar on your soul flares up and you just want to cry like you have never cried before

  i flew with málev once it was from dublin airport to odessa ukraine via budapest it was on the fokker 70 and that was a very nice aircraft this was back in 2009 so i dont remember too much  it was a nice airline but even then it was on shaky footing financially  hungarians only have one issue theyre not the most friendly to foreigners including westerners
    nw had the best logo
  just like cancer its finances made the tragic end inevitable does not make it less sad for me and many of my compatriots though  i am sorry that you had such an experience with hungarians but i guess flying to the ukraine had put it into perspective eventually just kidding  partially at least you see i live in the states while spending a lot of time in hungary and russia cultures and their base level of neutral behavior are different for that matter even st petersburg people behave differently from moscow people but one can bring up for example nyc and the south in the us i for one do not believe in the great equalizing power of the motto keep smiling but when in romeits just not to be forgotten that the eversmiling used car salesman does not love you unlike your grumpy uncle who in fact does  hungarians have gotten better dealing with foreigners or much rather advanced in globalism so i think you would have better experiences if you gave hungary and its people another chance these days
  the last time i was in hungary was 2012 and i was only in the budapest area málev had ceased operating then but the airport still had a lot of their logos and marks throughout the terminal  that time i flew with lufthansa from dublin airport via frankfurt airport  hungary at that time was not going through a great political time it still isnt and there was a very unpleasant and authoritarian feel around then  budapest is a beautiful city and i have to say that i like the metro and the tram network i also quite like the máv which ive traveled with more outside of hungary than inside regardless i guess that hungary just has a troubled national history one which always seems to side with authoritarian regimes
  i prefer not to get into politics on this board i understand and respect your point of view even though i most likely would not agree with you regarding most questions related and i appreciate your accepting approach to our national history and mindset  and above all of this i am positively delighted that  regardless all of the reasons you potentially could harbor reservations  you do enjoy visiting hungary budapest and you like its public transport system i hope you will keep returning and once upon a time in the future unknowingly but we will sit next to each other at the bar of a ruin pub in budapest sipping some excellent pálinka cheers my friend
  this hurts the most flying on them between japan and the usa was great
  they were they only airline to fly from cheyenne the stopped 7 months ago
british midland international  bmi used to be the uks other airline based out of east midlands airport instead of london bmi were the alternative to british airways and they were the only airline in the uk to properly serve all the major uk cities connecting them to hubs like manchester airport where you could get a connection onto a star alliance airline like lufthansa continental air canada or whatever  in 2012 british airways bought out bmi took over all the a320s sold all the a330s and gutted the rest of the airline  now the only option you have for connecting onto international flights in the uk is through british aiways which has recently moved to budget airline practices for shorthaul flights or flybe onto a codeshare with some other airline  its now a more pleasant experience to get a flight from a european airline like lufthansa or klm than it is to go through a uk hub
  bmi also used to fly long haul as well in their a330s but with british airways having taken over bmi those long haul routes were either cancelled or absorbed into british airways slots  british airways has done more to harm and destroy the uks airlines than any government
  bmi also ran a budget airline bmibaby which operated on 737s it was a reasonable budget airline and it at least did its job pretty well of providing domestic flights in the uk as well as tourist focused flights  after british airways took over bmi they disolved and dismantled bmibaby
  the only aspect of bmi which british airways didnt gut was bmi regional which focussed on smaller airports and served them with smaller regional jets or turboprops  that branch was made independent and rebranded as flybmi which still exists today serving regional airports  its such a shame that ba managed to totally destroy their rival by taking it over and then destroying almost everything of it
    i know i used to fly for them
  best budget flight i ever went on was with bmibaby

no pan am on this thread

  dont forget about the aries ib    the only airline in space 2001 to not go defunct was aeroflot though makes you wonder
  that was a scary one
  florida  ended in the iced potomac   pottery
  not just a defunct airline in that pic but also a unique aircraft
    is it a mercure
  what it was estimated to have impacted at 345 mph
  yes air inter was the only operator of the mercure the main issue with the mercure was that it was engineered to be the perfect french airliner capable of flying to every major french and european city from paris  the problem came from its range though because as soon as airlines starting thinking of how it would operate from london madrid rome or düsseldorf the planes could really only go as far as france the nordics were out of luck too  when dassault tried their luck in selling to the us the same problem came up but it was even worse even flying from new york to florida was too far for the mercure    french government paid for 12 to be built for their operation by the state owned air inter air france was partially privatised and focussed on profitability over public service ultimately a lot of what was learned from the mercure was later implemented on the a320 especially the lessons learned when you forget that not all flights fly to or from paris
  air berlin    on a slight extension pic related rip leftovers
  canadian pacific air you moron
it was the largest charter airline in the world with 91 destinations
  hey mustard
  its funny that people keep on thinking that im either him or captain joe  wtf  im just your normal spergy /n/ user
  it got blown out even more when airlines realized they could use long range aircraft on popular shorter routes when they had to the result was an aircraft that got beat in pretty much every category if i recall correctly they physically couldnt engineer it to give the plane any more range because it would basically warrant designing a brand new plane
  dassault mercure  the first airbus
  actually concorde was the first airbus because it was manufactured by the same companies who then formed airbus
  i remember watching cp air 737s and ward air 747s land at yyj in the first half of the 1980s
  funnythey sure manage to handle ie fuck up my payroll every 2 weeks
  eh im probably wrong then either way crushed into effectively dust
so 11 speed is not offically pleb tier and patrician cyclists ride 12 speed already or have one orderered    electric shifting of course    shimano being the choice of lower social strata is stuck on 11 on the raod but even they provide 12 for the serious mountain rider    how does it make you feel being so inferior and riding 9 or god forbid 7 speed
hopefully this means the next generation of tiagra will be 11 speed and i can replace my 5800 shifters with those after i get chopped in a corner first race next season
  ill take the bait and say that i dont realy care  im faster than the freds and here in the hills these narrow spaced gears are not much of an advantage anyway  50/34 1128 7speed is sufficient to pass them
makes me feel pretty good knowing i can probably cop a cheap 11 speed etap soon
im not planning on moving from 10 speed any time soon  maybe when my shifters break
  how much lighter is it than 2x10 though
fpr cycling nobody needs more than 3x7 speeds anyway the rest is pseudoinventions for ripping off stupid cyclists
  cope
somebody call shimano and tell cassette should be located outside the triangle then spoke angle wouldnt be that bad on the drive side
  the detriments of drive side spoke angles are vastly overstated in my opinion but you do have a good idea
  would not slap chainstay either
  also belt drive
falling for the latest marketing meme   being proud of it on top of that    how much of a retard do you have to be  how about you ride your bike    i know im taking the bait here but there are people like op irl
  gravel biek
  3 speed is all you need tryhard bike tech nigger
  this    the detriments of drive side spoke angles are vastly overstated in my opinion but you do have a good idea  wrong
  if they were as bad as armchair cyclists make them out to be we would see busted spokes in every single race so far ive only seen one pop on a 24 spoke wheel under a dude who had to weigh at least 240 lbs
  in fairness gravel bikes are useful in places with frostheaved roads as well     t michigander
youre all gay and real cyclists do it single speed  later homos
  youll have to replace your wheels too     old and busted cant wait for the flood of gbikes with less than 100 miles on them on cl new meme is ebike    we never needed indexing and integrated shifting either but here we are
  5800 is 11 speed unless youre saying tiagra is going to be disconly
  post bike drivetrain with timestamp      7speed  1128  youre not exactly riding at the top of your potential so i guess that explains in part why you dont understand how having as many cogs only 1 tooth different from each other makes a difference that and likely never having had any better than what you have now believe me i understand not having a basis for comparison      lowquality bait      real cyclists do it single speed  not fixedgear lol casual  also be sure to enjoy those 10 climbs no worries for you though knee replacement surgery is pretty routine these days xd        i see no reason for anyone to be an earlyadopter of 12speed drivetrains especially if 10/11speed freewheels wont support them the only reason the s5 frameset i have will be built up for 11speed is the wheelsets i have will support it otherwise id be going to 10speed
11 mountain already looks retarded with the chain on the biggest gear and it constantly hovers on the edge of slipping off the sprocket by a margin of like 5 mm in adjustment
what if i live in chicago and the biggest climb is a bridge over a river
  race
  what you scared whteboi
  be only person on 7 speed in roadie club all with modern ultegra or above  ride with lead group and drop everyone else top 20    feeling pretty superior    using cheap plastic thumb shifters on top of that
  got any epic group ride stories
  yeah i scared of you niggers jacking my bike
  nothing wrong with 10 speed drive systems  only literal pros can pull any benefit from a higher sprocket count
  can you explain this in more detail as far as i understand the jumps in cadence between shifts is the same for everyone regardless if theyre getting paid to ride or not
  being so inferior and riding 9 or god forbid 7 speed  nigga i ride single speed
  man what a shit group
 you  7speed  1128  youre not exactly riding at the top of your potential so i guess that explains in part why you dont understand how having as many cogs only 1 tooth different from each other makes a difference   indeed but not even nearly as much as in the flats  only in the flats you have a measureable advantage in the hills your cadence is never perfect anyway  too tightly spaced gears slow down your shifting when the gradient changes  that and likely never having had any better than what you have now believe me i understand not having a basis for comparison  i rented a 11speed 105 equiped bike with carbon fork for almost two weeks during vacation it didnt make a significant difference    if i was riding more in the flats my position might be different but currently i often just draft trucks when in the flats so im often riding in 5011 at 7080 km/h anyway
  post bike drivetrain with timestamp    sorry mate blue board
  i was explaining part of this in my 1x road video but the thing is  pros have such an instinctive understanding of gearing and ftp that they get most benefits from having a ton of closely spaced gears    and there are people like me who never have enough of gears i am doing my best now to convert a 1x only mtb to a 2x with a road cassette
  too tightly spaced gears slow down your shifting when the gradient changes  if the rider is retarded yes otherwise this is in the running for dumbest statement on /n/    but currently i often just draft trucks when in the flats  racing equipment is not developed with idiots like you in mind      pros have such an instinctive understanding of gearing and ftp that they get most benefits from having a ton of closely spaced gears  anyone with power and cadence meters and more than one season of training with both has that a very good understanding where theyre most powerful and are still able to react to surges and attacks
  you are fucking retarded lol
  if the rider is retarded yes otherwise this is in the running for dumbest statement on /n/  i can shift more than half of my cassette with one shift when reaching a steep section i shift once to get into the proper gear and dont loose much time   currently i often just draft trucks when in the flats  racing equipment is not developed with idiots like you in mind  tell me a faster way to ride the flats as a climber    retarded  maybe slightly suicidal but not a retard
  you need to jump up half your cassette when you start going up an incline how weak are you
  not weak at all inclines tend to have over 10 here with gradients that change pretty fast and i tend to spin up climbs rather than grinding them up
  ive climbed in the mountains too never once have i thought that i was hindered by the speed of my shifters to find a comfortable cadence     cope
  i can only talk about my experience with 11speed and 1128 cassettes but the larger spacing between the gears is nice when you have rapidly changing gradients  in the flats or almost constant gradients im totaly with you
  i dont think you understand with modern shifters you can jump half a cassette within one pedal revolution if you really need to
  one pedal revolution maybe but not with one shift up front for more than half of the cassette
  ok now i agree with 
  your mistake was renting a bike with 105 it cant shift fast because shimano cant into designing levers that can dump half a cassette in one go
  sorry if it sounds insulting but you sound like me when i was nothing but a casual rider when you ride for performance you learn theres a difference
  sorry mate blue board  so in other words you have no such thing yourself and are just another shitposter gotcha
  while its a good idea to climb at higher cadences when possible saving your muscular endurance for when you need it the most you should be able to plan ahead enough when a climb is coming up to shift to larger cogs and likely to your small chainring and also your pedaling mechanics should be efficient enough at a wide range of cadences ie in this case 100rpm that you can deal with spinning the cranks faster for a handful of moments before you start a climb that you dont lose momentum
  shimano cant into designing levers that can dump half a cassette in one go  if you cant flick the lever all the way twice in the space of 1015 seconds then i dont know what to think personally its never been a problem and my old bike had 105 on it
  you still dont have a rideable bike  get a cheap beater off craigslist its better than nothing   or would that be embarrassing for you
i ride 1125 10 speed  im assuming my gears go as follows  11121314151618202225  12 speed 1130  111213141516182022242730  as you can tell this increase in gears provides 0 real world performance benefit unless you need a 30 tooth sprocket for some reason i have decided that i do not need this    i have tried electric shifting and its terrible mechanic shifting is buttery smooth and i can feel the relationship in cadence chain tension and cable pull i feel connected to every shift its very kinetic and wonderful    raod  aha youre a blundering idiot    i cannot take the average mountain biker seriously because my entire cross country team passes them like theyre standing still on hill repeats leaving me to assume their fitness doesnt improve because they pedal uphill in gears that would leave them better off pushing their bicycles    seriously they make gruppos with ratios less than 11  and they sell 00    it all is rather amusing i am baffled when hanging out at lbs and sram eagle comes up something like 300 dollars for a cassette that cripples your bicycle maybe it is made for people with only one leg
  my dream shifter is the og gripshift before they got acquired by sram made nearly completely silent just as much response on shifts the same way the cable wraps around the internal of the shifter to provide 21 cable pull    you can throw the entire cassette in either direction i love twisters except for the obnoxious click click click each time i shift
  my road bike has a quite long wheelbase and i frequently ride gradients where i cant pedal seated because the front wheel lifts     i pity anyone who doesnt ride horse category climbs like that because its the real nigga shit
  sounds like youd enjoy friction stem shifters
what a shitty thread  its like a breeding ground for autism and bullshitty bragging  just stfu and ride your bike
  a breeding ground for autism  welcome to /n/
  your post is reasonable  having gears spaced too tightly isnt much of a disadvantage however it doesnt net much shifting performance as you get into larger sprockets you are able to make longer jumps in number of teeth because the increase in circumference of 1 tooth corresponds to a less significant change in radius than at the beginning of the cassette 1114 is much harder to shift than 2528  furthermore it is easier to settle into proper turnover if youre able to shift the position of your foot along the pedal axle further towards the ball of your foot seems to benefit higher cadences and resting under the center of your foot helps with standing on the pedal and provide smooth torque cadence is only one aspect of turnover another being momentum/gear inches lastly i would consider the total of physiological economy    im not sure about drafting behind trucks but ive done it a few times to great success i need to develop my power further so i can overcome wind resistance and that becomes less necessary
  long wheelbases ftw  iirc too easy of a gear makes doing a wheelie much easier so id look into that  in the era of heavier bicycles they would also use heavier gears to match food for thought    im worried it would be less practical to use friction on 10 speed also i love twist shifters because im gravitating towards flat bars    desu being a deadbeat at a teen centerbike commune has turned me into the greatest autist further than /n/ has driven me
  to compliment my autistic focus on flat bars i want a pneumatic shock absorbing stem slow and deliberate so that if i push down on it there is resistance possible to redistribute towards steering that i can adjust the angle on the fly in order to allow for an aero position  i like my stems crazy long i feel that stem length needs to grow with wheelbase  also maybe a buckling spring somewhere close to the wheel only deflects on positive input from a shocking object as not to absorb energy    mostly i need to focus on making a stem i can adjust the angle of by some kind of intuitive performant design
the neck has all the properties i desire from a stem maybe i need to do biomimicry 
  wtf are you talking about you must be responding to me in error
  i have tried electric shifting and its terrible mechanic shifting is buttery smooth and i can feel the relationship in cadence chain tension and cable pull i feel connected to every shift its very kinetic and wonderful  oh god another painfully autistic faggot on /n/
  you said a while ago that your bike was kill and youre referring to your old bike     do you or do you not have a rideable bike atm
  only 12 speed  electronic shifting  stay vintage pleb
  ill sperg a little    10 speed 1125 are universally sequenced like this    11121314151719212325  so a 12 speed version would be  111213141517192123252730    essentially 12 speed in this format gives one two extra gears or 25 extra range if you dont need it then dont get it but    11121314151719212325    in brackets i have added cogs that are on the most common range  they correspond to the range where most cyclists spend most of the time so hypothetical 12 speed 1125    111213141516171819212325    extends it from five to seven gears granted it forces more common shifting to actually use it and some people cant be bothered but it is a clear tangible benefit    pic kinda related 1118 i rode a decade ago with a triple at the front on an mtb it kind of annoys me that the market goes in the direction of moar range when adding cogs      10/10 awareness mate      i am not a fan of 1x but if you want to have it on the road  this is how you do it
  and i forgot to trip silly me
  11 speed 11  23 cassettes are widely available with the same gear steps as your 12 speed 11  25 excluding the 25 the only problem with the 11  23 cassettes are that theyre not enough for mountains and you need a cassette with a longer gear range to swap to when riding in areas with a lot of climbing i can see 12 or 13 speed at the latest solving that problem and being able to provide both the range needed to ride everywhere while also having 1 tooth steps for the most used range
how do filter tripfags in clover
  how do i stick my head in the sand  generation z bunch of pussies
  everyone is get hype about 2x12 etap  and im just sitting here with 3x7 friction  feels good man
  3x7 is all you need  yeah youve clearly never run an old mtb on any sort of technical terrain and had chainsuck ruin your shit
  i drop freds like you on my alu bike with 10 speed red all the time
  the only horse category rider around these parts is baconrider
  answer my question
daily a fixed   4point gear ratio  knees are fine tho  mfw posting on /n/
  using gears cause you need muscle to move your bike  and you call other people pleb  neck yerself
  tfw running 2x6
  still riding an 8 speed dura ace and i will still be much faster with it than you with a shit ton of gears  multi gear fags like you try to compensate their physical strenght with more gears
  dura ace  easy there freddie
  needing 8 eight speeds  lmao get a load of this tryhard
    if i had more sprockets i would have come in first    fred
those deliveroo riders get plenty of exercise delivering freds takeaway meals on urchin tier bikes they should put together a race team
  they would get dumpstered in their first cat 5 crit
  y tho
  hes poor
   poor people  12 drivetrain  what a joke thats too many gears only pussies and racers need that kind of shit   di2 and whatever the hell campys come up with   still a joke  still some pussies who cant use some regular ass mechanical stuff
  he needs two gears  lmao get a load of this granny
   its 2x2   used to be triple
  whats up you smug faggot i ride a 1x7 and love it     hows it feel having unnecessary spinning weight and having your chain at an inefficient angle 
  hows that big jump in cadence working for you champ feel nice hammering up those hills no worries knee and hip replacement surgery is practically routine now and being a young poorfag they probably wont even make you pay for it lol too bad about that rusty piece of trash youre riding though must be tough having to troll through thrift stores looking for replacement parts haha
  not having 4x
  casual
  thats like next level poverty
  are you even looking at the parts installed   mavic a719 wheelset laced to white industries hubs   doesent acknowledge brooks sadle and bar tape   because that screams poverty
  turns out i forgot the picture
  why the fuck even bother having a rear derailleur at that point
       broken rear mech cable   front mech too high above the crankset   rear mech too low below the freewheel   torn bar tape   mavic is now good somehow   meme screwed freewheel hub    maybe if you spent more on proper parts and less on silly useless junk  king headset braap saddle  then you might have had a good functional bike     now it just looks like a dumpster find that was made rideable with minimum cost    just supersayin

   dura ace triple deraileuer   shimano ultegra hollowtec ii cranks   not truly compatible with one another  thats why you are seeing that added clearance    no incompatility there and fd should always be as low as humanly possible  23 mm gap above the teeth  to perform its function
  are you having a stroke
   go any lower and start cathching the chainring when shifting to the big ring   just brilliant who needs to shift anyway
  call an ambulance
  not very familiar with dura ace 7703fd are you  it is meant to be installed with sqaure taper or octalink style cranks not hollowtec

are there any scientific literature that explains why cagers are such selfish entitled pricks    i just saw this woman get run over and the driver made no attempts to even slow down all it wouldve taken to avoid was just being the tiniest bit courteous to people who cross the street  imagine thinking that all pedestrians and cyclists have to accommodate to you
  the weak shall fear the strong
its just normal behavior because they know nothing bad will happen to them
  strawman argument
  not an argument
french cagers on suicide watch because the price of gas increases by 004  a liter    
cagers chimp out  block their own roads  rail and cyclists are unaffected    this is how we kill the cager menace
    you do realize that so long as you continue to use babby words like cager youre never going to get a girlfriend right or is it your ambition in life to become a wizard and only ever have a 2d waifu
  you do realise that calling people names instead of making any valid points does nothing to change their minds right
  the projection is strong with this one
still continues
  why would i want a gf im not a lesbian
  pls be in new york city
  you people are retarded theyre obviously protesting about more than gas prices
  you realize setting fire to monuments isnt going to lower the price of food for your cage right
    attempt to overcome the last mile problem by not building any bike docks  users begin dumping bikes at popular destinations  city takes bikes to impound lot  bikesharing company just makes more bikes    its like some kind of bizzaro world
its kind of beautiful to see a selfish society take it to the absolute maximum
this is how larger bike share hubs should be setup      sound of the electric motor is like at the end of the bourne movies
      how do these bike sharing company make money
  i think there is a deposit when you sign up but i think the big thing for the companies is selling shares to investors so in order to attract the most investment money they flood the streets with bikes to make it seem like they are the biggest or one of the biggest players in the market there are a lot of dubious investment scams in china
i still dont understand why nobody grabs these tears them down and sells the raw materials i mean theres a shitton of metal money just laying there
  well they dont theyre just dumping their bike everywhere hoping to outperform their competitors by dumping more bikes around than their competitors in each cities and hope that they can start gaining money when that day their competitors bankrupt come
  there could also be some financial shenanigans going on such as the company that produces the bikes is owned by the head of the bike share outfit and inflates costs as a way of bleeding the investors in the bike share outfit dry
they should pay riders who ride them to places they are needed ie top of hills suburbs for commuting downtown etc
  sounds like the general china economic plan

  how do these bike sharing company make money  a bit of  but also you pay for the ride and most bikes arent dumped and theyre cheap bikes that are massproduced to a single spec huge economies of scale are at work    as a side effect though the market for stolen bikes has crashed and now bike theft has nearly disappeared combined with pickpocketing and mugging being made obsolete because people rarely carry much cash due to phone payments and phonetheft being almost obsolete due to dirt cheap androids petty crime in china has crashed in the last couple of years i have no idea what junkies can even do anymore
  in areas like shenzen the labour time isnt worth it    i have no idea what junkies can even do anymore  ass backwards burgulary attempts
what the fuck why did they take this from us its not fair fuck los angeles cager culture reeeeeeeeee
  the entire economic model of the companies that ran them was fucked
  dude if that existed today it would be just as shitty as modern public transportationfull of freaks dregs and criminals    la was mostly white then
    i dont think theres much they could have done differently that wouldve saved them postwar la was a particularly bad place for commuter rail but even in places with very high levels of public transit service and usage its still nearly impossible to make a profit outside of thirdworld minibuses and jeepneys and stuff the only successful privatelyowned transit services i can think of are ones that operate at a loss just to funnel people to places where theyll spend lots of money like the vegas monorail      maybe maybe not many of its routes took it through areas that are still middle/upper class and are dominated by white and/or asian professionals i guess you could argue though that those areas are middle class because they lack easy access to good public transit
  la was mostly white then  spics have always been a prominent community in socal what do you expect from a spanish colony
  yeah not like all those public transit operations making money amirite
  they dont have to make money if theyre being publicly run they absolutely need to make money if theyre privately run thats the fucking difference
  it wasnt just you famalam i know these feels too
  nice pcc la scrapped or shipped all of theirs overseas by the mid1960s it is a complete scandal what happened to public transit in america during the 1940s1960s     the last day of regular service was a very sad day for me for several months i had been getting petitions signed by rail passengers to prevent abandonment  petitions given to me by the city of long beach on actual city letterhead in all about 8000 passengers signed the petitions i along with long beach city officials went to court in an effort to save the rail service the court ordered the southern pacific to make the rightofway available to the lamta but the lamta was not interested in continuing the rail service for many reasons i really thought we would win the fight to save the rail service twice while i was petitioning aboard the cars mta special agents put me off the train telling me that i was not allowed to petition on state property the second time they threw me off the train late at night at dominguez junction i was pissed i had to walk a mile to find a pay phone and call my dad to come and get me i got an ear full from him all this work was for nothing i was 18 years old at the time and on the very last run as we pulled into long beach at dawn the track was lined with red flares in the dawn mist i broke down and cried like a baby i will never forget that last run    
  jesus christ get a grip dude
  guy campaigns for an issue he feels passionate about instead of standing around complaining  finds lots of people agree with him  tries to tell the people in power the huge mistake theyre making  nobody listens  all your efforts for naught and youre ignored  whyd you even try you just ended up wasting your time  get emotional about it  at least that guy actually did something takes a lot more effort to try and lose than it does to do nothing  i think anyone who goes through that is entitled to feel a little emotional

      oh noooo ive attacked an autismos pet thing
  such a shame what happened to the tram industry thanks to greedy fucks  
  based    nice conspiracy theory foamer
  most publicly run transit operations were private once and then taken over by the city or some other public administration
how the fuck did our ancestors let this happen fuck you boomers and (((greatest generation))) this is unforgivable
  you have to put yourself in the mindset of the time back then    many people in cities relied on streetcars to get around and were limited by where they went and their schedule highways and personal vehicles were a welcome change and the drawbacks to them wouldnt be readily apparent for some time    in 3050 years things we consider good now will be looked back on with a negative perspective
cars are better anyway

    as an la native its so trippy to see these old photos of la looking like some midwestern city or something im pretty sure the first one is near where the convention center is now that hotel in the back looks like the one they always paint up for e3 pic related the second one is definitely brand blvd in glendale thats the alex theatre with the big tower in the background now there are two big malls just about where the photo was taken
      bring back the red cars
  but they were a minority la was flooded with midwestern protestants for a while after ww2
  la was predominately white midwestern transplants from the 1880s through ww2 ironically the citys financial sector was controlled by jewish families from the midnineteenth century on but everyone got along more or less
  toot toot toot  even american streetcars honk their horns all the time apparently
  at least in new york streetcars were seen as old and obsolescent this guy fiorello laguardia pushed to have every streetcar line replaced with a bus and doesnt everyone just love nyc buses
  italian ie nonwhite just as i suspected
  i thought this dude was supposed to be a progressive sounds like he was in cahoots with moses
give it back reeeeeeeee
  for a time it was progressives that were against street railways as they were seen as an outdated concept while the now obvious drawbacks of massive car use werent too well understood yet
    you got a better deal mate we kept our trams but they gutted our trains
  his mother was unironically jewish
  trams and actual trains on the same tracks  thats so cool i wish that was still a thing
  if you look closely they only share one rail the interurbans are standard gauge the streetcars are narrow gauge
  dual gauge street tracks  very very cool  also very surprised to see a trolleypole on a full heavy rail unit
  also very surprised to see a trolleypole on a full heavy rail unit  was reasonably common on burgerland interurbans  trolleybuses are limited in speed to about 50 kph 30 mph by the trolleypoles but its because they widely swerve away from the wires since rail vehicles dont swerve the trolleypoles still allow up to 150 kph 90 mph although they need precise hanging especially on curves see pic related  pacific electric and north shore line routinely went up to 125 kph 75 mph likely even faster at times
  quick rundown  the north shore line is the record holder of the fastest railroad to use trolley poles  the electroliner in your pic made it up to 111mph in a special test run but had to be limited to 90mph in regular service because it would outrun the crossing gates otherwise  a 3car lashup of the standard cars could and regularly did hit 8085mph in regular service  the mainline was designed for highspeed operation to compete with the cnw 400s and milwaukee road hiawathas in chicagomilwaukee service doubletracked tangent w/ virtually no curves  it was also designed for an eventual conversion to pantographs that never happened

  yes can you upload them to youtube or dropbox or something
  many people in cities relied on streetcars to get around and were limited by where they went and their schedule  the trams rarely had headways longer than 10 minutes you didnt check the schedule you just went to the stop and waited like rapid transit
it always amazed me that some 3 world shithole country can create better light rail system than usa   
  most placks i talk to on here are rightwing neoliberal/reaganomics dickriders who think your vid related is literal gommunism though
  literal gommunism    well literal communists did build the systems originally no
  few places in the world actually care for good transport in most they think its some kind of gommunism but they depend on it so whatevs and since ridership is good it gets cared for even tho most people dont give much of a shit about it and would rather take a car if it were cheaper/more practical  here in spain the largest public transit advocacy group has around 500 members the spanish automobile club has 800k members jfc i get depressed just typing that out
  good transport  good public transport
  forcing businesses to engage in unprofitable models because you collected signatures is a noble pursuit  suck start a shotgun commie
  this the preferable option is to have the government municipal/state assume operation and fund/subsidize it with tax revenue
  limited to 90mph in regular service because it would outrun the crossing gates otherwise
  such was the great depression fampai the employees even accepted a pay cut so the railroad could afford to buy them

  were you riding it for fun
    nah i work at the space needle maintenance
  anon are you ok
  dumb burger here    is it true that you spend the entire ride in your car and theres no passenger coaches or amenities like the regular eurostar
tube home lads
  90 true  you do the spend the entire ride in your car the ride itself only lasts 35 minutes tho eurostars are capital to capital long distance services built around a 3 hours travel time boarding and leaving is about as efficient as it can be check in 45 minutes in advance drive through customs they only popped one car trunk and one coach baggage hold open among the 30 or something cars in front of me be ready to board 15 minutes before scheduled departure time  you can however leave your car at leisure and move around toilets on both floors every 3 wagon you also get 4g throughout the tunnel there might be paid wifi too didnt bother looking for it so i went and took a leak when we started moving and then just put some shit on youtube while i was laying in the passenger seat with my legs hanging out through my shitboxes window had been driving since 4 am running on nothing but double expressos and a light ham sandwich  its also a super comfy ride as you get 4 stages of suspension under your seat wagon primary and secondary car tires car suspension
  the ride itself only lasts 35 minutes tho    ah i see i thought the ride lasted a few hours and they were just too cheap to give anyone amenities like a bar car the autotrain in the united states has hotel services like valet parking and first class dining    have they ever considered extending the eurotunnel shuttle service to more locations ie trains that run to belgium germany the netherlands etc i imagine they would need to add more amenities for that since it would be a much longer ride
  it sadly has about 0 chance of happening  for starters the shuttle rolling stock is positively massive iirc it would fit the french high speed lines loading gauge they would however be completely unable to leave them and french hsls will typically end about 2030 km away from the city centre stations  so youd need a terminal somewhere in the fields and a road to drive up to it okay technically feasible but you better have the demand to justify building it protip trucks from spain and italy  but then you run into the bigger problem youre gonna have to find a way to insert your long distance car/truck carrier in an already busy high speed schedule now a pair of 7mw eurotunnel class 9s has no issue bringing the 2000 tons rakes up to speed tunnel original safety regs made for an impressively overpowered design but theyre also limited to 160 km/h so half of what tgvs can do good luck getting a slot  the issue with the drive and walk through design is also that a club or dining car would have to be at the end of the rake between the locs and loader wagons go tell that to the poor sod at the wrong end of the half rake that hes got a 400m walk ahead of him during which hell have to operate about a dozen pressurised doors and the same return trip to get a coffee hes probably not gonna bother with that coffee i guess you could make it work on longer journeys by making access to those car an option you have to book and pay in advance so that theyll give those cars the closest parking spots    current shuttle compositions are either 2400m car and coach carriers cars in duplex wagons vans caravans and coaches including a eurotunnel minibus with a bike carrying trailer for cyclists in single deck wagons theres a loader wagon at both ends of each half rake truck carrying rakes are similarly split in two half rakes with a club coach coupled right behind the leading locomotive
    that said im getting a huge boner only thinking about something like  middle of the road design bb power unit between a tgv power car and a class 9 gearing them for 220 km/h or maybe push it further if the axle load can be kept below 18 t and making them quadtension  short passenger rake something like 23 lounge coaches  bar car just use an off the shelf avelia or refurbished duplex r1 r4 and r8 for instance thats the minimal compo for any tgv rake as you need the two end cars for uic interface and the central bar car for a load of reasons crossover of most electrical circuits static power converters  a eurotunnel like enclosed autocarrier rake making it single deck and 43 meters tall same as duplex cars which be enough height for some meaty 11001200 mm wheels and enough headroom to fit things like 75 t trucks and regional coaches    that would fit most of western europes main lines except uk you could design a smaller version with single deck passenger cars and more limited vehicle height a typical boxtruck like a fuso or a master/mascott is only around 27m tall after all  going for 400m thats the practical length on french hsls due to loops and siding lengths sets might not cut it with only two power cars having part of the autocarrier powered could solve that just raise the floor and add some power under it youd have to add an exit ramp before the raised section to let trucks out but whatever its just an extra door and has no impact on capacity not the case with duplex carriers  brb gonna check euro loading gauges again and try to sell alstom the design
heres the new smart train in marin county california
  nice reminds me of the light rail dmu near my house
  
  yes but with shorter loading times and faster travel speed to make the thing attractive
  at first i read shart on the train logo kek

  side platforms at terminus stations    this triggers me
  what where else would the platforms be
  its not going to be a permanent terminus station theres another planned station beyond it
  not the terminus end goal is it meeting up with the ferry system so people can commute from santa rosa  sf with only 1 or 2 changeovers
tfw travelling on a feve narrow gauge dmu through bumfuck nowhere in galicia  doesnt get much comfier than this lads  theres like 15 people on this two car train
  forgot pic
comfy dmu is comfy
    it is
good afternoon hustlers lets get this bread
  based comeng poster
  dat absolutely insane loading gauge
    not the terminus end goal is it meeting up with the ferry system so people can commute from santa rosa  sf with only 1 or 2 changeovers    what is missing is where this is behind this picture to the right is the san rafael transit center where you can bus to san francisco or you can bus to the ferry at larkspur landing or you can bike to the ferry     there is a huge problem the tunnel to larkspur is now a bike tunnel and there needs to be another tunnel for bikes or another tunnel for trains considering the other 49 miles of track has three tunnels that were already there this is a big problem marin transit owns the right of way but does not want to just destroy the bike tunnel outright
  another tunnel for bikes or another tunnel for trains    the other problem for the bike tunnel is that it is at a steep grade and has a trestle to cross that is under the freeway

  aare you me    also barcelona or madrid
  aare you me  im every single spaniard that takes the cercanías/rodalies    barcelona or madrid  madrid thats the abroñigal freight terminal in the bottom of the pic  by the way today i saw a doubleheaded talgo consist smallest branch nine coaches coming from jaén the fucking 334s break down so often theyve decided to double head them for redundancy this shit is getting out of control
  im every single spaniard that takes the cercanías/rodalies  i didnt know there were other spainanons other than me from barcelona myself  tfw take fgc rail lines  tfw gud but always packed and no seats at least renfe trains are xboxhueg and always have seats at least here  tfw no face    i saw a doubleheaded talgo consist smallest branch nine coaches coming from jaén the fucking 334s break down so often theyve decided to double head them for redundancy  top fucking kek  its ridiculous that all of spains railways havent been electrified
  i didnt know there were other spainanons other than me  i think theres three of us here on /n/ im the one who posted about how they killed the estrella and how well never hear a talga again  tfw take fgc rail lines  man i really love narrow gauge stuff everytime i go to valencia or murcia i make sure to take a trip on their narrow gauge lines never been to barcelona i really should go visit one day  tfw no face  tfw stands for that feel when  mfw stands for my face when  its ridiculous that all of spains railways havent been electrified  whats that you want another hsr line  sure vote for us well build you three more hsr lines  t every political party
  i think theres three of us here on /n/ im the one who posted about how they killed the estrella and how well never hear a talga again  fwiw im reeeetram guy could have been the one bitching about the estrella talgobro is someone else    narrow gauge  i use the standard gauge lines the narrowgauge lines arent as packed they have less people travelling and allow for 6 car trains narrow gauge lines are more /n/ worthy but their shit frequency and the fact that they run through literal ghettos makes me glad i use the other line    tfw stands for that feel when  that face when fucking fite me    s ridiculous that all of spains railways havent been electrified  whats that you want another hsr line  so true   tfw no directo de burgos
  could have been the one bitching about the estrella talgobro is someone else  no those two were me at least the last two posts mentioning such matters  their shit frequency and the fact that they run through literal ghettos makes me glad i use the other line  define shit frequency  that 465 i took today was running ten minutes late because it was delayed at atocha but i had been waiting for it for fifteen minutes at sol already before taking it  fucking fite me  u wanna go m8 gimme an address and i swer on me mum ill go  tfw no directo de burgos  stop this is not a feels thread plus we should end this circlejerk methinks not good on such a slow board
  define shit frequency  from barcelona to sant boi theres a train every 35 minutes  from barcelona to martorell theres about one train every 610 minutes  further than martorell theres a train every 20 or 40 minutes except to olesa de montserrat where theres two additional trains at irregular intervals    compare that to the standard gauge lines  up to 10 trains per hour on each branch  twice as many on the shared section to sant cugat  32 trains/hour during rush hour in the central tunnel section    its probably not so shit compared to madrid but over here the rail system isnt so overbuilt so were used to high frequencies on local rail lines
  sant boi  i bet the station is announced like  here come sant boooooiii   oh shit whaddup

what is autorotation  casuals    not that its all that comforting
be you  shitpost on 4chan  never fly a shit
  my only beef against helicopters is their range i like their skycrane ability but holy fuck are they fuel consuming whores that go slow as hell
  honorable mention hot air balloons never will i ever
  trucks vs forklifts
helicopters should only permitted in emergency and military service 2bh and maybe also in rural areas in general the godawful noise they produce in urban areas is completely unwarranted just for shuttling rich people around above everyone elses traffic jams
  buy a 15k cessna make air traffic jams
be gyroplane  helicopters laugh at you  airplanes laugh at you  nobody to party with    such is life
  assuming the gearbox and engine doesnt explode autorotation will allow a helicopter to safely come back down to the ground
  dunno theyre easily the fastest growing light aviation vehicle    
  fail hotdog
  i dont see how    ultralight plane kits in the 520k range are extremely common    gyroplanes are either 5k gokart frames with a rotor or 60k fiberglass eggshells surrounding a 5k gokart frame
helicopters are the thinking mans aviation vehicle
  this is true thinking men are often the most suicidal
  gyroplanes fly like they have a permanent parachute attached but without being dragged away at the slightest gust even on a 5k gokart frame you can crash into rocks and walk away fine    
  im not raggin on gyros as a concept im a fan i think theyre pretty neat and id love to add on certification for them    but everytime i think about it i hit two brick walls    1 gyro cfis are like super fucking rare at least in the usa    2 you cant rent them anywhere so youd have to buy your own then back to the rant on how they seem massively overpriced for what you get when you could get a decent used airplane for the same price
  i dont think you need cfi to get a rating on a type granted you already have a rotor craft license it should be very straightforward
  i only have a fixed wing private id still need dual instruction time in a rotorcraft    not really interested in private helicopter nobody rents them for solo flight where i live
  wauchula fl has a shit ton of them for some reason id check there for a potential cfi and just do it on a vacation that part of the state is cheap as heck diggity go do it and let us know how strange it is
people in the 80s were flying homemade tipjet helicopters    did people back then have a lot of balls or were they really bored
  fuck thats beyond suicide and balls of steel tier id say people back then were both
  wiki says 3 madlads were flying those in 1998    and 6 were flying these
  ramjets at the blade tips were actually quite promising eg no torque to counteract with a tail rotor and overall simplicity of design
yeah anon i am a helicopter avionics engineer and i personally hate the things so all of the oil rig guys that fly on them too ill post pics later    spoiler most people get crushed by the gearbox on impact /spoiler
  i saw something similar in a chinese pla training military video
  try to land an airplane on the roof
  given its high enough  a belowminimum height to allow adequate autorotation is still a very lethal height to fall from
  challenge accepted
  hot air balloon pilots are the blackpilled /n/ posters
  i flew the gullfire over leningrad
  thought the one french design was pretty neat that used a small turbine to run compressed bleed air through the rotors to nozzles on the tips same effect of not needing a tail rotor and seems easier to work with/get started than ramjets seems like a likely design idea for small utility/personal helicopters id wonder if you couldnt rig up a recip to some sort of turbocompressor so its even cheaper/easier than a gas turbine
  do we have balloonanons
  underrated
worst ship to ever be fitted with naval guns  im going to say hmt olympic yes that olympic sister of the rms titanic olympic was converted into a troop ship during the first world war including the installation of several 12 pounder guns with little armour and a large silhouette its a miracle she didnt share a fate with the britannic it should be noted that she did sink u103 by ramming it using its speed to cut through the submarine like a knife through butter she was returned to civilian service and withdrawn in 1935
why didnt the titanic use its speed to cut through the iceberg like a knife through butter
  i dont think you realize how massive an iceberg is and how strong ice actually is
  have you ever tried cutting frozen butter
  ramming a fucking submarine with a cruise liner is metal as fuck though
  just like that one german tank commander that shot down a plane with his main gun because it annoyed him
  worst battleship of all time prove me wrong
  it was the strongest battleship class ever build and destroyed the pride and glory of the royal navy
  did alright against the hood and the pw   that said by wwii battleships were yesterdays weapon today and in general pretty fucking pointless     god only knows why the burgerfats didnt scrap this pos immediately after the jap surrender
    penetrates your magazine    brits start calling the previously battleship hood battlecruiser hood
  dude you dont eventually have to leave that class to find a worse ship at least the bismarck destroyed the hms hood the fucking tirpitz achieved nothing and sat in a fjord waiting to be bombed for its life span
  theadmiralclass battlecruiserswere to have been aclassof four britishroyal navybattlecruisersdesigned near the end ofworld war i their design began as an improved version of thequeen elizabethclassbattleships but it was recast as a battlecruiser afteradmiral john jellicoe commander of thegrand fleet pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships but that anumber of german battlecruisershad beenlaid downthat were superior to the bulk of the grand fleets battlecruisers and the design was revised to counter these
  tirpitz tied down tons of enemy resources just by existing
  so did the bismarck
  the tirpitz did it for most of the war bismarck didnt even last a month
  and it didnt tie down tons of german resources coming into existence and then exisitng
  have you ever tried cutting a submarine though
oh man i would love to ride in an airship since im not rich and famous it looks like my only option is gonna have to be saving up to visit that company in friedrichshafen any of you mooks ever tried it
  there is a cheaper way out mate  
  i have been to friedrichshafen and i have been to the zeppelin museum theres also a zeppelin vineyard there zeppelin university and zeppelin you name it    as far as i understand it costs a few hundred euros to go in a short flight over lake constance and see some of the sights of the lake which borders germany austria and switzerland    if youre from the united states then the main cost will be the flight to germany from whatever backwater youre from best options are either to fly into basel/mulhouse/freiburg via frankfurt with lufthansa into zürich with swiss or perhaps into munich with a variety of airlines like lufthansa    but if youre from europe just take a budget airline or the train
the airship was a marvel back in the golden age of aviation if only technology were more advanced at the time and people hadnt lost interest in airship travel we may have been able to see truly giant and luxurious ships from what i know they were very limited on what they could use onboard so the luxury was very lacking when compared to ocean liners
whats the main disadvantage of airships why is it almost dead now sure theyre slow but so are balloons and yet balloons are doing pretty good at the moment     what prevents humanity from building floating platforms in the sky well above tropopause so they are not affected by storms and turbulence with modern technology like carbon fiber it should be even possible to build elevators to get up or down with minimal energy waste it is also one step closer to space elevators
  whats the main disadvantage of airships  gas lift is not as reliable as lift generated by wings
  i dont think it was the main problem even hindenburg had 16 independent gas bags the problem was that the lifting gas was flammable so that a single leak could have caused a fire which would consume the whole ship moreover hydrogen was simply vented out in order to descent which creates a highly combustible mixture  if you replace hydrogen with helium it would be as reliable as the supporting structure
  still some giant balloon wont be as reliable as some aluminum or composite wing   also helium is quite expensive
  still some giant balloon wont be as reliable as some aluminum or composite wing  its not a single balloon its lots of them if one of them will develop a leak it will not cause a crash it wont necessarily even cause a descent that is unless the leaking substance is flammable  wing alone cant keep you aloft forever it must move through the air which means you need a way to constantly control the flight path and push you forward both of these things involve moving parts and may cause disaster if either of them fail  also helium is quite expensive  its not like airship would be running on helium i guess with modern tech it should be possible to compress it to change buoyancy instead of using ballast/vents
  what do you think of hot air airships
  helium shortage is a big hidden wtf in space science and tech application as well

so im changing my fork on my road bike tappered head  new fork needed a new headset sealed bearing so i bought what the manufacturer told me felt direct email with them and this is what is pictured does it seem right for you guys  check out the next pic im posting
this is how it fts it feel locked but at the same time its far from going to the base im putting minor force down in the pic so thats the final position     does it look good is this suposed to be like this dont have much experience with forks and bearing liek these thats why i need help thanks
    youve got it oriented right but youre missing your crown race
  it has an integral crown race ya dingus
  it definitely looks like youre missing a piece  why not just compare it with your previous headset
my veloce rd supposedly can take up to 29 teeth cogs do you guys think i could get away with a 30 teeth big cog
  yes
  if it just doesnt work try getting a longer b limit screw
  uhhhh they usually dont make those out of carbon
i just use finished a ride hit a pothole during a sprint and heard an unpleasant crack sound how and where should i check the bike for cracks
  id check both rims all spokes whole forksteerer and at the downtube/headtube junction seen a few frames crack there after crashes
  already checked wheels they look good would cracks in the frame or fork be obvious through the paint
  what material is your frame
  it is carbon
my schwalbe luganos that came with my bike started to fraying from its sides also i got two flats in a week one was from low pressure when im going to gas station the other was small beer bottle piece in campus should i replace my tires if so i need recommendations i might not be able to find some tires in turkey so more is better
  in that case cracks may not be too obvious to spot sometimes what looks like a paint scratch can go deeper they can even be not visible at all
will cycling in shorts hurt my knees i seen some people say it does but most of those people are old or middle aged and im only 18
  in the cold i mean
    lolno
  how cold is cold i usually find when cycling legs are the least affected probably because theyre working a lot
  not sure where else to ask this but  how stupid would it be to build a hoverbike as in a human powered hovercraft  i have a rough idea about the general construction mainly wood depron and plasticfoil but no idea where to source the blower for the skirt
  hoverbike  stupid but entirey feasible      human powered  you have got to be joking  
  you have got to be joking  it should be possible but still a stupid idea  
  i dont need that much power it already has been done  my idea for the variable powersplit between blower and propeller is to use the rotor of a flybarless rchelicopter to have variable pitch
  most of those people are old or middle aged  this has something to do with it  cold temperatures limit how effectively your joints function because the sinovial fluid becomes more dense and doesnt flow as effectively older folks notice the effects of cold more quickly because gradual wear on the body over the years means their joints already have accumulated wear and injury that makes them more sensitive whether riding in the cold is harmful to the knees in itself is harmful or not isnt something that has been demonstrated scientifically afaik but given the reduced performance of your sinovial fluid it stands to reason that the cold isnt going to do you any favors and might reasonably be assumed to increase your chances of developing the sort of injury that knees are also vulnerable to in warmer conditions so covering your knees in the cold below freezing at least is a sensible and simple preventive measure to take      really stupid in absolute terms humans dont put out much useful horsepower 02 hp for a well trained athlete in ideal conditions so youd probably waste more 1000x more energy in efficiency losses than youd stand to gain by adding humanproduced power into a machine that would require a massively powerful engine to function at all      look at the tread of your tire  if its worn the point of having a large smooth plateau on top or if the tread has worn down so that the casing inside is exposed in places then its definitely time to replace      i think this is fine there doesnt appear to be any real space left for anything missing but id compare to other pictures of this fork justto be safe
  really stupid in absolute terms humans dont put out much useful horsepower 02 hp for a well trained athlete in ideal conditions  o2 hp are just 150w i can do about 200250w for one hour plus i only weight 60 kg  pro riders pedal well above 350w 047hp for one hour  so youd probably waste more 1000x more energy in efficiency losses than youd stand to gain by adding humanproduced power into a machine that would require a massively powerful engine to function at all  i wasnt talking about a hybrid system i was talking about using only human power for it
  how stupid would it be to build a hoverbike as in a human powered hovercraft  it would be quite difficult but doable you just need to calculate wings so it will take off at 30 km/h or even lower also you need some sort of fan
  i can do about 200250w for one hour plus  you can ride 40 km/h on pedal power for hour
    would you mind taking this to   
  show maths please
  i dont think that much power usually gets you to 40 km/h
  hovercraft  wings    no that would reqire even more power or a verry aerodynamic position like a recumbent bike    ok this will be my last post about it here    i didnt calculate it yet since that would require me to know the blowers efficiency and the leakage of the skirt
  a dry road has a friction coefficient of about 07 lets say anon  his bike have a mass of 75 kg thats 735 n of weight 515 n of resistance from the road that he has to overcome to keep a constant speed of 40 km/h  if he rides 40 000 metres taking an hour to do so he will have needed a total of 20 060 kj over 3 600 seconds or 5 722 j/s also known as watts is anon capable of outputting 57 kw i dont think so  for the result to be 250 w the friction coefficient would need to be 22 times lower so 003 and we havent factored in wind resistance which increases with speed
  also this is assuming a perfect power transmission with no losses whatsoever
  i honestly dont know that much about physics but there is something seriously wrong with your calculations a good pair of tyres will give you around 30 w of rolling resistance riding on the flat the vast majority of your power goes towards air resistance especially at those higher speeds
  at 750 kg the mass of a small car the twingo iii weighs about 860 kg it would mean a power of 572 kw the twingo iii with its engine develops between 51 kw and 77 kw i might be off by a factor of 2 or 3 but were in the correct order of magnitude
  no were fucking not lol  go watch a bike race some time they routinely cruise over 40 km/h in the peloton those guys in the middle are doing probably less than 200 w sheltered from the wind if your calculations were remotely true then riding a bike at all would be a herculean task    consider that a car doesnt actually use all its power unless you really put the pedal down while accelerating hard or climbing a hill    btw modern derailleur bike transmissions are probably 95 efficient as a ballpark
  do the calculations yourself
  ok grampa
  doesnt 02 hp  150 watts or am i missing something or is your definition of well trained not the same as mine
lets talk groceries and transporting other medium sized items dedicated cargo bike strapping lots of bags to your bike or getting a detachable trailer
  baskets on racks
  baskets on racks  baskets on racks  baskets on racks    a couple pybt threads ago there was a guy that had foldable wald baskets attached as lowrider panniers patrician af
  rolling resistance is defined as fc_rrn where c_rr is the rolling resistance coefficient and n is the normal force  a typical bicycle tire has a c_rr of around 0003    so the rolling resistance for a a 75 kg rider a 10 kg bike would be 00038336 n 25 n    for the aerodynamic drag we know that f1/2ρv2c_da where ρ is air denisity v is velocity c_d is coefficient of drag and a is frontal area  a fairly standard c_da is 03    so at 40 km/h this would be 1/21225 kg/m31111 m/s203 m2227 n    if we add these two and multiply by velocity for the power needed we get 25 n227 n1111 m/s  280 w which is without considering drivetrain loss and other smaller factors this is pretty close to the real life data i have from using a power meter
  trailer only if you shop at costco or wanna get the 48 pack of toilet paper  i have the axiom oceanweave 55s and have more than enough room for groceries wish the backing were a bit stiffer though
what is a good gear ratio for tackling hills on a single speed
  not fucking with a single speed and getting a cheap 7speed freewheel
  depends on your hills i do deliveroo on my 44/16 steel steed and it does me ok for 400m 7 climbs though i am puffing at the top
i posted this in /bbg/ but this thread seems more active id like to hear more people voice their opinion on this    im a complete newbie and i need some help  i posted in i think the last thread about finding a nice looking bike in a tiny store run by a nice old man for surprisingly cheap compared to similar looking bike front suspensions disc breaks 20 something gears 275 wheels stuff like that  i asked what i should look for in a bike and what i should check before buying a bike for a price that seems too good to be true  i didnt get a chance to stop by that store again until today it was closed but i managed to look through the window and catch a glimpse of the bike he recommended me on the frame it said active on the bottom tube and limited on the top tube or the other way around  i tried looking it up online and i couldnt find anything from that brand only bikes from cube like in pic related  it looks similar to my untrained eye except green and black but i doubt its the same company    are fake bikes a thing i should be worried about what about nonbrands so to speak  does anyone recognize that brand active limited  im fairly certain he said the gears are from shimano i think i remember that right which are considered a reliable brand right    im no cyclist by any means i just want a bike for commuting but i also want to be limited by myself and not by the bike if that makes sense so i dont mind cheaper but i do mind cheapest
  theres tons of cheap chinese/asian bikes and bike components out there that are just plain garbage and should be avoided the reason why is poor manufacturing techniques producing lowquality parts that perform poorly and/or are not durable a bike that starts having problems and is falling apart after a couple months of riding it is not a good deal at any price also there are counterfeit goods out there that are also low quality and in some cases dangerous ie a frameset that is a counterfeit of a name brand can literally fail while riding and land you in the emergency room or the morgue /n/ will talk sometimes about bsos bike shaped objects usually found in places like walmart bikes of no known brand with components of no known brand these are cheap lowquality machines like i described above    overall youre better off with a known qualitybrand bike built with known qualitybranded components    get on craigslist and find a used quality bike instead of a new shitty bike
  i really want to believe it wasnt a knockoff because the old man running the store was great but how would i be able to tell from looking at the bike personally or by asking him certain questions    its not quite alibaba or walmart cheap costing roughly 360 bux so while it probably costs more than it would in the us of a due to imports and my country israel being generally pretty expensive its also not quite a third world shithole and he operates not far from other shops that sell at more predictable prices for the type of bike around 520 ish  as i said googling the brand name brings up nothing and i tried looking in aliexpress for that bike and couldnt find something with that particular design  i should try and take a picture next time im there    pic semi related its obviously not the bike im talking about but its similar in shape
  the thing is the fact that the old guy and the nearby shops sell the same type of bike a hardtail mtb in this case doesnt mean theyre all the same quality theres good hardtails and shit hardtails generally speaking when a frame has such buzzwords stickered all over its a shitty bike also theres a wide variety of shimano components ranging from pro race tier to barely good enough tier so thats not a quality guarantee either
      speaking of this i just built a bike for this purpose got it up and running yesterday and need a front basket/rack any recommendations
is it okay to buy a tour bike from bicyclesdirect whats the most i should be spending on that site
  depends on your bike what rack you can use i have a wald 137 i think basket that came without all the mounting junk i zip tied it on and its been solid for 2 years so far
is there really that much of a difference between rim and disc breaks
  depends if youre riding a road bike which means you dont brake much anyways in a dry conditions then no if youre riding in wet conditions then yes if youre mountain biking discs can help because they can put more force out at the wheel with less hand effort which is important when youre going to be doing lots of braking for hours on end
  what about if im just a casual commuter  do disc breaks have an advantage in wet conditions
  bd bikes are fine as long as you know enough to adjust everything on your own and true the wheels before riding them or are willing to pay a shop to do all this for you
  what does bd stand for im only interested in tour bikes and would like to know if its a reliable site     of course i will be inspecting it thoroughly before i take it on a ride

recommend me a headlight for electric scooter or bike same thing  i was driving in the night for the first time it was dark so i used stock headlight oncoming traffic was flashing me not cool considering that it didnt even illuminate needful area
whats your chain cleaning lubricating regime  some chain manufacturer recommends against solvent bath presumably because the factory lube in inaccessible parts cannot easily be replaced by the consumer  some advise against cleaning the chain they feel that lubricating does enough to push out dirt from the important parts  thoughts
  i use a park tools chain cleaner with a mix of water/simple green fill it half way and spin the chain for awhile to get all the shit off after that ill clean the chain ring and cassette with a brush before wiping it all dry and relubing the chain if youre just riding roads or commuting i dont imagine youll have to do this too often if youre riding trails i would do it after 2030 hours of riding unless its wet conditions then after every ride
  i just lightly oil it when it starts making noise spin the cranks a few times wait 20 mins then run the chain through a rag a few times    if its really dirty ill wet a rag with kerosene and run it through that a few times then let it dry then oil     also clean the jockey wheels and if they arent sealed bearing then service them with grease and a lil cup of kerosene and a rag not often though
  busch  muller iqx e    usually just squirt some loob onto the chain spin it through the gears and wipe maybe smelly green degreaser if its seriously dirty at which point i also take care of the derailer i dont ride through mud so i have no idea what cyclocrossers and mountain chads do
  yes my bike is pretty patrician thanks
  but you dont know how to take a picture of it   regurgitates velominati jokes seriously in an attempt to sound educated
  kek
  busch  muller iqx e  i like the beam and i like the fact that it works at 660v  thanks im buying it
new to bicycles in general and tires specifically  i was looking for a commuting bike and i found one with 700c wheels  while i understand that having a lower profile wheel would be better for the city i cant help but wonder what im giving up on if i get that instead of more mountain bikey wheels  would they be acceptable on paved surfaces similar to a sidewalk what about wet surfaces after rain or dirt roads that are not too harsh like in a farm  i really am clueless
  yes
hello for my secret santa exchange i have someone who asked for bicycle stuff i was thinking of getting some princess helmet or something but id like to get something actually useful if possible and would appreciate some tips i already bought him some other stuff so id prefer to spend around 5060
  that seems like a lot to spend on a secret santa
  well id be happy with anything cheaper thats the max i want to spend i just figure this stuff is expensive also this is basically the only gift i buy for anyone all year
  if he rides mtb      otherwise a dragon dildo
anyone know of a pump with a really good pressure gauge my gauge and my pump are shit i wanna kill two birds with one stone
  yes as in theyll be okay in the conditions youve mentioned
  get cheap pump  get nice gauge   sets exact pressure super easily
  knobby mtb tires suck on the road wet or dry the knobs are meant to bite into dirt when they cant bite they bend and that makes handling go straight to shit get slicks    the performance of road tires depends on width and construction the wider you go the more cushy the tire will be 700x32c to 40c is a really good range for allround usage under 30c is the racier end of the spectrum you can still use those offroad ive bombed down singletrack on a bike with veloflex record 25s but it can get a little sphincter clenching     panaracer gravelkings are really good for road wet or dry and light dirt they arent going to be as fast as a good dedicated racing tire there id go for veloflex anything or conti gp4k sii especially now that the latter are on deep discount due to the gp5k coming along but theyre going to be more cushy the only problem is that they only go up to 28c above that there are the gravelking sks but they are dedicated dirt tires and the sideknobs make cornering on pavement suck     for slicks at 32c and above i like challenge strada bianca panaracer pasela pts and schwalbe marathon supremes the mara supremes have better puncture resistance at the cost of a harsher ride and less handling feel the pts give up some puncture resistance particularly on the sidewalls for better ride and handling the strada biancas go even further in that direction     one tire to avoid if youre concerned about wet traction is continental gatorskins theyre okish punctureresistant racy tires for dry riding if you dont mind the compromised ride feel but in my experience theyre dangerously bad in the wet
  a nice bidon with a cool graphic or bikeshop on it is a nice gift too because its good to replace them semi regularly
  i think my answer was better     yep
    these are really nice if you want something expensive
  tires and wear items 5060 can get a decent set of tires    tiretism  solid choices though panaracers seem hot this year especially gravelkings but if i didnt just go replace my corsas again id go gravelking nonsk just to try them
  the fuck does that have to do with bikes
  its touring gear
  if someone got me this kamen rider bicycle bell id be over the moon
can i seemlessly wrap a handlebar with 4 rolls of tape  i got some scott wrap around bars that are longer than most normal ones and want to wrap it in the same style of tape i have 4 rolls and 1 is slightly too short to completely cover one side of the bars
      schwalbe supremes the mara supremes have better puncture resistance at the cost of a harsher ride and less handling feel    everyone seems to forget that the supremes are a more punctureresistant worsehandling version of regular schwalbe marathons greenguard they come in 32 width usually people get supremes if there are goatheads thorny seeds where they live or the like    just get the regular ones otherwise
  brringbrring bells have a clapper that rattles slightly whenever the bike is in motion which is maddeningly irritating
  same guy as this post  i visited the store again and asked him some questions about it i didnt find out anything new about the bike  i got to hold it so i know the frame is aluminum and i was reaffirmed in my belief that he is a nice old man he put up with my questions like a champ and was generally much more eager to help than the other stores ive visited  i asked him what the brand was and he said active according to him its an american company that produces its bikes in china naturally i couldnt find anything about it  i brought up to him the fact i couldnt find any mention of it online and he said that getting an online presence is expensive so small companies dont do it i kind of dont buy it but i think its plausible he genuinely believes it hes an old man who has no internet presence himself and all records of him online are from 3rd parties  speaking of those third party sites some people commented he was great some people commented he was alright but expensive which is peculiar because the bikes are cheap and the helmets and kryptonite locks were priced the same as in other stores around and several accounts said he was unhelpful and had no reason to be there practically verbatim they all had exactly this one review in each account so i suspect it was someone being salty who made several accounts  i finished my visit with him saying i guarantee you will enjoy this bike which is an empty statement from anyone else but since then ive developed something similar to a crush for him not in the actual romantic sense but in the he seems so nice i dont want to believe hes lying so i really want to believe him
  my question is this is there any hope for a bike to be decent if its not listed anywhere at all online neither locally in english or even in aliexpress or should it be an immediate deal breaker for anyone with a brain  i dont need the best i want a bike for 1 hour commutes at most i just need it to not disintegrate while im riding it and for it to be acceptably comfortable    sorry for writing a wall of text have a blessed image in return for your patience with me
two years ago i got myself a road bike thinking id start using it in my city to get to and from work and what have you but after just a few months i got fucking fed up ive not rode it in a year now and feel guilty as shit and id like to start cycling again just not on the road   how fucking retarded would it be to use it not exactly offroad but on quite rough cycle paths
  youll be alright how wide are your tires i offroad my road bike with 28s all the time nothing super serious but some light gravel and woods paths are extra comfy    but after just a few months i got fucking fed up  this is really the problem with young padawans riding everywhere all the time they go in too deep burn out then never ride again take it slow ride for recreation at first to build up strength/stamina find new routes explore the weekends and most importantly enjoy the ride
weekend warrior here not real knowledgeable about cycling     i bought a really thin saddle after riding a very cushioned one for years it hurts my bum    did i fall for a meme or is a thin saddle going to be worth it
  your shorts are bunching up road saddles should be used with lycra
  if its bruised your sitbones then you just need to harden the fuck up and break in your ass
  if it hurts like a bruise stick with it and after a week so you get used to it and it wont hurt    if it is chafing and causing blisters or open wounds your clothing could be an issue and the saddle prob doesnt fit    if your junk is hurting or tingling or going numb the saddle is not fitting or not adjusted right    generally a thinner saddle will be way more comfortable in the long run compared to a fat cushioned one though i once had a thin speciallized saddle that always just felt like was sitting on a 2x4
  wear lycra bib shorts w/o panties and use buttr or dz nutz or assos or butt shield or sprotique or whatever to protect your gay nuts against chaving
  youre talking about pluses m8  supremes are like half the weight
  people ride bikes with no name frames all the time generally what matters is that you have shimano gearing and at least a 2x8 shimano setup
  also looking online activ bikes are a brand of bike sold at sporting goods stores made by raleigh so a low tier mtb    what is the price
  oh could i please get a link to that  equivalent to 3345 dollars as of today
  dude just google activ raleigh and look at the images  if its one of those its trash  why cant you just snap a goddamn picture
  unfortunately its not that the one i saw said active with an e  why cant you just snap a goddamn picture  i genuinely didnt think of it then
  assuming youre wearing bike shorts ill bet the saddle is too narrow get measured up properly at a place like specialized and get a saddle 20mm wider than the width of your bones  you cant ignore your 3 contact points on the bike if you want to be comfortable and fast start with the saddle and possibly gloves and clipless pedals and shoes if you start to get more serious
  its the time of the year to buy bikes online dont take a flyer on a bike you cant even id    check out dimondback if you really want a mtb for cheap that is decent
  seconding this diamondback in particular too since they have an easy to access corporate discount last i checked few months ago to save you some cash
  the ones on my bike just say marathon  no plus no supreme
im sure im not the first non/n/ to ask this here but im thinking about getting a bicycle less about sports and more about just mobility in the city  folding bikes are tempting to me and the pros are obvious can bring the inside almost anywhere and can bring them into buses and trains but what are the drawbacks  say i wanted to ride one for a solid 40 minutes would the difference between that and a regular bike be very noticable  what am i giving up by choosing a folding bike with say 20 inch wheels as opposed to a cheap decent mountain bike
  my take on folding bike is that they are going to be a pain and worse than another bike in nearly every way except for when youre not riding it i prioritize my experience of riding when getting a bike if the hassle of storing / stashing your bike is one of the most important parts of having a commuter then go for a folding bike but otherwise i would go with the 90s rigid meme
  obviously its going to be worse than a regular bike im no bike man but its obvious smaller wheels mean im less stable and can handle less bumps along the way also no form of suspensions and fewer gears than is acceptable now  however the question is not if its worse but if it is on its own manageable and up to what limit  im not a sportsman or even do sports man i just want to improve my mobility despite having a license because i dont really need a car and bringing it with me on a bus train or classroom/work/home is a big plus  with a full sized bike i can only use very specific buses that have luggage compartments or whatever the right name for them in english is
  smaller wheels mean im less stable and can handle less bumps along the way also no form of suspensions and fewer gears than is acceptable now  doesnt sound like these are things you need to concern yourself with at all i dont really have any experience with folding bikes so i cant offer any legit advice but it sounds like you want a folding bike so i suggest you get a folding bike and evaluate how well it suits you yourself    alternatively get a proper bike and skip the bus altogether it depends very much in where and how you live whether thats viable
  my boss was telling me about zwift and how its really good but a large investment to start  what do you need
  zwift  your boss is a moron
  all you really need is a power meter dumb trainer and a way to pick up bluetooth or ant depending on your pm and zwift device i do it this way and its okay but a smart trainer is really the best way to do it those apparently change the resistance to match the simulated terrain and you dont need a pm on your bike
complete newbie here    what should i look for when buying a mountain bike on a budget 
  a second job because spending less than 1k will turn you off of the hobby
  zwift  htfu and go outside    you can have plenty of fun with a rockhopper or something
so i had this 26 hardtail for about 15 years nothing too fancy but ive used and abused it in mountain trails daily commuting touring and bikepacking trips and even some moderate dirt jumps   i love it but id like to move to a better mtb ride so im buying myself something nice this summer    i was thinking on selling this old one but nowadays no one is paying too much for an abused 26er so maybe it can be converted to something like a gravel/beater ride that i can use everyday or in trips flatter trails etc    i was thinking on changing the fork to a rigid one the actual suspension one is busted so i have to change it anyway the flatbar for some drops fucked geometry i guess or maybe a jones type loop bar and the wheels for some more spiked rims and thiner tyres    is it feasable or too stupid
  i have a bike kind of like that and its fun to use for fucking around on basic singletrack and underbiking on technical stuff its an old novara buzz that i slapped a bunch of zee  xt shit onto it is way too small for me but that makes it more interesting its very nimble sucks fuck uphill
  yes something like that     im a complete casual in technical terms i mean i ride a lot but i dont even know the relations on my speeds kill me if you want but i just recently knew that the relations for route and mtb were different and important     so i dont know what could i change more that the bars wheels and fork and if those changes are really relevant
  id keep the flat bars replace the fork with an suspension offset fork     i would put the widest set of tires you can on it with the white wheels id look for a set that has whitewalls    i still use my old starter mtb as well you have to resist the urge to sink too much money into it
  but a smart trainer is really the best way to do it    except they are literally 800 dollars
  i said best not cheapest
  also consider a true city comfort/hybrid bike that has wide gearing something like the raleigh detour 2 or the trek fx are both beloved bikes that are fuckin chill to ride around     raleigh 400 trek 500
  i know but at that price i could literally buy a salsa fargo from my lbs and have a claris gravel grinder to go with my roadie
  i dont understand how that is relevant at all
  suspension offset fork  as i said im a dork when it comes to technicalities and english is not my language so could you clarify this please you mean a rigid     with the white wheels id look for a set that has whitewalls  the problem with this is that rims and spokes are really busted and im thinking on making long trips with this bike so ill change the whole wheels i want some rims with more spokes just in case some brake and im far from a bikeshop    i would put the widest set of tires you can on it  yes im thinking in a not so knobby type of tyres not for mountain trail but for gravel
  with a mtb or gravel bike you can ride most of the winter
  i still dont understand what relevance that has to zwift i get it you would never spend money on a smart trainer there are people who will and there are people who do anon asked about zwift not how many bikes you can buy for 800
is bying a modern alu cx bike for commuting and general leisure riding ie not cyclocross racing a bad idea
  you can buy about three quarters of a bike for 800
planning on going tubeless    how long does the sealant last how does it last during winter storage   do you have to clean out the tyre at some point    going to use stans
  cx/gravel    so long as its got mounts for for rack and fender then yes its excellent      sealant longevity depends on a few things different types last longer than others and i think heat dries it out faster    iirc stans is one of the longer lasting ones probably a few months between topoffs ive never personally bothered cleaning out the tyre except when changing tyres
  htfu and go outside  whilst i appreciate the concept and i do try to its 20c outside and it takes half an hour to prep  also there are zero hills in my city inner mongolia is a flat land
  so long as its got mounts for for rack and fender then yes  thats the thing with modern cx bikes they dont
  hence /gravel or all road adventure randonneur etc    theres lots of bikes that fill a fairly similar niche these days that often have more practical features
  yeah but i kind of fell for this one cyclocross bike i like the colour and the way it looks
  well if you like the bike and it makes you want to ride it thats important too    you dont need need those things you can always wear a backpack and use clipon fenders or just get wet and plenty of people seem to get by without them but i personally consider them a requisite for commuting
  im more worried about the frame material and the geometry
  i dont see why you want a racey bike but then wide tires as well
  not him but a road bike with fatter knobby tires is super fun if you live in a place where there are lots of different kinds of riding available nearby and want to enjoy the ride to the technical trails just as much as the time you spend on the trails or just for riding fast on gravel
  yes but i wouldnt assume that commuting and general leisure riding means that
    wide tyres are great for just general comfort smooth out the bumps especially if you carry a load and give a bit of innate puncture resistance too
clogs your valves  whats a good tube auto sealant
are gear shifters universal can i put a nice shifter on a piece of shit dunlop  the trigger shifters look nice is there a goto chink shit one
  its like youre not even having the same conversation just regurgitating stuff youve read online
  i take that to mean that its a bad idea
  are gear shifters universal  indexed shifters are nowhere near universal some shifters are compatible with some dérailleurs and cassettes and some arent    youll want to look up uncle sheldon about the combination you want to use and see if it works if youre replacing a shifter with one with the same number of clicks then it might work but it could easily not work too its to do with the gap between the clicks also needing to be the same
tire question for you mtb bros i recently got myself a fairly entry level mtb giant fathom 2 and it came specced with maxxis ikon 22s i dont feel like theyre cutting for me when the trails are wet which is often where i live so i find myself slipping around on them more then i like i know a lot of people say you shouldnt dump too much money on an entry level bike but would it be a noticeable difference in grip going from the ikons more xc oriented to more downhill oriented tires in the 25 range
  anon asked about zwift  indeed    i work from home in inner mongolia and winter is harsh here i just end up avoiding going outside all winter also a complete flatland and chaotic traffic and sheets of ice and piles of snow on the bike lanes in winter the street sweepers just scrape it off the car lanes and leave it piled in the bike lane until a truck comes to collect it all contribute to my losing fitness over winter  my boss in australia is a triguy and was telling me about how his peers all use zwift for training even though he actually has bike paths and lanes and big hills that he can ride hard in it seems worth looking into  i dont have a powermeter i suppose i could get one but a smart trainer seems a better option 800 isnt out of my reach at all provided its actually as good as claimed my bike computer isnt ant/bt either so that will need replacing but im sure i can do that cheaply in china if i go for a decent chinese brand its probably going to be a bit cheaper if i need anything foreign then it will be even more expensive
recently bent my front wheel in a crash and i want to try truing it myself ive got a spoke wrench is there a good way to do this without buying a truing stand and what are good tutorials for truing in general
  if youre going to spend entire months on zwift a smart trainer would probably be the best route im not 100 sure your bike computer needs to be ant or bt compatible just whatever computer you have the zwift software installed on needs to be able to pick up a signal from the trainer most laptops are good to go with bluetooth if you need ant you can get a usb dongle for pretty cheap
  you can kind of do it without a truing stand some things might not be as accurate you definitely need to understand how a truing stand is used first if youve never used one hit up youtube and watch people using them first    put some zip ties on the forks and angle them around towards the rim and trim them so that theyre slightly larger than required then angle them forward or back as required to nearly touch the rim  you can use rim brakes to do the same thing in a pinch you can also leave the zip ties there just point them back along the bike frame in case you find yourself wanting to adjust it on the road  then spin the wheel youre watching for the space between the zip tie and the rim as it moves in and out  you also need to watch the vertical radial truing too see how the top of the wheel moves in and out as it turns you can end up moving the centre of the wheel out of truecentre if youre not careful this is also visible at the rims but not as obvious  then you need to watch that you dont move the whole wheel too much left or right dishing thats harder to detect using the zip ties but its also slightly less common to get wrong you can probably just use a ruler and measure both sides to make sure theyre about the same this doesnt have to be perfect but ill let someone else tell you about tolerances here because i dont really know this last part well check sheldon too of course
  if youre going to spend entire months on zwift a smart trainer would probably be the best route  yeah i can see that im just a bit disappointed that ill have to be removing the back wheel all the time and maybe need to buy a cassette just for the trainer  my current bike computer is the cheapest possible thing so upgrading that is no problem smart trainers seem about the same price here in china though there are some cheap ones that may or may not be good enough  it seems like the chinese ones are all onelap/zwift compatible      when i was looking for trainers i saw a tonne of ant usb dongles that should be no problem
  i would disagree and advise you to spend a little less 500 on a power meter and just use a non smart trainer the smart trainer will only be able to be used for training indoors while the power meter will be good for zwift as well as any training/riding you do outside the rest of the year the automatically adjustable resistance is kind of a gimmick and is not even used at all if you are using zwifts workouts
i bought a wheelset a really long time ago and never actually got to use them id like to use this wheelset but it comes with quick release and i need a solid axle i tried using a solid axle from another wheel and tried to use the cones that came with the wheelset they felt a little loose so i stopped doing it is it possible to convert from quick release to solid axle i can do the job myself i just need to know id be able to find the parts at all
  by cones do you mean the endcaps were they loose in the wheel or around the axle keep in mind theres like 3 different ta diameters they might not be the same    but yes you can do that
  previous anon said most of what id contribute except to second the recommendation of the sheldon brown page on wheel truing    also worth keeping in mind that if the crash damage bent the rim itself or if the wheel had previous tension issues exacerbated by the crash you may be limited in how much repair you can achieve through truing so dont be too hard on yourself if you find your first experience to be a real struggle
  if the crash damage bent the rim itself or if the wheel had previous tension issues exacerbated by the crash you may be limited in how much repair you can achieve through truing  oh yeah when done as a repair truing has limits sometimes you just need a new rim  you can do a fair bit with truing though so its definitely worth trying
  by cones i mean pic related
  whoops
  i work from home in inner mongolia and winter is harsh here    damn man youve got to promise to post in daily ride thread when it finally thaws /n/ needs to see mongolian roadie culture and roadside attractions
  inner mongolia is actually a part of china its an autonomous region which is just a province but with legal guarantees for the ethnic minority    ive posted a few pics before the mountains are really nice the roads in town are chaotic and when ive tried to ride hard on the highway i got a broken collarbone for my efforts nobody drives that fast because you cant really take anything for granted i dont get so many of the near misses that i used to get every day in the west though    i have ridden in mongolia too though pic related is from a trip up there with a folding bike
  did they feel loose in the bearings or loose on the axle itself be specific if you want a useful diagnosis there are a few different threads for hub axles you may not have bought the correct one
  yes buy the whole axle/cone/cup/bearings set though also i recommend loose bearings over caged
  the cone felt loose in the axle as oppossed to its original quick release axle    thanks ill go to my lbs tomorrow and see if they have the parts i need
  this may be a dumb question but why didnt you just tighten it cupandcone hubs are often pretty finicky to perfectly dial in
  anon probably doesnt have cone spanners or know that this is a thing
      thanks a lot ill read up and try it with zip ties on the weekend
  is this some kind of old technology
hi im looking to buy a bike but i dont know what type im pretty rough with riding hoping onto street curbs travelling down stony roads  the wheel usually takes a beating i dont feel too comfortable raised high off the ground i prefer to be closer to the ground to quell anxiety if i need to stop with my two feet on the ground i feel more in control i want a feeling of security in the construction i dont want it to feel thin flimsy or that it might fail as im bulleting down a hill but having said that i dont want it too bulky as i will be cycling long distances    suggestions budget less than 400
  youre at the whim of whats available on your local craigslist at that price if any of your criteria are real   400 does not get you a new bike with strong wheels or anything     post it  your height and ill make some recs if you want
  i dont have a bike currently 511
  anon probably isnt weighing off the bike properly to prevent fucking their wheels up so theyre assuming their shit wheels are the reason for their inadequate handling skills
  yes i understand that if you want a durable bike then youll have to buy a used one off craigslist its a good idea anyway     400 wont get you a durable new bike it will get you something extremely cheaply made if you insist on buying new and the only advice id give is to avoid anything with any suspension
  well yeah probably but it is also pretty easy to damage shitty wheels
  whats the minimum budget then for a modest version of my request
  more like 600     i dont see why youre adverse to buying something used would you buy a new car
  90s rigid mtb
  yeah basically this
  im not adverse to buying used i never said that ill probably opt for buying second hand due to my restricted budget but i just want a template to follow i wish there was a website that allowed you to find the bike best suited to your preferences by selecting criteria or something for me  as someone who isnt knowledgeable about the scope of bikes to choose from it is hard to know where to begin or if its possible to make an intelligent choice because theres just so many youll never make sense of it    my previous bike was the carerra subway 2 bought it twice for 450 around 2010 and it was stolen on both occasions thick wheels you could jump off and on fairly quick black colour suits my tastes but i think i can do better than aim for this again especially seeing that this was just arbitrarily chosen from a limited selection in a local outdoors store
  might it have a worn transmission which swapping will cost twice the price of the bike or are there 90s bikes in good conditions
  it might but 67 speed freewheels and chains are dirt cheap so it wouldnt really matter youd have to replace them eventually anyway
do you get catcalled when driving  i had a teenage girl with her friends yell something at me from a distance something like i like your style i also had college girls in a car yell something like race race race as i drove past and a passenger yell something at me when a sports car went past me
  not really catcalls but when im out for a long ride in full attire i often get encouraging though still annoying beeps and sometimes people will yell racerelated stuff like go youre winning or stuff like that  i also got called a fag by some poor fat people the other day
i have a 93 stumpjumper and i have no other way of explaining this but i noticed that as i ride that the throw of the shifter original would get longer usually i just have to push my thumb a bit on the little lever to feel some resistance and initiate a shift for the rd but a lot of the times now i feel it go past that point of resistance and i wouldnt be able to shift to go to a larger cog what gives
im thinking about buying a used 60 cm caad 12 from my boss but im about 51161 so im wondering if itll fit me of if itll be to big
  im 63 and ride a 58 caad12 and i think i could have gone with a 56 if i really wanted to these frames have a fair amount of stack
  so how badly might it fit me because its a really good deal but id be really annoyed if it didnt fit
  i dont know without knowing your saddle height and what stack and reach you usually ride its impossible to say  is mine i have a fairly long torso and saddle height is a hair over 80 cm
  you could make it work by taking out all the spacers and getting a shorter stem and setting the seat height as needed normally youd ride a 58 or 56     you are gonna have to go and take it for a spin to find out if it is doable
  youll be fine unless you have freakishly long reach you may need to slam the stem or go for a longer one if you cant otherwise get enough drop
  you should measure yourself more accurately  im 511 and ride 5556  if you were 61 youd want a 58 maybe  60 is definitely going to be too large i know how you feel but its not meant to be anon
what does /n/ think of automation  a leap forward into a bright future or step further towards a mechanised dystopia
  automated trains  automated cars
i dont mind ato with a driver on metro systems but full automatic operation terrifies me my local metro wants to be fully staffless by 2024 and its fucking horrifying staffless in this case means 2 controllers and 2 mobile managers who can go to a breakdown zero incident management zero onsite personnel
  when will you cucks realize the endgame is always to reduce labor costs to zero stop praising halfmeasures towards that goal start resisting any attempts to introduce laborsaving technologies that enslave modern man further to soulless corporations and big tech
  automation is ok in small insignificant stuff like mickey ds but a hard to get into career like aviation fuck no
  i mostly agree with  but i must also add that i would like to see hsr also adopt ato on high speed lines the separation between trains really only means that a train can keep to its highest speed for as long as possible  train automation will be a real help in making trains more punctual and also making trains a lot safer as all the person in the drivers seat is doing is watching that the train is doing exactly what it should  removing all staff no thats dumb but making at least someone watch over even if its only one person constantly supervising the train thats fine
unavoidable for the future

  dude planes have been flying themselves for decades hell the 777 is capable of doing take offs on autopilot
  how about driverless train operation dto with a nondriver attendant on board its between ato semiautomatic train operation sto by uitps goa classification and unattended train operation uto     uto on light metro and people movers  basically synonymous with apm already is inevitable high enough ridership on conventional heavy metro may keep dto in the largest and most railcritical cities others should go uto with the density of stations and thus support   hsr and mainline rail will keep the driver in atosto   the chuo shinkansen maglev have to use ato
please automate my commuter rail each train has like 4 staff and they cannot even open the fucking doors in a timely manner
   hsr and mainline rail will keep the driver in atosto thats concerning driver only suburban and metropolitan regional service should be oneman operation long distance regional and intercity service will keep some of the usual conductor and attendants in the staff roaster       specify
  based
i wonder how much more a 5 man yard crew could switch than a 3 man remotes cant do as much as even a 3 man job
  how about driverless train operation dto with a nondriver attendant on board  the london dlr is like this it is driverless operation but there is a customer service person on board at all times who operates the doors and basically gives the go ahead to the driverless system they can also during a failure open up a panel and drive the train themselves  only other system ive seen is barcelona metro line 9/10 and either the line 1 or the line 14 of the paris métro  barcelonas metro has a driverless system however the trains are still capable of manual control if you have the key to open one panel that said it is totally unmanned with platform screen doors protecting the train only staff i ever saw were security guards who were hopping on and off trains on a patrol  paris metro just had people in high visibility jackets on the platform just making sure that passengers werent going to get stuck in the platform screen doors but as far as i could tell it was fully driverless as well it just had people making sure other people werent being dumb
  either the line 1 or the line 14 of the paris métro  i havent seen anyone staying on board with an ratp uniform on either line and i go to paris at least twice a year
  this
  it cant you need to set dozens of thing in computah otherwise it wont take off
  frequently   arrive in station   doors open 30s to 1 min later    or   standing on platform in rain or snow   train arrives   doors open after 30s to 1 min
  just look in the news and youll find your answer automation is as flawed as the humans creating it thats why we need to have humans in the cab of engines pilots in the cockpit of aircraft and drivers at the controls of cars and trucks
  thats a retarded attitude what do you think trains are in the first place if not a laboursaving device
  wouldnt it be better to electrify the railroad first
  shall we also ban all tools not made from flintstone genius
  no
  except everywhere you look in european and asian rapid transit driverless trains are becoming the norm  im guessing that this will be another thing the us never gets right along with hsr
  pretty sure almost all the recent rail crashes were due in part to human error and would not have even happened if there were more computers involved
    heads up on the tripfag
  thanks
be a hardcore nlord  dont even have a car  hate cagers with a passion  borrow my dads car yesterday  rush to make a right on red before cars come  a jogger enters the crosswalk on my right while i look left  almost run him over    i realized cagers arent bad people and that it is impossible to have 100 awareness people arent computers
  are you trying to justify your irresponsibility to us op is once again a faggot
  faggot
  thats more than a simple lack of awareness  kys
be a hardcore nlord  in your mind maybe not in your actions  dont even have a car  borrow my dads car  still reliant on the cage then  story of negligence on the road concluding with empathy for poor driving practices  you are part of the problem slow your roll if you cant be properly aware of your surroundings you shouldnt be forgiven for it  you shouldnt be on the road
  cager
  your story only confirms that cagers are reckless clueless retards
    are you a spider with eyes that face 360 degrees
  why would you need to be aware of your backseat when entering an intersection fucken tard
  you need a full driving course
so what you are saying is that people mostly dont provoke accidents like they are accidental and without intention that people have flaws arent perfect no one is actually out to kill you because you arent inside a car    huh
  i think op said he was trying to rush a right hand turn thats not an accident thats reckless driving
    most cagers have had hardly had any driving education at all
  well that told you why your country have a high number of traffic accident
   to make a right on red  cagers arent bad people  hmmmmmm
    right on red wasnt even legal until the 80s its more ground lost to the cagers
humans arent perfect but you didnt almost run that guy over because youre only human you almost ran him over because you were careless  even if everyone is supposed to let you pass first even if the lights green for you and red for other road users and pedestrians slow the fuck down look around and make sure other road users and pedestrians are doing what theyre supposed to  even when they are doing what theyre supposed to do prepare yourself for the possibility that their behavior might change suddenly thats why you keep a gap between yourself and other cars thats why you slow down before crosswalks and thats why you slow down in situations like pic related because someone might pop up from behind one of the cars to cross even if theyre not supposed to  you dont want to injure or kill another person even if they were entirely in the wrong
  i cant control my car therefore cars are good
  right on red has always been legal except where signs specifically prohibited it or towns had rules against it in minnesota it was literally in the handbooks that accompanied our first automatic traffic signals where do you live
hardcore /n/ lord  has a drivers license    yeah alright desu
  realize youre a bad driver  well i guess cagers arent that bad  there are a few decent cagers you are definitely not one of them
  it was made law during the gas crisis ya dummy
  thats why we cant get anywhere with these people way too many people really dont care if they hurt someome if that someone was in the wrong
    kys faggot
  i am commander shepard and this is the best post on the citadel
am i an nlord if i drive my cage to my job which is to drive a subway train
  based and redpilled
  kys traitor
  99 of accidents happen because cagers simply assume that everything is going to be ok and they dont feel the need to pay proper attention at all times something that can be considered an actual accident is if a clueless animal deer possum cat nigger or a bird jumps right in front of your car and its too late to stop you should be prepared for just about everything else  taking into consideration that the traffic is full of stupid monkeys such as yourself really makes driving a car a whole lot safer most people just fail on this one thing simply because most of the time people dont have accidents on traffic    the thing op was talking about is the oldest trick in the book just as stupid as failing to give way for a car coming straight when you are the one turning over their lane of course you have to check for runners and cyclists whenever you are at such a situation at lights op just failed on one of the most basic traffic safety things and is therefore prepared to switch his whole world view  such is the fragile ego of a cager who cant find the blame in themselves
  no you might be an nlord if you ride the subway to your job which is to drive a subway train
  am i an nlord if i drive my cage  no
  what are mirrors for
people arent computers
  this automated cars should be mandatory as soon as possible cagers are reckless scum who endanger lives because hurr godda go fasst   op you were 2 seconds separated from becoming a murderer you should feel bad you piece of shit slow your roll and look before you move your murderbox     this shit pisses me off pave 3x more road than you need to just to provide cage parking like they dont have enough parking garages and lots taking up space as it is caging was a mistake all cagers need a day of the rope and all cages should be vandalized and thrown into the sea
  thrown in the sea  no they should be recycled not ruining nature makes cagers go even madder
  actually if you strip cars off of almost everything and leave just the chassis they can be thrown into the sea and help coral reefs form
    we could make them into hipster microapartments if you take the wheels off and mount them on cinderblocks in a lot somewhere put a few communal portapotties on the property and charge 200/month rent
  this automated cars should be mandatory as soon as possible  okay i will get an airplane then i dont want to be crashed to death by botnet
  but being crushed to death by a weed smoking nigger facetiming himself driving is aokay
  weed smoking nigger at least is easy to detect and keep distance
  are you retarded crashes happen in under one second and you cant keep distance in traffic you homosexual
  im both a cyclist and an auto enthusiast as with anything absolute beginners are going to make mistakes theres no reason whatsoever that an experienced driver should make those types mistakes with any significant frequency if youve been driving regularly for more than a few months if you take the responsibility seriously and if youre not a complete idiot those types of mistakes will become very rare most drivers dont take the responsibility of driving a car as seriously as they should and their failure to do so puts peoples lives at risk there is not a good excuse for that
  crashes happen in under one second  yes at this point you already fucked up  and you cant keep distance in traffic you homosexual  traffic accidents arent dangerous since speed is like 20 km/h worst thing that can happen is damage of front bumper bar
  please explain to me why you cant keep a one car distance from the car in front of you
what makes their rail lines so relaxing yet interesting
the blind homeless guy ranting to the train car
  the combination of elevated undergound and atgrade lines all in one service make things interesting
  chicagos less popular motto is urbs in horto city in a garden because we have a lot of greenery mixed with buildings made of dark red orange and brown brick makes for a great scenery on the outskirts of the city while the loop has elevated lines and traditional architecture from like a century ago    id say though the comfiest feature is this announcement  
third rail was a mistake
  tfw i plan to move to chicago in the next 68 months  tfw i get to hear  on my daily commute
train gets dirty with the snow 
  strap in and get comfy  
  whats even the point of the yellow line
  connect skokie to the rest of the rapid transit network
  yes but people from skokie can just hop on the metra
  it was originally a twoyear project to demonstrate the viability of federally funded mass transit a new concept at the time the service was popular enough that it was kept after the demonstration ended the village of skokie wanted to maintain rail service after the north shore line quit and its also the location of the l shops so the cta wouldve needed to keep some of the route regardless
  it was for well off used to be anyways whiteys who didnt want to pay chicago taxes that clogged up the highways leading into the loop fucking the rest of chicago transit up
florida cfi endless bummer edition    welcome to the /gag/    /gag/ is dedicated to all the pilots and pilot applicants out there and although the name suggests otherwise airline military and charter discussion is welcome keep it on topic keep the shit throwing to a minimum    old 
  boi this better either be near sua or fpr cuz i know this coastline
  its nearby yeah
any military pilots in here
its interesting to see how in 30 years of this raid pilots got older and the planes got smaller and lighter    
why are hot air balloons so expensive
anbody know much about working for planesense training/how many hours you fly/contract i just applied with 1000hrs
oh no not another episode of sunday traffic patterns at the best breakfast spot around
my school has some serious safety issues and wont refund the money for the hours that i havent flown almost all of them should i sue them    europe btw
  any advice for new student pilots starting out
  yeah whats up
  right rudder
  please explain this meme  is this caused by spinning prop and this affects only singleengine ac
this thread is a lot slower than the last one    do you all hibernate at the first sign of frost
  keep trying to take a picture when im up but i keep forgetting also had 2 flights cancel today one for student not knowing his stuff and the other for lack of resources       god i wish it were a meme its cause by spiraling slipstream propwash hitting the vertical stabilizer and pushing on the rudder torque equal and opposite reaction from the engines rotation and pfactor descending blade has a higher aoa than the ascending blade at high power high aoa and low speeds causing asymmetrical thrust from the propeller new pilots and applicants just dont add rudder cause they get fixated on other stuff and half of the flight is uncoordinated they are frequently reminded to use more right rudder
any advice for someone whos dreamed of becoming a commercial pilot since age 6 but lives in a shithole in central america which has no flight schools and cant really afford one atm guess i still got time since im just about to turn 19 but i still dont know how to get there
  start with having rich parents relocating to another state would not be such a big deal    sounds like youre flying on untrimmed a/c   you may need to apply a lot of left/right rudder on descend/takeoff but the rudder should be trimmed in such a way that you dont have to apply a lot of pressure on cruise i used to fly on a lawn chair like that rudder was trimmed with a bungee cord after 3 hours of xc my right foot was getting very tired
  keep trying to take a picture when im up but i keep forgetting  why dont you take someone to take pictures for you
  military but they wont hire basedboys  i think sopademacaco has some flight schools for sure
  god i wish it were a meme its cause by spiraling slipstream propwash hitting the vertical stabilizer and pushing on the rudder torque equal and opposite reaction from the engines rotation and pfactor descending blade has a higher aoa than the ascending blade at high power high aoa and low speeds causing asymmetrical thrust from the propeller  so it is caused by single prop spinning right
tfw the florida winter is beginning  enjoy your snow faggots
  how do i learn foxtrot uniform charlie kilo india november golf phonetic alphabet
  buy a kneeboard and actually fly
  but seriously
  git gud memorize that shit and fly a lot so youll ease into it when i started out i didnt know shit for radio but eventually i got better at it the more i flew
  literacy say the nato phonetic alphabet in order a lot itll come
planefags i am visiting san diego and can someone please explain why the airport is located in the center of the city and is a massive annoyance every 8 minutes reeeeeeeeee i understand getting to the airport in 5 minutes is a blessing but why as opposed to my local airport dia i would rather drive the 45 minutes into the middle of nowhere than live with this
  spell adverts plate numbers of the passing by cars when youre driving/walking helped me a lot even better if you can do it out loud without attracting too much of unwanted attention
  lmfao like theres any other feasible location for an airport anywhere near sd just get a different hotel faget
  i applied to my countrys air force canada i got a good score on my aptitude test but im preparing for my interview at the moment if you dont mind id like to ask some questions  what aircraft do you fly   why did you decide to become a pilot in the military specifically  whats an average day entail for you  what was the most difficult part of the application process  how did you deal with the more difficult parts of your application    thanks in advance anon
  tfw the hawiian slightly cool and ranier season begins     enjoy your sub 60 temperatures faggots
  i get busy trying to fit all the shit into the allotted time while my student drags their feet on checklists and procedures       untrimmed aircraft  all three of the aforementioned factors of left turning tendencies occur at high aoa low airspeed and high power setting if the aircraft needs constant rudder pressure during level flight the groundadjustable tab on the rudder isnt set correctly or the rudder cables arent tensioned properly      it is caused by the engine and propeller yes it affects multi engine planes arguably worse because you now have twice the torque and pfactor
  student drags their feet on checklists and procedures  ffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkckk  literally everyday i remind myself multiple times that a the student needs to learn this and b every 1 they waste doing checklist i get paid to do nothing
  how do you like being a cfi
  that says a lot i have heard mixed things at least are you at least logging a decent amount of flight time
  im getting good time yeah depends on the school though im about to the place where i can apply for real jobs
  the groundadjustable tab on the rudder isnt set correctly  this is what i meant by  untrimmed aircraft  that thing on the rudder is called rudder trim tab
  it is caused by the engine and propeller yes it affects multi engine planes arguably worse because you now have twice the torque and pfactor  why engines cant spin different directions to compensate
   some do those are called handed props bc they are like your hands that way however that does add to the cost and now one engine is more critical than the other in case of failure on one side overcoming that leftturning tendency depends on the plane design size/configuration of the rudder engine distance and angle from the centerline pushpull types engines in front and rear of the fuselage cancel each other out pic is burt rutans boomerang assymetrical and weirdlooking af but it was designed to minimize all of that for easy handling even with an engine failure
  sub 60s is pretty comfy here and it never rains so theres no excuse to not fly
  having propellers on a multiengine aircraft spin in opposite directions removes the critical engine issue
  im trying to imagine what the performance and handling issues would be like on this plain if the nose engine failed
  plain  whats the point of being able to cancel posts before they go through if it doesnt fucking do anything
  this  but it increases the price at the very least youll need left and right prop cam shafts and pickup/magneto locations
what is the most amount of ice youve picked up in a nonfiki plane i got about an inch today on a single engine cessna
  i think the most ive gotten is a quarter of an inch
this thing popped up on my local craigslist    theres no way you could legally fly this in the usa right its multipleengine and fucking jet turbines at that strapped to your feet
  would probably be fine up to a certain altitude
why is there still so many md11
  not the same anon that replied before but im a pilot in training in the rcaf    1 doing phase 2 on the harvard right now     2 its a lot more exciting than commercial flying better pay and job security compared to entrylevel commercial jobs    3 average day is spent preparing for your flights briefing flying or getting cancelled due to weather which happens a lot at this time of year and debriefing     4 aircrew selection in trenton    5 study for the mental arithmetic portion of the aircrew selection tests at this website 
an aircraft ive been looking for for a while now has popped up on barnstormers but the catch is its in canada and 30 fuggin hours away by car    is importing from canada to the usa a nightmare for aircraft or is it easy can i just truck it in and call it scrap parts
  probably counts as an ultralight no license needed
  this thing is supposed to be wired to the ground/sea right at least thats what i saw from a nearby amusement park

mad skills
  can you 92 gasoline european octane number into some cessna which needs avgas100ll
  no afaik continental is a high compression engine it may start detonating on a lower octane fuel
  how about this 
  they have like 71 ratio while modern shitbox has 101 and yet shitbox can work on 91 gas
  modern shitbox  they all have injectors and the ignition timing is controlled by a computer  these engines are designed to adapt and run on lowoctane fuel even though they have higher compression ratio but if you put lower grade fuel into an old carbmagneto engine designed to run on a higher fuel grade  it will probably run ok for a while until you end up with crooked exhaust valves and spark plugs  theres also a problem with alcohol contents fuel lines and all related rubber parts may start cracking and decomposing unless they are designed with alcohol in mind    but probably the most important problem is regulations you can put any donkey piss in your experimental a/c and fly at your own risk but if you intend to do business you must adhere to the operators manual which states what type of certified aviation fuel is acceptable for this specific engine afaik none of the automotive fuel is crosscertified as an aviation fuel so chances are none of the certified engines operation manual has a reference to any type of mogas rotax on the other hand has a line of noncertified engines eg 912ul ops manual for them states which types of aviation or automotive fuels are acceptable the manual is actually the only difference  certified and noncertified versions are physically the same the only difference is what you are allowed to do with them if you put noncertified engine in your plane the whole a/c becomes noncertified and youre a chad now
   handling would actually be easier than a similar engine failure on a more standard multiengine design the dead weight of the nose engine is much closer to the good wing engine so you dont have to bank into the good engine as much and the drag is on the fuselage half the distance than a rightwing engine would be so less rudder needed to stay straight less overall drag and easier control so gives you better chance of getting it back weird but good making planes symmetrical is more of a habit than a necessity burt rutan designed other asymmetrical planes that also flew great pic relatedintake on one side gun on the other with tilted engine exhaust
  they all have injectors and the ignition timing is controlled by a computer these engines are designed to adapt and run on lowoctane fuel even though they have higher compression ratio  yes but some 90s shitboxes with carbs had engines with 101 compression and ran on 91 ron without any problems injection wont magically allow engine to run on donkey a piss    but if you intend to do business you must adhere to the operators manual  or be in thirdworld shithole  if you put noncertified engine in your plane the whole a/c becomes noncertified and youre a chad now  but can you make noncertified a/c certified by installing certified part back   i guess i know why nobody cheap on fuel engines are expensive there is no 92/95/98 gas in the airports
any cfis in here currently working on my commercial licenses wanna know how the pay is around the us i would hope to instruct part time and fly skydivers on the weekends always been something ive wanted to do just how brutal are the cfi checkrides
  yes but some 90s shitboxes with carbs had engines with 101 compression and ran on 91 ron without any problems  old carburated shitboxes with mechanical ignition used to have compression ratio of about 81 and none of them were aircooled  injection wont magically allow engine to run on donkey a piss  injectors  oxygen sensors allow nearperfect stoichiometric mixture regardless of how oxigenated the fuel is or how high is the fuel grade within reasonable limits    but i agree it is not a single thing which does the magic it is the whole lot of things   manifold turbulence   intentional limit for the peak power output   water cooling keeps cht stable   ignition timing electronic ignition allows superior timing control and this is extremely important for antiknocking   continuous mixture control go reach if egt goes too high    101 engine must be specifically designed to run on 91 ron otherwise it may detonate other thing to consider is a safety margin having detonation problem in a car is not nearly as bad as having the same thing in a plane aircraft engines must be designed to run at a high power setting wot during take off or 75 on cruise while automotive engines are designed to run at 1025 most of their life given that detonation is most likely to occur on a higher power setting it is also adding to the mix  or be in thirdworld shithole  yeah ive heard horror stories about a fuel contamination at gas pumps in russia  but can you make noncertified a/c certified by installing certified part back   i dont think so although regulations may vary depending the country  certified a/c must be always maintained by a certified mechanic if something goes south with the plane some poor bastards amt/ame license is at stake if you were allowed to tamper with the plane no one would probably agree to take the blame of releasing it to service even if it was legally possible
   can you make noncertified a/c certified by installing certified part back  although im not sure what would happen if you are amt your self and doing dodgy stuff to your own experimental a/c and what to get it back to certified state
  the oral and flight for cfi can be a bit long but it depends on both your preparation and your examiner for how rough its gonna be just remember to give the important ideas reference the acs and have a source for everything you say
  i guess i know why nobody cheap on fuel engines are expensive there is no 92/95/98 gas in the airports  ive heard an interesting story about an ultralight club trying to set up an official mogas pump at the field theyve got the figures and made arrangements with one of the major fuel supplier   supplier was initially very happy and even offered a huge discount club got the county and the aviation authority approval the pump and the tank was successfully installed at the suppliers expenses but when the time came to actually fill the tank the supplier suddenly pulled out they had to dismantle the pump and take it back at their own expense  turns out that someone at the very top of the company heard that they will officially supply fuel to an airfield and has instantly terminated the contract i can only speculate why theyve done it but it seems to be very reasonable to me  imagine you are a fuel supplier and must adhere to certain automotive fuel standards whats the worst which could happen if you occasionally dont someones car may stop somewhere and if the guy is smart enough to go with an investigation which will point back at the bad fuel in your pump you as a pump owner would have to pay for the repairs and promise that this will never happen again but what if some one died in a plane crash and compulsory investigation points back at you first of all its going to be all over the media then youll have to deal with dead bodies and aviation authority lawyers at the court
  certified a/c must be always maintained by a certified mechanic if something goes south with the plane some poor bastards amt/ame license is at stake if you were allowed to tamper with the plane no one would probably agree to take the blame of releasing it to service even if it was legally possible  i didnt know that  i guess it would be much cheaper to get an experimental amateur built modified a/c it would be cheaper from the beginning since it cant fly commercially anymore and it will be cheaper since noncertified mechanic owner can service it btw can you fly experimental with friends and other pax   anyway i think it is possible to make in normal again but it would be expensive paperwork and so on     as long as it is not documented it is fine but it is semilegal  imagine you are a fuel supplier and must adhere to certain automotive fuel standards whats the worst which could happen if you occasionally dont someones car may stop somewhere and if the guy is smart enough to go with an investigation which will point back at the bad fuel in your pump you as a pump owner would have to pay for the repairs and promise that this will never happen again  this is literally what was happening in russia it is russian roulette gas might be fine and next day they will fill natural donkey piss  but what if some one died in a plane crash and compulsory investigation points back at you   dead cant sue but this rule will work only for individuals   worst case if plane crashes people got injured you might end up paying for medical for airplane repair/replacement  first of all its going to be all over the media  media is cool to general aviation they are even cool to freight crashes
  i guess it would be much cheaper to get an experimental amateur built modified a/c  experimental/ultralight/microlight regulations are different depending on the country  it is not so unusual to sell used 10 years old noncertified 2seater a/c for 100000   it would be cheaper from the beginning since it cant fly commercially anymore and it will be cheaper since noncertified mechanic owner can service it  yes it is usually much cheaper to maintain noncertified aircraft even if youre not doing it yourself although there is nothing complicated about changing the oil and the oil filter yourself which is a major part of the 50/100 hour checks   btw can you fly experimental with friends and other pax  yes youll need to pass annual inspection and fly the first 2540 hours solo you are not allowed to fly it for profit although i think its ok to share the fuel costs at least in some countries  anyway i think it is possible to make in normal again but it would be expensive paperwork and so on  afaik it is not possible at least not in the uk
    ive been practicing these tests everyday since youre rcaf this is perfect how long did it take between writing the forces aptitude test and aircrew selection also where abouts are you from and are you going for fast jet
  the wait time can vary quite a bit depending on when youre available to do it my recruiting center tried to get me loaded on an aircrew selection course just a month after doing the aptitude test but i couldnt make it work with my exam schedule so i had to wait a few extra months im from bc and i am trying to go jets though it isnt a great time to become a jet pilot right now so well see what happens
  good luck man i already graduated uni so im hoping to get going asap im from montreal so kingston isnt far for me
  usaf c130 pilot still currently in the training pipeline for mc130 so not very experienced yet looks like that other anon was able to answer your questions pretty well and i dont really have knowledge of the canadian process i guess what i can answer is that i started down the military aviation route because it was a stable job and offered a much different experience to the average commercial pilot also its a great resume padder if i do decide to go commercial after leaving the military also an average day usually consists of various squadron duties like working the step desk or making popcorn and various busy work while studying things like aircraft systems and emergency procedures to stay sharp for checkrides on flying days the mission planning shop will hand me all the materials i need for the flight but im responsible for checking it over to make sure the filed routes lz/dz info and charts all make sense for the mission then its route study with the navigator then we go out to the plane to brief the crew walk around fly debrief then go home
  thanks a lot im sure theres a lot of overlap in the daily routine
why all modern aviation uses retarded units reeeeeeeee1111  why only soviets used normal units   no really why knots when km/h exist why feet when meters exist why nautical miles when kilometer exist why weird tons when metric exist why everyone who wants into aviation should learn fucking units based on subway sandwich length
  because the us invented aviation deal with it
  yes but i dont live in us so i should have normal worldwide known units not some subway sandwiches per hour
  to be fair no one here uses knots either so its just as foreign for us
  no really why knots when km/h exist  one knot is equal to one minute of latitude navigation is more important than your unit preference
  same reason why a british pilot once told a german pilot why he had to speak english in a german airport  because they lost the bloody war  also the usa invented aviation
      the usa invented aviation    u wot
  frenchies get their aerodromes and random other french terminology we get the units millibars can suck a dick
  fixed winged aircraft are an american invention
  fixed wing is a phrase helicopter pilots use to feel important its airplane single engine land not fixedwing single engine land

  hows daytona beach      tfw northern virginia winter is starting
tfw plane went in for maintenance last week  tfw shouldve been back tomorrow  tfw got a call they found a bulge in the exhaust system and have to order replacement parts  welp
  sounds all too familiar
  to add to that classic airplane engines rotate very slowly and thus have lower piston speeds giving more time for an explosion to turn into a detonation but im disappointed airplane engines are not designed to run with higher compression ratios to take advantage of the lower temperature and pressure of air at high altitude it would be a tradeoff between slightly less power at takeoff which would have to take place at part throttle and better power and fuel efficiency at higher altitudes    then again carburettors are still widely used despite their problems with icing and syncronization
  i guess modern stuff has higher compression  anyway it works it is bulletproof sure it could consume less fuel but i cant even afford 1960s plane yet i dont even have a license
something like this was flying at my local airport today    i talked to the guys flying it and they called it a gyroglider and told me people use them as gyroplane trainers    but i got to wondering later how to hell does the faa class these    they arent gyroplanes because by definition gyroplanes are powered    while i think they could be classed as gliders im pretty sure the few glider pilots ive met would scoff loudly at that and theres no way you could get a glider ppl in it    what do you say /gag/
  got an idea of the specs of the thing looks really interesting probably would be classed a ultralight not needing license
  what do you mean by specs i didnt think about asking them the weight but i assume its pretty light/ ultralight for unpowered is 150 i think not sure what this thing weighs    its a frame with a chair some little wheels a rotorhead and a pair of 25 foot or so rotor blades no engine    its tethered by a car not sure if you could do it with a plane the forward movement causes the blades to spin creating lift it rises like a kite and the tether is disconnected by the pilot who then zoops around in autorotation until he comes back to the ground
  wait can you really just buy a ultralight and be in the air sounds crazy as a europoor
  whats the deal with that gusset fin forward of the vertical stabiliser you see them often on planes with squared off tailplanes like the p51 for example
  navigation is key and we got their first so we wrote the rules
  not true the french were the first and have always been world leaders
  thats not true first of all a knot isnt equal to an angle its a measure of speed and is equal to exactly 1852 km/h or one nautical mile per hour second of all the nautical mile was originally based on the distance over the earths sphere when you moved along a meridian by an angle of one minute except not much later we found out its inexact as arcs of minutes are shorter at the equator and longer at the poles worse it loses any practicality when you stop moving in a strictly northsouth direction in the day and age of current year with current technology the nautical miles/feet system makes 0 sense it would work just as fine with     feet are absolutely unjustified as they are not even an exact subdivision of the nautical mile which is defined as 1 852 metres
  why ustards cant just use meters kilometers and kilometers per hour and metric tons of fuel
i have stupid question why being stretched 30 meter long 737 into 44 meter long 737 max if they could shortened 757 and they had designed short 757  sure 757100 didnt take off back in 1980 but now airlines want exactly this also they would have less problems since 757 is much newer wings are higher so kosher engines would fit wingspan is larger so more fuel efficiency plus higher cruise speed
  from what i know reagan halted the metrication process that had started in the mid 70s whenever americans elect some clown that will make america great again the country is set back three decades
  when us will elect thirdworlders i think i can fix us
hello i am a bit confused and need a little info so im just another wage cuck but once i have enough money i would like to work on entering flight school    what work is there for amateur pilots im not looking for big airport gigs rather the smaller stuff if anyone has anything it would be 100 appreciated    also  i would love to get a degree totally saving up but many have suggested going the simpler route of   fly first school later i dont have much guidance in real life so i must resort to online aid
  cfi
  whats cfi
  why cant you function with more than one unit system they are all arbitrary anyway
  wants to go into flight school  doesnt know who the cfi is
  that poster wasnt me calm your roasting  is there a high demand for flight instructors does anyone know any tips before i get too far into this
  lurk moar newfag
  that is why flight schools exist all they do is teach students abbreviations and shit and cfi exist there as well
  what country couldnt honestly say man but your military or a law enforcement agency would be your best bet
  like this anon said    its a bear at one point i think during 20082013 the cfi initial first time pass rate was somewhere in the vacinity of 20 which means 80 failed first time when a few of my buddies went to the airlines and asked if they had any training failures on their record they were asked to not include initial cfi
  be me   get super into band of brothers   want to own a c47/dc3 and run curahee daily  dont give a shit about family because i have none the only bros i have are on the battlefield or 6 feet under
  certified flight instructor
  take your blog shit to reddit
  why dont you enlist in the air force or air guard as an aircraft loadmaster and you can deploy paratroopers from c17s
and so it begins
  modern china use metric unit for things like flight level too    where
1965 tour package from hong kong to japan  the leg to tokyo will use iata luxurious jet aircraft  there were jet aircrafts that arent iata
only until the end of next june/start of juli before the theoretical exams run out  still have to fly a bunch of navigation flights and all of the radio navigation training  only got saturdays to fly  im scared i dont want to have to redo all these exams      iata is just the airline association a business jet is not necessarily going to be under iata standards for example iirc at least      it doesnt really matter its just numbers on your instruments that you have to memorise youre not going to convert any of these for anything and they all work with eachother as is  the only really annoying one is when one plane uses gallons for calculation and another uses liters or kg
  right maybe with lighter than air but not so much when it came to aeronautical navigation    also seems like paris is burning m8 great job leading by example shit posting aside i hope everything gets better over there for you all
i have my initial class 1 tomorrow but somehow managed to miss the part about needing my gp records with me to give to the medical examiner so im going to have to try and get in my gp first thing and beg them to print me some form of records before the hour drive to the aeromedical center    am i fucked
  reschedule
    they want 48 hours or you pay the full amount and have to book another at full price
  hmm you may be cucked i dont know desu
    theres a chance theyll hand me a record tomorrow morning but if not im gonna call them and tell them i dont have it if they say i have to rebook then tough shit its my mistake and ill take the 500 hit i guess shit happens
  lol last two times i got my medical the doctor listened to my heart then we talked about his helicopter and his tesla then i handed him a 100 and he signed my paper and that was it
all went ok but i need fucking glasses    mfw
  i have a small hump will it somehow class 1 medial for what do they check    glasses is ok fixing back is expensive
  which exam
  which local craigslist how much i would seriously consider buying this for the right price hopefully with a parachute
  youre thinking of the ones that work by shooting out seawater from a hose these are actual airbreathing turbine engines like you would find on a cruise missile or expensive af rc plane
  indianapolis in  1500    we live all around corn so if meth doesnt kill us amateur aviation does    sometimes both
    you cannot work as a pilot if you dont have a commercial pilots license other kinds of work that may consider amateur pilots aerial photographer aviation museum guide signature flight support uav drone operator pilot or payload helicopter news camera operator
  wouldnt aerial photographer and helicopter news guy be considered working as a pilot or in furtherance of a business
  he means the non pilot wielding a camera or microphone depending on which of the jobs youre specifically referencing
  at first i was stoked for the little turbinepowered hoverboard for 1500 then my bullshit meter started screaming little sucker looks like it has 6 r/csized turbine engines on a platform buddy any one of those engines probably cost 3k or more since its craigslist its gotta be a scam if youre local do go check it out in person i hope that im wrong but since the waterpowered version costs as much as a tesla i just dont see how bring some backup if you go

strange british train thread ill start this is the british rail gt3 go watch youtube until you know about it
bruv whats up with this 125
strange british trains  outta the way boys
gotta love the early stuff
  shortened lower gear ratio and with improved ventilation for hotdry conditions
  
  what the fuck  they ruined the perfect train
the bongs have battery powered locomotives theyre used for maintenance of way work on electrified rail the third rail or catenary can be shut off
  i think its just the london underground which has this  its a batteryelectric loco which is mainly used for maintainance works it conforms to the tiny loading gauge which deep level lines have but can also do work on subsurface lines  the loco has 4th rail shoes which allow it to run normally but it also has a large battery bank which can be charged while running on live lines this allows it to run when the 4th rail system is shut off for maintenence work
hi /n/ tis the season every year i set up my model train layout for christmas this year i want advice from people who do this as a full time hobby since im a casual who does it for the holidays my usual set up is an oval shape track set in a small snowy winter wonderland but my grandpop and i have a tradition of going to a local train shop to add to our layouts what should i add this year the trains i have are a silver prr gg1 and a new york central 080 steam engine some prr passenger cars new york central ones too i laso have a good amount of freight cars what im really trying to ask is if yall could help me out
  that looks super sweet maybe add to the winter wonderland vibe a little think to yourself what 5 year old you would want to see on a magical train ride and see if you can model it
how about some cable cars
   they would work great like light bulb on christmas tree
talk about past and present interurbans    suggest what interurbans youd create or recreate    we talk about why the interurban is the greatest transit concept ever
was looking for this thread yesterday glad someone made it again i wanted to post this
i feel like talking about the amazing interurbans that existed in around the san francisco bay area and that have been fascinating me lately the famous key system spiritual forerunner to bart the southern pacifics east bay electric lines later renamed interurban electric railway and the most wonderous one of all the sacramento northern    in the early years of the 20th century before the bay bridge those lines would connect to ferry services to san francisco with the opening of the bay bridge they would reach the transbay terminal using the tracks on the lower level of the bridge this arrangement would last less than 20 years from 1939 when the bridge railway was opened to 1958 when the key system was abandoned the east bay electrics renamed in 1938 to interurban electric railway would cease passenger service in 1941 as would the sacramento northern the key system then extended some of their lines using abandoned ier tracks    pic related shows the situation in 1927 at its prebay bridge heyday it shows the key system the east bay electrics and though not marked in the legend but visible on the map the sacramento northern here you can see a yuge hq version 
  the lehigh transit company should come back as the highways around here are constantly clogged
  contd  the bridge railway opened in 1939 about two years after completion of the bay bridge for a brief time it was used by all three companies and only by the key system from 1941 onwards a gianormous yard the bridge yard was built on the oakland side    heres the thing with the bridge railway all of the mentioned lines converged onto the double tracked bridge railway this meant five key system lines which each ran halfhourly during offpeak hours plus the ier and sn adding to that deadhand movements to and from the bridge yard it means a whole lot of trains to cope with this an ingenious signalling system was devised which would allow for much tighter headways than usual the cab signalling system
  contd  trains that ran on the bridge railway had a cab signalling system installed which displayed speed limits of 11 17 25 and 35 mph if a train got closer to the train ahead the cab signalling would indicate to the driver that hed need to reduce the speed this system worked by using very short block sections of 250 to 500 ft more or less 100200 m and a transponder system that sent an electric signal through the rails behind each train there would be a tail of progressively higher speed limits in each block sections 11 mph in the block section occupied by the train 17 the next one then 25 and then 35 on the bridge railway no regular signals were used except at switches this was conceptually a rudimentary forerunner of presentday distancebased signalling  in this key system promotional film from which pic related is taken you get to see the cab signalling in action 
  contd  with the opening of the bridge railway the key system put into service the bridge unit trains these were articulated units styled in a quite modern fashion though mostly rebuilt from older equipment they were very hansome looking in their original orange and silver livery when the key system was acquired by the infamous national city lines in the late 40s they were repainted green and yellow which made them look rather shit pic related is a restored bridge unit sporting its originalstyle livery  the ier and sn kept using more standard interurbanstyle cars
  heres a schematic map of the key system in 1940 the key system also operated some regular urban streetcars around the east bay area not shown on the schematic  this map is taken from a 1940 timetable you can see the whole timetable here 
  now we get to my absolute favourite the sacramento northern  the key system and ier operated as commuterstyle interurban streetcars they mostly ran through the east bay conurbation and into san francisco when the bridge railway opened  the sacramento northern was different so much so that it deserves greentexting  from its inception in 1926 to the end of passenger service in 1941 it was the fastest train from san francisco to sacramento at 2h47 later cut down to 2h40 with the bridge railway  the fastest competing train was southern pacific taking 2h55  the journey started from san francisco using key system ferry to key system pier from there sn train on key system cline tracks until sn trackage  about halfway to sacramento the train crossed suisun bay on a sn train ferry and then continued on to sacramento and chico  the whole trip used three different electrifications pantograph on key system tracks trolleypole on sn tracks until sacramento third rail from sacramento to chico  some trains were equipped with all three current collection systems to make the whole 183 mile trip    in 1939 you could take an electric train from sf to sacramento taking less than 2h45  for comparison presentday local buses take 3h10 fast buses 1h50
  ive drawn the alignment of key system cline in orange and the sn tracks green onto this current map of oakland didnt bother to draw the other key system lines the sn trains would run on key system tracks coming from the bay bridge and then on 40th street until shafter ave just before broadway there it turned left onto its own track on shafter ave until eventually reaching its own row once off city streets trains would reach impressive speeds of up to 60 mph
  at 40th and shafter marked with a black dot on the map where the sn trackage began there was the tiniest little yard occupying just one and a half city blocks
 ive  the pittsburg/bay point bart line is a kind of successor to the sn which also ran some commuter services from pittsburg to san francisco part of the bart line runs on the same former sn alignment ive drawn in more or less where the sn ran onto this current map showing the bart line again in orange where it ran on key system tracks and green the sn tracks    thats all ive got for now i hope you guise found this kinda interesting
r/amtrak thinks amtrak should be about interurban fast travel they also didnt like my idea of adding autoracks or roll on roll of european style auto cars to cross country service like the florida to virginia autotrain
  r/amtrak thinks  come home interurban fren
you can still find present interurbans in europe eg   
  rural singletrack line  street running  absolutely neat    youre right tho we often talk about american interurbans since theyre kind of iconic but we rarely talk about euro interurbans
barcelona has a bit of interurbanrelated history well technically the modern reeetram is an interurban since it connects barcelona to no less than 8 other municipalities but theres no ruraltype row nor does it ever leave the urban area    now the smallest of the three commuter train systems the popular vallès line which connects the eponymous region including the quite large cities of terrassa pop 216k sabadell 207k sant cugat 89k and rubí 74k among others started its life as an interurban tram  a preexisting short commuter line which ran from barcelona to the then city now borough of sarrià was extended through the mountains starting in 1916 and the whole line with the two branches was finished in 1923 plus a short tunnel in sabadell in 1925  for rolling stock american brill cars were imported shipped in pieces and assembled at the lines own shops until 1929 the line ran up balmes street in barcelona then via augusta until sarrià however it always had a full row with level crossings at each street this eventually triggered the inevitable autistic screeching because dumb spaniards are scared of da big choo choo so a tunnel was built local residents even wanted to cut the line short to its nexttolast station provença completely removing it from the city center first for the most central section and eventually between the 1940s and 70s tunneling was extended all the way to sarrià it was very very important to build an expensive tunnel for the horrible and dangerous train so that a beautiful and safe 6lanequasihighway could be built on top
  today this line is made to look like a metro because nothing gets retarded spaniards dicks harder than metros so everything has to be a metro tram bad metro gud after all theyre entitled to it however it never properly improved its low capacity and average speed it only allows for small 4car trains with no possibility of doubledeckers overcrowding is an ever bigger issue to the point where i shit you now you usually cant even find a seat at 11 or 12 at night if you dont take the train at the terminus needless to say theres standing passengers throughout the day even at offpeak hours at rush hour even the impressive 112 second headway isnt enough to cope  average speed is even a bit slower than a century ago the old brills could go up to 90 km/h while modern trains only go up to 80 a few stations have been added since then and theres no express services of any kind since the high frequency and doubletrack dont allow for it suburban trains skip three stations within barcelona thats it    heres some pictures of the olden days
on balmes street near the plaza cataluña terminus just below the lower edge of the photo the line would turn to the right where the station would be still today the tunnel kept this alignment so after the long straight stretch of balmes street theres a very tight curve to enter the station
brill car at les planes station when it was opened in 1916 it was the very first section of the interurban extension and it included the long tunnel to cross the collserola mountain range which limits barcelona
two brills have been preserved they could run but they dont because of lack of proper maintenance and needed repairs though this line is one of the most profitable in all of spain reaching 100 fare coverage they wont even put up the money to get these babies running some years ago there would be regular trips on sundays with these old trains costing just the regular fare now theyre tucked away in the depot and cant even be seen except when they are brought out once in a blue moon as static exhibits
lokalbahn wienbaden or vienna local railway its a line connecting 25 km of suburbs south to vienna all the way to the town of baden in vienna it uses the local tram network however outside of the city it operates more like a light rail on its own infrastructure it also uses cars different from normal trams more resembling american light rail there are also normal heavy freight trains operating on the part of the line and even street running
the only interurban in milan remaining in service is the 11 km long line 179 to limbiate north of the city
                  not interurbans
lets try to get this thread back on topic
the last true interurban
  interestingly those trains originate from this line 1177265  they were built at the sarrià shops reusing the old brill mechanical equipment a few of them were donated to cuba in the 80s or 90s or so
  why is it that every single /int/ there has to be these pigdog americans who insist that the only thing that counts as an interurban has to be a historical system in the usa
  not a clue its like they think they somehow came up with that idea when euro cities had had steam interurbans since the 1870s and in america they only became popular with electric traction   electric interurbans were very common in europe as well tho except they werent so iconic as the americans as the standards and rolling stock varied more widely  in spain to this day the expression interurban buses is commonly used
map of midwestern electric interurbans in 1920 you could go from chicago all the way to pittsburgh columbus or louisville riding electric trains  ywn ride comfy electric interurbans through midwestern small towns  why fucking live
you can see torontos old interurbans on this map while they are obviously gone many of the routes they took are still used today the exception is the kingston road interurban which is all but gone except for a small section still used by the kingston road and downtowner streetcar lines
  my very own special snowflake definition of interurban is the only correct one
/int/ newsflash    london  port stanley railway on track to be reestablished as a tourist railway  qrd  lps built in the 1850s between london ontario and port stanley on lake erie  electrified in the 1910s and turned into an electric interurban  passenger service ended in 1957 section between london and st thomas about 3/4 of the way to port stanley was eventually taken over by cn  track between st thomas and port stanley was abandoned and eventually rebuilt by volunteers now operates as the port stanley terminal railway offering tourist excursions using small diesel locos  track is interrupted at port stanley part of it was rebuilt in 2013 now the town is in talks with cn to reconnect both parts of the line  if this goes through the lps railway will exist once again in its entirety initial project is for tourist trains running the whole original route  we could witness what might be a rare rebirth of an interurban  i am excite    
  track is interrupted at port stanley  at st thomas
so the other day i was talking about the sacramento northern  which used a train ferry to cross suisun bay apart from the key system ferry which was later replaced by the bay bridge  now i found some history on that ferry and its pure gold wall of text incoming you have been warned    in 1912 the oakland antioch  eastern oae railroad company later the sacramento northern then western pacific submitted an application to build a railroad drawbridge from chipps island south of birds landing to mallard island west of pittsburg in contra costa county this was to have provided a fast direct rail route from sacramento to oakland the plans finally were approved after much finagling and construction began with an estimated completion time of two and onehalf years  at the same time 1912 oae in a hurry to begin service decided to build a ferryboat and provide service while the bridge was being built the ferry named bridget a pun on the words bridge it was completed in july 1913 and put into service  construction of the bridge stopped in may 1913 after building one pier on the contra costa side after the company ran out of money then the bridget was destroyed by fire on may 17 1914 it sure wasnt a very propitious beginning  as an interim measure oae rented tugs and railcarfloats from the santa fe and western pacific  railroads to continue service while another ferry was built  the lanteri shipyard in pittsburg built the replacement ferry ramon in a hurry in order to speed up production it was built completely with flat plate steel  the ramon was basically a rectangular barge with no keel and with propulsion at both ends a distillate engine for light diesel fuel oil that was rated at an optimistic 600 horsepower but in actuality only managed to grind out about 535 horsepower powered the vessel
  ramon also had a very small restaurant below decks when it was built one has to wonder why you needed a restaurant that seated about 25 people on a vessel whose runs were only supposed to last an average of nine minutes each well it was only supposed to be a temporary ferry anyway so why not   ramon was launched about six months after the bridgit was destroyed and of course even that had its problems a tugboat was hired to pull it off the building ways into the river because of a heavy river crosscurrent the tug couldnt hold the proper position for the operation when the signal came to pull the tugs skipper did just that even though he was out of position and the ramon was pulled off the building blocks onto its side several days later after righting the vessel and a few repairs the launch was successful  william stritsky was assigned to the ramon as a deck officer in 1916 and later became her skipper serving until the ship was taken out of service during an interview in 1966 the then 75yearold captain stritzky related many interesting stories about the ship that seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble  with a boxy hull no keel a very shallow draft and with not enough power it had a tendency to go where the wind and river currents wanted it to go instead of heeding to the captains desires  with trains on its deck the ship was equipped with a very efficient sail many times the engine would fail and the ramon would be blown ashore or drift with the winds and current heavy winds made landing the ship at the ferry slips a tricky and very often repeated maneuver
   on warm summer nights passengers on the train would open the windows for relief from the stifling heat then swarms of mosquitoes from the surrounding swamp thats wetlands for you politically correct folks would make life thoroughly miserable  one night one of the trainmen just couldnt stand the swarms of attacking insects any longer and threw a lighted flare into the caboose of a train being loaded hoping the fumes would drive the nasty little critters out the caboose burst into flames and an emergency unload was made after the fire was extinguished the train was reloaded and sent on its way with the virtually destroyed caboose still attached  getting out of the landing slip with the underpowered ferry resulted in an interesting solution to getting under  way the captain would tell the train engineer to come on board fast slam on the brakes and the hooks holding  the ramon in place were released at the same time this gave the ferry enough momentum to leave the slip  with little trouble the california occupational safety and health agency would have had a fit if it had been  in operation in those days  in spite of it all the temporary career of the ramon lasted 41 years without losing a single life or injuring anyone she was retired in 1954 after a coast guard inspection determined the hull was no longer safe the vessel was built with hull plates that were only threesixteenths of an inch thick and constant erosion had taken a toll of the already toothin metal thus ended the rather spectacular career of the ferry ramon and ferry service from chipps island to pittsburg  pic related is the docking slip on the oakland side on mallard island
  there were twelve 12 interurban lines radiating out from indianapolis in 1920  nowadays 93 of trips are made by car   83 of trips are made by a single person in a car  less than 1 are made via public transport   no rail based transit  kill me
  in spite of all the problems with the ramon capt stritzky was proud that he was able to operate the roamin ramon all those years with no damage of any consequence to the ship freight or passengers id have to agree it takes a man of courage and steely nerve to survive the shortcomings of design in a temporary vessel that continued in operation for 41 years the ramon was scrapped near to the place it was built and apparently no artifacts from it have survived  pic related was taken in 1951 after passenger service had long ended
  fuck your cccombo breaker reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee    just kidding yeah its fucking painful to learn that your town used to have great rail services and just threw it all out iktf bro iktf
  you sound like an autist but ill let it slide because were on /n/ and im an autist  too
barcelona had a bunch of interurban tram lines which began operation in the late 19th century many as steam trams however many of those lines stopped being interurbans when the towns they reached were integrated into barcelona between 1897 and 1921 as barcelona and the outlying towns grew together the interurbans became proper urban trams over time  only one line remained as an interurban until it definitely went the way of the dodo in 1965 that was the line from barcelona to badalona via sant adrià and unlike the vallès line i talked about before this was more like a regular tram running on doubletrack in mixed traffic within the city and a singletrack roadside row outside of it like the other interurbans it started its life as a steam tram in the 1883 reaching badalona in 1885 and was eventually electrified in 1903  pic related shows the tram at badalona sometime between 1903 and 1922
  the line had an interurban extension from badalona to montgat however there were never through services since the concession didnt allow it so as to not interfere with the railway concession   at montgat the line met yet another interurban tram from montgat to tiana this was also a connecting line of the same gauge metre and voltage but again there were no through services since this line belonged to a different company fuck yeah bureaucracy  a preserved and restored for the 2nd time after it was vandalized tram can be seen in tiana since 2016 seems kinda dumb to leave it out in the open again after it was vandalized the first time at least this time theyve enclosed it somewhat to protect it from the weather and put it in the middle of the town instead of a park but my bet is that it wont last very long these things never do when theyre out in the open idiot spaniards  you can see it here 
  maybe they are embarrassed interurbans in europe are still in use america got nothing but a few short heritage lines
  in 1923 the company that owned the badalona line bought new trams these were at the time the first metalbodied trams in barcelona the first trams running on bogies and the largest trams in the city not counting the vallès line trains these trams were of belgian design since the company that ran the badalona tram was of belgian capital  because of their large size and riveted metal body they were nicknamed tanks these would remain as the only rolling stock for the badalona line until its demise  these trams endured uncountable changes some were double ended some were married pairs with one motor car and one control trailer some were married pairs with both motor cars and then they were remodelled accordingly over time and starting in 1946 some of these trams were converted to standard gauge and ran on the urban lines in barcelona where they would run until the very end of tram service in 1971  pic related shows a metergauge tram on the badalona line at the final barcelona terminus near estació del nord train station which is now bus terminal that terminus was only short lived the tram would be supressed not much later
  this is my favourite photo of the badalona tram line because i used to live right next to where it was taken the pic is also from the very last years of operation heres the approximately same view today 
  wew i kinda missed the spot this is more like it 
  before the civil war 3639 there were both metregauge and standard gauge lines in barcelona after the war the whole system was converted to standard gauge except the badalona line which remained metergauge until the end in 1945 the reorganization of services was concluded and a new terminal was established at urquinaona square there was a stub track for the interurban services to sant adrià numbered 71 or all the way to badalona numbered 70 which used married pairs that were doubleended and a loop for the partial service to sant martí 42 and the branch line to poblenou 41 which was discontinued in 1955 when it was replaced by a standard gauge line  in those days there were trams painted red and painted green afaik the ones running to sant adrià or badalona were painted green the others red but this was apparently not strictly respected as pic related shows im also unsure if this 71 tram is actually single ended and using the loop intended for line 42 the pic is from 1956 so line 41 was kill already the picture is taken on trafalgar street close to the terminus hackshually the terminus was also called trafalgar as for the street where it ended which is why you see the signs of that era indicating trafalgar as the terminus
  this schematic shows the urquinaona trafalgar terminus as it was from 1954 to 1961 though there was no change in the metregauge alignment from 1945 to 1954  green shows metergauge tracks red the standard gauge tracks purple doublegauged tracks and blue the project for the new terminal which was established in 1961 shown in this pic   for orientation or those of you who have been to barcelona the triumphal arch is situated in the approximate center of the image where the red stdgauge tracks are further apart and right below the green metregauge tracks the badalona tram passed right in front of the triumphal arch we really cant have nice things here
  this postcard shows the badalona tram passing in fron of the triumphal arch in 1958
this photograph shows the badalona tram on pallars street still in barcelona note the multiple gauge track the red trams shown are standard gauge urban trams the green one is an interurban headed to badalona the area has changed quite a bit since but the building on the right which is very recognizable is still there so i can perfectly pinpoint the location heres the approximate same view today 
  heres a view of the tram on the bridge crossing the besòs river outside the city it ran on a roadside row thats why the interurban units had white and black lines painted in front so as to be more visible to road vehicles  notice that people are hanging on to the tram which is totally overcrowded that was a sad reality in the spanish postwar years which lasted for no less than two decades 1939 to 1959
  heres another color picture taken around the same spot as  but looking the other way id say its the same tram as in that picture it has a sign in front barely visible which says completo complete indicating that its full such was life in autarky spain
  more overcrowding at the badalona terminus in the 40s or 50s  well thats it hope you found this interesting
  thanks for the quick rundown do you perhaps know anything about barcelona trams during the anarchist years
  during the tumultuous period of 1936 the unions eventually get into the catalan parliament under the wing of leftwing political parties they immediately collectivize tram operations among other things in late 36 at which time trams and buses start sporting the red and black cntfai livery of which afaik there are no known colour photographs or films  dividends are eliminated so is the higher financial administration salaries are raised albeit only slightly mostly to compensate for high inflation theres talk of a unified salary which isnt implemented for fear of losing senior technicians in november 1936 the 40 hour week reverts to a 48 hour week however the increase in ridership together with the elimination of dividends allowed for somewhat more income which in turn leads to a bit of investment before the war reached barcelona mostly improvements to the shops  in september 1937 fuel is rationed and all bus service abandoned  in 1938 tram service is at around 50 due to a lack of imported spare parts electrical restrictions and infrastructure damaged from bombardments by the end of the war theres just 50 tram cars in service for a city of one million  pic related is a rare photograph of a tram sporting the cntfai livery
  you can see what the liveries supposedly looked like on this period poster
  50 trams for a city of 1 million  if fuel was being rationed and buses were stopped then did basically everyone else have to walk to work
assuming the people who say passenger rails are making a comeback arent full of shit what would be your reaction if interurbans made a reassurance in the us as well and where would you imagine the most likely routes would be revived/made
  walk to work  work  at that point the city was a war zone expecting to be run over by the fascist troops any day eventually the republic was defeated before that could happen and the fascists just marched in with no resistance there was little electricity if any almost no supplies and constant bombardments even during the day  my guess is that for many people there wasnt any work to walk to at all or little point in doing so  many of those who did have to go somewhere would likely walk yeah barcelona is a compact city even nowadays you can walk across it in about 2 hours
  passenger rails are making but a limited comeback only for corridors of rather high demand or intertwined with autobased infrastructure like pr rails in highway medians ie far away from the actual population    if interurbans were to make a comeback theyd do so just the way they did back in the day mostly irradiating from major cities and reaching the most significant outlying communities  the interurban is a great concept because it can use a limited row within the city like a 2nd gen tram allowing for reasonable urban avg speeds of about 20 km/h 12 mph and then become like a commuter train once outside the city the speed it loses compared to a commuter train when entering the city as a tram it makes up for by going right through downtown thus reducing or eliminating the need for connecting services this also means much less expensive implementation than heavy rail requiring grade separation or needing to share row with freight trains    many cities have a problem of too low density as a result of carcentric planning parking minimums and highways tearing through the city so the big advantage of the interurban which is urban accessibility is practically rendered moot so more dense cities that dont have too well developed suburban public transit systems i think of san francisco boston dc or philadelphia would probably be the best bet
  rightofway is virtually unmolested  logical extension of current rapid transit line  potential for a direct suburbtoohare connection    hurr not in my backyard muh taxes muh urban youths    kill me pete
  that makes sense but if interurbans make a comeback in some form what would different than modern lrt would assume they might be fairly similar and often confused for one another but the main differences coming down to line length/ave distance between station speed iirc the top speed for most lrt is 4550 mph so interurbans would be a somewhere faster and seating arrangement/passenger capacity
  at least we have this   thanks for the info dump
illinois terminal streamliners a last gasp attempt to revive passenger service outside the st louis area after ww2
  buy fast and comfy streamliners  8 years later shut down passenger operations  just  could you imagine if there had been an interurban renaissance in the 1950s using streamlined equipment sweatingtowelguypng
  it didnt help that they couldnt run on some parts of the system such as peoria and had reliability issues    the itc was full of whatifs what would it have looked like today if they actually connected chicago and st louis if they connected to indianapolis and so on
  some speculate that samuel insull planned on eventually consolidating his various interurban lines north shore south shore indiana railroad among others into one massive electric railway empire across the midwest
  muh dik
they see me rollin    they hatin
sixty years ago today april 20th 1958 one of the great interurbans ceased passenger operations the san franciscooakland key system with it also ended the magnificent bridge railway and the transbay terminal was converted to bus operations    press f to pay respects

how interurbans operated    books on the american electric interurban railways seldom if ever mention how the cars operated aside from the briefest allusions and the photographs do not show signals or other operating appurtenances except by chance we now have a resource the dot website that contains historic icc railroad accident reports 19111966 that includes descriptions of operating methods in the official reports these unfortunately have no photographs and few descriptions of signals but explain the methods of operation in detail there was no standard method of operation but a broad spectrum from the most primitive to careful operation identical to that of steam railways there were however certain widespread features distinct from steam railway practice and peculiar to interurbans this page will concentrate on these features    read more 
  interestingly enough alstom offers a specially designed tramtrain unit that allows speeds of 90 km/h and it has fewer doors and more seats it even has an optional toilet

why is the new aarhus letbane not an interurban
  does it have streetrunning can be atgrade urban row like most modern lrts  does it run from one town to another  if the answer to both of those questions is yes then its an interurban
  it drives from town to town at street level through aarhus but only runs in traffic through intersections 
  thats atgrade row so its all good trams should never run in mixed traffic
  pittsburgh had trams into the 1970s who knew must have been some of the last ones to close down
  a few us cities never completely demolished their streetcar networks they are boston newark philadelphia pittsburgh cleveland san francisco and new orleans
  does it have streetrunning can be atgrade urban row like most modern lrts    yes    does it run from one town to another  yes     if the answer to both of those questions is yes then its an interurban    great
  interurbans in the 1930s selfdisabled if the engineer disregarded speed limits  amtrak cant do the same in 20 fucking 18
  pic related  i meant cities that did close them down eventually
   in the 1930s selfdisabled if the engineer disregarded speed limits  you should check out  theres some crazy shit  the control handle had to be pressed down against a spring when the car was running if it was let up the power was cut off and sometimes the brakes were applied motormen often taped down the handle for their comfort negating this safety feature  there was a serious accident on the shore line electric railway at north branford ct on 13 august 1917 caused principally by the primitive operating conditions and poor discipline on this line   motorman negus said he suffered from fits that had lost him other jobs and was unconscious leaving north branford the icc report says he came to his sewage only an instant before the collision with the regular car he had tied down the controller handle for his convenience and it was not connected to the brakes anyway company officials said that when it had been the motormen used it to make stops which jarred the passengers so it was disconnected
  also speed limits were rare on interurbans and systems that somehow stopped the trains if they exceeded them even rarer i can only think of the key system having something like that and it was an exceptional highly modern interurban system
  im sure they were and it was but still they managed this nearly a century ago and amtrak cant even though theyve had multiple deadly accidents from engineers speeding
  they really werent speed limits generally were applied only on certain stretches like within towns or for stretches with tight curves or hard grades other than that it was at the drivers discretion the trains only went up to about 60 mph anyway and they could brake better than heavy steam trains  the motormans controller cut in starting resistances to limit the current at low speeds and controlled the series to parallel transition in motor connections and field shunting there was only a limited range of running speeds corresponding to series parallel and parallelshunt connections but this was adequate for this reason there were usually no stated speed limits for passenger cars    the key system had such an elaborate signalling system because of the extremely tight headways on the bay bridge once outside the area of the bridge railway that system switched off and trains were limited to about 22 mph which was the speed limit in oakland however the key system was anything but a typical interurban it was more of a hybrid interurbanstreetcarcommuter train
  but pittsburgh never closed all its tram lines
  i wasnt aware of that you learn something new every day
  el paso had a transborder line to juarez last well into the 70s
  wish america would learn that and germany as well
  all public transit should have its own row to be honest except neighborhood buses and those in rural areas
  true transit should never be subject to congestion ideally transit vehicles should only ever stop at stations or bus stops with zero delays in between i think that almere is like this
  my brother lives in berkeley and i always admire the bart when im there he uses his car like once a month desu    we drove up from la and it was really cool seeing all the new development around the new transit stops like in dublin    sfs gotten so expensive people are moving to the outer rings en masse but its not suburban shit theyre building its cool urban development
rare color footage from 1953 showing the mexico city  xochimilco interurban line this line was eventually turned into a subway on the mexico city side and into the mexico city light rail on the xochimilco side  interurban images start around 300  
  sometimes the freight business becomes more important than passengers simply because it pays the bills
  freight business was almost always more important than passengers
dumping key system timetable from 1940 observe how travel times are perfectly competitive with bart or the automobile but frequencies where suprisingly low generally every 30 to 45 minutes
        wow service frequency is shockingly low did the inner sections have coordinated and frequent service like sbahns or was that only when crossing the bay bridge additionally was there trackage for more frequent service
  ayyy its like a thread i can talk about the keihan kenshin line   its a interurban that starts as a subway goes into a mountian railroad and then transition into a street car  the 800 series are dope as fuck
  its also a shame most people dont take photos of anything other than the section before hamaotsu since the construction of the line ended up with some crazy shit like pic related
  my thoughts exactly i expected frequencies to be in the 1530 minutes area but at the very best they go to around 20 minutes in rush hour 60 in offpeak hours    did the inner sections have coordinated and frequent service like sbahns  nope there were no stops on the stretch shared by all lines keep in mind on the oakland side further toward the coast from san pablo ave there was mostly rail yards and rail maintenance installations also the highway coming from the bridge and maybe the odd industrial facility lines a and b split off the others before the first stop and between them only maybe one or two stops the other lines had a shared stop at san pablo ave after that the c line split away and idk if there was maybe one more stop shared by e f and h lines before they split up as well
  yeah passenger services were essentially a mobile advertisement to businessmen for freight railroads
why isnt this thread on page 1
    is the water spray to prevent squealing
ywn comfily ride and electric interurban through the rural midwest at 60 mph  its not fucking fair
  yup there is a whole japan railway journal on the keihan keishin line and the 800 series
bump    the brill bullet routinely hit 85mph in service outside philadelphia
  bump  the brill bullet routinely hit 85mph in service outside philadelphia    um the ops said the trains could go 100 but it rarely saw service above 55mph and they were gone in 1990s great train and they could hit 100
    yup there is a whole japan railway journal on the keihan keishin line and the 800 series    otakus want links dood     because of the tracking the inner rail heats up inner rail heats up it moves it moves it wears unevenly its an insane piece of track to take at speed but it does
  that is not interurban
  those cars are beautiful stuff like that might actually encourage more people to ride public transit our system is comprised completely of buses ugly smokespewing buses
  its not ugly but honestly not all that interesting either could never get into the more modern designs
tfw rode an actual interurban tram today  went from alicante spain to benidorm on the interurban tramtrain  converted from narrowgauge railway  converted to tramway in and around alicante and in the small town of creueta  runs lika a train outside those  local trams in alicante make all stops and run until the end of the doubletracked tramtype line  interurban skips almost all stops in alicante except in the very city centre  single track railwaytype line outside alicante and creueta  9/10 would ride again  only bad part is no toilets on interurban units full trip takes an hour and 15 minutes   from benidorm the line goes on to dénia but is not electrified and has high platforms operated by dmus  interurbans run every 30 minutes every other interurban connects with hourly dmu to dénia   also ama about this breddy gud operation

  torontoguelph beltline shouldve never been discontinued  it ran right past my neighbourhood gone in 1933 rails pulled mid90s 
  same could be said for the torontoscarborough interurban which used to run from bingham loop kingston road and vp to kingston road and morningside the line was closed in 1936 and replaced with buses although the ttc still operated a streetcar line as far as birchmount road however it was ended in 1954 and replaced with buses as well no part of the interurban line remains east of victoria park    picture is the only one i could find of it
bumping not losing another inter urban thread
holland the haghe
brit here what are interurbans supposed to be are they trams are they light rail are they heavy rail what are they
  interurbans are basically light rail before light rail was a thing electric trams or tramlike vehicles running on the street or on their own row and connecting separate settlements
i was researching the seattleeverett interurban the other day it advertised itself as going to bellingham but that wasnt quite true the interurban stopped at everett and passengers boarded a bus to mt vernon where they then boarded another interurban to bellingham ive included a partial track map with this post
  interestingly the bus service today mirrors the old interurban service somewhat the 90x goes from everett to mt vernon and the 80x goes from mt vernon to bellingham
  the interurban used city streetcar tracks across the fremont bridge and along westlake avenue it was originally ordered to not make stops in fremont but that changed due to popular demand
  if seattle ever gets up the guts to try and rebuild another streetcar line they should extend a line to fremont and revive the old row which is currently occupied by cager parking
north korea interurban tram line maintenance car in photo
  are you a legitimate nk poster
  obviously i am just reposting from other photo archives
  they can be any of the above the definition is kind of loose    in north america it refers to a type of electric railway that typically grew out of existing streetcar tram networks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when shitty roads and steam trains were the only competition they were essentially the main form of rural/suburban public transit in the preautomobile usa    most of them were killed off by the great depression with a few of the bigger and more successful companies survived until the highways wiped them out after world war ii
  autotrain i think would be unbelievable successful if done on a state level in flyover states my idea would effectively be state dots building there own autotrains parallel to interstates running from one border to the other    ohio could be a good place to try it for example trucker coming from penn crosses the stateline and pulls off the first exit and loads his truck on a train bound for toledo on his way to michigan now instead of going direct he should have to take two trains with every train stopping in what is basically the center of the state columbus he transfers his truck to that train to toledo disembarks and continues his drive to detroit mi    states could plausibly make a profit off of fees which might be the equivalent to the amount of gas money spent less trucks on the road means less hazard to other cars less cars on the road means less money should be spent on road maintenance
  is that vintage 1950s equipment
  fuck nimbys
when i become a multibillionaire i will be building a streetcar system in my hometownowen sound ontario screenshot this post
  youre a good lad wish you all the best if only more billionaires cared about streetcars
    trams that run between cities with infrastructure upgraded accordingly
  wait isnt it on the pyongra line i dont think that count as interurban    no idea about that
bump
  whaddayaknow just yesterday i was looking at my old pics and found some i took way back in 2013 of the maintenance rolling stock for that line
oc feels
any interurban line remaining that are actually interurban
  where do you mean anywhere in the world a few have been posted    theres a few in switzerland as well at least the one in zurich and the one in neuchatel    in burgerland theres the notorious south shore line then a bunch in and around philadelphia routes 101 and 102 and the norristown high speed line maybe one or two others    and then of course theres tramtrains which are essentially a modern iteration of the interurban    all that is just off the top of my head so yeah theres still interurban trams
  eh in this post  i actually wanted to ask if there are actually interurban as in intercity
  yeah just eat their streetcar scandal shit i hope they enjoy it
  how did i not respond to that all the examples i mentioned are intercity between cities
  because those things youre posting arent interurbans
      sorry for not defining everything in the original post but i werent counting those smaller cities that can be count as satellite city to the main city for instance from zurich that would mean is there any interurban line that connect into bern or stuttgart i forget that some consider those smaller towns around as cities
  yes yes they are
hannover tramway   longest crosscountry section ran from goseriede in the city of hannover via döhren wülfel grasdorf rethen gleidingen heisede sarstedt and hasede to hildesheim   the route was 306km in length  completed in 1898   received the number 11 in 1906  terminated at hildesheim central station and connected to the hildesheim tramway an independent tram network  used rolling stock with four axles and distinct red coloring pic related
  the tramway operator üstra got two new highcapacity trains consisting of two emus and a central motorless car each  they even had a buffet section for some time   depots were at rethen near the halfway point and hildesheim   hildesheim tramway was closed in 1945 after heavy bombings  the southern half of the interurban line was closed in 1958   sarstedt is now the terminus of hannover stadtbahn line 1  üstra want to close down the remaining track between gleidingen and sarstedt  this is because of low demand and because heisede and sarstedt are in hildesheim district not hannover region so financing is a mess    this counts as an interurban right i dont think you can call hildesheim a sattelite city to hannover at the very least not back when this line was fully operational
  whoops wrong file i had to overlay the 1920 track map on an osm screenshot so the alignment might not be perfect but you get a rough idea where the crosscountry/interurban tram lines were going
whats the difference between modern intercity light rail and classic interurbans
  theres no significant difference other than already common differences between old trams and modern lrts like rolling stock maybe one main difference is that modern intercity light rail usually has a row within the city while classic interurbans just ran in mixed traffic as there were no significant traffic problems back in the day
  if you count short freight lines including ones that dropped electrification decades ago there are a few left iowa traction still runs little orange steeplecabs on their couple of miles of track and they have an old interurban sitting around operable for special occasions the east troy electric railroad is essentially a museum/tourist line now but has been continuously operating its 4 or 5 miles at the end of a former tmerl line outside milwaukee since the 1930s    in the tulsa area there are two short lines that originated as interurbans that still operate today albeit with diesels the sand springs railway and the tulsasapulpa union railway the tsu is still locally owned the ssr was controlled by an american steel company that sold out to a german one and then a few years ago sold to omnitrax it used the same 3 sw900 it initially dieselized with until recently im not clear on the details all i know is that one of them was sold and sent to a sand loading operation in texas about a month ago     portland  northwestern is a new company but it operates over 110 miles of the former oregon electric railway including streetrunning through several towns and some old sp red electric routes commuter service is operated over a few miles of exoer by portlands trimet using colorado railcar dmus and rdcs from alaska and dallas also in portland the local interurban/standard gauge streetcar company known among other names as pepco stuck around as the portland traction co until the 1980s as a short line whose ownership was traded off between up and sp for decades part of one of its lines became the first part of portlands light rail system pt actually delivered the first cars itself the line still operates now owned by a local who was essentially running it himself when the original company finally died    cont
  in addition to portland at least dallas los angeles sacramento and baltimore run at least a part of their modern light rail systems along or near former interurbans los angeles blue line for example uses the row of the pacific electrics long beach line and its expo line uses the pes santa monica air line route they even once dressed up one of their cars in old pe livery     there are plenty of lines still around but dieselized see some more here   but by the strictest definition even the south shore line isnt really one anymore the passenger is operated by a transit district who owns the line and the freight operations are leased to the original company which is now dieselized the former philadelphia  western/red arrow lines sometimes seen as the other surviving true interurbansdont have any freight service and all cover such short distances that the philadelphia urban area has grown to include their termini making them more suburban than interurban you could go to europe to find more but those just dont have the same feeling as american ones
  ah sorry please read  
  but werent most american interurbans also centered around a larger city and smaller satellite city from what i can tell only the most extensive ones could really be considered intercity
  yeah thats what i am asking
        go with this definition dont listen to random anons who dont know what theyre talking about
ann arbor to urbanachampaign so i can stay with my bf     stay strong trainons
please welcome my humble countrys interurban system the hév longest one built in 1888 is traveling 25 km 155 miles while going through 4 town and one city most of the country is/was filled with inter urban rail my favorite one completed in 1896 has a length of roughly 100km 62 miles and connects 14 towns with rail it is still ride able the only difference is that the countrys main railway operator bought all of the interurban rails to extend his own ones
  looks like an older metro or commuter rail vehicle to me
  the question was geared toward a particular subset of interurban network/lines instead of the general concept of interurban so that obviously wouldnt match
  cute
  there were no stops on the stretch shared by all lines    i did not write this line but i told someone exactly that while i was parked in the target parking lot in front of the entrance to the ebmud throughway to the sewage plant     we  my friend g and i  were making a bit of a day of it traveling from the popular street station north along the right of way to the entrance to the tunnel under the sp tracks most of the original tracks and a bunch of signaling is still sitting there 60 years after closing closing
  why isnt this thread on page 1    i would prefer five threads one for east bay  a ton of source material  one for the rest of the us one for europe and hungary and one for pittsburgh my god the brill bullets were fantastic trains  much east bay jealousy here 
love those interurban freight motors imagine if electrified freight had remained
narrated trip over the sn from the east bay to sacramento    
      oh my this is crazy priceless for the views of old east bay and the narrative of locations and equipment priceless
sacramento northern ran barely two years over the bay bridge  if it had survived just a few more months it would have lasted at least until after ww2  _
  one of the greatest whatifs of transit history  imagine this system  becoming the nucleus of bart     ironically sn helped in the construction of the original bart system
is the septa norristown line an interurban    wikipedia is telling me yes and i cant tell if i trust them
  is the septa norristown line an interurban  wikipedia is telling me yes and i cant tell if i trust them    yes it travels from philadelphia to norristown and its electrified    do not trust wikipedia it calls the septa norristown line a commuter    
  this tired of all these europoors and least coasters shitting up this thread with their unaesthetic and uninteresting interurbans that are basically just glorified streetcar lines north shore being the exception     sn lives
  interurban and commuter arent mutually exclusive tho most interurbans ran mostly commuter services
  bart is conceptually a heavyrail rebuild of the key system and parts of the sn the yellow bart line runs more or less parallel to the old sn line all the way to antioch in part it runs on the old sn row although not at grade    if the sn hadnt disappeared it could have been turned into a nifty little tramtrain get some modern rolling stock capable of 75 mph and capacity of 400 pax doubletrack it for the most part until concord for denser commuter services get some row going on the streetrunning parts and build the bridge across suisun bay wala a comfy tramtrain that gets you from sf to sacramento in 2 hours thats not even twice the time it takes by car and way faster than any other public transit operation      bitch im a europoor and i posted everything about the sn so stfu also at least we still have interurbans unlike muttland
  thank you for your service what i mean to say is i wish all the posts by europeans itt were about american systems not their own modern systems i guess thats a failure of the op not being specific enough although he never says anything about europe which should imply this is a thread to discuss american systems
  but op did specify past and present  just because you want the thread to be only about american systems doesnt mean it actually is
  trolley pole  pantograph  third rail shoe  all on one locomotive  how many other lines could boast of such    also on a semirelated note i recall hearing once that the brief trend of thirdrail interurbans northern electric north part of sn cae philadelphia  northern etc was a response to the arcing problem that trolley wheels would have at speed this problem was solved by the invention of the trolley shoe but for a few years third rails were seen as a viable solution is there any truth to this story
  i am op and i didnt specify because all interurbans are cool not just the american ones whats wrong with talking about all kinds of interurbans
  also on a semirelated note i recall hearing once that the brief trend of thirdrail interurbans northern electric north part of sn cae philadelphia  northern etc was a response to the arcing problem that trolley wheels would have at speed this problem was solved by the invention of the trolley shoe but for a few years third rails were seen as a viable solution is there any truth to this story    it would seem so from demoros sacramento northern on nes thirdrail lines p 3132  electric railway technology was still evolving and there was spirited discussion among engineers over the advantages of overhead trolley and third rail with a third rail it was argued greater currents could be carried and higher speeds attained without the inconvience of a trolley pole jumping from the overhead wire third rail was adopted on most elevated and subway lines to save space in tunnels and to avoid having trains stalled in tunnels by a trolley leaving the wire  however in a few years the unprotected third rail it did not have a safety cover at most locations would be considered a hazard when the speedwayoroville section was converted to third rail from trolley the section gang resigned rather than work next to the rail
  from the very beginning newspapers missed few opportunities to refer to the third rail as deadly  ne officials were continually assuring local officials that the more dangerous thirdrail system was necessary to provide enough electricity for the long and heavy trains being planned  a number of major interurbans also adopted electric third rail except on city streets at about the same time as the ne among them were the aurora elgin and chicago railway and the puget sound electric railway seattletacoma both opened in 1902 and the central california traction building between stockton lodi and sacramento the cct in 1907 used a 1200volt dc underrunning third rail with a safety cover  for interuban service many of the electrical inadequacies in the 600volt overhead trolley system were alleviated by the 1200volt dc overhead trolley equipment pioneered by general electric and installed starting in 1911 on the southern portion of the sacramento northern
imagine an electric interurban stretching from redding to san francisco
came across this article randomly felt it was worth posting published in the december 1959 issue of the southern california traction review and available in full here along with other issues     the shape of things to come by lr veysey    the ending of a decade makes it appropriate to stop for a moment in the attempt to take a longer view    what have the 1950s been like for the railfan what will the 1960s bring    the 1950s were probably the final decade during which railfan activity would center about a continual succession of last runs here and there a few systems linger on the brink of abandonment but much of what remains is safe until late in the decade to come    of course very little is left    but here and there separated by odd gaps of from 500 to 2000 miles are clustered the remnants of a dozen or so street railway systems    even more infrequent and scattered are the few encouraging evidences of new construction in the electric rapid transit field which the 1950s also brought to light and which we can all hope will become the harbingers of an increasing trend    confining ourselves to the picture in california what may we expect the 1960s to bring for whatever they are worth we offer the following predictions    during ten years to come all surface street railways in the state will be abandoned including those both in los angeles and san francisco    actual rapid transit construction of some type will take place within the state probably both in los angeles and in the bay area    finally the last conventional interurbantype operation  to long beach  will disappear within a year owing to the intransigence of the southern pacific company if wrong we shall rejoice
  what will the effects of this total situation be upon the lives of those who are committed to streetrailwaycentered enjoyments    in the first place the fan trip or excursion will cease to be the characteristic railfan activity already with the neardemise of conventional cars throughout the state these occasions are losing their charm the pcc car is simply not worthy of such attention except on an annual or less frequent basic    with the demise of conventional traction and the simplification or extinction of oncecomplex systems opportunity for fresh collection in the field also greatly diminishes railfans will instead increasingly concentrate on cataloguing organizing and rounding out through purchases the materials which they have obtained during the abandonmentstrewn decade just passed    the 1950s have already seen phenomenal progress in the museum field and the 1960s should well prove to be the decade of unparalleled museum activity throughout the state the time money and effort formerly marshaled for excursions distant lastruns and the like will now pour increasingly into what is essentially a far more creative if more demanding endeavor the construction of a reality tailormade to fantasy    publication activities already large scale throughout the country as well as locally will continue apace would projects as sumptuous as the recent 1960 interurbanphotograph calendar offered by pacific railway journal or on a higher plane the newer publications in the interurbans series have been possible ten years ago the answer is no for however fine some of those older publications were in retrospect they seem only feeble beginnings    meetings will continue of course and may prove increasingly popular they too have their place as substitutes for nonexistent streetcar rides
  marked by such enjoyable if slightly differing interest the years will continue to pass in 1970 those who can remember riding the long beach line will smile indulgently upon the young newcomer who define the streetcar as the recentlyabandoned pcc even as we who rode birneys on edgeware road think the newer generationunable to imagine the route of the oak knoll carsas incredibly young    more and more we shall attempt to recall the exciting moments which recede in our memories into antiquity the pe 950s turning into hill street station a watts car sounding its gong insistently at an h3 on san pedro st the motors of sn 1005 echoing exotically against the narrow walls of the tunnel east of havens    more and more we shall accept substitutes for these memories the photograph of the car which although we are loathe to admit this we can barely remember having seen or ridden in actuality the artificial experience of seeing a 5050 creep forward under sagging museum trolley wire while we vainly try to imagine ourselves back on the four tracks    these will be the experiences of our future as railfans they must continue to be valuable ones during the decades ahead we shall have the interesting tasks of providing to ourselves and to the great outside world that antiquarianism is a truly creative and constantly regenerative experience not merely the psychosis of a handful of people who fearing life in the presentday world seek vainly to exile themselves among selfindulgent fantasies

i liek trolleys
  if youre going to make a bold claim prove it
  when someone says something like what if americans had developed their interurbans/streetcars into more stadtbahnlike direction i point them to these and the last incarnation of the keysystem with the bridge railway in use    and they threw all that away on a whim
  whats even worse they dont even consider rebuilding something cheap and simple like that it has to be all grade separated heavy rail in the end thats also a way for the auto lobby to prevent transit developments by promoting the idea that only the most complex and expensive systems will do
does the los angeles railway count as an interurban
rip key system    f    and rip this mural too sadly
never forgive never forget    f

  cool
    interurbans declined for a reason interurbans are very vulnerable to acts of nature damaging bridges  track particularly in the midwestern us where flooding was common the heavy  large interurbans some weighing as much as 65 tons caused damage to city streets which led to endless disputes about who was responsible for the repairs the growth of automobile traffic in the mid1920s aggravated the issue the interurban companies dealt w/ growing competition from cars  trucks on newly paved highways  streets while municipalities sought to alleviate traffic congestion by removing interurbans from city streets
  municipalities sought to alleviate traffic congestion by removing interurbans from city streets  thats the urban planning equivalent of saying that we couldnt sustain widespread vegetarian lifestyle because of all the additional farmland that it would require
  the interurban was only practical for a brief window of time between electric traction becoming practical and the advent of automobiles and buses which doesnt mean theyre a bad concept per say just that theyre generally not very competitive thats why surviving interurbans in europe tend to be publicly owned and operated and ticket prices are subsidized just like with most public transports and unlike with urban transports they usually serve areas where traffic isnt a problem so they dont even have that advantage over cars    interurbans are generally superior to buses theyre more expensive to run but they also carry more passengers so it comes down to similar costs per pax as a bus however since the cost of the infrastructure that they use isnt diluted among the road infrastructure spending its easy to make a case for closing them    tldr interurbans are gud but they have everything going against them
  i dont think most place in the world subsidize public transportation
    south shore line almost died in the 80s but was saved by locals who petitioned indiana to take it over    now if nictd can get about to double tracking the main and maybe a new downtown south bend terminal that would nice but nice things rarely happen from the government
  the insull interurbans around chicago were relatively atypical in both their high standards of construction and their longevity the south shore ultimately fared the best of the three due to a lack of competition in commuter service
  ask mike pence for help
  maybe a new downtown south bend terminal  literally never ever ive been living in south bend mishawaka since 1984 this idea has been on the table since at least that long ago when parent was still the mayor probably longer still hasnt happened they got a few bones tossed at them years ago when we got the airport renovations but that was the last of it
  welcome to government    honestly i think it could be done as a publicprivate venture but we always have time for whatifs in public transport
  theres talk of moving the terminus to the amtrak station tho
  youre wrong broski like 99 or more of urban public transportation is subsidized one way or another i think japan may be an exception with many private rail lines turning a profit although they make money with shops and malls at the stations not the trains themselves but in the west public transport is systematically subsidized
  in the west  so its problem if the west probably
  only this very specific american sort of interurban counts    cringe
  pittsburgh was as far as i know the last major american city to close its streetcar network while there were some networks which survived and two lines in pittsburgh did they are all weird exceptions which made abandonment and replacement with busses impractical pittsburgh however limped along until about 1975 although by that point the network had already been greatly diminished     iirc the north american cities which didnt abandon their 1st gen streetcar networks were as follows    philadelphia remaining lines fed into a subway although purely streetrunning lines survived well into the 1990s and one heritage line still operates    boston fed into underground tunnel or fully separated row ashmontmattapan large abandonments still occurred on feeder lines to subway    cleveland segregated row interurban with downtown subway    newark segregated row downtown tunnel    san fran tunnels under hills and central subway tunnel    new orleans segregated row    pittsburgh tunnels under mountains    mexico city segregated row    toronto for some reason didnt abandon it despite having no tunnels or weird circumstances
  no most of east asias public transport is publicly subsidized in one way or another its also subsidized in the middle east eastern europe and russia and actually everywhere except shitholes like africa that dont have proper public transport in the first place
  where you get the idea pretty sure its not the case in japan except some muni buses not the case in korea mostly not the case in taiwan not the case in hong kong etc
  thatd be fantastic as a londoner its not often the city gets anything neat itd be fun as fuck to take a tourist train to port stanley for a day of beach drinking    but fuck do i hope we get this brt shit figured out moved to hamilton about a year ago and had to drive a bunch today while visiting parents good fucking god the traffics intensifying faster than i thought possible
a literal boomer once told me he went into school distraught the day after the local interurban line was abandoned and the teacher instructed the class to laugh at him for being upset about the obsolete trolleys going away
  what an ol meanie
actually what was service frequency of interurban like in the past
  i believe it was generally like modern metro or tram frequency
  the mid 20th century was a mistake
  there will never be a 1950s/60s generation of interurbans and streetcars with sleek midcentury modern styling
  i prefer the predepression cars 2bh
    it varies from every few hours to every 15 minutes or so the pacific electric had very good frequencies then again that was more of a suburban operation true rural interurbans ran maybe like every hour or every few hours  heres a timetable from the sacramento northern  the most densely traveled stretch around san francisco had a whopping seven trains per day each way
hes made another one  
  damn his 3d modelling just keeps on getting better
  yeah i find it hard to believe one guy is making these
  i think its two people
how does /n/ feel about the fast as fuck scooter craze    heavily modified some of these fuckers hit 60mph    they recently got heavily fucked in singapore effectively getting banned
scooters are gay
  your face can be gay
  i think the surge in scooter popularity came out of nowhere not just escoots but i noticed a lot of kick scooters around before it got colder folding kick scooters are a decent compromise of sacrificing range and speed for convenience and portability    latest terry video featured kelsey on her bike but also her friend sanchez on a kick scooter killing it starts at 310 to 650  
  mostly a lot of people realized the market exists now since lipo cells have gotten decently more energy dense and hub style motors a little better i imagine bird and lime made people aware of it too
    small wheels and pot holes dont mix
  swhy you steer around them
anyone memba those old school kick scooters that were essentially longboards with 12 wheels on the front and back     cracks jolt     now that was a scootah
  100 km/h on tiny wheels is a suicide  max speed that is somewhat sane is 3035 km/h for 8 inch wheels
  i remember kick scooters being hugely popular when i was in late primary school probably 20 years ago seems to have picked up again
  but now theyre electric its like somehow electric motors and batteries are a new invention or something
  it is not new only li ion batteries are new and this all allowed them to be somewhat practical
  i dont think the ones i see kids on are electric tho
  the normal ones in this modern aluminium iteration became popular when i was a wee lad in the 90s iirc
  this i remember in the late 90s razor scooters were being shilled on commercials magazines and stuff then everyone wanted one then everyone had one then skaters called it gay then everyone started skateboarding i remember my razor scooter it was orange and had a wheelie bar those things were pretty fun but since i was already cycling pretty shit compared to bikes on a practical aspect
    its only a matter of time that an electric vehicle smaller than a car larger than a bicycle and that is enclosed becomes super popular    escoots are fine for city riding and flats but are pretty garbage on hills and bumpy terrain due to the small wheels and weak motors they also dont handle well at high speeds escooties with nice big thick tires powerful motors and seats are pretty fucking fun
  yeah back in the day those tiny 10 cm scooters were around they were quite impractical due to wheel size and overall dimensions  at some point 20 cm scooters appeared but i thought it is a toy for children until friend of mine gave me it for a ride it was surprisingly cool more convenient than brompton sorry guys pulling one lever and folding thing in 2 seconds cant compete with complex system and gave significant boost in speed 3 times faster than walking so 15 km/h  so either electric or kinetic they are pretty decent transport i never understood bikes but i understand this   more maneuverable than bike stops more rapidly weights nothing 5 kilo for normal  too bad there is no good manufacturers all electric are literally garbage quality since chinks cant into materials some kinetic are pretty decent but price
  35km as in 21mph thats slow as balls way less than these scooters can handle  also the big ones have 10 pneumatic wheels with suspension arms and are built like tanks they can very comfortably go over rough af pavement
  on 8 solidwheel id not go faster  on 10  maybe you can go 50 km/h without any problem dunno
  i used to have one of these that had a thing on the back that you could press down with your foot and would make sparks on contact with pavement shit was dope
  hey watch thi ah fuck my ankles
    lold
  then everyone started skateboarding    i dont remember this part if anything skating has died out after the tony hawk games craze subsided
  literally the dorkiest mode of transportation  now available at lifethreatening speeds    just buy a bicycle and stop being a cringy memelord
  did you mean petrol scooter
  i think he meant ebike
  haha i forgot about those beasts    sips redbull    yep
electric scooters are motor vehicles provided they are regulated accordingly i have no problem with them i do have a problem with users acting as though they are entitled to operate their motor vehicle in pedestrian or humanpowered vehicle lanes or areas
  audible kek    full kit lycra 20 km one way commute roadie here its not the same some people just want something thats in between a motorbike and a bicycle when it comes to convenience and lack of regulations
  250w ebike is a meme too slow 8 inch scooter will be better
  depending on the setup you can take a scooter inside with you which in a place like san francisco is a godsend because people with fucking portable angle grinders will cut your lock and steal your ebike if you lock it up outside and nobody will do shit about it
ive been making a lot of railway journeys this summer and have just done the mid cheshire line which was nice and the penistone line which was beautiful but not very comfy being stuck in a crowded pacer for almost an hour and a half    planning to do the settle  carlisle line in about two weeks so looking forward to that    where have my fellow britbongs been lately  made any nice train journeys any hidden gems what about nice/unique stations visited
what about irish rail  i suppose this should cover both northern ireland and the republic of ireland thanks to the two networks being connected and using the same gauge plus a lot of trains being compatible for both signalling systems    i would say that the nicer train journeys around ireland would be the more coastal trains since they have a great view in general nirs derrylondonderry line from coleraine is allegedly michael palins favourite train route larne line is pretty nice as is the bangor line in northern ireland for ireland a number of lines including the howth branch the great northern mainline along the coast of county dublin and county louth are very scenic plus theres also the nice views along the way to dun laoghaire and also on the trains to waterford and cork as well    plus a large number of the rail tours in ireland start in northern ireland and then go to some remote part of the republic of ireland fitting into the spare capacity of many lines
  ireland is fine too i must visit at some point
  isle of man rail acceptable too
want to get up to the gcr at some point on a day theyre running branch services on montsorrel    also hoping pic related gets restored soon as it was hidden away behind a gym where i live until like 2011 i think the group that owns it is struggling to find somewhere to restore it
  yes
  thank you for your 125s sorry we didnt do them justice
    arent the xpts still valenta powered if so you are doing us proud and more besides
  unfortunately the valentas got replaced from june 2000 with vp185s the biggest reason i feel the xpts dont do they 125s justice is that dont really operate at the full 200 km/h per hour owing to the poor state of trackwork and the freight alighment of australias regional railways
although im not british im interested in its railway  general railway history was planning first  foremost to take a trip on the island line simply because of the rolling stock there hopefully will be able to take a trip on other rolling stock before theyre cascaded by the end of the year
tfw the great central is finally bridging the gap  bridge over the mml was built last year  fund raising for the refurbishment of the bridge over the grand union canal is now halfway    ive been waiting for this for decades and now its steadily coming together bit by bit
  if youre on the island line change over at small brook junction and have a ride on the isle of wight steam railway  its got very historic locomotives and coaches some of which are over a century old and still running  
  what the fuck  how did you make 125s look ugly
  nice    anyone looked into getting paid summer work on tourist lines unfortunately ive only found a couple that arent chock full of old retired volunteers ubi when
took the east coast mainline out of kx to edinburgh the other day man it was comfy  no security car parking check in crammed into tiny seats baggage reclaim transfer from airport to centre of edinburgh  just a quick tube ride hope on a comfy train watch the sunrise over cambridgeshire and the coast by durham then step off in the centre of edinburgh all in all cheaper and less stressful than the plane now i just wish that other train journeys were cheaper and on time more often with better quality trains    is there a place where i can read more about improvements/plans for british railways
what are the major infrastructure projects in progress/coming up over the next few years
    nothing of any note electrification has been halted pretty much everywhere so billions can be pumped into solicitors wallets to fight every dandelion that might be cut down by hs2 which by the end of it will definitely never get built
  fair dinkum looking at heading over to do contract archaology next september if the programme is delivered on time was kinda banking on hsr2
    infrastructure project  uk  on time    seriously put the crack pipe down
  not the infrastructure the archaeology apprenticeship the longer hsr2 takes the better from a work perspective as long as the work is actually going on
  i was bored so i made the pic in op look like a toy train
  and you you also get turned into a toy train
  been travelling to or through melbourne a lot and it still surprises me at just how ugly their liveries are
how many stations have you called at /n/    ive called at 84 since i started counting in july
thinking of doing glasgow queen street  oban on the west highland line in autumn anyone done it
  is there a place where i can read more about improvements/plans for british railways  theres hs2 and fuck all else
  thank you ill have a look although correct me if im wrong doesnt the steam railway only run on certain times of the year
    fuck thats good
  no but from people that have done it and photos i get the impression that it is extremely /comfy/  you can spend the night in that signalbox in your attached picture
  also electrification though thats more general    is there a place where i can read more about improvements/plans for british railways  railway magazines in a lot of newsagents like whsmith or whatever will have a lot of news on whatever railway project is going on    otherwise the orr has you covered with this    info on hs2 is also here  
  good luck  most tourist lines rely on the volunteers to keep overheads down      beautiful  might give them a ring and lend them a hand      yeah i think its the summer months/tourist season that it runs but if you get there soon you might be in luck
  good luck  most tourist lines rely on the volunteers to keep overheads down  yeah ive noticed theres a rail bus and boat company in the southwest the miniature railway from the railway series and one other ive found so far    not being coy about where ive looked its just been a few months putting in my resume at the west coast wilderness railway in tasmania next week if any of you are interested applications for the season close on the 14th
  whats up for electrification that hasnt already started
what ranger/rover ticket should i buy /n/    
how would you fix british rail /n/ given we have such expensive tickets and poor service compared to the rest of europe what is the solution nationalisation privatisation of everything including network rail
  1 nationalise/ leave bidding only to uk organisations no subsidising db sncf  ns  2 expand the loading gauge on highcapacity commuter/container routes  3 reopen profitable closed routes like the varsity line   4 encourage businesses with long distance freight needs to go with rail  5 increase freight speeds to 70mph   6 more electrification especially on intensively used sections  7 replace 3rd rail routes outside tfl control with 25kv ohle
  just disband network rail altogether and hand down maintenance responsibilities down to individual tocs instead  thatll remove their only scapegoat for shitty service
  look at northern ireland railways and consider how that functions and is profitable while being publically owned with reasonable fares  my 3 step plan would be as follows  1 nationalise all local and commuter services bringing them under the control of regional transport authorities think of tfl structure but with birmingham manchester newcastle etc along with nationalising other transport in those areas bringing about integrated bus rail tram and metro services in these regions  2 impose standardised fare systems for all long distance rail but permit virgin trains first capital connect gwr and so on to continue operating until their contracts end after which absorbing those franchises into publically owned franchises  3 revisiting of hs2 with extentions beyond birmingham to manchester leeds and glasgow funding and construction of hs3 replacing the transpenine railway upgrading the ecml and wcml to higher speed operations investigate hs4 for a glasgowedinburgh line as well as additional hsx lines for other major regions/cities    network rail is fine privitising the infrastructure will only make things worse for tocs since then the franchises will just monopolise the lines and they could introduce issues like incompatible rail systems  last point an alternative to nationalising local/commuter rail could be the introduction of transport authorities like in germany all transport is integrated within these areas regardless if they are publically or privately owned
  last point an alternative to nationalising local/commuter rail could be the introduction of transport authorities like in germany all transport is integrated within these areas regardless if they are publically or privately owned    we already have ptes like travel south yorkshire and west yorkshire metro that integrate transport in their respective areas to a certain extent
  how the fuck would that worked with track shared between tocs   wed end up with tocs being dicked like amtrack in america
  upgrading the ecml and wcml to higher speed operations  because that hasnt been tried before has it
what do we think about the eternal ecml problem lads will it ever work  personally i think that because of the open access arrangements the franchise on that line will never work
  i havent been aware of such transport authorities in yorkshire as im not from that part of the uk but in essence the idea of german style transport authorities is that transport becomes far more integrated into each other and that there is no area that isnt covered by one  the intention is however to seek full integration whereby there are tariff zones not unlike tfls zones and you can get tickets which can cover your journey though those zones regardless of the mode of transport whether its by bus tram mrt commuter/regional rail or something else like a ferry if its relevant to the location    its been tried in limited scopes because shutting down the ecml or the wcml for weeks if not months on end would cause delays both those mainlines need to have their tracks replaced with newer track certified for higher speeds  the problem with that is that both mainlines can only be reasonably shut for such work after hs2 opens when there is enough capacity available to take over from the lack of service on a mainline  both mainlines need extensive work to bring them up to a decent upgraded speed something like 200km/h compared to hs1s 300km/h hs2s 400km/h and the limit on most of network rail of about 100km/h or 60mph now the wcml only permits pendolinos to go to 200km/h its about 170 km/h for normal nontilting trains  speeding up to about 250km/h with sections maybe as fast as 300km/h would need extensive work the kind of work that would not have been possible with no alternative rail links
  something like 200km/h  both lines already run at this speed   stopping commuter trains dont need to run at 125mph  hs2 is the answer to upgrading line speeds why would you even consider spending billions to do something which is impossible as the south wcml is bendy as fuck  saged
rival rail firms should run trains on the same lines say mps    
  sees trains  no competition  poor service  thinks of airlines  just let train companies compete with each other on the same line  brought to you by the tory party
  fuck the tories theyve cunted electrification for years to come
several years ago the lbr commenced work to build a replica of yeo a manning wardle locomotive that ran on the railway from 1898 until closure in 1935 this earlier project was put on hold until the construction of lyd at the ffestiniog railway was completed and operational    with our planning permissions in place now is the time to progress the construction of new locomotives for an extended lynton  barnstaple railway construction of both locomotive and railway will take approximately five years accordingly the 762 club is to construct not one but two manning wardle locomotives to run on the lb these will be yeo and exe  the company name manning wardle is now owned by the lbr trust consequently these two locomotives will be works numbers 2048 and 2049 they will not be replicas but simply new locomotives the design will be closely based on that of lyd with other various improvements over the original three locos built in the 19th century     
  why cant boomers run a country as well as they run a heritage railway
  why cant boomers run a country as well as they run a heritage railway
    it said it didnt send  honest
bump
  why wouldnt that reduce prices
  covering aesthetic metal structures with blocky plastic shit    why oh why
  train stations oughtnt be too nice people might start enjoying riding the trains and theyll stop buying cars
  because there isnt demand to support competition and aside from the odd londonx route not even the ecml makes money every single line is a natural monopoly
this was a thing
  hse
  theres got to be enough paths on each route for there to be any chance at competition   otherwise youre cramming more trains on congested routes
  reverse beeching  nationalise everything    literally just stop shareholders from forcing these things to run for profit    no i dont know anything about business or economics
  one thing i would say the beeching got wrong was marshalling yards  containerisation was the way forward wagonload freight and the shunting it entails is inefficient lorries can do small loads over short distances far better  another mistake that was made was the closure and selling the land of the gcr mainline between sheffield and london it couldve been a very good freight line for high speed container trains and ease the pressure off the midland mainline  the woodhead route was beautiful but there were routes that had far shallower gradients through he pennines
  i think one of the biggest mistakes in general was selling the land under any doubletrack lines ill agree that plenty of rural branches while its a shame probably wont have a situation where they can profit for at least another fifty years if ever but more main lines shouldve been mothballed
  selling a railroad line or converting it to a trail in this day and age is essentially gaurenteeing a train will never run it again too much red tape too much cost and too many suehappy nimbys for new rail to be put down anymore
  they should have mothballed the lot its not like thin strips of land are in high demand
  the rapid track lifting and subsequent destruction of the trackbed  structures was deliberate and politically motivated woodhead is a great example of this still happening right into the 80s there was no reason it couldnt have been operated with diesels as the cheap option but thatcher wanted the route for yet another motorway that was then subsequently not built
  high speed container trains  come on lad  you were doing so well
  did you say (((beeching)))
  no way he cant be
  he isnt a jew
    i used to be a contract archaeologist later moving to a field supervisor     left just before the whole hs2 thing kicked off in a fairly dead period of work in late 2016     let me know if you want any protipz
  yes please     wondering if i should do geophysics because it would allow me to get some coin working in the minerals sector in the next upswing but it does seem a bit like having an interest in architecture and deciding to do surveying im guessing working at a smaller firm would give me a broader experience but is there much room for small companies in the sector
    the way he acted under the supervision of ernest marples one of the most corrupt politicians to have ever disgraced parliament it wouldnt surprise me    
have you watch old railway walks on channel 5    comfy show
  take the caledonian sleeper from london to inverness

if britain wasnt such a cucked orwellian shithole id move there for/after university just for the kino trains
why are the euros so obsessed with splitting the company that does track maintenance from the company that runs the trains    part of the reason amtrak sucks so much is because it doesnt own its own tracks on most of the routes it runs on the ones it does its service tends to be much better
  why are the euros so obsessed with splitting the company that does track maintenance from the company that runs the trains  its eu law
  because the ownership of the tracks and related infrastructure can be kept nationalised while the train companies are privatised much like how roads are publically owned and buses and road freight are privately owned    this can be seen in a number of cases such as in great britain where network rail is a nationalised organisation which keeps the infrastructure in public ownership or sncf réseau which was created to become the organisation to own and maintain the tracks and related infrastructure while france breaks up the current sncf structures similarly db netz owns the rail infrastructure in germany and maintains it for use for other rail operators which are mostly other db subsidaries such as db fernvehrkehr and db regio    the main difference between what europe does and what the us does is that while european rail remains in public ownership its private freight companies in the us which own their own track and when forced to let amtrak on their rails they only barely comply    network rail sncf réseau and db netz all remain in the ownership of the state though as public infrastructure to be used in the public interest that being primarily for public transport and secondarily for the transport of rail freight    csx up bnsf or whoever else operates their own track infrastructure for their own business as soon as someone else comes in wanting to use their tracks they push back as it means they lose capacity they could theoretically be using for their own trains    think of the likes of the european railways as open platforms which allow anyone to operate on them and the us railroads as proprietary platforms which only allow themselves to operate on them eu rail is like linux us rail is like apple/mac
  because the ownership of the tracks and related infrastructure can be kept nationalised while the train companies are privatised much like how roads are publically owned and buses and road freight are privately owned  that wasnt the original british plan though they had to renationalise infrastructure because railtrack was a fucking disaster
  thats not what the question i was responding to was
how have we got to the stage where the most powerful freight loco in the country is a monstrosity built by some us company who scaled down a us freight engine to uk loading gauge and put a front and back on it
  yeah complain about network rail as much as you like but its 10x better than the abomination that was railtrack
  arent basically all modern diesel freight locomotives made by americans nowdays its not like they lack experience with the design    european railways buy american freight locomotives for the same reason american passenger railways buy european locomotives they know how to make them better    hell freightliner is actually owned by the genesee  wyoming railroad and ill give you three guesses what country theyre from
  what about the diesel version of the siemens vectron plus theres the bombardier traxx which can come in a diesel version as well  now i get that these are locomotives primarily in use in central europe but the siemens vectron has had a us varient made of it being the siemens charger
  yeah but i mean the design of the class 70 in particular is appalling theyve tried to do that thing walkway thing yank trains and its like they only realised what the uk gauge was halfway through making it
  theyve tried to do that thing walkway thing yank trains have
  they can probably save on maintenance costs though by using shared parts
  no freight company uses the siemens charger only passenger ones
  japan is doing that for reason of financial sustainability i think
decide to take earlier train to work  pacer rocks up to the platform
  not getting to work on time  vs  having to ride a pacer every morning  there is only one correct choice
if you want to lament what once was start here      transitioning from historic railwaysmodern railway to modern railways is very jarring
  to further explain this eu law insists on no monopolies
  thats not completely ture though i will say that eu law basically states that monopolies cant be allowed to keep their status or if such a monopoly exists it be a nationalised  this basically permits a number of thinks like mail and whatever in public hands if they operate in the public interest that said in most places even if the monopoly is state owned seemingly that state isnt allowed to stop other private companies from competing    its complicated and theres a lot of arguments over what it should and shouldnt cover one of the big debates especially from diehard socialists in the uk was that continued eu membership would essentially force competition to exist in the uk which would threaten the existance of state owned monopolies  in reality the situation is more that the eu permits nationalised industries but basically forbits states from banning private industry in a certain sector    france for example is going through a splitup in its train system sncf réseau the rail infrastructure owners in france will continue to be a nationalised company regional trains in the form of the ter will remain as they are although i suspect franchising of regional lines like in germany may start and the tgv services are being rebranded as inoui in contrast to ouigo the budget tgv services this is to allow for openaccess operators to start up their own hsr services so long as they buy their own rolling stock thello already is an openaccess operator which serves a route from paris to venice as a sleeper train
  ive done the oban route attending a music festival the train was full and standing best to go offseason if you actually want to enjoy the train ride
  the tgv services are being rebranded as inoui  i cant believe theyre just throwing the tgv brand away    anyways vertical separation of railroads while wellintentioned is a dumb policy     to be fair the eus working on it they dropped the requirement for vertical seperation of railways in favor of simply requiring nondiscriminatory pricing towards openaccess operators its sort of like the common carrier status of american railroads except for the trains that run on them instead of the cargo they carry    theres also been some good progress within the countries with vertically separated railways in britain for example theres been moves towards more openaccess operators as the franchise system is increasingly seen as flawed and inadequate    the issue with vertical separation and why its increasingly on the downtrend is that the incentives of the track owner are different from the owner of the trains running on them the track owner wants to keep their maintenance costs as low as possible and to minimize the wear and tear caused by passing trains the train owner wants to move as much people or cargo possible with the least amount of expense there the conflict arises    the track owner has littletono incentive to expand or improve their network beyond what its already capable of thus theres very little impetus except political to expand overloaded lines by widening tunnels allowing higher axle loads or longer trains therefore a lot less expansion gets done than if the train owners owned the tracks    the train owners have every incentive to do the opposite since the fee is constant permileoftrack they have no reason to try and minimize their wear and tear on the tracks this is one of the reasons why the pacers still run despite their axle configuration  its not the companys problem if its 4wheel axle configuration constantly scrapes against the track
  not even slightly just fair tender which is easy to game    if youre a brexity type then bad news the wto have similar rules have fun
shit train
  what branch line does that run on never seen it from the mainline
  gas the tories  labour have been just as shit if not worse  they should both be gassed along with the rest of the crooks and liars
  sounds like fun this summer i went to the bluebell railway and got a chance to ride behind the 01
  as of january 2018 gwrs nine remaining class 153s will begin takingover services on the cornish branch lines releasing class 150/1s for cascade and class 150/2s for regional services
i have never been to britain but i have a british passport and love british trains    i mourn the death of rail freight in britain anyone know where i might find good videos before 1960 of freight trains
  uhh  rail freight is still big in britain it only died in ireland and even then there is still some rail freight to and from dublin port  its mostly container trains though there are some coal and other raw materials trains in britain plus all nuclear waste in britain is hauled by train    look up db schenker freightliner colas and a few others rail freight might not be as huge as it used to be but rail freight in europe as a whole is nothing like rail freight in north america or australia hell in north america there are whole states which have no passenger rail at all only freight its disgraceful
  i have never been to britain  love british trains    checks out everyone here hates them for being overpriced and crap service
lads does anyone know what happened to the traction motors on class 465s    they used to sound like this glorious      but now they sound like this  
rhdr anyone
  yeah im aware that freight is still in use im just comparing it to north america where everything is freight i find the whole premotorway transport system pretty fascinating    also class 66 is based
  what an upgrade
  also on a trip to ireland i saw a zinc ore train going from the tara mines to dublin port while waiting for the dart and i wish i had gotten a shot of it
  its cute
  there are basically only a few freight lines mostly just serving dublin port for stuff like that and some container trains that only operates on the iarnród éireann network  there is absolutely no freight anymore on the northern ireland railways the last freight service to run to northern ireland used to be the guinness trains which hauled kegs north for distribution to pubs across northern ireland that ended when road transport and distribution of the beer could be done much cheaper  i think that ended sometime around the 1970s
  ive read all about it already sad to see it happen but at least some still exists i guess    i did a cool hobby thing a bit back where i would go on gmaps satellite view and find old embankments lines and stations in ireland just based on visual cues using this map  
    they had armoured trains in ww2
  thats right this locomotive called hercules was armored to be used to pull the armored train    the military took over the line during the war
  kek
  i fucking love you lad i used to ride those trains all the time as a kid stopped for about 8 years and then when i came back on one found the second video that you linked    i found out that the answer is the engines were switched in a load of them in 2009 but for reasons completely beyond me theres still a few knocking around that still sound like your first video    the old class 465s are my favourite train of all time
i wonder how the beachy head project is going on
this piece of shit is a reminder of how 80s british rail was
  arent 153s/155s basically just pacers as well
  they were made by leyland but not to a bus body design so no
  no they were only supposed to be temporary but then br was privatised
post freight please
cool irl hogwarts express
  is that 3837 in that photo
  wrong viaduct and wrong loco i did see olton hall when it was at the nrm years ago though
  do bankers count
i happen to see the belmond british pullman yesterday although it was hauled by class 67s instead of a merchant navy
  of course my friend
    wooden bikes seem to be even lighter and a smoother ride than carbon fiber should i get a woode/n/ bike
  wood has a problem it flexes and cracks
  every material flexes and cracks as long as you dont surpass the yield strength it shouldnt crack
  yes but im not sure if it is as strong as steel
thats pretty cool i wasnt aware there were hollow wooden tubes bikes only solid ones still seems like an immense effort to tweak and engineer around such material just to say you can make a decent bike out of it
  yea i guess thats the appeal for me
  depends on the steel but yea youre probably right
    that just means you need more material in certain places though and considering the weight difference this shouldnt matter
  aluminium isnt as strong as steel either yet its pretty popular
bike thief just cuts the frame instead of the lock  you just want to impale your groin when it snaps
  bamboo is better than wood
  falls over a rock/slips on ice/whatever  frame breaks in half
          i personally would worry about the longterm durability especially since wood expands and contracts a lot more than either steel or aluminium dont know about carbon fiber cant be bothered to look it up sry
  in what way
  youre right they address that in the article by saying that expansion is proportional to thickness it only occurs across the grain and they engineer the frame around that property of expansion
  theres a reason they use it for construction scaffolding
laminated wood is flexible and can take high amount of stress so doesnt seem entirely dumb idea  arificially improved densified wood is even stronger than steel and 6 times lighter    
just make sure the brakes arent made of wood and youre good to go
  presumably yes
your preferred mode of transport  your political views
  economic left and right are meaningless terms
fuck everyone government is overrated
im as far left as they get and im all bike everyday so this is completely incorrect
  if you were far left you would be against private ownership of bikes at all trains and buses for everyone regardless of class
  dont forget toothbrushes comrade
  fascists claim to fame is they make the trains run on time  they get a car
im a centrist and prefer walking
  national socialism is still socialism anon
  train  mid auth right
  light rapid transit and im a social liberal which means that im closely aligned with the social democrats but im focus more on social issues rather than economic ones
left anarchist biking  bus
right  trains and car
  what a shitty thread
  trains are authoritarian left  trams are libertarian left  wut  theyre different tools for the same job public transportation systems comprising different networks
  they never actually made the trains run on time its a myth
  because we all know the netherlands is very libertarian rightwing and the trams of the eastern bloc came about from libertarian left policy not authoritarian at all
  i use public bike systems smarty pants
radical center    best mode for the trip
  i get that no one makes that type of meme for /n/ so its supposed to be somewhat funny but this is just downright normie tier trash
  not knowing the difference between private property and personal property  not understanding marxism is all for access of all to personal goods by ways of seizing the means of production  you must be a monarchist since youre so pleb
  its not entirely a myth they slackened the schedules a lot so the trains didnt run late so much
  theyre far from meaningless terms   economic left favours government redistribution of wealth economic right opposes it  economic left thinks the government can make a positive contribution to wealth creation economic right thinks the best thing the government can do is get out of the way
  reminder that intermodal transport is basically the /n/ version of genderfluidity
  there is no difference between private and personal property retard
  economic left favours government redistribution of wealth economic right opposes it  economic left thinks the government can make a positive contribution to wealth creation economic right thinks the best thing the government can do is get out of the way    inb4 ancaps think property rights magically exist in anarchy   explain leftist anarchists
  no government no heirarchys no money  to say theyre left is somewhat inaccurate communists are just antieconomics altogether
  youre just confirming your ignorance on the theme and trying to be right at the same time  jesus dude youre one of those tryhard retards that are proud of their stupidity  ill simplify this for you to the max since youre a proud brainlet personal property is what you have and use for your needs like your bike for getting around or your notebook for shitposting  private property is the means of production which produces value like an industry a petrol platform or the machinery involved in the process and all of its structure  go read a book for fucks sake before trying to look smart for anonymous people over the internet

  that pic  it will never happen again  thank you stalin
i knew it i knew i loved trams purely because im a smart leftist not growing up and loving toby the tram because im not a nazi in denial
  your preferred mode of transport  depends verry much on where i want to go and if im in a hurry  usually biketrain sometimes car and sometimes my motorcycle  i often combine multiple modes of transport  your political views  it is a little complicated im a enviromentalist nationalist oppose wellfare in favor of workfare programms want taxfunded rail infrastructure flat tax stable currency 100 capital reserves in banking otherwise relatively free market free speech and gun ownership
  
  i could use my bike to work as a messenger or delivery rider and my computer to code create cadmodels or simply mine crypto  would it still be considered personal property then
  why  that would basicly mean if i cant walk to the trainstation i should take the car instead take 30 different bus lines or ride 70 km  every form of transport has up and downsides if combined properly you often get a combination that is more efficient than each option in its own
  yes you massive cocksucking fucktard  its unbelieavable you cannot discern between your bike used for working as a messenger from microsofts industrial complex  you are not the owner of the means of production for riding a bike delivering newspapers  do you know who that person is the owner of the newspapers  but anyway im not your personal teacher go inform yourself from books written by reliable authors who write about marx and im not even saying you should read authors who are in his favour or even marx himself if you want to express your opinions on his theory  because if you want to say something about this subject the least you could do is get informed instead of disseminating shit brought straight out of your ass  and jesus christ you must be merrican ffs
  how is the bike of a messenger or the computer of an engineer/programmer not a produktionsmittel  by the way im german
  he thinks people in the real world use their computers to do all of that
  what is home office
i like cars as tech objects but find them awful for mass transport i also cycle to work as much as possible and value the physical exercise of cycling alongside its smug moral superiority as long as its still a transport outlier last time i took these tests i was slightly libertarian and slightly economically left
  man im not being arrogant or anything but marx is extremely complex and his concepts are not something i can explain in an anonymous board in a few lines  you have the opportunity of reading das kapital in its original language make good use of that  i see youre genuinely interested and youll probably like it if you read it  but its not and easy reading and i recommend you first read marxist authors instead of going straight to marx  anyway there are a few concepts which are not simple but lets go  there is this difference i explained about personal property and private property  then there is the alienation of the work i dont know if this is the right translation to english i didnt read it in english but lets go which is basically about dissociating the personal aspect of your work from what you produce  that means we do not perceive traits of the work thats been put into the product which produces the commodity fetishism which is like perceiving the object in and of itself as if it was given without having work force put into its production  so if you die in the manufacturing process youll be replaced because youre just another gear in the machinery and the products you make have value from your work effort thats dissociated from you  the product has no traits specific to you  fucking hell this is hard to explain and its probably confusing for those reading  so if you use your bike to deliver newspapers youre not the owner of the means of production youre just the average proletarian  even if you own a small bookstore that sells newspapers youre not the bourgeoise  because its absolutely replaceable and does not add value to that commodity or product  eventhough you earn money from that its way different from the owner of the newspaper factory  i dont think i made it clear and its way too hard but look after concepts such as commodity fetishism value from a marxist perspective theory of alienation  cont
  id say obnoxiously loud motorcycles or just motorcycles in general    id put cars in lawful evil theyre far too conformist to be chaotic anything
  delivery ads no value
    try reading respectable authors like domênico losurdo istván mészáros and so on  gramsci too but hes a bit more complicated  anyway dont get informed from wikipedia articles and youtube videos unless theyre serious and do not distort marxs concepts because oversimplification will only make you more confused  those are not simple concepts but they sure are worth taking a look at seriously  then again its hard to explain it in an anonymous board but you can learn it from lots of reliable sources and youll probably like it  go to the nearest university and ask a sociology teacher about these concepts it might be a good experience
  not understanding value as a marxist concept and reading it as a simple keynesian economic term for currency  cmon youre not even trying
  the main issue with the differnce in private and personal property is that there is no clear difference  for example  tools are the means of production for all kinds of mechanics and other workers but also common as personal property to fix your own stuff  where do you draw the line  the adjustable wrench   the cordless drill  the industrial grade cordless drill  the drillpress  the lathe  the cncmill  the entire workshop including all of the above
  im not seeing it as worth in therms of currency but the value is different  for example a delivered newspaper/pizza/letter has a higher value than one that you have to go and get yourself
  the main issue is that youre not open to actually learning it  its not about some intrinsic property of those goods  its about the material conditions in addition to their symbolic attributions    being delivered adds value since youre putting your workforce into something thatll be sold to the consumer as an attribution  i wrote it in a retarded way sorry  what i meant to say is that if you deliver it or if i deliver it it doesnt matter  the delivery itself adds value to the product but you dont it doesnt get more value just because you did it does it make sense  were replaceable
radican centrism  pr
strasserist   heavy rail purist
  then give me a clear definition that seperates personal property and means of production    well pretty much everyones work is replaceable but that has nothing to do with the economic system  a delivery driver only delivers stuff what should he make different than that
  so if you die in the manufacturing process youll be replaced because youre just another gear in the machinery and the products you make have value from your work effort thats dissociated from you  the product has no traits specific to you    tell that to a corporate ceo that wants to fire his head software engineer or pay him less but has no option because he built his systems and is a vital part to the company    or tell that to my friend that sits at home and makes his own video games that he sells on steam and gets 90k a year for it     or tell that to my bitcoins you fucking coping cuck biatch     marx would be ancap today no more do you need a factory or a farm to produce shit all you need is some bitcoin miners and a 3d printer and your fucking means of production that you are fucking starinto right now the most powerful in history and the thing that capitalism made dirt cheap the komputer     the universe is ownership based because there are whole matrix universes on computers that aliens own because they have the password 
  libertarian socialist  everything in walking distance  carpool or taxi for mid distance  lrt or brt for longer distances  shinkansen for everything further
    umm sweety castle doctrine we are capable of defending our own property and making property agreements or treaties its alsio beneficial for nieghbors to protect eachothers proiperty for mutual protection for example and you can hire security
  libertarian   socialist  pick 1 fgt     how can you prevent people from making agreements not to fuck up eachothers shit property agreements how can you have freedom when you take away individual liberties     i think you are like alex jones and just a limmited hangout shill to subvert the anarcho capitalist bitcoin community im telling biz about you
  the main issue with the differnce in private and personal property is that there is no clear difference  i might not get something but everything is private or personal property as long as you bought it or made it or stol found it
  lol  i might ask you the same question how can you have freedom in an economic system that denies the vast majority of people actual say in the concrete issues that define their lives you dont think that there can be property rights in a libsoc society i certainly dont believe that and no resonable socialist would either i would wager
  then give me a clear definition that seperates personal property and means of production  fuck off youre asking me to resume a major concept from one of the most complex books of its century in a few lines because your lazy ass wont try to learn anything more than an article on wikipedia  go read mészáros losurdo for fucks sake you can even go watch some žižek video on youtube but dont come and say theres no clear definition just because youre too lazy to go get informed
  because you dont get to just form a mobo and enforce what you think shoudl be fair    rights are not entitlement you are not entitled to free healthcare you are free to not have to take care of someone if they demand it though
  you might as well call them economic apple and economic orange for all the sense using terms left and right does
  socialism is just too complicated to explain thats why i get to be a hypocrite    meanwhile freedom is beautiful elegant free of self contradiction and not a convoluted fantasy of wishful thinking and feminist aesthetics    shall     not     be     infringed      nap  a  p    no violence except immediate self defense     you dont get to claim that youre not consenting to not owning the entire world however its ethical to want consent from people if they are to support a social safety net for example instead of brutally extorted people like a bunch of immature 2 years that just want want want    marxism is just excuse after excuse after excuse after strawman after strawman after strawman     marx even took pride in admitting leftism is literally terrorism
national socialism
  freedom  not a convoluted fantasy of wishful thinking  lol
yedhtreshtesdtredh
  this is what a cuck actually thinks     how does it feel knowing that no matter what your larp government and stupid piece of paper says that i will be free and ill do whatever the fuck i want when i want people all over the world are subverting authoritarianism en masse i bet that really pisses off a bootlicker like you doesnt it     just like borris i am invinciable
  if you want to implement such a system the answer to what one is allowed to own should be clearly defined
  im too stupid to actually read a fucking book and i get my information from internet images with sourceless quotes and use it as a valid argument while accusing other people of appealing to phalacies  shit youre dense  i briefly explained key concepts of the marxist theory in an introdutory way just so it makes a bit of sense and recommended authors to read and understand it in its entirety so that you can go after it and get informed properly  but you prefer to reeeee and say it doesnt make sense just because you dont know absolutely nothing on the subject but try to pretend youre some kind of expert in marxist studies  again fuck off go read and dont come and post random phrases in a black background with a picture of someone and pretend its some kind of legitimate argument
  28800 people dying per day every fucking day in the beautiful capitalist world  more than 2 billion people in subhuman conditions  yeah capitalism is great indeed
  i will be free and ill do whatever the fuck i want when i want  true enough i guess even a prisoner is free who never desires to step outside their cell
  and yet this is also true because capitalism
  if i define liberty as being the opposite of socialism socialism is incompatible with liberty  imagine reasoning like this and actually thinking its a great argument

  there are whole universes on computers so that means our reality is inherently ownership based and there are aliens that because they have a password get to control their matrix world     ownership is a natural right when we lived in huts you had the right to defend your hut socialshits want the fruits of your labor except you have no way out with capitalism you can buy the greatest means of production ever invented the one you are reading this with computer for about 20 bucks used millions of people support themselves working online and get to be their own boss meanwhile you want to be controlled by another man with absolutely no way out except the black market and crime how gay are you       projection much neet i have a taste in the finer things things that no one can take away from me 
the defining factor of property being personal rather than private is occupancy and use     if you occupy or use something frequently and youre the only person or group doing so you own it nobody has the right to take the thing away     if you are however one of many people occupying and using a thing such as a factory a train line a public park then matters are more complicated and there are a bunch of different suggestions on how to manage such collective property/common good/whatever you wanna call it     the line is of course very blurry it may be normal for a single person to own a car in one society while it may be normal for a car to be shared among everybody in another basically the fine demarcation line between private and personal is up to social consensus       ownership is a natural right when we lived in huts you had the right to defend your hut  anecdotal evidence no evidence and naturalistic fallacy huts were built cooperatively and used by several people in most ancient societies   socialshits want the fruits of your labor except you have no way out  in capitalism the boss gets the fruit of your labor and you have no way out except to another capitalist who also gets your labor   with capitalism you can buy the greatest means of production ever invented the one you are reading this with computer for about 20 bucks used  correlation is not causation communist countries had computers most of the development of the computer was done in statefunded staterun companies in the us and elsewhere if anything capitalism is an impediment to the development of digital technology through planned obsolescence marketing and the profit motive   millions of people support themselves working online and get to be their own boss   if you wanna believe clickbait ad animations sure   meanwhile you want to be controlled by another man   you mean like your boss under capitalism            ultra based
  did you write it off as a business expense on your tax forms the same arbitrary distinctions exist in capitalism too
  leftists btfo
  you do realize socialism has gulags for people that refuse to work the welfare state was invented by monarchists not socialists       this is your city on anarchy
  why dont you just educate him on mutualism or syndicalism and watch him try to claim its actually ancapism
  honestly cant be assed
  car followed closely by train   libertarian
  libertarian  lol youre a social liberal
  conservative train
size of government from left to right    totalitarian  communist  socialist  liberal  moderate  conservative  libertarian  anarchist
  size of private property rights from left to right    libertarian  conservative  liberal  socialist  communist  totalitarian  anarchist
  thats not what left and right mean at all you absolute fucking moron government intervention is on the updown spectrum not the leftright spectrum leftright is socialist/capitalist i bet you dont even know what those words mean fucking dumbass fuck
  socialism has fuck nothing to do with size of government  true communism is no government  liberal means the same thing as libertarian modern liberals are not liberal  conservative is subjective to the country and era  you are an absolute fucking moron and dont know anything what so fucking ever about politics dumbfuck
i made an anarchist commune on nationstates and created a gigantic fantasy transport map for it on scribblemaps dare me to post it im afraid its too autistic even for /n/
  explain leftist anarchists  those are just called anarchists the anarchist capitalist meme is a very modern convention and hardly exists outside online neckbeard political debates
  technically the blimptrain should be on the z plane but centercenter works
  i dare you to share your autism with us dont worry some of us wont judge you much for it
  cmon thats great ive been obsessed with transport maps ever since i was a kid please post
  ancap
    i made something
  true communism    the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over expecting different results
  you cannot stop people from making property agreements ie i wont fuck wit ur shit if u don fuck wit mine m9 without a monopoly of violence     ancap has the violent power decentralized and distributed and we know it can work because humans act in their own self interest meanwhile commies somehow think that individuals are going to willingly yah fukkin right sacrifice their own self interests for the borg (((collective))) ie magine your whole village is starving and you have to send 99 percent of the grain you are farming to moscow basically holodomor         foh
  the line is of course very blurry    i agree that there isnt one natural definition of constitutes too much property but we can take for example planets if elon musk claimed mars as his property that could cause conflict right now but in the future it might be possible for people to all own their own planets across the galaxy     but when it really comes down to it being able to defend your property is the pragmatic thin red line and with nuclear weapons we have can all have enormous power and then it becomes prudent to negotiate property treaties with one another and in the future weapons are surely going to be even more deadly     also the universe is inherently ownership based because passwords can denote ownership and control of a computer system and it is likely that there are whole universe matrix like worlds simulated on computer systems possibly by aliens this means it is all our natural right to be our own deighty of a computer system or universe     huts were built cooperatively and used by several people in most ancient societies     only in cuck societies the hut builder would usually be the one who decides who gets to live there just like you have families sharing houses     in capitalism the boss gets the fruit of your labor    yeah but he had to invest and risk what he and his family had worked for while all you have to do is show up and work the boss is providing you with something and you have to consensually decide to work there and you have the oppertunity of shopping around for better work when the state owns your ass you have no other option except to be a criminal and face gulag sentences or execution and the commies created the russian mob and chinese triads the most powerful mafias on the planet because of communism    communist countries had computers    and only elites had access to them and 10 year waiting list meanwhile homeless people ahve computers and cellphones now thanks capitalism
  planned obsolescence marketing and the profit motive     hahaha windows/apple kek detected obviously you are too stupid to ever have used linux linux is the greatest operating system and open source decentralized distributed created platform the world has ever seen along with bitcoin itself this was created because of freedom and linus torvalds wanting to build something that people could own and use in their own homes on their own hardware     linus torvalds specifically invented git the content management system so he could work from fucking home in his fucking underpants    what kind of communal authoritarian system would ever fucking let people work from home in the their fucking underpants according to the fucking schedule that they want    what if you are the kind of person that cannot adapt to schedules and bosses and communism    what if you are the kind of person that can only work for yourself because right now if you are that kind of person you have every opportunity to study and learn how to make money online without having to fucking leave your apartment the opportunity which you are squandering    you could be fucking drawing furry porn and getting people to pay for your expenses on fucking patreon there is limitless demand for digital warez you could program robots to harvest natural resources without anyone lifting a fucking finger besides the ones they type with    if you wanna believe clickbait ad animations sure     i live it you mother fucker ever heard of cryptocurrency you kek piece of communist waste crypto currency has given people more economic freedom than anything else in the last decade you faggot and because of that we are able to trade and transact freely and no communist larping faggot can take that away from us    you mean like your boss under capitalism      you can find another boss some bosses are chill meanwhile you have no fucking choice with the state
  how come communists never were able to produce decent toilet paper have you ever met someone from the ussr they had to use that brown untreated pulp cardboard paper that they had in socialist public schools on their pink assholes and the plumbing couldnt handle it so they had to throw it in the garbage next to the potty imagine wiping your ass with cardboard and having to throw it in the trash can next to the toilet filled with other peoples shitty cardboard paper thanks communism     fuck you cuck
  you do realize socialism has gulags for people that refuse to work    abnahahahhahahahhaha hbwahhahahahahaha hbabhawhwahhahahaha breaths in bwahahahahahhahahahaha    proof that leftists are a bunch of violent masochistic cucksss    wow you are like bernie saying bread lines are a good thing    gulags are greats reeeeee    putting non violent offenders into prisons is ethically wrong you fucking nazi fuckstick fucktard piece of shit     those people didnt get a fucking choice where they want to fuckin work the point of the cartoon is that most leftists just want free shit or they have some imaginary fantasy that all the jobs are going to be easy but the fucking truth is that if you dont succeed at the gay tests they have for you then you will be diggging ditches or scrubbing toilets it even outlined this system in the gulag archipeligo and here you are fucking defending it    imagine being sucha neet and such a resentful wage slave that you actually fantasize about having the privelage of being forced to work in hellish conditions under threat of being sent to the fucking gulag absolutely fucking pathetic and you are fucking reading this on the most powerful means of production the world has know the komputer which glorious capitalism has made cheap and abundant for you and you could be part of the intelligentsia but you are too worthess to even fucking try and you coiuld even have bought crypto currency but you are stubbornly forcing yourslef to be part of the lowest class of humans instead of trying to take any oppertunity that is being offered to you over and over again you area worthless pathetic nazi commie pussy piece of shit that has to be forced to do anyting productive just like a fucking child
  how can you have freedom in an economic system that denies the vast majority of people actual say in the concrete issues that define their lives      you have the power to affect your own destiny if you are upset with the dollar or the banks you can store your value in other means like bitcoin gold or land you are just too fucking conditioned and indoctrinated to do anything about the miserably situation you are in and have convinced yourself there is no point in trying because that relieves you of the personal responsibility to try and maybe fail you are a pussy you are ed norton in the movie fight club     also you have no entitlement when it comes to controlling other people and their property even if that indirectly affects you corporations dont directly affect you without a violent centralized state your relationship with a corporation is consensual unless you are a communist that wnats to give more power to government which mean the people bribing them get more power    you have every fucking opportunity to take control of your own life but you just fantasize about communism as a way to excuse your own cowardice and sloth     look how easy it is to get money right now you can easily get a business loan or a fucking crowd funding platform you could even use this to start your own coop or commune based on voluntarism but no you are a pussy and you just want violence anyways     video called how to get the fucking money        if you cant cover a couple percent interest rate you are so fucking worthless and your ancestors would have killed to get an opportunity like you and you have a fucking means of production at your finger tips which you are reading this on     talk about biting the mouth that feeds jesus
wtf is happening here it is not g so dont discuss gnu mas linux here

property rights are violence    so if you build a space station are you not allowed to control it
  i dont really get how trains and trams are all that different in this situation both are just as public  but anyway somewhere between public transport and having a bike cars should only be available for renting/as a service desu
  how are you going to keep others from it without violence
  lasers
  actually the life support systems only will turn on with a password and self defense does not violate the nap     if the lord of flies decides we want your hut and we take it thats ok  if you defend your own hut that you built out of bamboo then you are a violent criminal insect fit for the gulag     holy fucking shit leftists use fucking circular fucking logic its so fucking irritating     reee property is violence   reee we throw anyone that engages in ownership of property in a gulag because we are compassionate and socialism is just sharing   how are you going to defend your property without violence   how are you going to defend your butthole from raep without violence   if you do not let the niggers fuck you in the butt that is violence and you must get in the gulag
  reeee no one offered me a milloin dollars so that means millionaires are violence reeee  if you dont let nigger fuck you in the ass you are being violent reeee
man youre completely delusional if you believe youre gonna get legitimate goodfaith responses arguing against your shitposts but thats not what youre here for anyway is it youre here to wave your wrinkly black and yellow rattlesnake penis around     so anyway if you build yourself a space station that is just big enough for yourself to live in and you spend most of your time on it fine keep it nobody wants to take your orbital appartment away     but lets say you build it you never move in and it just floats there while there is a severe shortage of living space in space then the person who hacks your life support password and allows the station to be used as by people again is a hero     again consider the difference between personal and private property claiming that all property is private property just because personal property is also private property is an excellent example of circular logic do not make the mistake of conflating the opinions of anarchists and tankies there are no gulags in libertarian socialism
an absolute beginner to bikes and new to /n/ in general for reference im 22 and only just learned how to ride a bike  i posted this question a few times on the question generals but each time i get very few replies with different opinions so id like to make a thread to see if i can get a clearer consensus  i want to buy a bike for commuting specifically longer commutes 3050 minutes and i was going around checking stores around my area  ive found a tiny store run by a very nice helpful old man that sells bikes for 3/5 of the price of a similar bike in the big chains the specific bike in question is equivalent to 335  to my untrained eye it looked good 275 wheels front suspension hard tail mtb disc breaks 3x8i think shimano gears all that good shit  but the catch is i absolutely cant locate the brand online not in my native language not on english and not in chinese websites like aliexpress it says active and limited on the tubes but those are just buzzwords probably  here are my questions  1 can no name bikes be considered or should they be disregarded immediately  2 assuming i live in a first world country can i trust bike parts to be what the seller claims them to be how big is the risk for counterfeit parts carrying a big brands name  3 what do i risk by getting bikes not from a familiar brand i expect them to not be as good but just how much worse are we talking here  4 how worried should i be about dangerous faults like the breaks straight up not working or the frame snapping i weight 80kg so within a reasonable weight  5 if i get that bike and find a specific part not to my liking could i just change it relatively simply and is it a legit long term strategy to just say im a beginner and by no means an enthusiast so ill get a very cheap bike and replace parts as i improve or want more  6 what should i look for in a bike to determine its decent riding it to try it out isnt really acceptable here
also id like you to consider in your answer that you guys are most likely enthusiasts and im not so what you guys might think of as the minimum to be acceptable will not necessarily be proportional to what i want and need given my needs and abilities  thank you for reading my wall of text here and in the generals    pics obviously unrelated
  1 can no name bikes be considered or should they be disregarded immediately    i wouldnt buy one if you are looking for a cheap bike you would be better off getting a second hand bike in good condition this can be a little tricky if you dont know what to look for though    4 how worried should i be about dangerous faults like the breaks straight up not working or the frame snapping i weight 80kg so within a reasonable weight    depends how bad it is even shit department store bikes should at least not have the frame snap usually because the frame is 30kg of solid steel    5 if i get that bike and find a specific part not to my liking could i just change it relatively simply and is it a legit long term strategy to just say im a beginner and by no means an enthusiast so ill get a very cheap bike and replace parts as i improve or want more    you can upgrade parts fairly easily most of the time but its usually not as cost effective as just buying a better bike to begin with usually you buy a bike with the components you like and replace them when they wear out
branded entry level hardtail bikes arent usually any better so im sure that one will be as good as a branded 500 bike    check if it has hydraulic brakes theres really no reason to get an mtb without one its easy to see with your eyes if the brake levers are connected to the brakes with cables or hoses    the fork is very likely to be shit but it will be shit on any sub1000 branded bike as well    some parts can be upgraded but the mtb world moves very quickly when it comes to different part standards so you might not be able to find for example a new higher quality fork for a quickrelease wheel and a nontapered headtube     if youre getting the bike just for riding around an entry level mtb with a shit fork is good enough only if youre going to ride actual mtb on trails the upgrades would be justified
  op said they are just commuting they dont new hydraulic brakes although i love the ones on my road bike
  i thought about it but looking through sites i could only find ones that are either absolute garbage or too rich for my blood craigslist isnt a thing here so i didnt take /n/ up on their offer to look it up for me  even shit department store bikes should at least not have the frame snap usually because the frame is 30kg of solid steel  this one specifically was aluminum pretty light    when you say actual mtb on trails im assuming you mean proper off road ones with hills and rocks and shit right because i would like to do some light off roading gravel paths or the kind of tracks youd see on a farm but im of the impression any bike could do that regardless of if its a mtb
  ey its active anon again id say to post this on the bqg and bbg but i know youve done so in the past already anyways heres my answers  1 yes at least if you know how to inspect frame quality components arent as important as the welds on the frame itself parts can always be fixed tuned or upgraded but a cracked frame is a cracked frame  2 never take everything at completely face value even if counterfeit parts arent really an issue in the big world  3 you risk quality control and warranties on the frame and possibly proprietary parts a broken frame is a broken frame you can always replace parts  4 your brakes and tires is something you want to ensure is properly functioning yourself as well as spotting any cracked welds on the frame ive never had the misfortune of experiencing a frame snap but that shit could seriously mess you up for life especially if the frame snaps at the head tube  5 it is a legit long term strategy but realize a frames geometry is locked in once its created and geometry plays a huge factor in not only how the bike handles but also how comfortable you are on the bike plus a shitty heavy straight gauge gas pipe metal bike will always ride like a shitty heavy straight gauge gas pipe metal bike a frame might not exactly be a moving part but its the most important moving part nicer frames are reflexive and dynamic despite being a rigid structure  6 honestly theres a lot to look out for but without riding yourself you wouldnt know what features equals what youd think is a decent bike i know you claim riding it is not as option but you really want to ride before you buy
  when you say actual mtb on trails im assuming you mean proper off road ones with hills and rocks and shit right because i would like to do some light off roading gravel paths or the kind of tracks youd see on a farm but im of the impression any bike could do that regardless of if its a mtb    actual mountain bike trails are pretty wild with jumps drops and rocks just your regular gravel road can be done on pretty much any bike but road bikes wont have a whole lot of grip so be careful around corners at speed if you get a bike with slightly thicker tires than the ultra thin road tires you should go over little pebbles and stuff nicely
  yes at least if you know how to inspect frame quality  how would i go about doing that what do i look for just cracks and out of place welding signs
  dont buy a bike from anyone who wont let you ride it first
  so what you guys might think of as the minimum to be acceptable will not necessarily be proportional to what i want and need given my needs and abilities    so heres what youre going to do    1 buy a shitty bso made out of melted down beer can metal    2 ride it and it will be a piece of shit and it will cost a fortune to maintain    3 omg cycling sucks    why bother making this thread if youre just going to buy a bso anyway just stay on /o/ please
  alright how do i tell apart a bso from a real bike  im not just buying the first cheap thing i see with front suspensions i am specifically asking what i should look for to determine if its an irredeemable piece of shit or not  i dont know shit about bikes but plenty of people ride no name bikes worse than what i have my eye on daily and im sure i dont need anything more than a 500 bike to commute around 9  10km in each direction    id love to but as ive said its not really accepted in shops around here my only option to try out a bike would be buying second hand if theyd let me and as ive said i only found absolutely supermarket tier bikes and 2000 bikes
  500 is plenty if you buy used doable if new but just dont fall for the suspension meme bad suspension is worse than no suspension and 500 is bad suspension
  bad suspension is worse than no suspension  how  not being contrarian genuinely curious  if suspensions dont do their job they just sort of dont do anything dont they
  adds extra weight and shit that breaks slows you down structurally questionable as soon as it stops working poorly and starts not working at all makes you look like a noob who thinks it needs springs and off road tires to ride on paved roads gives you aids
  pretty much look for neat consistent welds you want the welds to look like stacked dimes keep an eye out for pitted welds with pinholes and stuff really cracks too but a proper shop owner should dispose an already cracked frame
    this but to put it even more simpler the up and down bobbing motion caused by the suspension is wasted energy that couldve been put into the pedals    really suspensions are shit unless youre spending 500 on a fork alone not the whole bike
  adds extra weight  fair enough even though the bike is pretty light from what ive tried ill accept its worse than it could have been  shit that breaks  thats actually something ive wondered what does happen if a suspension fork breaks and how would i test the suspensions on the bike on site what would i be looking for  makes you look like a noob  frankly i am  gives you aids  not nearly /n/ enough to fuck my bike    shits informative thanks anon    granted im no physicist but wouldnt the energy lost from the suspension be negligible for mediumish speeds
just buy the fucking bike its obvious you want to already
  sure i want to but im not entirely at peace with it  i dont know dick about bikes i dont know how bad bad can be i dont know whats standard or whats acceptable and i dont even know how my needs translate to those wants  i dont want to end up doing what  described
  when a bikes suspension goes either the seals will be blown and itll sit on/close to the bottom of its stroke leaving you with no suspension travel and dangerous handling geometry too easy to over the bars when you brake or bump something or if the seals are good but the dampers are bad the fork will infuriatingly bob endlessly even if the fork works fine now or a few years from now itll eventually require maintenance to prevent blowing its seals and becoming a death trap    granted im no physicist but wouldnt the energy lost from the suspension be negligible for mediumish speeds  neither am i but ive read a bike is somewhere on the order of a mechanical efficiency of 98 without considering the thermodynamic efficiency of the human digestive system now reduce that by any margin and itll be very obvious hell even going from a rigid fork to a very high quality air fork is a pretty night and day obvious difference thats why suspensions forks are mostly recommended for off road applications only and even then a rigid fork with a skillful rider could still easily out ride a noob on a hardtail mtb  a new and lubricated chain can have an efficiency of upwards of 985 percent      another thing that hasnt been mentioned yet is fork flex an inherent issue with suspension forks being of multiple pieces instead of a single solid piece like a rigid fork that means really poor suspension forks can exhibit unstable braking and turning characteristics as the lower stanchions flex under stress    the final nail in the coffin is cost what went into manufacturing the fork couldve gone into better wheels drivetrain brakes or frame or whatever    dont get me wrong suspensions are great on expensive mtbs but for your purpose of casual commuting a rigid fork will serve you better
  youve asked about it in three different threads already post some pictures already or youre just going to keep getting vague answers
you guys might be right especially since i overestimated the price difference  i found this thing in a big chain for about 410 dollars it comes from merida which to my understanding is a reliable manufacturer and the only real difference is rim breaks instead of disc breaks some sort of seat suspension thing ive never seen before and narrower wheels  are cheap bikes from reliable companies any better this one specifically is marketed as a city bike    i might get one tomorrow
how the fuck have you not taken a picture of the old guys bike already for fucks sake  we cant tell you whats better or worse if we dont know the goddamn bike  shimano gears and front suspension doesnt help
  picks another suspension bike
op here ive stopped being a faggot for 5 minutes and took a picture of the bike  its not very clear but hopefully everything is clear enough
dont know if this angle is any better but just in case

  no idea why they sometimes have helmets when theyre on such a wide wheelbase and stuck on tracks other than that it looks great     i was touring when i passed a group of them and the riderstobe getting some kind of introduction speech i would have loved to have joined them although their longest trip is only 26 miles
  risk of collision without signaling and only tool to prevent head on collision would be visual mean so the risk is kinda not low

worst fucking loco ive ever driven only been on em for about 3 year and im already thinking of jumping infront of a hst    wish the class 60 was more mass produced a real loco right there

  the one im working in mostly has no fucking aircon the amount of fucking noise and resonance from the fan end when in notch 7/8 leaves you with that still moving feeling 6 hours after getting out of the cab    the horn is way too fucking loud    worst thing about 66s are the drivers who unfortunately have to drive them had no input to the cab layout and design improvisations before the introduction to the uk unlike the class 60 which was made to perfection for the driver    the cabs are awful for vibration and hot in the summer especially no 2 end    the only redemable thing about the 66 is the engine shut off button    i even have industrial hearing loss blamed on firstgeneration diesels but when sent to a specialist by aslef regarding a claim he already knew about the class 66 noise tunnel    ill give it a year before i hand in my notice to ews and apply for freightliner
  freightliner doesnt use these
  sounds like emd did a pretty shit job fitting an american diesel into the british loading gauge because thats essentially what the class 66s are shrunken american diesel locomotives

ive always seen major airports as not only as places for travel but very formal centers of buisness diplomacy discovery etc anyone of pictures that fit that description
airport not airplane
  
  ive always liked the little ones honestly      threads dead bud
  the insides of older planes is always comfy to me
  this is bullshit the light reflects off the windows so its actually very hard to see any stars without putting your face on the window although the sight is beautiful though i remember flying miamad on a iberia a330 and the sight was gorgeous i really cant wait to be a first officer so that i can start looking at constellations and other celestial objects that i could have never seen from the ground due to light pollution
barajas is peak airport kino
    i will be thoroughly impressed if anyone knows what airport this is
  osaka kansai
  no that wouldve been too easy 
  its tokyohaneda i recognize that observation deck anywhere
  no its not cumstain
  no still wouldve been too easy if it was hnd
  pretty sure its oka
  jeez yeh you got it lol how you know
  yes it is because i posted the last couple images before it hit the limit
  i think its rain while its at the gate you can see the lights through the window
  oka  can we stop this trend of using iatas instead of icaos it basically denounces you as a passenger with no real knowledge of aviation
  well this was in the middle of the atlantic not necessarily in kmia or lemd
  im a pilot and i prefer using iata when talking casually about airports i only use icao when im actually flying youre just a tryhard faggot
  22 hours in a 152 does not quality you as a pilot whos opinion is worth 2 squirts of piss go fetch me some prop wash from the fbo little boy
