asking again i guess anyone try the la vie en roses crystal hard
  havent had that one in particular but i have lolinco crystal hard and im pretty sure its the same material its fucking amazing as compared to the original as the only real differance is that the durability is a bit higher in exchange for a bit of drop off on lolincos feeling so im guessing if you like the original la vie then you should like this one as well
after giving a couple new holes a first spin tonight i believe i understand the magic eyes meme had a couple hours of free time so i fired up a vid and started with chouzetsu vacuum nurse feels good but little sensation except pushing through that small tendril and crook in the middle its kinda what i imagine lilith uterus would feel like in regular instead of soft two rounds later my libido is already waning but im not even halfway through the video and ive still got plenty of alone time i didnt want to waste doing things i could do in the presence of others so i kinda forced myself to grab a second hole chose alraune    despite being halfdisinterested in the first place despite having already blew my load twice once i was inside holy hell this thing feels amazing tight yet easy to enter stimulating but not too rough maybe my best onahole experience yet and thats going in with a halfassed attitude and desire went three more rounds and only stopped to get cleaned up before everyone starts getting up for work    but you know typical magic eyes qc too dunno if it was outofbox or after using but the inner layer is slightly shredded at the entrance along the top further in theres a point where the inner layer just thins out into nothingness along the left and right edges exposing the outer layer its not peeling or tearing off in either case so im hopeful its not trash after a few uses but it doesnt inspire confidence there are also external areas where the red stuff is peeling away more substantially than id like yet in the back of my mind i cant help but think this was totally worth it even if it doesnt last till christmas
fucking finally gonna find out why that dude from onahodouga is shilling those virgin loops so hard
i just tried the school council president onshole and it was impossible to get my duck inside it wth
    well there arent many transparent options either i grabbed a virgin loop too because i wanted to try one and figured the second nurse hole would be too similar to chouzetsu
  that loop is not very transparent btw due to it having lots of pores
  he seems to shill out hard for anything made by ride japan
  as if waiting for my shit to get shipped for a fucking week wasnt bad enough i didnt even get to use gokusai utherus and it already has a fucking hole in it tried to rinse it under a tap before use and material began bubbling up and leaking good fucking luck to me trying to prove this shit to otona to get money back for a replacement
  yeah its kinda frosted almost but its still significantly more transparent than 99 of other holes out there
  good ol magic eyes quality control    tfw my stuff from otona hasnt even shipped yet and its been about a week
    well hes not shilling that virgin loop for nothing it really feels nothing like other onaholes i have tried feels very tingly and intense almost to the point if being uncomfortable to remove once you cum because of sensitivity
months without an onahole turned me into a premature ejaculator
  how
two new onaholes arrived yesterday but i was too busy with work to try them out and today im not alone at home close to a week of abstaining from masturbation as well this bums me out somewhat  also i understand that pornstar themed toys are supposed to have pictures of said stars on the box but damn these things are too conspicuous might be the first time i throw the boxes out and store the holes in some old amazon box
so repeating question from last thread whats the most realistic breast toy on the market right now seems to be busty aichan but a lot of the things ive read saying that are a few years old at this point so i wonder if its still true
how good is the romanesco from tomax  i was going to buy something from the venus series but apparently from what ive read apparently the roman its way better now   theyre out of stock atm but i can wait
  tfw always hated roasties but want to buy roses just for those petals
  you need to lube your dick too
  its still busty aichan
  yeah believe me i lubed it i would try to push it in and it would just slip away i hate to open the thing with my hands and put it on like a condom is there a loose ass onahole like a gaping one 
  months using them and i still am i make up for it with eroge protagonist powers of being able to stay up and keep going afterward
  tell me about it i could live with the cartoon girls on the box but the graphic xray of the inside of the toy is so explicit and perverse that a normal person would be horrified
  i second this question
can the dude who posted this in the last thread post more pics and info plz
is that free toy demon lube any good i guess compared to something cheap like astroglide    same question for onatsuyu
  if its free its most likely cheap quality to average quality onatsuyu is typically regarded as one of the best lubes but it seems to be a mileage may vary  kind of thing ive heard some swear by it while others say it dries out too quickly for them
  id say from personal experience that tomax insomnia and silky are better than onatsuyu and a bottle last longer you need to use less  but it might be personal preference onatsuyu is still great
so im 135cm x 12cm 525 x 472 and i was thinking of getting a lolinco virgo  and for the hips i was thinking of getting either the cocolo or ritopuri little princess anyone have any feedback on either of those if someone could also provide a comparison between the puni ana dx cocolo and ritopuri that would be greatly appreciated too
  if you do end up getting it let me know how durable the anal hole is  the anal hole on the regular la vie en roses is amazing but ive literally torn the ass up on two of them  the second one on my first use
  virgo is big and thick so youll most definitely want some kind of thin instrument to help clean it its tight but smooth and since its much larger than the original its also way more durable still will tear around the entrance after a few uses but mine is still going strong for the year that ive had it however i dont use it as much as my others since its the second hardest/most tedious hole for me to clean
  my virgo arrived defective and only got worse from there if i could guarentee getting one that actually worked im sure id love it
  why not just fuck the duck instead
so hey guys i have a question for you all that might be a dumb one so ive had an onahole for a bit an got some pepee lube for it and you see recently i got a gf well things happened and weve been using that lube and now she been complaining about itching where the lube has been is this stuff safe for use on real girls or have i fucked up
  its meant for that but some peoples bodies are just sensitive to stuff use something else instead
  according to pepees website it should be safe to use with a partner how does your gf react with other waterbased lubes does the reaction come spewcifically from pepee lotion or is it a common problem your gf may just be allergic
  duck  i didnt know cwc browsed 4channel let alone /ona/
has anyone tried heating up an onahole with sous vide whats the optimal temperature
  i wouldnt go much past body temp
      isnt the toydemon lube just vanessa and co i cant vouch for it personally but some people do prefer it its probably okay stuff insomnia is great for soft holes but its too thin for hard holes eg good with my lilith uterus but makes virgin age grad a bit of a painful experience so i use my onatsuyu with the latter
accidentally get drunk  use doll  my testicles and scrotum are saggy through and through  any biologyfags here  what is going on with my genitals    summer nuts and sack are saggy always but kinda shrink during the orgasm  but when drunk they are saggier than normal  fall/spring  sack is kinda tighter and get tighter when orgasm time  but when drunk they are kinda loose perfect kinda loose where they feel good slapping dolls taint  winter balls are smaller sack is always tightest but when drunk more loose and just right on orgasm some give but with a little firm    i wish i can explain this more but god damn alcohol has a weird effect on my genitals that i cannot describe properly
  your scrotum is a sack of smooth muscle similar to stomach its purpose is to move the testicles closer or farther away from the body in order to regulate temperature since sperm production requires somewhat lower temp than inside the body  alcohol is gaba receptor agonist it binds to some of the receptors that are are used to relax your nervous system and muscles to some degree body temperature might rise a little as well when inebriated hence the effects of the scrotal muscles being more relaxed    at least thats what i assume is happening im not a medic
  that thread was a riot just because one of the taglines for this thread is and every thing else we stick our junk into doesnt mean you freaks actually have to do it you people play such dangerous games with your dick
  jesus christ why havent i ever thought of this
does anyone have the lolinco soft and regular version    is it wroth ever getting both or nah
  so those onahole tampons would be a pretty solid investment huh what have you been using      is this a common thing thats actually terrible
i currently have the toy demon vanessa or whatever lube astroglide and i currently have onatsuyu from amazon of all places in my cart    any others i should pickup to try
  do you ever just fuck it on the rack out of laziness
  what have you been using  i just use a plastic chopstick wrapped around a microfiber cloth i havent tried the stick but does look nice for particularly annoying holes  could be worth it if you have a lot of holes that have tight entrances and dont want to risk tearing the entrances too much
  nope
item was supposed to be here yesterday there hasnt been an actual update since monday and its now friday anons help is this normal
is inner length the tunnel length
  the same thing happened to me black friday/cyber monday always fucks with shipping
  they know run a magnet over your hard drives and flee
  id assume so but i dont where youre reading that
  amazonde for example  
  looks like it it matches the google doc at least
  tracking updates have been slow for me too lately pretty sure its just the holiday shopping season fucking everything up
i wanna throw away an onahole i bought it is too tight and short and really dissapointing how do i get rid of the vulgar box and perverted rubber thing covered in my dna
  just throw it in the garbage you fucking autist
  rude
  if possible tomax insomnia or silky great for soft toys better than onatsuyu imo
  i tossed some vulgar boxes with naked women on them in the trash today would have sorted it to cardboard if my area did recycling   i mean what else would you do with them if you have a fireplace or make fire you could use boxes as kindling i guess
just got my first one and gonna give it a try thanks for all the help guys
what are some holes with very pronounced uterus gimmick ie the ones where you can actually feel it very well lilith is sadly out of question
the one thing i wanted by far the most on queen cat and of course its sold out    does anyone know anything about their restocking like do they restock stuff once a week and they might have it next week or they only restock stuff once every few months or they just never restock stuff once it sells out
  dolphin 3 thick uteruses in a row i like mine its pretty cool there was also that muses toy arkhe i think although i havent tried it but those who did mentioned that the uterus is much more pronounced than in lilith  ive also tried daishuki hold uterus there is thin but since this onahole is a bit harder than usual tomax stuff it is much more noticeable than in lu dont recommend getting it if you like softer toys with less stimulation
waiting for onatsuyu lube stock  this is killing me
  none of that stuff is on otona    fml
  almost 30 euros and it aint even in stock  why not get it somewhere that sells it for 8 usd and have it shipped
  if you live in america queen cat is the only way youll get tomax brand holes omachodreams if youre a european    daisuki hold is on otona however i also heard the gokusai uterus is worth the money
any good website for europe besides motsutoys   or japanese ones that dont ask a fortune for simple shipping 
thinking about getting a lolinco for my first onahole is this a good starter trying to stay on the lower price end for the first one
even with the cheapest shipping thatd take 4 months the chichifueta would be 200    this is very disappointing why cant there just be cheaper yet still quality breast toys or free shipping
was afraid the mots teeth were going to scrape my dick to shreds  its the best fucking part  oh my god this shouldnt feel so good but its fucking amaaaazing hands down my new favorite hole easy like holy shit i cannot believe how good this actually fucking feels
clean mot soft once before using it for the first time  everything looks fine  go to clean it after use   notice a black speck just beneath the surface of one of her teeth its really apparent   have to scrap it out with a fucking dental pick its literally lodged in like a sliver  what the fuck  i definitely would have noticed the speck upon initial inspection which means this was scrubbed off my dick
  looks like rat shit that got into the material for the toy  enjoy your super aids
got sick and tired of sticking my willy in cold holes even when i warmed them up lube would still make them cold    i got curious and microwaved a tablespoom of my shibari lube for 15 secs and used it it felt warm and great thinking about doing it again but got worried if i do it more often its gonna damage my holes or lube will melt my dick off am i fucked
  i dunno what kinda bottle you have but i use those little 23 inch tall ky jelly bottles and i use my bodyheat to warm them up  armpits crotch keeping it over a vent with hot air
    those small foam onahole tampons arent very rigid so its still annoying getting them into tight holes because you have to stretch the hole open to be able to guide them in think rolled paper towel trick except its tighter and cant unravel but theyre dirtcheap and useful enough that gproject stick seems pretty useful but its kind of expensive for a drying utensil
  gokusai uterus is worth the money  its great but mostly due to the delicious bump at the entrance you dont really feel uterus itself
  if durability is your concern then shouldnt you then aim for a soft version as opposed to a hard one
  there is omochadreams but its pointless to buy anything but tomax stuff there you could also try amazon and check the seller because motsutoys also operate through it i think ive ordered stuff directly from japan through it somehow it evaded the customs tax
  maybe if you read the fucking guide    but yes lolinco is a good first time its fragile however and thus has a shorter than average shelf life
  have you read the guide lolinco is a decent toy for people who prefer something tighter and more stimulating its obviously hard to know before trying but it might turn out that you prefer soft toys more
any good onaholes that are actually properly transparent irl not only on the box art
  no the material is shit
  i ran through all results for 透明 on onahodouga and halfmature succubus little sister magical vacuum hard seems to fit the bill the most
  also highly invisible pxp yoshimi looks pretty good and its the closest thing to dolphin with good reviews on otona
  why not get it off amazon or something
tfw zxy mouth of truth and soft lolinco arrived    now i have a black fliphole original from like 6 years ago and a flip black zero electronic in addition to all of the above    another week until my reusable chopsticks and microfiber cloth arrives so i can clean them though
  checking out cmst and toydemon  getting a mouth of truth and a few storage bags what else should i get 3050 to hit the 75 for free shipping i already have a 17 bordeaux
  what is the source of this tried google and nothing came up
ive had two venus clones over the past 4yrs the first one was regular the second is soft how long till you throw out your onahole also are there any onaholes there are better than venus clone im in the market for a new one and wanna try something different
  lemme add  length  7in  girth 55in   budget 60  geographical locationusa
  use yandex or iqdb
anons    ever since i cut the teeth off of my mot this hole went from eh to i want to fuck it 50 times a day    the part where the uvula and those ridges just beneath it massages my head and urethra so fking good i fill up the throat to the brim    is this fking normal deepthroating mot doesnt feel as good as just staying in the mouth
  thanks i found it    bear hand ireading humananimal marriage original
  are they made out of different stuff than normal onaholes
  material is shit  whatever material ride makes its transparent holes of is the best one of all onaholes i have shit is indestructible and you dont even need to powder it
so this isnt entirely related but ive always had trouble getting a full erection and keeping it for longer than a minute so i got a pair of cockrings and god damn are these supposed to be the erections i shouldve been having it actually changed everything
i hate to be the guy making this kind of post but does anyone know where can i find this specific onahole in a trustworthy site searching for jiuai gives me tons of other products but never this specific one    if anyone cares why i want it specifically its because its by far the best feeling one ive ever gotten why not get it the same way i got the one i currently have then thing is i live in a shithole third world country and local stores just send you a fucking random onahole if you order anything from them and all of them fucking garbage holes for like 70 fucking bucks but this one is absolute heaven and ive had it for so long by now that its starting to fall apart ive tried to buy a new one several times often with this exact image on the store page but every time i receive a different shitty hole im a poorfag and this is taking a huge toll on my finances so ive finally decided to bite the bullet and try to buy it for however billion dollars converting my money to u really hurts it takes to just fucking get this specific one and be over with this but i cant find it in international stores for the life of me     any help is highly appreciated
  how did it go
  daisyuki hold        if you still want the tomax brand the dolphin and romanesco are both great but get them in regular or hard   r20 is also a good choice for larger than average dicks      yes iguess with the mot people either really love the teeth or hate it i personally like the teeth and everything else      it might be discontinued as ive never seen or heard of that hole/company before but try amazon jp
    guess ill just use the chopstick with a cloth or rolled paper towel methods first until i determine whether or not i cant be bothered to continue lol
this lube that came with zxy    christ thats thick and sticky literally had to use my pinky and jam it into the little sample bottle to get any out because its unpourable
anyone own a bigger doll and or the meiki plush dx know what kind of sized variety clothing to put on them    sort of wish it had legs for that thighhigh action but at least elbow gloves still exist
  the romanesco is out of stock just got the r20 thanx anon and its even larger than the romanesco
    btw the r20 didnt come in a hardness is it like a regular on the tomax scale
is the most pelolin better than the original   also what is the second best lube after onatsuyu since its not available on motsutoys 
should i really get one or just continue using my hand
how often do you lads use your stuff    once a day or every third day
  too many variables  sleeping in  the day at work  what day to day stuff there is paperwork lawn snow other appointments etc  id love to use my doll every day but its been like 5 days a week now
  huh i havent opened that bottle yet but i guess its something to consider zxy is so soft i would assume a thinner lube would be more useful to pack with it
  a good toy can feel much better than your hand they just provide stimulation that your hand cant and there is a wide variety of toys that provide different types of stimulation  also softer toys are much gentler which might disappointingly feel like nothing at the beginning but you will have a hard time going back from after getting used to it i tried regular masturbation after using these toys for awhile and my dick felt abused and sore in comparison
  the mot mouth of truth
  id say its about slightly more than the regular compared to the tomax but very stimulating
bought my first onahole last week  arrived today  fapgif  feel more empty after fapping than usual  i didnt ask for this    how did you guys feel after the first time you used an onahole
  how did you guys feel after the first time you used an onahole  pure bliss
  kinda awkward since i didnt cum and got soft halfway though
  again again again  i used to spend hours looking for just the right one now can use anything  softcore to enjoy it longer  music videos this is a whole new world  quicky burn  on more onas  novelty is fun but i keep coming back to first one  thank you tomax lilith uterus
  that felt pretty good lets find out how to clean this thing  eh fuck it lets go for sloppy seconds  ended up using the second one i bought as well a couple of times    you need to relax and just enjoy it mate if girls using plastic phalluses is ok there is nothing wrong with sticking your dick in a piece of rubber
just got pic related from the mail itll be my first breast toy  while i had doubts about it when i got it  i can say that im more than happy with what i got they feel surprisingly big once you have them theyre pretty soft as well i wouldnt call them jiggly but they have a decent amount of bounce i only wish the base were bigger/more durable because im worried that it might break if i manhandle it too much
  sort of awkward tired and disappointed i had fairly mild dgs so it didnt feel right and i had to finish by hand then i took a week off from masturbating and when i tried it again it blew my mind
  my little sister cant be this tight is actually incredible for the price
im looking for my first onahole and i have an unquenchable mermaid fetish that the squamate doesnt quite match  the dolphin is in the recommended section for big dongs but it has an insertable length of 57 doesnt say what the tunnels circumference is but it looks pretty tight  the rest of them are about that size  im 77 long and 6 girthy am i too big would i be fine with the soft version is onatsuyu alright with it i dont wanna fuck up here      onatsuyu is 565 here anon  
how do you clean an onahole lolinco virgo with a chopstick and a microfiber towel its a bit difficult to get in there with the towel draped over the chopstick
  god dammit anon     wrap half a paper towel sheet around your finger jam finger into hole swab gently until dry its just that easy i recommend doing so after the outside has been dried and powdered     a microfiber towel just sounds like a hassle of it isnt exactly the right size
  cant you just wrap some rubber bands near the bottom of the stick to secure it
  i recommend getting the dolphin in regular or hard so you can really feel those cervixes  onatsuyu is good but i prefer tomaxs insomnia or silky lubes
  im still keeping the teeth but im honestly shocked at how much ive come to like this hole feeling the tongue press against the base of my dick drives me absolutely wild my only concern so far is durability considering the brand really want this to last
your method has already worked for me just fine i was just curious how they managed to clean it with their method i tried exactly what they suggested before but it was a hassle
just had my first fap without using my hand it was an amazing experience its like someones sucking my dick and felt very refreshed afterwards
just seen a thread on /gif/ of women with 14 inch to 17 inch deep vaginas  truely i never had a chance to never not use anything but onas    thank you ona for giving me masturbatory bliss that i would never know otherwise  my 7 inch dicklette would be a waste of flesh without you
  does otonajp have a working coupon code or should i wait until christmas
  you are an autist and that thread is in metric
  seemed english to me unless 4chan has a new autotranslator
  are fleshlights a better choice i keep reading comments here and on ona sites about how their onas keep tearing and how theyre too short for their dicks so im wondering if i should just go for a fleshlight
  that depends on what you want and how big you are   onaholes tend to feel better because the material allows the producers to do more interesting things with the tunnel designs but the sizes dont go as high theres a spreadsheet in the pastebin with a bunch of tunnel lengths a good ona should still last you months of use and there are some models that seem to be nigh indestructible but there are also some that can be quite fragile  fleshlights are generally more durable and come in bigger sizes which can make them a good alternative but the material they use limits them to plainer tunnels though still better than the hand
  at that length most onaholes will be too shallow you can still use them just might have issues with poking the bottom when trying to go all the way in while in the heat of the moment this might decrease the lifespan of the hole since you will be stretching it out and there is a possibility of fucking a hole through it  the two models that are often recommended to people who are more well endowed than average are seducing/vacuum witch and r20 or you might consider fleshlights that while inferior will accommodate you just fine and some of them feel pretty good    i have dolphin in regular firmness its pretty good and so far it is more durable than venus real from the same manufacturer barely any tunnel surface cracks
  i was gifted fleshlight go by my female friends a year ago they say that this originally started as a joke but they ended up going to the local sex shop and tried picking the best option bless their hearts i was initially disappointed by it but over time figured it has some merits    pros   soft material similar similar to tomax   durable can turn inside out with no issues   openended tunnel makes cleaning easy   feels pretty nice    cons   cursed open ended tunnel means that lube and sperm can seep out from the end   they have a cap that can be screwed on the end to prevent the leaks i guess but all it does is makes matters worse with it fully screwed due to the toy in the plastic cup not being able to deform properly it starts to be insanely loud and the cap is not even properly tight and air goes in and out with whistling sound creating lube foam/bubbles    with the cap partially unscrewed its still pretty loud and messy   with the cap unscrewed forget about using this in any position besides vertical anywhere you dont want to make a mess   its way too long but its just me since i dont have a pornstarlength dong    so the main issues honestly come from the openended design and it being in an inflexible plastic cup the material feels pretty good and is durable
tfw literally spending money to dress up my meiki plush  yet still know nothing about womens underwire    does anyone else do this not sure how id deal with the thing not having a face or hair    that stupid climbing mt 4chan threadcap hit me super hard today since i came to /jp/ for monster grills and now im dressing up a doll
  does anyone else do this   you mean dress up the doll yea its really common i do that to my doll i think there was some information about what pant/bra size to look for floating around but its not in the pastebin like i thought it was  not sure how id deal with the thing not having a face or hair  but it comes with a head right you can get the faces meant for the airdolls and they should be the right size and wigs
  came for the monster grills stays for the doll talk  youre not the only one my friend
tfw i finally understand the beauty of extra soft holes after months of chasing for hardness and tightness    fuck you age admission fuwapocha and super soft succubus are my new friends now
    my cocolo about once every month or two depends if i have the time i like going for long sessions to make the cleanup process worth it but its so good i really have to pace myself    mot every couple weeks usually    lately ive just been using an old fleshlight that ive cut the length off with an old water bottle the suction i get with it is amazing and its really quick to clean
    nah i like staying in the mouth too i also removed the teeth for that reason used to get uncomfortable after a while from sensitivity i dont even need to stroke just having it inside and moving the tongue side to side is fantastic    try putting an elastic band or hair tie around the uvula/throat area for a bit more resistance when you push in
  i dont think anything is wrong with the onahole itself its more of a me thing  whenever i fap i always feel empty as shit after this time it was worse because i had hyped up getting an onahole for myself and after getting it and fapping i just sat there gripping the exe julia hips while on my bed starring at the ceiling for a minute  and all i could think was that i spent 40 bucks on this and i dont even have rent money
  pic related me and my dick postfap
  and all i could think was that i spent 40 bucks on this and i dont even have rent money  maybe thats why anon get your expenses straightened out before you spend it on material possessions
  it might be discontinued as ive never seen or heard of that hole/company before    god damn it i was so scared of that possibility i did try amazon jp with no luck as well thanks for answering anyway    since it seems that my search is hopeless can  you recommend me something similar the only things i know about this holy grail since i cant read moon are that its made of cyberskin is dual layered and is very very loose  ive checked the guide recommendations but its very hard to gauge visually if they have these characteristics and it doesnt seem like any of them fit the criteria
  you tried a reverse image search i get loads of results from what appear to be brazillian sex toy sites
  i did and i get them too but ive bought from some not all admittedly of those stores and just received some other shitty onahole instead of the one in the page thats the kind of shit that people can get away with on this country    getting burned like this is why ive turned to searching in international stores
  how are you enjoying it my last day of no nut is on wednesday about to order this as a reward only place to get it in europe is 300 euro bucks  importing it is even more expensive tho
  i wish i knew what the internals looked like nor do i know what cyberskin means but the outer material reminds me of the meiki 000 series by npg you might want to try them out they can get pretty pricey however and thats not even including the shipping costs            doing the reverse image search landed only brazilian and russian websites for me so there actually might be a small chance that the hole you used could possibly be a rebranded npg hole which would explain why they look so similar
  just dress it in lolipan 
  cyberskin is the term the local stores use to describe the material i assumed itd be the same anywhere since its in english but it seems thats not the case i dont know what it is in the usual terms then but its definitely not silicone    that said that first link of yours does look extremely similar and i might just go for it and hope my quest is finally over thanks a lot friend
    cyberskin is a kind of tpe
i got a new daki and inner recently and im thinking of putting some silicon breasts inside for groping purposes anybody have a recommendation for a pair that wont leak anything like plasticizer onto the pillow
  i cant seem to find any of these masks other than that one single queen cat one do they have a term or special name for them
  felt amazing  came buckets and felt better than i thought it would  then i went for another round with cum as lube
  had to throw out my mouth of truth after like a year  i was cleaning it well but apparently parts around the teeth never dried enough because when i decided to take out the teeth there was a layer of mold in the groovesdumped it immediately
  thrown out my first venus real after a year and even that was stretching it since i was waiting for 3 months for omochadreams to restock my second one is also a year old tunnel and entrance is all cracked and fucked up and gross this time i got julia and zxy instead and will likely toss the vr soon  vr is a great toy hands down my favourite one but the entrance starts cracking like a month or two into use while thinner tomax toys like dolphin or lilith uterus are much less damaged with comparable or longer service time a bummer really
anyone have experience with this from the recommendation list in the guide    
is there a downside to using a drop of dishsoap to clean off your hands and dick after using your hole    my hands are softer and my dick is shinier
  realized i was bullying my dick too hard first hole was the mot and the teeth were the most enjoyable part for me
  big ol fuckin tiddys  itty bitty nibbles    i want some wide ass pink pancake areolas with some big ol door knob nipples to chew on
    why is wanted to be transparent a thing watching your own dick
  i found this which uh i dont think id go for but you might more stuff if you wanna tredge through the various japanese language sites either under doll masks or doll accessories or you might try to go for kigurumi masks  
  compared  the second one looks fun to nibble on but my current situation doesnt really warrant me wanting another akari the nipples are quite firm and nice stands up quite well under light clothing you would need to be a bit clever with mounting and plush attachment since most bras struggle quite happy with akari kinda makes me want another solely to be surrounded in    ill definitely have a closer look at the ai and akari when i get home for you anon    otona had something like 5 off which wasnt really worth the pain and hassle if anything i might throw a contact of mine for dhl on them if life treats me well
  i dunno but i just tried some dawn after using my hole  never once felt so clean after fapping
  ah i meant compared them with other oppai both akaris would be mad im only really interested in the iis but if the first ones are worth it then im sure the iis are     i think these things would make a plush buckle under the weight even if i found a way to mount them so i didnt plan on that i find the ais to be the perfect weight without it making too much of a imbalance 3x the weight and i think it would make things difficult for different positions ill give it a try though if i get them
  i always regret using it because i cant get hard enough to use it properly wonder if a ring will help
bought a lolinco virgo after people kept saying the normal one is too small and it will rip easy  fapped with it  couldnt even reach the cervix  i couldnt even last a minute  spent more time cleaning the damn thing  at least i know ill never have a woman so onaholes for life i guess
  anon at  seems to have success with that ive been curious about em ring hardons are super saiyan roided versions of your dick
  bros why do different girls have different tightnesses when i was younger i always though that all girls pussies were identical and that they were tight wet soft and warm but so far ive only ever run across 3 pussies that were sort of leaning towards being tight and none of them got wet and all were more like room temperature than anything  all the rest were the same except different levels of loose with one being so bad i couldnt cum even fully hard i could stack 3 fingers in there and still have room     its so depressing i was a virgin until around 2 years ago my bodycount is at like 13 and ive never been happy with any of them i feel so empty and everything seems pointless all im doing is just lifting my ass off and starting community college classes so i can get jacked and transfer to a party school  is pussy a meme ive heard men say theyve had pussy that made their toes curl but idk if they were lying or what other guys view pussy as just kinda cool ive seen porn where the girls are dripping wet and i read some story told by a guy that before him and his wife got married they would grope each other but not fuck and she would be soaking the chair with pussy slime   idk what to do at this point will i ever find pussy thats good does it not exist is it really rare and is pussy quality caused by genetics or how often they fuck or what     ive never had pussy that even just matched a warmed and lubed up venus real and ive thought for so long that the legendary pussy is even better than that but now im starting to wonder if its just a legend
  also i would be able to fuck them without them being wet by using spit or lube i had also this one girl who thinks shes my girlfriend who i always have to use lube to fuck i was able to just stick my dick in her and go at it after id been groping her for hours but she was basically just moist enough for me to do it it was nothing like onatsuyu lube for example
    these are /r9k/ posts this is a place for fake vag00 not real women
  now the iis have apparently a softer inner material iirc having a quick grope of ai and akari akari is definitely firmer  akaris nipples arent as firm as i remembered it to be but it still protrudes quite nicely under some tight or heavy clothing the nipples are no longer noticeable    yes plushes tend to buckle under akari ive made makeshift spines with pool noodles and ive stuffed a nui and a venus r to the point of then exploding from stuffing to compensate for the mass with all the stuffing nui was ripping from the seams under mating presses and the venus r i still have to clean and wash and restuff there simply isnt enough support on the legs/thighs to keep them upright with akari    as for handling and positions its difficult to keep akari on the plush with clothes unless the plush is as firm as a car seat my current setup involves akari clothed with a woolen shirt lying on two or three shirts between the base and the chest of the plush and finally a polyester tee to keep it all under wraps with the arms inside the shirt to help support while useable i find it most comfortable under missionary cowgirl or lotus positions sideways tend to slide her into one side due to my shirts and positions with her facing down tend to slide akari up/down due to how loose my shirts are    comparatively having such large volume and mass provides a different feeling i personally like the feeling of having ny thighs/belly slap on the underboob during paizuri and i like seeing my dick disappear as my dick tends to curve upwards ai chans were too small and limited my positions to a pronebone with me squeezing ai together quite firmly to seal my dick in with akari the relative size of each breast made enveloping my member quite easy both hands free and without     best of luck with storage and handling the box sits under my bed very neatly handling out of and into the box is something youll have to learn by yourself without dropping her or damaging her same goes for cleaning i used wipes on her occasionally for cleaning up my shota mess but i always revert to a good ol bath powdering is essential if you dont want those massive jugs chafing    clothingwise i can fit a sports bra on a plush with ai however i cant even fit the bra on akari alone a nursing bra had once fit on akari alone and ive used that setup on a pillow for some paizuri but i havent bothered with bras for a long time    personally worth for the weight alone i barely fuck akari but i tend to sleep with it grope and occasionally suckle in my sleep if i sleep with a pillow under my head with a plushed akari on top i get back pain if i sleep with a plushed akari on top of my arm while i hug it i lose circulation in that arm but theres something so magical that she does for me that i just feel so warm and fuzzy    if you have any questions or requests for comparative photos please dont hesitate to ask away i would like to share my happiness with you all    if you end up getting iis and dont like it i would be more than happy to adopt
  im thinking about buying some titties and im leaning toward aichan they seem to have a bit more realistic weighting to them and i dont have any particular fetish for huge breasts so akari doesnt really do anything for me thoughts pics are always welcome of course
  the weight and size will be the leading factor for your decision in this case it will be the most economical decision and you will most likely enjoy that size of breast while aichan reigns supreme in that size range due to softness/build there are other similarly sized breasts like utea chichifueta and saccuel while these may be options for you please also keep in mind shipping forex and such  the only way to truly find out is to experience theres been a few anons with utea and a couple with chichifueta and some with other breasts and im sure they can shed some light on their experiences    please have an image of akari next to aichan and the kiwami
  thanks for the write up  i have encountered the same problem with ai needing to squeeze firmly for proper paizuri i like the idea of akari engulfing me entirely with ease     i think ill wait until a sale to jump on it though shipping just kills it for most places so hoping for another  off coupon at the jew devils
just bought a sexdoll  want more  is this a calling
  chichifueta and akari
  dont use soap on your dick  it dries out the head
    how does the soft version of mouth of truth compare to the original i got the soft one today and it wasnt bad but the reviews arent very good compared to the original one i usually go for the soft one but i may get the original one if people think its better
i want to get one of these pic related which one should i get it is going to be my first hip the left one is out of stock and i cant find anywhere that ships to na and the right one is not out yet also is there a word for onahole hips in japanese this is the word that i use 大型オナホール  there is no one website that seem to have all the av actresses onaholes/hips it seems to be spread among different ones
    mods are gay    also jesus christ i didnt realize how fucking big akari is
  why else would it be a thing feels pretty good seeing it all the way in with some more to spare
  yes never use soap on your dick it will fuck up your natural bacteria flora and make getting skin infection much easier just rinse it under running water to clean dish soap is fine to use on your hands but can dry the skin out and make it crack if you use too much get one with aloe vera to counteract that somewhat better yet use actual hand soap and save dish soap for cleaning dishes
  i think 大型 is for regular big holes  据え置き型 is what they call hips over there
any input about ordering things from otonasekai
  how big are you though did you even bother to compare the size of the onas to yourself
  no hand soap in the bathroom and/or kitchen  i may never understand people
  they used to be pretty bad but are shaping up to being decent as of current matters
  thanks thats great to hear since i find that os is much cheaper than ojp like the puni ana dx being 144cad as opposed to 83 on os do you know how i could find any coupon codes for os or just in general
i screwed up guys     kept my dick in onahole too long getting a scrap/ burn on top of shaft  itchy around the more sensitive under side possibly due to not cleaning it out well enough    i cant even fap now been putting ointment on it and wrapped in gauze for a few days
  i struggle to do it at all hundreds of dollars for brief 1015 second sessions ha
made my order on otonajp ever since the blackfriday sale came out  order still in preparation  its been 2 fucking weeks holy shit why do they take so long to even ship it out i live in on the wrong side of the world so i already know it will take at least a month to get here after its shipped
  its probably because you have ordered something that is out of stock and requires weeks to restock it says how long you have to wait under each items price on its page
  fuck man i get the same shit are there any remedies for this
  i just do it multiple times a day to make it worth it
  you can just train yourself proper way doing breathing techniques forcing yourself to stop when you are on the verge etc just dont expect to get results after only doing it for a couple of times it takes weeks/months
  i do the same thing haha or i just dont stop since im usually still hard after i finish anyways      ok thanks anon ill look more into it      bumping cuz i want cheaper shit too
does anyone here own a product from tamatoys im trying to get the メスはめ hip and was wondering if tamatoys stuff has any good qc records
thoughts on regular aichan vs the white version
ordered a lolinco a year and some ago as one of my first onaholes  it was great loved it  threw it away after a while   ordered another one the other day  material is flimsy as heck  my benis practically pierces through the silicone  end up throwing it away because its a travesty  is this the dreaded magic eyes qc ive heard about or is my memory just really bad and ive somehow romanticised the lolinco in my head  this is my first time being unlucky with qc

babbys first onahole
  depends on how big/small you are
looking for a warmer that wont break within a month  narrowed it down to     or       the second one has no reviews but looks pretty durable theyre about the same price  opinions if youve used either are they worth the 10 more than the nonthermostat flimsy cable ones that seem to be standard
  onahole loot boxes  why not
  shipping is like 40
  if youre not using hips or anything larger you can also just wrap it in a heating blanket  ive been doing that for a while and it works perfectly well
  does that really warm up the inside very well thats the important part isnt it
  reviews say the white is softer but quite a bit more delicate
  my friends and i have been using this one for a while no complaints so far 
    i personally havent seen otonasekai use coupon codes seems to be otonas upside is that they haver some form of coupon code that takes off 1015 every other month
  magic eyes qc is like rolling a die it really stinks at times but hey at least they dont charge you 50 for most of their products
  around 6
  there is a pretty significant dwell time but absolutely  i let it run for about an hour or so and it warms the entire hole up pretty nicely inside and out
  id wait until their christmas sale so you could at least get a bit off on it
    read the pastebin it goes through the stuff youll want to keep in mind and has some recommendations
whew  i was a little worried that xs size clothing wouldnt fit the giga titty doll  thank fuck for 90/10 cotton/spandex clothing
  2060days  aliexpress  supercheap chinese manufacturing  i dunno man
  i have the romanesco hard along with a few other tomax toys romanesco is good and you will be satisfied if you get it but i prefer other onaholes to it like the lilith uterus or the rina big
  unless you want hard plastic then its going to leak so its better to get a chink bootleg of it and do it that way
  biology student here i agree
  rina big is one of the best out of the 10 onaholes i have tried
  id get a tomax ona as my first they are durable and feel great i like the lilith line
  i really just wondering if anyone here could give a more detailed account re the whites durability
  general rule of thumb is that the softer an onahole is the less durable it will be
  i understand that im asking if anyone here has any specific experience with it jesus christ
  my lolinco was dogshit too which sucks because the mot is probably my favorite hole so far so their shit is good when its made right cant ever justify buying something again when theres a chance of failure
im guessing it doesnt actually have blush coloring  man id pay extra if it did
  i did up my old original mouth of truth with make up and god damn it was fucking hot
any raisin i shouldnt
  chill out dog im just trying to help
any recommendations for a good hip or torso ive been thinking about making the upgrade from handheld for a long time but spending 100 dollars on what is essentially a big  onahole is intimidating
  depends what you want in terms of pure value its hard to be puni ana spdx or miracle dx theyre expensive but youre basically getting a mini sex doll and in that context theyre an extremely good value build quality is really good as well
  what shop
  queen cat
  perorin is 648 cheaper on otona if you care  the tiddies arent cheap for unconnected breasts what are you planning on doing with them
  perorin is 648 cheaper on otona if you care  otana usually rapes me on shipping so ive stopped bothering with them might be 6 cheaper but theyll charge me an extra 20 on shipping    the tiddies arent cheap for unconnected breasts what are you planning on doing with them  i like the idea of having two small tiddies just to play around with but more importantly im  and im a bit worried about the durability of the white aichans so i figure i can get these to test the material out i figure ill get some enjoyment out of them either way
  thanks anon i will take a look into these two you recommended im a cheap bastard and feel guilty even spending 30 on an onahole but i know they are much cheaper than dating or hookers appreciate the recommendations
  my friends and i    like sharing one  ew x 10
  perhaps the monitoring had become much more active during the split a lot of the old images seem to have been kept     yeah shes big try and mark up her dimensions on a table to visualise how big each breast is i had once tried to use her as a wrist rest and eventually gave up as the cleavage swallowed my arm and couldnt use my mouse and trying to rest both arms on a breast each for the keyboard induced some pain as i tried stretching my hand down to the keys    i really need to invest in some form of large sports bra and some tight fitting clothing my shirts are just the right size for a plushed up akari
  that sounds kind of hot i want to share one with astolfo
  astolfo is the onahole for you
  i want to be astolfos onahole too
  thats mighty homosexual senpai

got my first nonthrough hole  cleaning it after usage  just squeezing fluids out of this poor rubber amputee    there is something oddly enjoyable about it though
anyone have suggestions for wombthemed onas    im a little torn between  1 pic related shikyu kantsu uterus sex by aone  and 2 gokusai uterus by magic eyes     the thing is i hadnt really heard of aone before so idk about their track record i was under the impression that toysheart magic eyes and maybe ride japan make the best onas on the market    another one im thinking of is marshmallow touch by aone which in the back of my mind im wondering if its a little too gimmicky/unrealistic to have a ball in the ona to simulate striking a uterus    otherwise do you guys have suggestions for buying another ona my main ones right now are lusty slut and virgin age graduation by toysheart i generally prefer ls since vag feels kinda annoying to use ls has been great to me and i generally use it to fap at least once a day but i think im getting a bit tired of it i was thinking before of getting witchs temptation or w/e its called by th too but then i started to think that it seems too similar to ls in the 1st place im not totally sure what im looking for i think i want at least a decent amount of weight to it like at least 300 g one of the things i like about ls is that its almost 500 g of ona i think im more interesting in a pussy ona than anything too and besides the womb theming im not sure what else i might be interested in maybe a gyaru themed ona if there is a such thing i guess otherwise id just like some different kind of feel to the ona from ls
    i also do have a big impreg fetish if that counts for anything
  if i remember correctly factory photos of the first one show it have long long nipples and a long clit disappointed the fuck out of me
  yeah someone warned me in /b/ and posted its ehentai  i had a clerks2 moment about the big clit
are there any short stack sex dolls
  i am personally a fan of what tomax does they have several toys that have a uterus gimmick  lilith uterus muses arkhe orca 2 dolphin  lu is probably the most well known i have it its a pretty nice soft toy but the uterus is barely noticeable ma is a much thicker toy closer to venus series with a much noticeable uterus and dolphin is as thick as lu but has 3 thick uterus rings along the canal feels pretty awesome  ive also tried daishuki hold from toys heart its harder than tomax stuff somewhat lolithemed i guess the idea is that there are several rings at the base that grip the penis and dont let go with a pronounced but thin uterus at the end you can feel it much better than in lu
  gurun gurun fantasy dx is built like a tank but i cant say how typical that is of tamatoys or how much that really helps judging a hip      i wanted to try witch myself but its made out of the same material as the r20 which is my least favorite hole by a mile and ive eventually come to realize i dont really care about vacuum strength either i thought maybe ls would be worth trying instead plus its cheaper what are your impressions of it unfortunately toydemon was out of stock when black friday rolled around    i dont think gyaru is much of a theme since gaudy clothing and dark skin dont really mean anything applied to what an onahole might feel like but as for the usual uterus suggestions  has you covered opinions on gokusai uterus seem to be all over the place

does anybody have any experience bringing onaholes new or old on your carry on luggage when crossing security at an airport    like for example you buy one in japan or hong kong and you put it in your carry on wanting to take it home
  thats nasty man i bought one was happy with it so my friends bought one too from the same seller
  friend of mine did that there was a stop in russia or somewhere and the old lady at the checkpoint did check his luggage he bought a medium sized hip lots of glaring but no problems
  yes i was caught with a sex toy at security and was executed on the spot

how does a hp thread exist without meeting the necessary maria quota
  how does a hp thread exist without meeting the necessary shit quota
  hmm
  sasuga americachan
  because we are contrarians and we dont like the best member of the group
  the best member of the group  she can barely be considered best girl of the worst gen
  maria is a textbook good idol in a group completely devoid of personality sure if you dropped her in any other era she wouldnt be anything special but right now the rest of the group makes her look good
  maachan more charismatic  ikuta more beautiful
  what personality does she have baseball is not a personality
  maria is a textbook good  kek  now ive read anything
  not him but shes  a huge childish baby  like masaki but more pathetic
  very clean tongue and teeth
  maachan doesnt have much going for her except her personality though shes pretty average on everything except her unique personality if it wasnt for that she wouldnt be the most popular member
      mariafag can you give me your top 5 hp idols im curious to whom mariafags think is pretty and so so

i wish other girls would actually put effort in like cg  seems like too many girls dont give a shit    
  how many non cg girls do you follow
  a bunch but i wish they were all aggressively competitive like cg is
  its because they were taught by the best
  lmao
  cute close up of kikkers
  morito  putting in effort
  i miss her
  she put in effort until they started injecting her with heroin or quaaludes when she joined morning musume
  cute close up of kikkers
  nice narrative
  its obvious that you dont follow hp from that comment or that you  are trolling so i think our discussion is done
  i have no argument
  why did they sell so poorly though
  its weird and sad that they dont include inaba in these dvd mags or cg events she spent 2 years with them right from the beginning uf logic in a nut shell
  inaba is the one that doesnt want to you moron
  give me proof or your speaking out of ur ass she loves the group
  why didnt she rejoin cg now that shes healthy again whats with yanas reaction when she saw that she was the one to join jj and is now leaving altogether
  she was in this dvd magazine but i dont think she was in cg or jj at the time just hokkaido kss leader or some shit
  shes being a mushroom btw    shes being a carrot btw    so kawaii
  i dont think you can rejoin something you left its like announcing your graduating and then decide to change your mind and come back never happens i dunnooo
sugoi
  geez they did a number on her  looks like cgi
  but joining another group instead is fine because
  because she didnt graduate from jj
    wait i think im on to something example is tanaka reina if she knew her group would be total dog shit she would have never left mm the money she made in lovendor was nothing like she made in mm just my thoughts could be completely wrong and inaba is just a bitch
   looks like cgi  cgi like computergenerated imagery or  meaning you would like to have sex with someone you think is very attractive looking
  idols making money  idols seeing any of the money that they make
  they photoshopped her too much so that she doesnt look real
   if she knew her group would be total dog shit she would have never left mm the money she made in lovendor was nothing like she made in mm   jodan desu    the do something with the light i dont think that she was photoshopped sayumin kawaii
  do you actually think their pay has anything to do with sales
  dont test my idol knowledge buddy she made a lot of money as the ace of morning she even said she bought  whatever she wanted and expensive brand name things when she joined lovendor it all stopped and had to be more smart with money
  she talked abut it on this dudes show
    shouldnt you be running out of money to spend at the local cibercafé
  why didnt she rejoin cg now that shes healthy again  first pregnancy isnt a disease   second  if you think the girls have any say in the business i have bad news for you
  tanaka  ace
  if she knew her group would be total dog shit she would have never left mm  shes the reason her group is total dog shit
   local cibercafé  when her producers create sayuminvocaloid
  when her producers would create sayuminvocaloid
  unironically this marin yuki and marina are all fairly talented musicians marin less so but she cute and it made absolutely no sense for that group to have two vocalists
  and she has even less money now that she killed lovendor av debut imminent
  
  why are you question marking sir
  doesnt look like any idol
  her name is in the top right
  doesnt look like her
  the short hair and lip shape arent clear enough for you
  doesnt look anything like her
  i dont know what you want me to tell you you might have vision issues
stop eating
  gotta get something in her mouth
  maybe yanamin is leaving because she knows her armpit fat boobs cant compete with those manakas
  dont bully her
who wouldve thought that cg will be a sexual group at the start i thought they will be an innocent cutesy hps every photo release of the members half naked are getting hotter and hotter
  no one could have predicted that 3 out of 6 japanese girls would end up having nice racks it was statistically improbably and im glad management did the right thing
bros how many iq i need for that she liked me
  shes against miscegenation sorry

  i like bitchy cunt airi  shes shown her true nature and shes not a nice girl what would she have to do to make you not like her
2 yrs sought for exgirl group idol yoshizawa over hitandrun    
   shes shown her true nature and shes not a nice girl   i dont blame her sometimes cinderella can be a witch   what would she have to do to make you not like her  i dont know she is so diligent i want her to succeed
how can you talk about her badly she is kawaii
  because airi is useful for tax write offs and maybe a bit of money laundering shes so good for it that uf is about to give her a second album lovendor not so much
    airi is useful for tax write offs and maybe a bit of money laundering   have you any proofs
    without the rest of cute and buono to share screen time it becomes more evident how much of a bitch she is
  can you say something in fact without girls hysterics
  the fact is she dated two guys at the same time in college and one of them was a chinese supremacist
  shell end up ruined and we all know what japanese women do when theyre broke 3
   the fact is she dated two guys at the same time in college  lol what   one of them was a chinese supremacist  wtf  i dont believe you she is a pure virgin
  
the chad bf vs the virgin wota lol      its disgusting would be better if i didnt know this information
also this story remind me of recent incident with reina
  ok i dont need to see anymore im already convinced enough to make this an instant purchase
theyre making us wait 2 more days      something to help get us by in the meantime  
  spent 32 million yen advertising her budokan dvd which probably only sold 4000 copies uf isnt that dumb so either the ad spend was a write off or they are cooking the books to hide income from elsewhere and make it look like it came from dvd sales exact numbers arent reported by oricon so uf can make up any number they want to internally probably a combination of both
happy 19th birthday kaga
   probably a combination of both  its really stranger things but i think there has an explanation for it  but im upset what if sayumin like when dicks poke her
  because you are gay
kids containment thread when
rumours   kobushi factory new member announcement on friday   morning musume 15th generation on budokan day one 12/15

  having to look at nonakas disgusting face  not bad

nigaki heckling in her first years in the group was true i checked their introductions at their first filmed concert and cameraman even showed audience while she was doing it and it seemed like they didnt like her indeed

  another chance for kirara
  how is that possible  whats inside 
  cunt meat
  why is it on dailymotion in 480

  i sorta agree now that angerme is out of the question for the time being i think id like to see her join jj once yanamin graduates
  i think id like to see her                gone               
  enough with these jokes no more uggos
  let her rot in kss at her own expense like dozens of uggos before her

     130    i actually thought you were just talking shit but after watching ayuni d solo project doco where the boss dude watanabe asked ayuni what she thought she was called in for her first instant thought was tax return this was taken in feb and japan has to file tax returns in march you know your stuff lol but i dont think uf is as shady as wack
  features of japanese culture  no it isnt
  yo stop yo shitposting for a moment
  mmmhm yes it is
  except that most citizens there are not required to file them and thats not what she says
  i dont actually know what yaeba means
  who the fuck is ayuni gross
  features of japanese culture
the perfect uf idol doesnt exi
  it will take some time to fix that uf needs to give her braces right on its not how the true yaeba should look  other than that she seems quite cute
  if she was perfect i would know her name
  you need to study your uf son
cuties
  but not uf
    a cute genius who learned to play bass in 7 months shes a real not hp
  man i dont know what she said correct me if you want my japanese is baby level      i post when i want
  what did you just say to me fag
just miki
  why are you posting nonboomer idols
  what if miki was laundering money for japanese goverment in usa    because im not boomer
horror movie gf with really nice boobs but she will never ever show them to you
  uf just sends nonaka to the us so they dont have to deal with her at the office for a few days at a time
  i think miki has nice relationships with other members group and administration  by the way she could make subs for clips in her free time
  she looks 100 times better without clothes she isnt actually chubby but she looks that way clothed
  the whole mizuki has a nice soft quality to her
  i know this sounds like a fat woman excuse but fuku just has a wide frame compared to other members that big watermelon head doesnt help either though
  wow she has a sporty tummy
im sure she will be cry on graduation
dudes i understood important thing yesterday as you know the day will come when sayumin wil be my gf and i need bring that day closer i can do it but first i have to be better so i will start reading 12 rules for life which was recomended for me on /litthats all i wanted to say
  you should probably learn moon runes and stop posting here first
  sigh ive told him many times to stop crossdressing in public
happy 20th birthday karin
  yeah same happened to kago when she initially joined didnt get fat yet she already looked big due to her boxy frame but she didnt have much fat on her stomach actually
      i remember a interview where she complained about bikini shots
  happy birthday best idol

how many pages did you read today
200 pages of anki cards
  theres nothing wrong with this
  i already did that one anything else even a scan is fine but i want a real one from the new version post 2010 i think
  in less than 36 hours you will have this information in your hands  itll work out in the end
remember to eat some カツ for the big day tomorrow fellow test takers
  how do i measure a vn in pages
does anyone have that document of kanji count for various books the djt library doesnt show it anymore for some reason im curious how many unique kanji are in date a live
  no one knows where to find archive of the old test i cant find any no matter how hard i look the few times i do find some they look too old
vns arent reading so you dont
  it does show it if you sort by kanji count or open up the series index
  oh i see it thanks
  thanks anon
i discovered the secret to learning japanese when drunk i understand 9999 of everything i read i can regonize and somehow guess how to read things i never seen before i have read 30 pages without touching a dictionary hell i feel that i can make my own dictionary too tired now have good night friends
  how do i say flat ass in japanese
平たい尻
フラットアッス
愛蘭製尻
i dont understand how to learn grammar i cant remember any of it ill read a sentence and know what all the words are but not get a basic grammar point that ive looked up 10 times fuck me up the fucking ass
誰でもフィンランド人は明日jlptしている
nani the fuck
hello pretty peoples  カワジャパのキュアドリーです
  いいえ馬鹿ですかあんた
  you dont learn grammar you acquire it you aquire it by reading a lot and listening a lot
hello pretty peoples  わたしはゲイ
    でしょねええ
  outside of me trying to learn to read it are there any sources you would recommend for learning proper pronunciation i tend to get more than a little bit of this wrong from sources i hear later on well unless those are wrong /
learn the ipa or dont be a stupid anglo
  
pitch accent more like bitch accent
tabeta backary dah
  subs2srs a bunch of anime/jdrama do each line you capture untill you sound like them  it helps with reading too and since you subvocalize while reading youre just crippling yourself not studying pronouncement as you go  you can fix it later but i think it would take more work later and practicing speech is good for memorizing vocab and whatnot
at least she dont say bocka
you need to listen to 10000 hours of japanese to be able to come to hear all the nuance of pronunciation until that happens you cant pronounce things properly so dont worry about how you sound until that time comes
reminder to set your interval modifier to 150
is the pomodoro technique a meme
idk any kind of time management routine that you actually stick to is really good    apathetic waffling literally wastes your precious life
  idk when i first tried it it was great but then i started cheating out of it and avoiding doing it altogether now that im a bit more conciencious it might work better but i dont wanna trade 50 efficiency for 95 but then burn out and get neither
  if you have concentration issues no  if you are a normal human yes
a zoomers brain is fundamentally and permanently crippled when it comes to not being a piece of shit    they need jesus more than pomodoro
    on a scale of 1 to 10 whats the difficulty of this article 2 maybe
its on nhk ez    so its ez/10
  so the son did it right
  where does one find jesus
  breaking concentration for 5 minutes every time you enter flow state is dumb as hell so yes
  genki/10 its fake japanese made for foreigners
  does it take 20 minutes to get there
this is damaging too its ok to let them read the ez news and feel good about it    as long as they are staying subjected to real ninja shit outside of that its zenzen heikidayo
  it does for me at least the first 20 minutes of reading feel like they go longer than the next 40
how long have you blah blah blah
  fair  i dont like the intervals of pomodoro myself  seems like a starting point if you cant get anything done though
just do something    be about it
i am doing something    its ur mum
no youre not youre just talkin about it    you aint doin it you aint bein about it
bitches that talk about it but aint about it    where i come from we call them ninjas ho ass ninjas
yeah alright fuck tatoeba time to make the jj chenji    
aint nothin to it but to do it bitch    and im doin it
jews control the media google it biographical information on the people who are in charge of major media corporations is available in plain sight for anyone who cares to look it up
id rather look up hentai bitches skirts lol
  you certainly are ho 
  why do brainlets always say   jews did everything bad  there are several payoffs to this strategy  1saves you studying politics history economics religion and nuance instead blame jews and work your way backwards using mental gymnastics  2 stops you from doing something about your sad life if jews are the reason wite wimmin wont date you or the reason you are unemployed fat anti social then you cant do anything about it theres no need for you to exert yourself to make lasting change

explain to me your process when reading manga what do you do to learn
  i read the words and look at the pictures to ascertain the details of the story
  everything you understand any of is progress  just read more
  there is no process because manga isnt reading
how can i read manga if manga isnt reading
the answer is simple    read it
  you clearly feel very strongly about this  would you care to explain why it isnt
taking n4 jlpt test tomorrow this is my first time taking the test what should i expect ive got more or less poor grammar but solid vocab skills and have 8k words in my study log so far so probably 5k matured any advice as well im nervous
lol
  i just carry on the torch of the original poster whenever i see blasphemous speech     what the fuck are you nervous about there are 0 consequences regardless of how you do
  some form of proof of my education on it and 60 aint cheap for my broke ass also been doing nip for 4 or so years ive wanted this for a long time
its always been a dream of mine to not only be bad at nihongo but pay japanese jews to certify me of such    lmao
  elitist weeb faggot circlejerking over fucking anime and a language  no one cares about you fuck off
you cared enough to get insta buttflusty and reply
if being able to read something isnt enough proof of education lmoa    and you actually need to drop money like that lmoa    looks like youll need proof of a brain first lmoa    tsugi ni omae wa poorfag lmoa
  4 years  n4
thats what the numbers are for right    you get n5 when youre 5 years in and thats the highest honour    thats the one nuke marine has
  the good news is that if you cant pass n4 after  four years you may qualify for social assistance
  if 60 is a lot to you why waste it on a useless test getting n4 out of all things doesnt make you better at japanese and its bad enough to not help you get a job    next time buy some jav
jamal real talk do you even speak japanese
im glad nuke is larping as someone with an interest in reading cause now when he reads rude things about him here    he wont be so hurt
kihontekini yes lol
  it wasnt 4 years of intense study
nihontekini yes lol
geitekini yes lol
does nip pussy smell like salmon or tuna
you gotta be intense if you want to get good at japanese
rotten albacore    get a native in here to vet this post
native here im a virgin lol cant vet shit but my dick
reminder no one browses djt anymore because avataring autist lurk this general and probably cant speak/read japanese for shit
lmoa at the 31 other people hes calling nobodies
nani 
btw that was my nuke chan impression
  i know your the same retard to because your being a turbo autist because he actually thinks yous are a fucking currency
to be honest i like when the threads go to shit
  lol it took me a minute but i got it i see you dude very nice        this is me
lol these threads die because nobody is learning japanese anymore  everyone is switching over to chinese 
  tadds 5 new cards a day  inb4 hurrr anki grind
  if they arent they should be so they are ready for the new world order
  agreed  plenty of faggots on /int/ who were formerly learning japanese have recently switched over to chinese  such a great sight to see 
is chinese easier
you have a better chance learning chinese to read cn translated vns anyway lol
no cause all chinese media is hella boring     like youd have to be a literal chinaman to enjoy that shit
  the fuck at 8k words your ass should be taking the n2 at a minimum if thats beyond you then your dumb ass should be reading japanese two hours a day and watching japanese four hours a day
yes chinese is easier far less grammatical bullshit to deal with and having the language all in hanzi actually works well for it  and you can find some fun chinese media i suggest 奇葩说 as a good one  爱奇艺 is just a good website in general
  nuke must be n10 at this point then
  i hardly study grammar these days or read im not at all ready for n2 and i said 5k matured from the shitty core decks
  what are you learning for if you dont read
i want to move to japan so i can finally lose my virginity
godspeed
nihong a go go
  language can be spoken you know
  do you have friends in japan
  no since i dont live there
  manga is reading but the density and lack of literary narration wont give you the same results as reading novels
  so who are you going to talk to
  nobody im not the n4 guy i was just sayin you can use a language to talk ya feel
it takes two to tango dont forget to grind out a personality as well    dont wanna have nothing but flashcards to talk about    ya dig
hows this for a nice lil ice breaker    
  try learning a language without knowing how to read not saying its impossible 
  uh ok you strawmanning cause you bored or what homie
  true but reading manga on the way to novels is better than jumping straight to novels and burning out because theyre too hard
  you dont need to study grammar you need to read and read some more look just take the stupid test and get back to reading
does it help to sleep with manga under your pillow
  up your game make the manga your pillow
  why do you guys hate the jlpt so much i know its a meme test but employers and normies dont know that
haha look i passed the jlpt n1  now you can be my friends and i get a job in aerophysics xd
  unless your job requires it i dont see the point of getting any of them especially getting any lower than n1
  because nobody here learns to talk to people or gain employment
thanks to japanese i stop mixing up vertical and horizontal  because of 縦 and 盾
got through an integrated approach to intermediate japanese and most of 上級のtobira  i should be ready for n3 tomorrow and n2 next year right
is there anything that comes close in comfy levels

i wish japan would open the immigration flood gates and allow anyone with a n1 in i dont want to get a meme degree
why would they let people who dont know japanese in without a degree or other proof of societal worth
just get a bachelor of arts take japanese uni classes and while youre at it take an intro to world history course so you can realize why thats a bad idea
  what do you think youd be doing there without a degree
test day tomorrow fags what level are you taking are you prepared
  what do people without degrees even do manual labor and being a customer service punching bag
im taking whatevers after this
  its not hard to find your own path to money dude    but if youre a chump thats part of the giant mass of scrubs that get funneled through mainstream society things are a lot harder because you dont have the ability to think for yourself
  oh right because of bill gates theres a lot of college dropouts who think theyre smart and successful like him w
make excuses and dump it on someone else it just proves my point
oh also dont invest in bitcoins lmao
if tkyosam can get permanent residency anyone can
  this is from 2010 i think nuke got worse since then
  now this is troubling
hes exactly the same what youre witnessing is the power of having a script
that was my only conclusion as well but it sounds like he actually knew some of the words he was saying like intuitively and then you know hed spit some kinda slurry mess after that    shoutouts to the wife at the end
nukemarine is epic
damn his wife was still skinny back then
day 27
  imagine being married to nukemarine how does she do it he must have a big dick or something
its called settling
  hes damn near about the same he said he had to work a lot though  im just glad im a neet and can dedicate a few years to this
has nuke ever talked about why he started learning japanese
  how do this work you can damn 0s on listening and reading and still be considered n3 the hell
  if it twists your nuts that much just have a minimum in each category like this    n5  10 points  n4  20 points  n3  30 points  n2  40 points  n1  50 points    so for n3 you need to be at least 150 overall and 30 points in each category
  yeah he said it was because he was stationed in japan when he was in the navy
has anyone bought any recently released books the library really needs an update
  after a fruitful career in the us navy he decided what he really wanted out of life was to be a 全国各地を揺るがす playa str8 outta 横須賀市
  what you need more books you havent read
  i just want more recent stuff
shameful zoomer behaviour on display here
jlpt n1 is the only one you should ever take and only for job qualifications the order you learn grammar in is completely arbitrary というか is n1 for example words are a little more understandable also for that reason going up to someone and saying youre n3 or n1 is the cringiest thing ever because it doesnt actually accurately portray your language ability like at all
ファンダメンダマウス   i wanted to read this one if anybody knows how to get it
  the words are pretty bad too but only because of the dumb emphasis on student work and political vocabulary
      hope that helps
  n1 is also good for japanese university obviously for courses in japanese but even if you are taking courses in english or want to transfer into 2nd or 3rd year sometimes fluency in japanese is required by administration and n1 is accepted proof of that
i wouldnt say the jlpt grammar order is arbitrary just that youre misunderstanding the level that n1 is at which is basically intermediate というか might as well be intermediate compared to n5 stuff like です in the grand scheme of things
big unko
  why nothing is difficult about というか its the combination of 2 n5 grammar points in a very easytounderstand way it also shows up a lot in real japanese so its not even particularly rare jlpt orders grammar in a way with no logic behind it if you just read and listened a lot then you would acquire というか in the first month tops it comes very fast in any natural order krashen that i can come up with
n5  absolute beginner earned in 3 months  n4  beginner earned in another 3 months  n3  upper beginner earned in additional 6 months  n2  lower intermediate earned in another 9 months   n1  intermediate earned in an additional 15 months   total time for approximately intermediate nowhere near advanced let alone fluent let alone native level 3 years   think thats bad just wait until the pitch grind after you reach advanced
yeah i mean who cares in the end its just a test if you study for it youll pass it who cares about the grammar order or whatever anyways its not like grammar is the hard part about japanese anyways
    i actually have lots of recent books but theyre all jpegs if someone could share a good ocr guide id be happy to make epubs
should i try to remember everything in tae kim or just read it and refer back when im confused
  easiest way to memorize tae kim is through anki
  skim it then do dojg deck
  you use tae kim as a reference that you come back to repeatedly until it sticks without looking anything up
you should not srs japanese  english grammar translations if you dont want to deal with undoing the translation habits it builds
  grammar shitters actually believe this  this is the actual list backed up by research by krashen and terrell    preproduction stage only listening no production some people skip this stage especially adults who can already physically produce speech synonymous with the silent period which is necessary to consolidate new grammar and information about 500 words in lexicon    early production stage very limited speech usually only a few words at a time not complete sentences about 1000 words    speech emergence able to communicate with simple sentences but makes a lot of errors about 3000 words    intermediate fluency able to speak multiclause sentences but still makes many errors about 6000 words    advanced fluency near native level about what a 57 year old native would have
tell me about the first time you spoke japanese in person im imagining my first time when i go to japan next year    500 yen ni narimasu   hai
btw krashen doesnt know japanese so thats all irrelevant
  
  can somebody get this man an ocr guide
  is there a way to watch gaki online
  pitch grind  only retards believe in this shit    you dont have to grind your pitch accent this comes naturally and as long as others can understand you you are golden    you want to know what is the hard part  seeing a 400 pound weeb who cant say one word in a social interaction      also  n5  absolute beginner earned in 3 months  n4  beginner earned in another 3 months  n3  upper beginner earned in additional 6 months  n2  lower intermediate earned in another 9 months   n1  intermediate earned in an additional 15 months     it really depends personally i would say n5/n4/n3/n2 are literally retarded what do they even prove also you dont write in japanese and dont talk japanese so this test is more or less just some kind of starting point to get you to a job interview    also n1 is pretty hard to really put into any classification if you want to know japanese on a university level n1 is like a joke and not even considered intermediate    if you only want japanese for anime and low tier employment/communication most of n1 is literally useless    the biggest reason n1 is so hard for many people is because you dont read any of those words this is the reason most people fail n1 if you just take japanese classes like in school or any other low tier education outside of japan and only read easy stuff you wont learn any of those    you could say the n1 test is more or less just a test for people who have learned specifically for this test also the pass requirements are easy and if in doubt you can just pick something randomly    personally i still like the jlpt but it is pretty much only for people who study alone and want to prove something if you took classes in japanese or have any degree in japanese the jlpt test is worthless
  with a tutor on italki  id never spoken before but because i had focused on reading and listening i had a decent vocabulary and we understood each other pretty easily
have you tried the internet    also lol yea freaking out over pitch accent is a thing scrubs who havent watched 10000 hours of anime do
real linguist here    n5  cant read your favorite porn games yet  n1  can read your favorite porn games but might have to look up some shit if the authors wiki dump on your ass
   yen ni narimasu  i kinda zone them out but its actually more like  500 yen ni choudai itashimasu    first time i spoke japanese in person  they asked where i was from i said america then they said ooh sugoi nihongo jouzu desu ne  the first actual meaningful conversation i had a guy was talking to me and his wife came out and told him hes an idiot and to speak slower for me
  in an additional  is this bait  theres a few people who passed the n1 in 1 year plenty who do it in 2 years and youre pretty much retarded if you cant do it in 3
n1  2 months  n2  4 months  n3  6 months  n4  9 months  n5  1 year total  if you are going try hard mode
pass n1 in a year  cant produce a simple sentence without stumbling over yourself and restarting the sentence twice as you organize the words in your head  epic use of time
  maybe thats the case for you cause youre retarded lol
just watch more anime ftw
  teach english but you need a degree for that too i would honestly do manual labor too
  dont memorize tae kims grammar rules at the most add the sentences to anki where the only thing you care about is what the sentence means even thats not needed if you start reading as then just refer back to  which has the dojg series
help me ruin 2chan     i was shooting heroin and reading the fountainhead in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in i put a quarter in the radio to activate it it was the chief    私有パトロールカーで麻薬をやりながらthe fountainheadを読みました突然ラジオが鳴れたラジオに50円玉を入れた部長だった  worse somebody just stole four hundred and fortyseven million dollars worth of bitcoins    もっとほどいな事だ誰かが500億円分のビトコインを盗んだ    the heroin needle practically fell out of my arm what kind of monster would do something like that bitcoins are the ultimate currency virtual anonymous stateless they represent true economic freedom not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government do we have any leads    ヘロイン針が腕から落ちるほどびっくりしたどんな化け物はそういう事するビトコインは世界の一番理想な通貨 仮想匿名政治と繋がらない究極な経済自由を代表して世界の政治の操作から無敵手掛かりがありますか    not yet but mark my words were going to figure out who did this and were going to take them down  provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so    まだだなでも僕の言葉を覚えて誰かした人を見つけて逮捕する誰かが市価を支払う次第に    easy chief i said any rate the market offers is by definition fair    安心して部長定義によって市場が提供する価格は市価だ    he laughed thats why youre the best i got lisowski now you get out there and find those bitcoins    部長が笑うそうだリオウスキは    dont worry i said im on it    安心しろと言った僕に任せ    i put a quarter in the siren ten minutes later i was on the scene it was a normal office building strangled on all sides by public sidewalks i hopped over them and went inside    サイレンに50円玉を入れた十分後に現場に到着しました普通なビル歩道に囲まれた避けながら中に入った    home depot presents the police i said flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of ron paul nobody move unless you want to they didnt    shimachu会社は警察を提供いたしますと言ながら拳銃気とron paul の小さな写真を見せた動きたい方以外皆動くな 誰も動けなかった
bought genki  only read the first section  immersed and studied naturally for 3 month   finally go through the book   already figured out 90 of this stuff on my own  i think had i used the book it would have slowed me down
  yea im not reading all that 69 decides what i read next
  who are you quoting
idk how long ive been studying certainly not even 6 months but i know i made a post about my 1st month reading i just dont know how long ago that was my curiosity wants to to check the archives but at the same time i dont want to burden my mind with comparing my time studying to how much i know  thanks for reading this blog
  to find out how much smarter youve gotten since you first started all you have to do is revisit the first thing you tried to read  if it gets you down just remember that language learning isnt a fuckin race      kinnikuman
so is jcat safe they dont even have 
  mad because bad
mad cuz bad lol
  its the case for anyone who studies specifically for jlpt because jlpt    1 does not test speaking  2 as mentioned above repeatedly has fucked grammar and word learning order many grammar even a kid often uses is completely absent too  3 uses artificial sounding japanese like you would find in the genki books
jlpt is definitely the kind of test you just drill specifically for with materials that target it and otherwise ignore all that bullshit because youre watching 10000 hours of anime ftw
why does learning a new language make my head hurt i dont like it when my head hurts so that makes me not want to learn a new language
  the brain is a muscle work out and feel the burn
tfw your down time consists of reading lns and watching japanese shows so youre basically learning japanese for free while others approach it as something they need to take a break from and talk up how difficult it is to learn which makes people think your smart even though all you did was watch tv and read porn books
increase the amount of fats in your diet and drink lots of water also increase your pages read and listening hours critical mass
  replace heroin with shabu if you want to localize the whole thing
increase the amounts of fruits and fish you eat and drink lots of water gradually increase your pages read and listening hours as you get use to the workout your brain is going through realtalk the reason why your brain is hurting is because you never use it
just eat hot pockets for max time efficiency    dont even waste time heating them up just eat cold dont even waste time taking them out of the wrapper or out of the box
just eat cold raw manga
i mean reading is literally a physical exercise that can tire a person out like thats a thing
how does a ninja read a book and get tired
  mad af
  it even happens w/ english language books motherfucker have you ever cracked open virginia woolf i quadruple dog dare you to get through more than 10 pages of this without snoozing      nihongo books are cooler than this but theyll still tucker you out
i dont want to do rtk anymore  maybe if there was a premade deck but making up stories by yourself is exhausting as shit i cant make 100 cards a day
  what a lark what a plunge for so it had always seemed to her when with a little squeak of the hinges which she could hear now she had burst open the french windows and plunged at bourton into the open air how fresh how calm stiller than this of course the air was in the early morning like the flap of a wave the kiss of a wave chill and sharp and yet for a girl of eighteen as she then was solemn feeling as she did standing there at the open window that something awful was about to happen looking at the flowers at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising falling standing and looking     jesus fucking christ   this is why i only read nonfiction
  rtk is a fucking meme just take the dip and learn the raw way rtk is like feeding a baby artificial shit forever and never giving them actual food or regular milk chances are if your sick of it you arent scared of kanji anymore anyway
  woolf  haha  no  haha  hhaaah  hahahaha  seriously no
  how about i just 
jlpt in a few hours im gonna fail it and quit djt forever out of shame
  its not all fiction its just that modernism is trash you may have noticed already that wwii basically marked the end of high civilization in europe and america and art of all kinds has regressed into absolute garbage since then
  im not scared of kanji i want to handwrite them and not freeze when i see a rare kanji out of the words i learned it in and cant recall the meaning or whether ive ever even seen it before
  wwi
  writing shit down in the day and age we live in  i mean you could if it helps i just dont see the point i used nihongoshark deck and just reviewed it for a few years and eventually dropped it vocab helps me now and its easier to distinguish them now
  the fact that you even bothered opening the link makes you the realest motherfucker in this thread anon
  theres good stuff in modernism i really like some of their work but christ some of them are awful  if youve never read faulkners sanctuary i highly recommend it though hes the nisio isin of english in terms of how difficult he is to understand  actually maybe hes even dare i say it romeo
just slow down on the rtk do it over the course of a year or something do it so slowly you dont even think about it throughout the day it doesnt teach you japanese just how to write chinese characters so think of it like a little task to make progress on each day instead of something tantamount to your studies
  i could do rtk13 in a month if i had a premade deck that has one example word with the kanji in question in kana and a premade story but nuh uh ninja    none of the premade decks have japanese words with them because idiots think its a good idea to spend 6 months doing rtk before they start learning japanese so clue words are completely useless to them also the formats and bloat information are retarded
i think i fucked up at dokkai
  myötis ja sinipilleröity
i mean if youre fluent then you it should take you a second or two to press the spacebar and type a japanese word next to the rtk keyword lets say thats 6000 seconds for all 3000 kanji so not even three hours of typing in japanese words
jlpt soon and only slept for 3 hours desu
waapurobakas out of my nihongo sure ok
  lets do our best anon
what are the benefits for having passed a test in jlpt anyway
does anybody have a japanese audio book they recommend     long solo trip tomorrow
  ok now write nabiku with a pencil
  validation probably
他人と本の話がしたくてもできない彼女は思う存分本について語り本が読みたくても読めない俺はその話を思う存分聞くというちょっとした持ちつ持たれつの間柄だ  this is the longest sentence ive ever understood without having to reread it i feel like i am making a little progress
sorry if this is a bad questions but how do i actually go about learning japanese  im reading the guide and i dont understand where to start do i do grammar then vocab vocab then grammar both at once ive already got a decent grasp of the kanas though far from perfect is there some sort of program to follow or do i just figure it out myself
  feel do not think  listen to raws while you sleep and it will come naturally
  i dont think you will be able to learn it my dude sorry
buy a textbook and work through it if you think japanese is still cool at the end of that buy a manga and try reading it
  i mean half a decade of anime and music hasnt gotten me very far  maybe im just autistic
yeah but were they raws
  the music is but ill admit the anime is subbed
its cuz you didnt complete rtk before you started listening
  spend like a week or two reading a grammar guide of your choice  install ithvnr and yomichan  read lns or vns or manga or anything you can get your hands on  constantly refer back to grammar resources dictionary of japanese grammar handbook of japanese grammar when you dont understand stuff  if something feels too difficult then dont force it and pick something a little easier especially when youre first starting out  read kino no tabi and become epic nihongologist
genji monogatari in its original form has more in common with modern everyday japanese than music does
  so i can worry about kanji and vocab after im done with grammar thanks for the advice anon
austrian jlpt takers where you at
  id recommend doing them concurrently i forgot that part  download anki and do core2k or vncore both are available in the guide
  ok so core2kgrammar guide thanks
started out with duolingo courses but realizing now that its far from a great tool for learning japanese any recommendations
read the thread
  tut tut  if you wanna learn japanese for real heres what you do over and over  google a question you have that relates to japanese keep looking until you find something that clicks if you come across something else youre curious about as you do that go ahead and look into that first no rush     sample the japanese media that you know of pick whatever you feel like and try watching/listening/reading and pick something else if its not fun lookup stuff you dont get in a dictionary recite the sentence from memory    keep tabs on japanese learning communities let them find and evaluate sources etc for you take their reviews and advice with a grain of salt sorry in advance if the above advice winds up being so ineffective for you that you get mad just thinking about it
  it sounds a little more like i speak english
  thanks
  
  かってください
  keep your cancer back in  where you belong
  keep tabs on japanese learning communities  actually do the opposite avoid them at all costs
  rtk is not a meme its probably the single reason i was able to pass n1 in under 2 years dont diss rtk just because you failed with it and/or an idiot who never read the introduction of the book    if you dont have the selfdisicipline to stick through rtk you likely dont have the selfdiscipline to stick with japanese for the years required to reach fluency and will likely regret it later once the novelty of vocab/sentencemining wears off too though you dont have to stick with it you can always just come back to it later
  do you know how long it takes to make 100 rtk cards
  no time at all if you use premade decks correctly
add rtk deck to my anki  want the new cards in this deck to always show before the review  for some fucking reason this of all things is not an options group setting and if you turn it on it applies to every deck    why
  make an options group just for rtk whats the issue
ive been having trouble remembering words since i only recognize characters based on kanji which means that i cannot understand when something is written in hiragana or spoken  would it be a good idea to make my cards have the hiragana on the front and the kanjidefinition on the back
  say that its a universal setting not an options group setting  why not just make an options group    
  rtk is not a meme its probably the single reason i was able to pass n1 in under 2 years  congrats in 2 years you passed a test with literally no production tests ie speaking you do realize that written language is not language right its a representation being able to read and write does not mean you know japanese sorry to burst your bubble    it may actually be better to learn japanese first then go back and learn kanji  because then it will fit into a framework you already possess the only reason you may consider not doing this is because some compelling content is missing furigana that and i like kanji are the only real reasons to do something like rtk doing rtk just to have an easier time stroking your penis thanks to your n1 cert is not a reason
  youre right that rtk is dumb but saying written language is not language is even dumber
  honestly only people who havent actually tried rtk or those who think its some kind of isolated thing you study as opposed to supplementary think its stupid i mean if you have a photographic memory rtk is probably useless for you but it has helped me tremendously    i learned to read the first 1600 words just by doing trial and error in anki once a new kanji came up that looked similar to another one it would start throwing me off and id start reading words i had already learned wrong now i still learn readings of kanji solely through vocabulary as isolated kanji study with readings is just fucking insanity you need a memory hook to learn readings or youll end up killing yourself or giving up anyways i did 50 new kanji per day using rtk took me like 4 weeks and my retention was around 75 most of the time but now i simply never have trouble recognizing a kanji anymore and through knowing how its written what it consists off and what rough meaning it has it becomes far far easier to remember new vocabulary and retain it my vocabulary retention has jumped to 93    of course everyone is different and different methods work for different people but if youre frustrated with kanji and struggling rtk might just be the solution i dreaded the idea of learning to write all these kanji before i started but it was actually kind of fun in a way i only did the 2200 core kanji though    obviously if someone were to do rtk by itself without anything else that would be beyond stupid but i think most of the rkt haters in here are just people who are scared of wasting time looking at it from a different perspective i can kind of understand handwriting is not required in this day and age after all especially if youre not planning on living in japan
  braille is a language
  ive tried rtk and it wasnt difficult i was doing it fine but it was boring and id rather read compelling content some of us want to learn the language i turn your statement around and say that only people who dont understand language learning theory think that they have to begin grinding kanji at such early stages
  1800 words isnt an early stage  i probably would recommend doing rtk right from the get go either i also never said that rtk or grinding kanji is required to learn japanese i simply said that it helped me personally and that its not a complete waste of time
  wouldnt  fuck
  1800 words isnt an early stage  it kind of is    im not saying rtk is a waste of time just that i did it benefited from it but weighed the benefits against what i could have been doing decided it wasnt worth it for me and dove into reading without finishing rtk right now taking a break to djt shitpost im playing dragon quest on my japanese 3ds with ease been studying a year and a half wasted about 9 months of that time on genki textbooks i consider that wasted time
      manga isnt reading though
  latin is not a language
  latin is a dead language one of the criteria for being a language is that you can create utterances which hold meaning you cannot utter with writing
  you could have done 400 kanji in rtk over 1 month instead of 2200 and the result would have been the same  youre familiar with more kanji already but you dont need rtk for this  i was the same as you had a hard time with new vocab because i was clueless about kanji it all looked like scribbles to me then instead of anki droning which wasnt succesful for me at all i went and got some actual experience with kanji studied radicals extensively browsed jisho tried making sense of stroke order and writing new vocab  after a while i just got better at it and my vocab retention naturally got better too
    who the fuck are you quoting
  congrats in 2 years you passed a test with literally no production tests ie speaking  i can output fine and i said in under 2 years youre also not making the point that you think youre making because rtk is production youre just cementing that you dont actually have any idea what youre talking about  you do realize that written language is not language right  lol so this is the intellect of the average person who is too stupid to understand the benefits of rtk ill give you 2/10 for effort if youre serious
    rtk is production  explain to my tiny brain that doesnt have any idea what its talking about  also since you can output just fine ive done the honor of preparing an easy page for you to read with your n1 level      i await being educated by one of such esteem as yourself

  だが断る
  just watch game center cx my dude
english revolution  french révolution  spanish revolución  japanese 革命    why does the only good nonenglish media in the world have to be made in this fucking impossibly hard language and not something piss easy like spanish fucking damnit

  dont you mean 再回
how the fuck do you improve speaking and listening  i just did n5 today the first 2 sections are simple af since im 2k in anki and do some light reading every now and then listening was a traiwreck tho  how do i practice listening and speaking finding a friend to talk to irl is hard enough nevermind them speaking japanese
  heres the secret watch 実況 on youtube im not bsing ive done nothing productive japanesewise for the past year and a half but watch 実況 on youtube and occasionally anime ftw and my listening has gone from can barely follow conversations to can completely follow anything that involves everyday or gaming words
  you practice listening by just listening to things and following the story or whatever theyre doing maybe your favourite idol shows up in some tv show and talks about her relationship with the other idol    youll never be able to practice speaking without finding someone to speak with give up now
  subs2 srs for listening comprehension  lang 8 for speaking writing
  ask nuke he somehow was streaming his studying of terrace house with anki
  youre gonna make it friend
  thanks frendo ill give it a go    thanks for the advice i rarely watch videos dubbed in jap other than anime because it sounds scary af do you think i should pay for japanese class so i have the opportunity to speak    subs2 ooks cool thanks m8  is lang8 something useful tho or is it something like duolingo
  ive never took any language classes outside of obligatory ones in high school so no idea if you have the money to spend you could always try
  italki      also check out the whole channel  
開くひらく  開ける  開くあく  開ける  明く  明ける  空く  空ける  woah
  thank you nukemarine for crippling so many peoples japanese
wtf why would you think im him
  to be fair he didnt actually design the deck
  how do i practice listening and speaking  listening  by listening  speaking  by speaking and listening
  just befriend obasan on tandem for free instead    i play animal crossing with a 35 year old depressed saleswoman every week
now thats whats up cakes still good boys
  みんなの日本語
  how much do you get out of this
  half a decade  thats nothing try 10000 hours
  is lang8 something useful tho or is it something like duolingo    you write whatever you feel like talking about and natives correct you you must collect points for this by correcting other people entries in your native langue
  do more stuff in the language get better at language  anki boosts your vocab reading boosts everything but your listening and tons of content out there for listening  books on the subject are kind of a waste
rtk is not language production its writing chinese characters given an english word it doesnt mean you can write words from memory all of a sudden like natives can you still have to learn to write if you want to be literate but it should help you a little more compared to someone brute forcing writing like japs do also it should help you visually deconstruct kanji which makes it for easy lookup of unknown words but you dont need rtk to learn this skill its just a byproduct of writing kanji from memory and learning with heisigs primitives
  jlpt    a sense of accomplishment for normals only n2 and n1 matters if youre aiming for employment too be honest i took n4 to motivate myself on studying but it didnt work i procrastinated then i crammed for the last 3 days prior the exam yet i still managed to pass it it seemed that the stock knowledge i gained by lazily doing anki and watching anime w/o subs/reading vns did the work i realize this exam is pointless since i can pass it easily it cannot guage how good you are with japanese
is 草食系 the japanese equivalent to cuck
anyone taking the jlpt in nyc willing to meet up afterwards to go over the test and have gay butt sex    3

going to japan for the first time soon never spoken japanese for but have been doing my reps for 2 years how do i gain confidence to speak in japanese without feeling embarrassed by how bad it is
dont talk just to show how bad at japanese you are    talk because youre trying to do something unrelated to language
  never spoken japanese for but have been doing my reps for 2 years    have you been reading
  do you honestly not know the answer to that question
  youll be screwed for conversating unless a japanese person befriends you butthey also have a lot of respect for people learning their language so youll be appreciated but they wont want teach you  theyll just want you to practice english on unless youre super fluent in japanese
if you watched your 10000 hours of anime youll be fine just imitate the polite characters youve seen and when in doubt dont invent japanese
people here glorify n2 and n1 too much when all the levels are meant to just gauge your level of proficiency    employers dont ask what jlpt level youre at they ask for the equivalent meaning you could never have taken the test be fluent and still say youre equivalent to a n1 in which case youre still likely going to have to demonstrate your proficiency    passing n2 or n1 proves to you that youre at that level just like passing 3 4 or 5 no reason to discourage others from taking it if they want to
  yea i heard the same thing you dont really need any certificate if you know japanese it will be apparent really quickly
    yes obviously but ive done 100 of my study in my room on my computer so ill probably talk like a complete retard even if in my head i can pronounce it properly
  i havent done it myself so take my advice with a grain of salt but id recommend getting some conversational practice online before you go it couldnt hurt and shouldnt be expensive
get a kimono and an accordian and play polka ive seen it work for others
  the problem is that passing n1 apparently doesnt really mean shit according to some im not good at japanese in the least and the n1 practice test was extremely easy for me    from what i can tell n1 means that you can communicate with someone if they intentionally modulate their speech to be as clear and simple as possible as if they were writing a manual or explaining something to grade schoolers
its more like youre better than you think you are you just arent comparing youself to scrubs so you think you suck
  contand thats if you get a good score a 100/180 score is still passing but thats a complete joke
  i dont compare myself to others in that way its just the fact that if i listen to any native content television conversations or try and read internet posts and conversations etc i dont know what the fuck is going on    i can read manga light novels games etc but that represents a very narrow slice of the japanese language and are specifically crafted so the average retard can consume them
so basically you learned how to read otaku media which is a very specific form of the japanese language and havent put in the hours to learn natural speech patterns and sounds or how people actually talk to one another
for real though talking about how easy or hard the test is without actually passing it is a waste of time
this thread and the posts therein were a waste of time
thread always sounds like a bunch of n3s finding refuge here after hitting the wall
what is the wall
  book some sessions on italki  accept that your accent will be terrible but also keep in mind that nobody will care  around tokyo you wont need to speak in japanese often if you dont want to but everyone will be delighted if you make an effort  have fun
  a pink floyd album
definitly wont pass n2 this time but i am confident next time  also when will i get my result on the site they say march of next year but i cant wait that long when i am sure i failed
who cares if you pass or fail it makes no difference on your life or your nihongo ability
  it does since i wont be able to put it on my college resumee
how many pages did you read today manga and vn subcreatures dont reply
anyone in mit
muh college resume lmao    you know what people do when they see those    they throw them in the garbage immediately
lmao at matts crippling number of patrons he uploads fewer videos than when his channel wasnt pay to watch
  i read 10 news articles on nhk  and this week i finished my 40th and last graded reader
im still amazed he makes 2k a month for literally nothing
only thing you should take in college is public speaking and then drop out and get work experience while doing something you really like doing that has potential to make money  you can even conterfeit a degree and bullshit that you are already fluent in japanese unless they have japanese people there theyll never know the difference  i was making 20 an hour fresh out of high school doing graphc design work that i learned how to do the day before the interview  you can do anything you want in this world but dont go to a boring ass college for no reason but they do have some cute girls there and nice parties but its a waste of time from my experience
thats fuckin word uppercase me
  i mean i make 2k a week literally doing nothing and i even get to post on djt all day
  do you think anime and vns are some secret dialect obviously theres tropes but the vocabulary and grammar is mostly the same
and if all else fails just use basic desu masu to communicate its the proper thing to do anyway lol
  its all recorded by professional voice actors with very clear pronunciation irl people dont talk like that anime might help you understand the news since its also very clearly spoken but actual conversation or real life stuff like live action movies or dramas it is basically a different dialect in the way they slur words etc
theres literally nothing weird about the way ideas are expressed and you can use a lot of what you learn key word learn from your reading and i guess listening of the hentai games as long as you arent mimicking the 2d girls key word mimicing    this means you need to know japanese on some level fundamentally and intuitively to actually you know build on those skills    this is too advanced for djt tho
and thats not even getting into 役割語 which is actual made up language for fictional media such as anime and ln that doesnt exist irl
  when in doubt dont invent japanese  biggest rookie mistake there is
so basically yeah i think its very telling about the kind of language used in otaku media if you can read manga and visual novels but not understand television or regular conversation like that previous person attested to
  how does one make 2k doing nothing
youre only allowed to invent japanese if you have a high score on this test      find someone willing to give you money for something that is really mostly nothing
  find someone willing to give you money for something that is really mostly nothing
can i as a white guy make in a host club if i get really good at japanese     im really cute and can hold my liquor
the dojg deck is pretty efficient for finding out what you dont know/cant figure out  i think ill have finished it in about 5 days and found quiet a few things i needed to know and didnt
  one of the criteria for being a language is that you can create utterances which hold meaning you cannot utter with writing  big if true citation please
  there is a youtube video where a guy tried this the first 4 reject him and said japanese only but he eventually found one  it was pretty cheap too like 80 dollars for an hour and she would do anything he asked except sex unless she wanted to
you gotta be movie star quality
  a year and a half ago what were you reading and how hard was it  been trying to get a better picture of the level of comprehension people start pushing listening at
what the fuck what are all these n2 words doing here
  i think he wants to work there
  i can read manga  no you cant manga isnt reading      see above
    youre comparing reading to listening obviously it will be harder to listen in real time than read super slowly while looking up every word
minna genki  lol
its mina  mina genki
  my listening and reading skills have always been basically on par id understand the same thing whether it was spoken or written with basically the same number of rereads/relistens and dictionary lookups or googlings
no its minna as in minna genki  lmao
what exactly is this manga isnt reading meme
some retards trying to pic related
  have you ever watched japanese tv there are subtitles everywhere if you can read you can understand japanese tv meanwhile this guy doesnt know what the fuck is going on he said he cant read internet posts and conversations i am not comparing reading to listening i am comparing otaku media language to normal japanese
daremo genki rofl
nandemo genki
  havent read in a month now wrist is starting to feel better
  does this have to do with the affective filter or whatever that word is that krashen and kaufmann have used to describe people who are too pussy to let the nihongo flow through them
  yeah and i never found that to be the case i can understand it if i have time to look up the words and read it for example just pausing  the video and playing it back a few time there are subtitles you still have to interpret much faster than reading a vn or manga which were the examples you gave im assuming the op read hanahira and yotsuba and was surprised people had more complex thoughts than how great their bento was
  maybe but im assuming he was reading stuff more advanced than that since the n1 questions were extremely easy  for him maybe he would fail the listening portion of the exam which would result in a 不合格 so his opinion is worthless anyways since jlpt is mot a reading comprehension test
its not even a language proficiency test
i thought you can only use は once per sentence but i keep seeing it twice　　
yeah but if you know japanese you will pass it
  look up は contrastive
  the first 4 reject him and said japanese only  fucking racism
  my buddies in the gaijin youtube community assure me that this is simply because their staff cannot understand them
how do i do 1675 anki reps in one sitting
nightcore and coffee
just mash the spacebar
why mash just hold
  keep in mind they are illegal operations  letting foreigners in is a risk some arent willing to take  he still made it into one pretty quickly  plus you should be able to do pretty good over there picking up women without the need for hostess bars  lot of gaijin chasers
  step 1 do some stretches get limber feel comfortable if youre uncomfortable you wont study as well  step 2 eat some snacks if youre hungry you wont study as well either  step 3 go for a quick walk and try to visualize yourself doing the cards happily  step 4 browse r/getmotivated until you are legit excited for anki time  step 5 quickly review your preanki deck for the less intuitive but important kanji/radical mnemonics eg how easily can you recall the stories about dotted cliffs and lidded crocks  step 6 put on some chill instrumental music it might be tempting to listen to japanese music but dont itll just be distracting check out r/classicalmusic r/techo or search on 4channelorg/mu for recommendations  step 7 do your anki reps biggest tip i can give here is just try to remember whats on the back of the card given the content on the front of the card  good luck
  look up kawajapa curedolly
  pace yourself dont take all 12 inches at once
late to the test and only got half of the vocab part finished rest were blank seriously fuck boston couldnt find a parking for shit and wont be suprised if my car is towed by the time i get to it because all the signs are vague as shit also most likely failed n4 my grammar is fucking garbage and i barely read i mean i can read just not fast or well
  didnt mean to greentext all that shit just the boston part
  step 6a meditate for at least 150 minutes
the answer is usually adderall if you can get it you can be fluent in 5 months with a prescription of them  youll basically be a meth addict but the studyig potential is endless
would it be a good idea to start with learning the hira and kata characters both writing and pronunciation before anything else seems like it would be a good foundation but not sure
  u dont need hirigana and katanakana
  how so arent they a fundamental part of the language
  not really
the only thing fundamental to the language is the language itself ftw
  where is the best place to start then i know there is the guide in the op but people say it isnt very good
a while ago some anon in /djt/ posted a japanese website that explained all of the references and jokes in sayonara zetsubou sensei anyone know that site
  yeah learn hiragana and katakana then look into buying a textbook if you cant figure out the djt guide if you want some structure
  it doesnt matter what you do or where you start it all connects in the end  jus try to stay away from anything english asap
  btw thanks
    ok thanks for the responses
is there a good method to stream live tv from japan
  anythings possible for the right amount of money
i feel like a retard because i aced everything in the n5 except listening ive taken listening tests before and did fine but my brain turned off thank god for the 19/60 requirement     back to only reading for me
   genki   read the first section   and studied naturally for 3 month    go through the book    figured out 90 of this stuff on my own  god i wish i werent stupid reading never helps me
glad the reading section was so easy so i only need a combined 35 other points to pass
  maybe if there was a premade deck  its called kanji koohii steal their stories and tweak them as you see fit but dont do rtk
血圧  重大  延期  埋める
do rtk but dont make a big deal out of it
  do rtk but ignore the stories and just try to remember the important readings
  either youre reading shit thats way too easy or way too hard  or youre just quitting before the progress shows
recently i noticed if all i do all day is japanese learnings my sleep is wrecked its if my brain is fried i wake up from semi deep sleep and suddenly have this sentence in my head that gave me problems  followed by problematic vocabulary the next day i feel like sht    damn
time to slack off on my studies for another nine months or so
  new matt video for those who care
  your brain needs breaks like any other muscle in your body if you are really concentrating you shouldnt do more than an hour or so before taking a rest
  if you take a rest every hour youll never learn japanese

guys what is best audio to listen to when commuting so i can bukakke immersion to the max
  most people here are already at an advanced stage  half a minute in and already looking to be a good time
anime drama cds
  why copypaste reddit posts when the gold is right here
who else here /failedjlpt/ today honestly im discouraged because this only makes me wanna try harder but having directions in japanese is fucking bullshit for n5/4 didnt even know what i was suppose to he answering half the time havent felt this cheated since the day i took my permit test
  im not
 all my jlpt takers
why didnt you just drill jlpt materials so u knew what u were gonna see
fucked up the n1 listening section
  lol dont be tom unless its tom from myspace
  some of the costco releases of bgnd have jap subs some dont
is rote memorizing vocab with kanji easier than just learning words like you would in spanish german etc i feel like theres no way i could learn 5060 words in a day without my kids pictures to help
  actually were reading highquality japanese eroge kid
  retard there are plenty of practice jlpt tests online you wouldve known what to do if youd done just one prepare better next time
gonna pass n2 next year
  2/10
  i dont read enough i already know its my fault because not reading was my biggest weakness next to grammar
  but having directions in japanese is fucking bullshit for n5/4  did you think it was a test to see how many words you memorized in anki
see word while reading for the 50th time  still forget it  put it into anki for 5 seconds  memorized forever
forget how to read 譲る  forget what うつらうつら means  todays epic fails
be reading for 3 months  still havent learned katakana
fluent for over a decade now  can never remember ヌ
  multiply by 15000  spend all day every day grinding words you never see in real life
  only mtt and his cultists are dumb enough to not delete cards they dont ever see
still didnt put my epic fails into anki cuz thats a waste of time even if its 5 seconds
  being stupid enough to let this happen
day 28
  七 caught me slipping today i just couldnt see it
20 of the most common grammar and vocab accounts for 80 of all language use  is this true
not for japanese at least
  the real question is does it matter
  yes
imagine never taking a test in japanese before    and then paying 60 bucks to take a test in japanese for the first time and bomb it epically
  le pareto principle xdd
  imagine knowing 37000 words and still missing 1 out of every 100
reading an article about the expected increase in ice cream prices next year
  yes but it isnt really helpful to know that that 20 remaining is extremely important to being able to understand the actual point of the sentence
  do you think the number of words for that to happen would be much lower for other languages
  it actually doesnt matter because pareto also holds for something more important  
what can i start reading now that i can get through nhk easy articles relatively comfortably ive tried manga but using a text hooker is such a massive pain in the ass when looking up a lot of words is there anything i can read on my browser
  find something you like on narou  or a vn
whats something good to read after yotsuba if i want it to be a little more advanced but still not overwhelming
  any slice of life really
hello i need to figure out how to replay the audio for spoken lines in fs/n realta nua do you guys have any ideas there doesnt seem to be a way to do it inside the game maybe its possible to retrigger spoken audio for the current lines with cheat engine or something
  narou  wow this seems neat thanks
  same here but somehow our experience is incorrect or something
  honestly im starting to understand a lot more of why some people just dont think anki is a useful tool its good to use it to build up vocab but for literally everything else you absolutely need to be indulging via media or people if you have the option any good radios for nip i can listen in on when im driving
  honestly im starting to realize anki is useful for what it is designed to do and nothing else  wow such a grand revelation youve had there
it doesnt even let you build your vocabulary dont forget that important part
      the kanji counts are shown by default
yes it does jamal
am i retarded or is reading vertically hard as fuck when youve been used to horizontal forever
it actually doesnt  it just helps you memorize definitions that you can recall in place of knowing the word
  its a useful tool but some people take either side to the extreme some try to replace input with anki and thats obviously dumb you and the people whose cocks youre sucking claim its useless and thats stupid too but you say it because it makes you feel enlightened
  just so u know i havent really been posting much itt
  it has never made a difference in the slightest in my experience
  which is better not remembering any meaning of a word period or having a vaguely accurate placeholder meaning that makes the text comprehensible    this is a rhetorical question btw and im taking joy in shitting on this retarded post
damn anki is basically a litmus test for the intelligence of language learners
  i didnt say it was useless and also said i can sort of understand there reasoning you obviously still need it but yea the extreme on one side or the other is completely true
  its better but is it better enough to be worth the time investment  you do you just know what you doin when you do you you know
  read more manga
  you obviously still need it  u sure bout that
  yes but in the sense that retards itt think people only drone anki when its actually just a supplementary tool
all i did to prepare for the n3 was read yotsuba the night before        and study hours everyday since september 18th
frankly im disappointed theres people in here that actually took non n1 tests today
  yeah thats my point   droning and only droning  retarded   saying it isnt useful  retarded   assuming anyone who uses does only anki  retarded
even more disappointed that you noobs didnt crush those noob tests
imagine having yomichan on google glass and walking around tokyo adding words to your deck irl

  it happens in english all the time its just specialty vocabulary if you watched prince of tennis theres a shit load of legit japanese words that the average starting reader wont know so it gets explained or is understood in context
anyone have any reading suggestions for history probably lower level is best  n4 i might go to the kids section of kinokinuya or book off but maybe someone heres interested    i guess history manga works too

what a taikutu thread    last for teh dolleh too lazy to even attach pic
japanese is a context dependent language if you cant understand the thread without knowing who is replying to who without a hyperlink then you have little hope of learning japanese sorry to tell you
  now you fuckin revitalized my hope in this thread    well done
  literally this fucking shit volume was so low i couldnt hear shit and some fucker was coughing too i shoulda asked the teacher to raise the volume to max fuck me
1 years of studying  understand 50 of yotsuba  why is yotsuba recommended so often when its so hard to read  you have to like feel your way through the whole thing
  no ones ever read it we just parrot that shit cause it seems like its good for beginners
  i gave up on starting to read for an additional month because i couldnt get through understand a single page of yotsube even with the reading guide wasnt fun
  youre gonna be in the exact same spot next month except you will have wasted a month not reading instead of having a months reading experience under your belt think about it
    worked for my first manga  i had skimmed tae kim and read like 20 pages of graded reader shit  i could see huge progress every day and it was highly motivating
  its simple in that the themes and story dont involve complex interactions and observations like youd see in sports or war based manga people like simple and innocent stories with silly humor     its just not simple in the just passed the n5 simple because thats no where in the target demographics for any manga you still need to read and look up words and phrases you dont understand it gets easier as you read more
can you read this
seisyun is actually not beautiful
  about what
is wanikani the kanji black pill ready to get that life subscription if it teaches me these damned chinese runes
i cant fucking stand spoonfeeding dipshits and yet here i ago wanikani is trash just start a vocab deck and start reading
  buddy i got some bad news for you
no because srsing english translations is harmful to understanding japanese fluently just stare at kanji longer and do more dictionary lookups and itll all make sense eventually maybe do rtk on the side and learn how to break them apart while writing them
wanikani wont teach you to read this
  how the fuck can i read if i d ont know the kanjis and why would i waste time just making a deck when when wankani has the languages natural order setup so you dont overwhelm your self and learn in the natural order i was going to do remember the kanji but i like the wankani layout more and the stories are probably better
am i just above average in intelligence for never being confused like the dumb fuck above me or was it luck
why cant people understand people learn at different paces better
  nah dumb people exist you know we cant all be average
youre at such a low level that you say stupid stuff like know the kanjis guess what there is no such thing as knowing kanji you just look up words you dont know and eventually it sticks look at them long enough and youll notice all the parts that make them up and youll stop confusing them doing intensive study of the characters individually is probably a waste of your time if you arent trying to take some weird kanji test or something
  its just anki where you do very few cards per day and your reviews take forever    how the fuck can i read if i d ont know the kanjis  dictionary innit  wankani has the languages natural order  marketing    i was going to do remember the kanji but i like the wankani layout more  enjoy and good luck when you begin learning japanese too
isntead of scratching your head over artifical stuff like this why not do something actually useful and productive like read a manga or a book
cause learning is hard and larping is fun
  i know what a kanji is they teach radicals and storys wich is proven the best method for retention i dont want to be looking up every word when i can just learn them all and get it out of the way
  manga is for manchildren
  its not proven wanikani wont teach you all the words you need to know nor does it teach you conjugations so youre still going to have to look up every word after you start reading when you finish wk in a year or two anyways and they certainly dont teach you all the kanji youre going to encounter in books so have fun starting from scratch once you waste all that time and money
  wankani has the languages natural order setup  no it doesnt  if you read actually read krashen the man who originated the term natural order youll learn that the natural order is unknown and probably unknowable  the key is to get lots of comprehensible input then the next thing youre ready to learn will be present  if you like wankikani and it keeps you motivated then by all means use it but dont fool yourself about what its doing
  by a funny coincidence so is your mom
reddit tbqh
  life subscription  kanji should be something you look up ad hoc and recursively till it makes sense with something like tagaini jisho or something you spend a month on getting the gist of and then just differentiating similar mistaken kanji as you come across them
  pretty pc way of saying their slow differently paced lol
ive got a lot of books that arent in the library but theyre all jpg and png scans if someone is able to ocr them and make epubs or something please let me know id really like to get these in a more versatile format and get them in the library i have literally hundreds of books that need to be ocrd and added to the library
can you make a list of all the book titles and a torrent
  basically if its an ln released within the past 10 years i for sure have it i might make a list at some point i want to find someone that can get these into a more usable format first before i go through all the trouble of making a list or a torrent

  better to upload them to mega accounts instead of a torrent if you were to go down that route it would mean they can be directly imported to a different mega and added to the site or backed up without having to worry about seeders or downloading the torrent and reuploading everything to mega anyway there are scans in the cor that are dated back to 2015 for example most scans on nyaa that old are as good as dead and the only other places online with the series are direct download websites with slowass limited file hosts  the ocr reader app for mobile handles book scans faster and easier than kanjitomo not as good as a retail ebook rip but not that bad i read the first volume of kino that way and it rarely ever had a problem looking up words scans are underrated tb h

i love autumn so much that the aki sisters are my wives i married both of them at the same time
  you dont love autumn enough to keep its thread bumped  and so do i
i like winter more but autumn is lovely too
  why are the aki sisters so unpopular they are very kind and deserve more love
    poor sluts
  autumn is an awful season
    cursed forever to be stage 1
  well for starters zun hasnt exactly gone overboard while naming them literary autumn harvestgirl and autumn quietleafs then theres their design wich is pretty complicated for minorin and rather simplistic for shizuha and artists like somesing inbetween  and about them being kind before marisas books the only lore they had were their profiles and theyre described as quite bitchy there they tend to boast in front of each other minoriko not telling the villagers that they should call her before the harvest for it to have an effect and they went to kick mcs ass intentionally talk about overestimating ones abilities heh

kill each other
  great more buses
  is it over or undersensitive either way try cleaning the contact side of the panel with isopropyl alcohol highest percentage you can find then rub some steel wool or emery paper on it then clean it with the alcohol again let everything dry before putting it back together
  no redalice amigo
  i fight me
  as much as i love led i saw that and instantly thought of bus hopefully the g means its a banger though
  undersensitive registers single steps but cant maintain freeze arrows or registers repeatedly when held ill give the alcohol a try otherwise i guess its a wiring issue ill have to fix to clarify is the contact side on the pad itself or on the arrow when lifted up
finally getting a iidx controller what are the proper distinctions between the fps fp7 plat res yadayada which is most cost effective and are sanwas a must
  death big cock bangs eat my ass    the fps has a smaller tt thats it i wouldnt spend any more than an fp7 sanwas are a bougie meme but you should definitely spend the money on getting omron switches whether you get them from dao or elsewhere like istmall or mouser is up to you you could get samducks for literally the price of switches elsewhere on istmall and theyre good
  dont get me wrong i love death zigoq
  actually couldnt complete this song for a while on the first beatmania game  nostalgic
sign up for kac  kac bonus song is literally just be a hero 2  where can i cancel
so i recently came across some circlejerks among nudesigners that want everything to look and move just like material design while condemning everything that isnt because its too disney and too timeconsuming  since bemani games interfaces lean toward the motion graphic wanking super stylized side im curious if anybody actually had a problem with those
last week i easy cleared my first 9 this week ive cleared about 20 or so of them loving the progress but hilariously ive actually been playing iidx less in this past month due to playing more popn yet in the iidx sessions i do have i feel like im progressing faster than usual    probably all in my head but its definitely a weird feeling
  games cant get away with looking as shitty and lazy as material design is they need actual effort put into them  cb looked pretty bad with the italy colors though rootage is an improvement

    look forward to my next blog update gonna talk about how i switched to playing onehanded and found it much easier overall
  make sure you play rislim remix onehanded on a midsummer night the way konami intended
  does the same go for the wang and yuan
  yuan is a little special if you talk to him you can custom order without parts you dont want for cheaper i would order no buttons/springs/switches and get samducks which comes with springs and switches that are ok when the gersungs inevitably die just get omrons you could also ask for no io board and get an arcin instead if you know what that is and you want it would require a bit of wiring work however it will probably come out to be cheaper lol for yuancons though make sure you get the emp mat the stock configuration is literally just a slab of acrylic and you might get by if you just wanna wrist bms all day but if you wanna go back and forth from an arcade machine the emp mat will be more familiar and more grippy i dont know anything about the wang sorry
warmly awaiting the next bemanixtoho collab with some good iidx charts

venomous firefly mxm    18 my ass    fucking camellia
    ive played it its nice and small so you never have to uninstall it its exactly like the kon game if you ever played that or want to check that out first the graphics for the game itself are fine and the presentation is decent the graphics for the girls and victory cutscenes are good but a far cry from estival versus pbs or even the vd game on vita as im writing this im realizing how forgettable the music itself is so thats not a strong point but its not bad either

      wew lads guess im gonna have to play it on a different tv in that case
  offset exists but slow/fast indicators dont cant remember but its in the options somewhere
  dont know what a wang con is yuancons are at their core the best entry level controller you can get if you dont care about looks its arcade accurate with a normal sized tt but is competing with daos fp7 in terms of pricing    it seems quite cheap at first until you realize that the base price is with no tt leds button leds chinese switches and no emp mat after adding all that plus shipping it then matches the price of a nonus warehouse fp7 with omrons    so if you want just the bare necessities to get into iidx get a yuancon its got good build quality and you have the option to just abandon the fancy stuff for cheaper pricing
is the 40 saving on the dao popn controller enough to offset the really expensive shipping and customs
  no youre gonna have to buy a new set of non shit buttons too
so i finally got to play beat saber on my brothers psvr and its fun and all but the way of scoring in the game seems retarded and also completely inferior than playing on pc with unlimited custom songs compared to less than 20 on the ps4    but anyway why cant western music game devs into actual precision and rhythm
  for the same reason western devs make shitty games in general theyre all dumb as fuck and refuse to learn from previous successes in whatever genre they tackle
  guitar hero is better than guitar freaks
  how could you say something so controversial yet so brave
  this is unironically true
  gf sucks but dm  rock band or whatever other drum game so
  all drum games are fun though  smacking things never gets old
  holy fuckignb ased
what does the new bemanitools have that is different from previous versions never had problems with it but i cant run config now so i cant even bind the keys to play cb
  hey anon do you see tech support anywhere in this thread no maybe go where you found the tools and ask you dumbfuck
  uummm nah gonna ask here sows is shit for support
  get fucked
  dont  me ever again
   this aint twitter anon where the fuck do you think you are
    ill happily gift reddit gold to the kind gentlelad who can answer my question thank you in advance good sir
  4channel
  people getting mad these days about being d or mentioned is pretty funny
osu
  absolutely criminal how little porn there is of them
353 slows 47 fasts in popn  is there a way to change the offesy
  isnt scoring based on arc of swing and angle accuracy also theres no timing windows    iirc on pc theres mods that introduce timing windows to make it an actual rhythm game but its still really fun
  no popn does not have an offset ingame
opinions on beatsaber
  fun and looks cool seeing the lightsabers on your hands      yeah you gotta do like a 150 degrees swing dead center ln the cube to get max points  must be very tiring to get perfect scores at high level    game has potential and there could be lots of stuff they could add like long parallelepipeds working as long/hold notes
  no just build it yourself its really easy
  no it isnt stfu
  popn is the easiest controller to build its literally just buttons wired up to an arduino then you can copypaste someone elses code for it the box doesnt even require weird square shaped mounting holes literally just use a hole saw    iidx and sdvx have encoders which are more difficult to use and easy to fuck up they also have rectangular and square mounting holes which you have to figure out how to cut via laser router or hole saw and broach    t built all three popn was by far the easiest and the tt on my iidx controller sucks fucking ass
  its pretty easy if you have a drill and a jigsaw though i understand not everyone has easy access to power tools and a workspace
  actually it really fucking is when you compare it to sdvx or iidx controllers    instead of needing to cut square holes you just need to get a hole saw part for your drill and cut straight through the wood literally 9 round holes is all you need to cut and if youre competent enough to wire some buttons then you have the easiest diy controller for bemani
      wow there were three replies all within 2 minutes of each other just to show how incompetent this guy was
  change your gn or get good amigo
      fucking nerds i said stfu
  dont be mad all those guys are genius rocket engineers who can build an asc from scratch
  back in my day you had to build your own asc
back in my day sdvx players were still playing osu
nothing makes me seeth harder than seeing a chart being called a map
  stop encouraging trolls
  thats so fucking true and its sad
    plays bemani games  isnt a rocket scientist genius    gtfo of my elite exclusive games anon
i had to rehide the entire index of /jp/ again with the domain change that was exhausting
  what does that have to do with rhythm games
  just bookmark this thread lol
  why do you even come here
anyone knows if theres a way to disable bga in iidx
  why would you want to
  i especially love the ui and ux of bemani games for actually having effort put into them i really hope konmai doesnt fall for the flat design meme any time soon it would be such a shame
  maybe he doesnt want half naked lolis or a half naked little boy with a dick symbol tattooed below his navel to show up on the screen
  you can use cams
  quit being an insecure beta
    delete the movie files and replace the dummy one with what you want displayed
  ya ill try this at my local arcade thanks
  a half naked little boy with a dick symbol tattooed below his navel  fucking what which song
  any rche song
  are you new here  todestrieb
  what a fag
  this actually worked thanks
  evidently by your standards i havent seen it mentioned in these threads and i dont pay much attention to any bemani groups
  i dont play shit songs
  excuse me bub thats an ancient goat demon youre talking about
recently started djmax respect on ps4 and can barely do 6 difficulty songs on 6b and like 8 on 4b    feel like a spaz
  implying
  gn in popn    wat
  yikes  i can stop playing the game for months and still play level 15 songs you gotta let that muscle memory mark your muscles forever
  stop playing a bad iidx imitation and play the real thing
  not playing both    plebeian
  hispeed x bpm  gn has been shown in game since sunny park amigo
  thats not really a gn though seeing as gn goes down the faster the notes come thats just your read speed
are there any good tips to scratching than just play more im pushing into tens and playing song that have lots of consecutive scratches are fucking killing me
  the number is green idk what to tell you anon  it works the same way sdvx hispeed works where your gn increases with speed   or you know  any game that is not iidx
  based anything that isnt iddx is shit poster
  try allscr on easier charts try one handing mad izm hypers and normals eventually when youre better at the game try bms scratch scale more or less play more but focus on scratch stuff
  allscr  is this an option somewhere
  though the numbers are different their purpose is functionally equivalent at least popn gn is easy to understand try to explain to me what specifically the iidx gn means most people dont even know
  its an lr2 and cs modifier  see 2dxplus if you play data
  focus on keeping your motions relaxed without tension that leads to exhaustion and rage
  number of frames the note is on screen for times 10
  congratulations  now tell me why that would make sense on a game that doesnt use framedata to make timing judgements   gn just determines scrollrate whether the number is inversely proportional to speed or not is really unimportant
  now tell me why that would make sense on a game that doesnt use framedata to make timing judgements  but iidx does use frames for absolutely everything  popn uses the millisecond timestamps for note spacing and display which is why gn wouldnt necessarily make sense for it but i wouldnt be surprised if it still used frames internally for judgement since thats what ddr did prior to a  do you have evidence of popn judgement not operating on frames eg being able to get two different judgements on different notes within a chord within the same frame and if so do you happen to know the size of the cool window
konamis adherence to the traditional annual 2dx release schedule continues to result in a more and more lackluster experience this downward trend will continue unless they switch to a nonannual release ie sound voltex
  nonannual release makes sdvx good  yeah ok anon iv was trash but continue gobbling nuts im not gonna stop you
  what difference does it make
cannon ballers is the best ost since ____
  sinobuz
are there any endofyear events with bemani artists this year
  if youre at the arcade just change the bga to the camera view instead
  agreed the lack of fap worthy goli artwork besides the two in rootage is concerning
  its preparation for the massive load well blow in 27
  race queens in skin tight clothes arent fap worthy for you
dezly get out of the fucking ss discord
  nazi secret police has a discord
fuck bemani
  shut up chippy
where is the best place to buy sanwa iidx buttons
  do not bully patchy
  from sanwa
how do we combat the overproduced zoomercore menace
  youre too old time to let go and let the new generation enjoy their shit music
    anything that is not eurobeat or dnb is trash
  give into it
  kick all of tanoc back to sdvx  bring back naoki
  tanoc has been total shit for the last few years anyway
  on rakuten  
  eurobeat
    who here is on this network
ever since starting to play itg im always super hungry ive literally eaten 2 big macs and 20 mcnuggets every day for dinner for the past 3 months or so can someone please recommend some cheaper food
  white rice and eggs
  rotisserie chickens
    i dont like eggs but rotisserie chickens and rice does sound like a better idea ill try that
  can someone do a pro/con list for all the networks  wondering if theres better out there than arcana
  arcana is the deadest but has the least trannies
  drop iidx for 5key like i did
    he plays rhythm games for the music    lol thats like eating cereal because you like the taste of spoons
  least trannies  sign me the fuck up my dude
  arcana is literally the worst network out there  bad players  dying playerbase  shit webui
  bad players  this applies to all ghetto rat networks tho everyone good is on eamuse  dying playerbase  this applies to all bemani games regardless of network
  this applies to all bemani games regardless of network  idk man some networks are gaining users while arcana just keeps losing them
if you have fat hands please slim them or dont show them on streams its fucking gross
  go to redacteds house sunday to play itg  play for like 6 hours  only eat a bowl of food afterwards    i have no idea how i didnt die
  i cant be bothered jumping through the hoops there are nowadays to initially get on a network so i just play with maint/ealocal
dolce is making waves in drummania now    can he save some of the bemani boipussy for the rest of us pls
what is arcana network url i have a account but dont know what to put in services
  a great question anon and the best possible place to ask it
  arcanadlbitcoinminerexeorg
    downloadfreepunjabimovieonline2018com
   info/murdervids_i2k8lk_ipstealer
  dont know where to ask
    give some handies to people in your local scene and theyll tell you
  other networks are more populated because there are a million brazilians who play with a keyboard
  based brs
  can you not make your own food  are you a lazy manchild
  ever since i started using energy i am now hungry  what a revelation you retard
how do i achieve this
  first you nofap then you volcel then you kaiden
  in case you havent noticed mcd food is intentionally not filling
  find a mentally retarded girl thats the only way youll convince them to play p2
  is arcana really a dying network i only know two or three others by name but everyone i know whos in them say it has far fewer submitted iidx scores
  why does this guy dress like a middle schooler stuck in 2005
  p2 is for truiidxers though
  arcana is definitely best for iidx dont know about other games though
  most of the better players have left arcana for other networks
  name them
  literally 90 of the kaidens in the west
  prove it
  there are only 10 aaas for i love you on arcana and 25 on a different network next question
  25 on a different network  which one
  doesnt matter youre not getting in anyway
  no one will get in your fantasy server
  ok buddy retard
hey does anyone here know how i could get into   the register button seems to just take me to a page which tells me to get fucked is this like sadpanda or something
  its a meme site get on sows if you are an arcade owner
why does everyone use compressor 3
  because if you know what a compressor is its the make loud button that everyones been looking for in loud ass arcades
why arent there any black people in bemani games
    tfw you will never be a japanese manlet that is the perfect height for a iidx cabinet  tfw you will always have to contort your body in uncomfortable ways just to play an autistic arcade music game
  have you never played ddr  or 5key  or beat juggling mix
  there are no black in japan
  no i dont play games with black people in them
why the fuck do numales love using the word slap on music so much
  use it in a sentence for me
    what the fuck is 5key
  an osumania game mode
  because a slap is a pattern you get from randoms or occasionally in nonran npa pa bbq is an example where you get 123/4567 p1 or 1234/567 chords
why is it that when ddr/itg players start hitting 95 scores on literally any difficulty they start feeling compelled to score dump every song they play every time they go to the arcade
  brain damage same reason theyre still playing ddr in 2019
why do you faggots hate on osu and stop anyone from getting more involved in rhythm games then in the next thread complain about x game or x scene dying out because lack of players and interest never understood this desu  inb4 incoherent elitist rage or mentions of why osu is a bad game id like some actual reasons as to why people have adopted noninclusion as strategy instead of using it as a place to recruit new players once they recognize the lackluster mechanics you just put up a blank wall and tell them to fuck themselves
  point out 5 times where someone who plays osu in these threads was told to fuck off when they were interested in bemani or other games
  you type like a faggot
    i really dont mind osu at all i just dont know anything about it other than you click shit looks similar to technika tune or whatever that vita touchscreen game was
  music analogy   osu is like pop music and bemani is like underground/indie shit    if you were interested in the good stuff youd already be into it but the plebs are satisfied by the shitty stuff thus the disdain
  its impossible for me to get more involved in rhythm games without bringing up osu  i hope thats not what you are implying anyway i do my best to simply ignore it at all times in order to not fuel the persecution complex
  tard level iq take your victim complex somewhere else
  lol you plife fags are insufferable    theyre talking about the elitist tranny circlejerk that is pedolife
  based pedo slayer
  is it that bad one of my friends is on it but he didnt really talk about whether or not its better than arcana
  tahirih walker is black and only showed up in 10/10 songs
  its literally a network for trannys chasers and unironic sjws  everyone ive met irl thats on it is at least one of the above  you know its fucked when the furries in this community are less insufferable than these power tripping onions drinking cucks
can you play bms on data
  if you go through the effort of modding it then yeah its not a drag and drop affair
  is it better to play like that than on lr2
  nowhere near worth the hassle
bobn musig ddddd
  whats wrong with eurobeat
  ok retard
    let me guess youre a uk reject
  not really
    wrong again retard there are multiple precompiled versions with the important bms
  sure if thats what fits your victim complex      sorry you got assblasted over the truth go back to your chaser and trender echochamber
  osu standard isnt a rhythmgame and manias only purpose is to jerk off wankers
  if you want ldj timing maybe and quirks maybe lr2 doesnt have the same bad chaining mechanics as ldj and you can get pretty mashy with it and still combo plus its frame instead of millisecond based so even when you turn on hard timing in lr2 its still a bit different    plus lr2 is a crashy piece of shit
hwy blog i just discovered my right forearm is hurting a lot because i play with my sleeve rolled up
  ok enjoy your lack of popn support
  idk enigma seems to have pretty good support so does broadbanded
  im talking about arcana also whats broadbanded i havent heard of that
  remember your nonfunctional overdesigned webui designed by two furries who spent months and months with their thumbs up their asses or how about when one of the members of djh blatantly lied about needing some overpriced chink shit board to play cb on cab then backpedaled once the data actually released
  pretty sure hard judge is harder than iidx
  remember that webui and back end that was directly lifted from an already existing project where all of the hard work of the implementation was already done me too  keep your candy rave source code handy you never know when you need to spin up another copy
  this post solidifies that you have no idea what youre talking about
  adding support for new games is trivial if you already have the infra the games hardly change theyre the networks and the games the same shit with a different coat of paint
  its not just support for new games i suppose youd know that if you were in the server but judging by your posts its obvious why you arent
lol
  theyre the networks and the games the same shit with a different coat of paint  buddy you dont have a dang clue what youre talking about
  you have literally no fucking clue what youre talking about mate
by the way if you legitimately think plife has anything at all to do with cr/flower at this point you are retarded
imagine actually defending insular communities  theres a reason enigma/1cc/ooc took off at the time they let people just play the games without having to deal with whos good books they have to be in today to be a part of the cool kids  the other poster may be blatantly wrong with facts but hes right about some things in spirit
        did you even consider for a second that maybe she has better information and knowledge than you do
  its hardly a cool kids club all you need to do to get invited is not be a dickhead
              
programmed bread is a good network
  basically yeah    if you know someone in plife ask them to ask to get you invited    like literally the only rules in plife are dont be a dick dont cause drama and please dont get us legalled
  almost like gasp bemaniso  i love hypocrites too
  that doesnt mean anything  its still an insular community  the fact that it relies on people vouching for you is exactly what makes it a cool kids club in the first place  you should assume good faith and remove people that dont act on it the other way around is the equivalent of shooting first and asking questions later  fwiw same shit applies to sows/ooc/enigma
  shut up derpta
  huh i made that post in favor of plife
  as if hed post hot takes without his tripcode
bemaniso a place to be excellent to each other unless youre from the uk and you think saying nigger is really funny
i feel like im the only one who knows about this game
  i played the demo when i was younger i love the aesthetic and its pretty fun
  imagine letting the words other people say have power over you lol    great game stage 7 has best song even if it is hard as balls  i really miss that more experimental era of rhythm games before activision drilled the genre into a hole
  saying nigger isnt funny though only retarded edgelords like saying no no meanie words a lot for no reason
spreads ass
  fuck off iso
  i sometimes wish i could go back to that community since i used to really enjoy it and the meetups but then i remember how a certain group of three people literally ruined it for everyone else because we wouldnt conform to their circlejerk of offensive jokes that had nothing to do with rhythm games in the first place and caused a split which then died off
what caused so many servers to pop up was it the end of psun/world or after arcana started
  yeah i think what mostly brought it about was the transitional period where pworld had just died and psun was forced into invisibility where no one could talk about it
  tau doesnt play well with others
  isnt that the story of sows in general right now  uk comes in and takes over  makes most people uncomfortable  everyone leaves      it was the end of psun/world
  both  psun/pworld was the defacto they died and replacements sprung up in their place  also because netcode is trivial to re you can get your own server up and running in about a week  more people with more technical knowledge got into the scene that meant more people capable and interested in making their own
  whats taus problem he seems alright to me  never saw him sperging or anything
  isnt that the story of sows in general right now   comes in and takes over   most people uncomfortable   leaves    basically everyone cool has moved on yeah
  he literally just doesnt work well with other people hes controlling and does stuff his way not slinging shit so much as explaining why other bright minds who want to work on this stuff have to start their own projects
  yeah pretty much all the cool people have either left the community entirely or moved to other places
  nah you just want a strawman to pin it on because youre too new  the real issue is that all of the oldguard grew up got a family a mortgage and bills to pay  then 2014 happened everyone made everything political and it stopped being ok to make jokes  the problem is zoomers and snowflake millenials
  yup i was made a target and pushed out just because i tried to call them out on their bullshit looking back i regret even bothering do wish i could find a comfy community to talk with and meet up again but i know its literally futile in current year for something like that oh well its not like i need a community to enjoy this hobby anyway
  talk to literally any sows member who recently became inactive and youll probably hear exactly whats in the post you replied to
  and if you talk to anyone that was active before tricoro and will say the exact same thing i did
  dude does it really bother you that much that you cant say the nword in public anymore
im going to say the n word
playing on inferior networks with shitty webui formerly no webui and no popn support to own the libs
is lr2 playable on linux
  no it bothers me that i cant make a joke at my own expense anymore without people like you assuming stuff about me just like you did there  get your prejudice and politics out of my fucking chink music box games
  le strawman meme  goes on to blame zoomers
  it is by a miniscule amount but yeah i said its different so not really a substitute  it also still doesnt have the bizarre late frame overlapping that ldj has so still not the same bad chaining properties
    hi zane
  id just like to interject for a moment  what youre referring to as linux  is in fact gnu/linux or as ive recently taken to calling it gnu plus linux  linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component  of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs shell  utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix    many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day  without realizing it  through a peculiar turn of events the version of gnu  which is widely used today is often called linux and many of its users are  not aware that it is basically the gnu system developed by the gnu project    there really is a linux and these people are using it but it is just a  part of the system they use  linux is the kernel the program in the system  that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself  it can only function in the context of a complete operating system  linux is  normally used in combination with the gnu operating system the whole system  is basically gnu with linux added or gnu/linux  all the socalled linux  distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux    also no lr2 is already jank as fuck and under wine its even worse  use beatoraja if you want something cross platform or wait for someone to make a client that isnt shit
why is this thread some blogfag extension of facebook and discord now just play the fucking games fuck the people
  just play the fucking games fuck the people  haha trying to
  still butthurt you got banned for being a retard in discord months ago
  beatoraja  enjoy your midsong gc pauses
  nice digits
all this talk of server splits and cool kids clubs just makes me wish there was an offline/local server program that still had full player data/customization support
post songs that never fail to make you smile    
  or just pick a server and play the game no need to interact with the commuinty and you still get competition
  this i remember the first days when sdvx iv showed up and seeing my shitty scores as worlds top
set a score on a song on the 1st or 2nd time playing it  can never improve or get close to the score on that song for months until i am a lot better  what the fuck
how is the brook converter with a koc lr2 is unplayable with one of those generic blue triangles im traveling and dont want to take my dao
wow this thread got a lot of activity today
  and none of it was about video games
negativity towards a large group as a whole will have little effect  you guys are going to have to start naming names on who should be removed from the foreign bemani comunities
everyone talking about multiple different bemani communities  mfw id be happy to be in any of them
  draw the pig and leave an email
  implying they havent always been here  
  any bemani community is full of autism and cancer    if you want hookups to data/network if you try hard enough you can find it without getting into any gay community
dfw has the only good bemani scene tbqh
  go away dezly
  probably because nobody there is good rofl
  t jealous tranny
  almost literally everyone in tx is on plife lmao
  what dfw iidx player is even good tho lol i only know of 2 texas kaidens and one moved to lubbock and the other is an annoying attention whore in austin
  host a iidx tournament in dfw  first place is from california  the rest of the top 4 is from colorado  gg ez
what happened to this thread yikes
  some based anon called out degenerates for damaging the community  said degenerates then dogpile that anon for wrongthink
wanting to be part of a scene/community  why does this matter so much to some people is it the competition i just wanna play the game which i do i already have accepted that some people dont like me so im not gonna put my flag down in their turf and ask that they accept me
  beats me im not part of any network or scene i know no one irl who plays these games i dont speak to my fellow autist freaks at round1 at all this thread is the only place i come to for rhythm game discussion
  people crave attention and belonging
  and dick
is there any home controller that has the exact same size turntable as arcades
does anyone has this already  
    yikes    boomers fuck off
  yeah the pee and the yuancon  however with the yuancon you have to select an emp mat otherwise its just a slab of acrylic
    quick rundown what benefit does it have over the fp7
  turntable is a million times better
  you can make the turntable light pink for when youre playing unkeysounded anisong bmss
you can get into plife if you pass a quiz but its a pretty hard one    1 did the holocaust happen    sǝʎ ɩ ʎǝʞ ɹǝʍsuɐ
  ppass
    subtle
how do you folks feel about parappa the rappa
  cool aesthetic and music but shitty and finnicky gameplay
  play the psp port its the only version that actually works its beautiful in comparison
  sad
  cringe oof and yikes my good sir
    ehhhhhh btfo
  no i remember the timing being dogshit on the psp version but more than that the game rewards you for bullshitting so oftentimes if you flub you will do better than playing it perfectly which is the fault of the judgement system having a improv judgement    basically as a rhythm game its kusoge
  theres actual musical logic to how the game handles freestyle input if you do something that sounds horrific it probably loses you points but if you try to do something rhythmic but original you get u rappin cool sounds like you dont actually play music games for the music
  i will admit when i played it last i was dogshit at rhythm games but i would get better scores when i did bad and when i did the chart correctly i would do worse so thats cool    its basically like groove coaster in which case invisible judgements can fuck right off trash mechanic
  i think youre kinda missing the point of the game    playing it according to the notes on screen isnt the way it really really wants you to play its a guide a tutorial a basis youre supposed to innovate remember it was made well before anything like beatmania existed
  chinese
  or chinese
  anything goes even chinese
  does plife unironically have people who think it happened lmfao
  honestly why do neo nazis want to think it didnt happen  wouldnt you want it to have happened since it enforced your ideals and makes nazis look more decisive/stronger
  it didnt happen but it shouldve now go ask /pol/ if you want more information
  degenerates    your hobby is playing a japanese music game sit the fuck down
youre all stupid fucking niggers jesus fuck
previously     please post music art or other original content you have created and discuss
  oh thank goodness looking at the archive i thought someone had made a third gayass monstergirl thread at first     cute pic although if thats supposed to be her hair draping over her and her wing its not that convincing
a bump to this
oh were back
id like to request oc other than artworks ty
  people have posted music before
i hope this belongs in /jp/ i really like vivaldi btw
  interesting but i think her closer shoulder/armpit shadow is kind of weird like making her arm look skeletal thin
  very classical
  you should make something
  faster
  like what
  anything other than artwork make a 2hu diorama
  ooh thanks anon
whats a diorama
  a little miniature model set
she never came so heres your reminder
tei boobies
i want flan to release an infestation of armadillidiidae in my kitchen

  why does this boy make me so hard
  girl
my wife makoto is so cute
makoto is best girl  change my mind   pro tip  you cant  
amazing
  wife
  yes
  your wife is this anons  naizuri slave dude
  mako is no slave
  naizuri  doesnt makoto have a nice rack
  what happened
  poster failed in game as he did in life
  shes pretty small but not totally flat perfection
  makoto is so cool
  the coolest
  what is she thinking about
  cute and handsome i want to cheer for her
  anyone who would be disappointed by makoto isnt a real fan
i cant stop fapping to that one recent makoto doujinshi where she is a booby milf
  the tomboy wants to become more girly what to do
  stop her like you would stop godzilla
  kill makoto
  she needs to face failure firsthand so she understands the reality of her situation
  thats a boy
  fuck you nerd
  the other way
i really want to fuck this boy
  very cute trap
  yes
  first girl  she was the first ims girl i ever saw  shes not in my top 3 but she ties for 3rd makoto is adorable
belly rubs
  for what purpose
imagine growing up with makoto and steadily becoming conscious of her as a pretty girl
  this tames your tomboy also it feels nice and soft
tombump
  that would be weird considering she is a boy
  it is weird coming to realize your bro is a girl
  fuck you makoto
  i volunteer for this
      what a cute boy
is it gay to fuck a tomboy
  theres manga out there of that
  does it feel gay
happy birthday hibiki
is hibiki a tomboy too
is there such thing as a makoto daki
  girl
  how is it gay if it has a vagina
  whats with the tissue and lotion
  he pretends hes getting a handjob by her by making his hand numb at least thats what i do
  depends on your definition of gay  exhibit a buck angel    by this time he identified and presented as male but had not had any genital surgery and still had a vulva so he promoted these works describing himself as the man with a pussy
  delete this cursed image
  a girly girl would have wanted a nds anyway
  no
  why is he wearing a skirt for her school uniform
  makoto is a crossdressing degenerate who gets aroused by almost exposing his nuts in front of the public
mandatory makoto image

whats so great about muh nichijou anyways  its a shit craving and a shit anime  also ren nichijou was pretty boring and stupid he should be grateful to merc and hajun for making his life more exciting
  i think merc made him that way so that ren would fight back had merc waited a few years ren wouldve graduated high school and wouldve become a salaryman and then hed abandon his nichijou in a heartbeat but that wouldnt be useful right
  holy fucking shit he literally went full reinhard/kotomine here
  nihilist goes nuclear and unlocks his power as his hair grows and begins to defy gravity  now its up to reverseredman reinhard to stop him
  i want to rape reinhard
  that dialogue  said by a character voiced by suwabe  jej
question when shreiber is in his beserk state does his body work like an ahnenerbe and directly damage the targets soul similar to trifas or does he just reach such ridiculous speeds that his body is basically a relativistic weapon and he manages to harm ldo members with regular attacks
  super schreiber 3 is a fusiontype no  even if he doesnt have a very clear and visible weapon like machinas fists rens guillotine or willhelms spikes something on him has to work that way    trifas a cheating nonfusion
  good point i forgot he was a fusiontype at that point i guess i just really liked the idea of him going so god damn fast he was bypassing his foes can tank pretty much anything that isnt a nuke level defences with sheer power and no soulbullshit at all
  because being a high school kid who has to think about all the inevitable changes looming on the horizon makes him appreciate the simple things that he has right now    but yeah just assume its all mercs fault
muzan  ootake  machina  yakou    who should be the last member of my team which shall bring utter death upon all creation also post your dream team
  kriemhild  if were talking about shinza only then probably hajun not only he kills he also permanently erases the soul    also post your dream team  some variation of the eastern expedition i guess or satanael and paralost company
  is that kkks michael  if so then what a poor lad getting reincarnated as a furry
  yes it is and he didnt get reincarnated as a furry but iirc he was shoved into the armor so his taikyoku wouldnt kill everything due to his desire getting too powerful    それは穢土に残留する現在でも変わらず極限まで達した死の希求はあまりに強く鎧に封じなければ穢土の者さえ死滅の虚に蝕むまで彼は滅びを願い続けていた    pic related him without a helmet
  existing as a phantom from the previous world without being able to change it with his deepseated craving remaining in his heart and sealed in armor that puts a leash on his worldemptyingly strong powers he continued to wish for his own demise  できたのか先生
  desire to die so badly he starts to kill the world itself   still sticks around for the sake of his kamerad  top tier bro i must get him
  would you ride his tiger though
kei is best girl
  youd be ded if you did
  low int and messy handwriting    isnt that the point
  cute
but why does he want to die
  imagine michael readying his hulking behemoth of a kannon 88 for action  imagine michael stripping down to his birthday suit his nude skin bearing the scars of his hundreds of battles from tula to paris  imagine michael embracing and enveloping you like how von rundstedt completely encircled timoshenkos entire southwestern front   imagine michael playfully hitting you in the bed with a backhand blow thatd make field marchal von manstein proud  imagine michael preparing for forceful penetration like guderians panzer groups in the ardennes with eyes brimming with lust and destructive desire like an ss veteran stationed in the warsaw ghetto  imagine michael roaring in coitus like a king tigers maybach hl 230 engine running full throttle  imagine michaels heat shell discharge making a mess out of your innards like a panzerfaust fired at t26 light tank at pointblank range    imagine
  t lotus
  its more like why does he want to stay fucking dead lol
  how does ast work again wouldnt she fit here too      hes literally an iron tiger now
  eop  always wondered if machina was still that guy in kkk who posed a threat to even the big bad  see this  mfw  based as always suicidal punch man
imagine a feelsy short story about trifa meeting one of the kids from his orphanage 60 years later when hes busy with divine vessel shenanigans
  he does shreiber kills them again in front of him
  life sucks
one timeline karl starts numerous ldos in numerous countries and pits them against each other in modern times for shits and giggles  russian ldo has a member whos the embodiment of general winter whose craving is i want all to know cold and can freeze things to absolute zero temperatures  japanese ldo has a kamikaze pilot whos craving is i want to soar through the sky like a winged beast whose yetzirah lets him fly and briah flat out transforms him into some kind of sky dragon  chinese ldo has a victim of the cultural revolution a newer recruit whose craving is i want to preserve what i have which makes things indestructible   american ldo has a wwii soldier whos been reading way too many comics and war propaganda whose craving is i want to go on a glorious adventure making himself some sort of fantasy hero  italian ldo has one guy be way too obsessed over ancient rome and history and his craving is i want to remake the past and allows him to do exactly that  a giant fight multiway fight occurs in suwahara city where the leaders of all sides obtain atziluth  naraka gets a massive erection over how many new gods hes going to get for his tree  snek gets bored right before the final battle and act est fabula resets unknowingly cucking naraka
   i want to remake the past  atziluth  how would this work would he just paint the world in the image of his past or what would time just go backwards
  is it okay to bully kei
  it could be anywhere from time rewind repairing like crazy diamond reviving the dead or just making things but they have to be from the past
  it is actually unacceptable not to bully kei
  youll have to defeat this guy first
  i was referring to that desire on the throne assuming it is a hadou type which it sure as hell sounds like
  it might just force the world into some kind of regressing state 24/7
  ren and machina bullying kei
  is it okay to kiss kei
   ldo has a kamikaze pilot whos craving is i want to soar through the sky like a winged beast whose yetzirah lets him fly and briah flat out transforms him into some kind of sky dragon
  no
  italian ldo equivalent  was pic related another sensory of snek

1 spinne  2 lisa sakuya  3 kei rusalka know ryuusui  4 wilhelm beatrice trifa the eastern expedition  5 machina eleonore schreiber lot ryuumei  6 methuselah the yatsukahagi the fallen angels the seven dark lords of evil  7 hegemony gods/transcendence gods  yomi is a 4 mc a 5 and hirume is a 6  why is hirume so low on the powerlevel scale shes still the sensory of a throne god you know
  sensory of a throne god  you answered your own question and 6 isnt low
  1 spinne  number one
tfw you will never see mos shirou become the throne god
  what would a conversation between shirou and shirou be like
  please dont wank this shitty ending
  so people will whale for 7 hirume
  i love this picture too much
  there are only 6 thats the powerlevel chart
muzan get reveled  thots start getting btfo all over the world  coincidence  i dont think so
  but anon dont you want to see a universe full of superheroes and super villains
  the fuck are hegemony and trancendence gods
  hadou and gudou read dies man
  spinne using a small portion of his true power nichijoudeprived ren routecraving anna vampire loli wilheim shirou upon confessing he truly is gay for ren  openly desperately craving ren maybe hajun but hes too weak
someone post buff willy  you know the one after shirou dowses him in liquid nitrogen
  how tall is karl
  witty
atziluth
does karl agree with this
    nice beyblad
  damn how did you even come up with this what an interesting way to use your time
bully kei
  maybe low wasnt the right word but shouldnt she be more of a big deal like gudou god level or something well i supposed hirume steamrolling everything while the protag sits back and watches wouldnt make for a very interesting story
  that would make her look even more pathetic if the eastern expedition are only 4 are to say anything about it
  aeons anon well probably get both a pre and postgodhood ee the same way well get both the ldo and the yatsukahagi
  she be more of a big deal like gudou god level  no because shes a sensory not an actual god
  you shouldnt take it too seriously gudou are put on the same level of hadou when the power difference is obvious
  what power difference gudou might not be able to take the throne but theyre about as strong as hadou for all intents and purposes id rather trust masada than speculate based on the few examples we had so far
  id like to see gudou gods vs any hadou gods willing to fight in a fair fight
  a copy of saltman was enough to btfo most of the expedition team at their peak
  but theyre about as strong as hadou for all intents and purposes  wut
  what their wins against hadou gods or even the legion of one of them necessitated to have a lot of them teaming up and even then they only won because of tumorpulls  whole bunch of gudou jobbed to a half dead hadou  only won against him at his peak because of muh tumor  and it was his plan to be defeated anyway  jobbed against a second one who didnt even use his own power but weaker copies of past gods just to mock them  only won because muh tumor and shit again  meanwhile one hadou genocided an entire universe by killing everyone one by one
    not him but he has a point theyre in the same grade not in the sense of power but in scope everything else falls beneath them     and it was his plan to be defeated anyway  no it wasnt  only won because muh tumor and shit again  no because of keishirous sacrifice   meanwhile one hadou genocided an entire universe by killing everyone one by one  im fairly certain he did that as a man
  i know both hadou and gudou are 7 because theyve reached the divine but that anon believes the 2 groups are equal in term of power which i sincerely doubt
  not that guy but the half dead ones stronger than he ever was healthy  some of them are even as strong as reinhard if i remember right
  ah alright just skimmed what he was saying and missed that part for the most part hadous are stronger even if you ignore the probably now irrelevant taikyoku values   even then the yatsukahagi were shitters when compared to actual gods even gudous
  when will we get someone with the craving   i want to consume  i want to recover what ive lost  i want to become a hero of justice  i want all to obey my commands  i want to be like everyone else
   want to recover what ive lost  how would this one work
  not before he was resurrected by tokoyos taikyoku during that state he was weaker than before with a tk level of 70
  not golden experience requiem
  i want a world of suffering eternal

news w h e n 
so are the details of the extra route from the switch version known
  no its a bad translation with factual mistakes     do you want me to point them out in detail
    eh ill just do it    それは穢土に残留する現在でも変わらず  this actually refers to the last part ie the fact that michael still 滅びを願い続けていた specifically that he still wishes for it even 現在 when he 穢土に残留する instead you interpreted it as him being unable to change what kind of existence he is     極限まで達した死の希求はあまりに強く  here you made something up its actually saying that his 希求 desire longing for death is あまりに強く way too strong 極限まで達した modifies the 希求 saying its reached its peak utmost limits for postering ill add that 強く in this case isnt an adverb its simply ending the sentence with 連用中止形 see circled 2 in     鎧に封じなければ穢土の者さえ死滅の虚に蝕むまで  here you got the basic idea right his 希求 desire longing for death is indeed being sealed by his armor if it werent  穢土の者さえ死滅の虚に蝕む  even 穢土の者 his yatsukahagi pals would be 蝕む gnawed at slowly eaten away until theyre 死滅の虚 dead/empty husks    彼は滅びを願い続けていた  this you got to repeat myself the important thing is that this is what それ at the very beginning refers to
  for postering  for posterity
  gold
  yes youre just about a month late
  tell me then
  about what give us your questions
  what happens in the route
  real unbiased summary for the previous heavens introduction of all hadou gods their personalities and motives muzan is based as fuck hajuns still an autistic brat   the conflict with narakaco gathering of theirs armies and fast forward to pantheon
  sounds pretty cancerous
  cant have hajun without cancer
  likely only next month      but why
  the mobage doesnt really need to exist and the previous 天s didnt need any fleshing out
  well to each his own then as for me i liked it   now we know that the succession of the throne was rather peaceful most of the time each gods were a product of their world and even now there are still things left to do
  unbiased summary  literally every god is garbage but marie is the best just the best
  cant be the best if it gave birth to shitty people who think doing whatever they want  without repercussions is allowed  pic related is the best and she even know it
  sorry i shouldnt have said unbiased but from kouha first hand perspectives it being the best is her opinion
  literally the reason hajun definitevely lost it and no one could beat him
  what the hell were you expecting from the new switch story anyways  it was already known it would be about pantheon stuff while specifics were unknown it was clear from the start the new switch story would lead to pantheon  dunno why you even asked about it if you think pantheon doesnt need to exist
  cheers mate

  abokaya beiroshano makabodara mani handoma jinbara harabaritaya un
  low iq post
  oh so thats whats going on kei is mad her route is still is irrelevant and started shitposting on pantheon
so habaki is the tumours sensory right and rindou is his apoptosis since both of  them are still alive and kicking in the seventh heaven does that mean the tumour is still out there somewhere as an actual person
  considering how his entire craving was to live i wouldnt be so surprised his soul was pretty explicitly released from hajun so he can live all on his own now    that said im not sure the usual rules apply to rindou or habaki now that theyre defacto throne gods or that death of a god would lead to the death of its sensory
  kinda want him as a character in pantheon now i mean if masada still hasnt given up on shioris little brother surely he has plans for him right
  yes the dawn/tumour appears in the pantheon prologue as hirume shes its direct sensory daugther of habaki and rindou her true body is a sakura tree
  the tumour is amaterasu and hirume is its sensory now likely a result of becoming an actual person of its own    and so jokes were made of hajuns loli brotherniece
so is amaterasu the kind of guy to make a female custom character to avoid looking at a dudes ass
another month with no news  bros
  the weak shall not survive winter

  the woes of being eop
  
  dead franchise
why does everyone have such nasty cravings why isnt there a god who wants the world to be beautiful and full of cute things
  because noone wants that so badly that their autism overwrites reality cravings usually evolve from some form of trauma or a crippling defect autism since birth marie is close to the ine exception to this and even that is only because of a million million year timeloop plan on mercs part
  why not why couldnt someone who has been traumatised by evil like schrieber wish for a world with absolutely no ugliness whatsoever that could be grim in its own way
  because that makes sense and his a reasonablt craving that goes against needing to be autistic
  schrieber specifically is a bad example all of the characters cravings make perfect sense actually what i mean is that someone who has been a victim of the absolute worst humanity has to offer wilhelm too to a lesser extent could want a world where absolutely no suffering is allowed that sort of craving could be twisted to make it dark but it would still be cool to see cravings that arent outright hellish
  i want a world without sin  satanaels is about as close to that as you can get and it still ended up bad
  blame mithra naraka and/or whoever set mithra up to be first her law set into motion the cycle of crazy autism and its implied to be all according to keikaku with how the first heaven gets described as basically a miniature modelperhaps even a caricature of the shinza universe
  man i wish i could read moon kkk looks like a lot of fun yes i know i should start learning i will after my exams are finished with
  i want a boyfriendfree girl
  marie wanted to embrace everyone then hajun happened one thing we learn from maries route is that a law can fuck over its own creator just about any law can ruin things for everyone
  being shinza is suffering
i want to fuck marie
  that was the 3rd heaven actually the result of satanaels craving for a pure world without sin and ignorance because satanael sees ignorance as the root of all evil and sin
fellas i need pantheon  i want to roll the pantheon gacha
  tasogare
  naraka can use a law against its creator in order to fuck them over
    are you guys 100 sure about that because im pretty sure ive heard the tumour and shokou are not the same entity it also goes against what this anon said 
  talking about kirei     whos the better shady priest with a fucked moral compass fates mapo tofu man or shinzas betsujun ni naritai
  yomi said to our face that hirumes body is all of creation and that is why she need to use a sensory to interact with the world during the bath scene   gee i dont know anon it was blatantly said in the pantheon prologue or maybe im spouting bullshit
  trifa is a better character  kirei has a more relatable and down to earth issue
  shokou is the law that habaki and rindou have made together amaterasu has no connection to the tumor besides that fact hes currently part of it just like literally everything else in the world calling her the tumors reincarnation sounds a bit like a jump of logic to me
did mercurius really just give rusalka her powers because he was bored
  trifa is more entertaining  kirei i feel sorry for
  a mans gotta entertain himself for decillion of years somehow
  this is merely russalkas interpretation it might not be entirely wrong but its more likely he was sowing the seeds for his apoptosis at that point after all in order to create the ldo they neededwellspecial people
      the basis of amaterasus law is the tumours craving
  元になった渇望は化外を生まない  the craving in its foundation is i dont want to exclude anyone  originating from some source and being that source is not the same thing marie is not mercurius
  here you go anon and habaki and rindou are not hadou/throne gods only gudou gods  you should read the pantheon pastebin
  simply put you are the universe
  read more of the page
  そして畸形嚢腫を彼の夢であった新たな生命として流出させたのである  alright i guess you got me here so while hirume and the tumor are not exactly the same people his being was used during her creation so he shouldnt exist as a separate human at this point        these screenshots dont say anything about the tumor though so im not sure what youre trying to prove here
wasnt amaterasu literally the tumor and habaki and rindou made it take the throne after separating it from hajun with hirume simply being its sensory or was i fed bullshit
     it also goes against what this anon said   about this
  ah right okay then
  to be specific it went a bit like this  rindou takes in the tumors craving thanks to her nature as a ruler a potential hadou god except those cant be born under hajun  habaki spreads her rule because he redirects any force directed at him  tumorkun is reborn as a brandnew entity that he dreamed of  so it would be more accurate to say that hirume is the sensory of the being the tumor became after being reborn
  makes sense thanks anon
  he redirects any force directed at him  whenever this is brought up i always wonder but how exactly did he kill yato did he reflect the guillotines curse or did he just cut him really hard
  probably just overwhelmed him with brute strength thanks to the tumor no ability by themselves can bypass the time armor
    i always just assumed yato went out of his own will content with the fact habaki can beat hajun like this
  wasnt his keikaku to get himself killed as proof that habakis strong enough to take hajun on
  well yeah its just that his last attack was basically okay you pass if you survive this lets see you taking a godkilling blow with your face
  i kniw people that crave for cute things  but the way it would be implemented would digust you
  not op here but im interested what do you mean by this
  people that have fetish for cute things

  wwhat
  looking for someone specific or do you just want to roll in general
  kei
  i want to grab mercurius in a tight embrace and kiss him passionately on the lips i dont care about marie and i dont care that hes a boy hes so cute
  i honestly find pantheon art the best even if kkk was absolutely beautifulas well
  it is indeed great hoping they go all out with cgs ingame fgo had a rather late start with those
  i dont care if its gay i love him   heres a better screencap by the way
  thanks i thought i saved this
  reinhard looks so rapeable
  is it gay to rape a widehipped goat
  
  t reinhomo
i like knowing you eops will never ever get kkk and you can do is oogle the art and discuss basic plot elements you read about on some tumblr
  i like knowing that you are still mad nearly a year later that dies irae was translated
  why would someone be mad that a kamige of dis caliber got translated  please explain your line of reasoning
  most jops like having things as their own secret club and get mad when anything they used to try and feel superior ends up getting translated
  well thats stupid
  the amount of people who are like that is incredibly small
  small but vocal
  basically this     i dont like the idea of unwashed plebs like you touching things i like
  get ntrd kid
  what in the everloving fuck is this
  
  does it mean everyone becomes cute or am i not catching the meaning of what youre saying
what if my craving is for milkies will i acquire all of the milkies in the universe
  every being would have tits no smaller than size d
  what a nightmare realm
  size d  too small  i will not accept this
  kyonyuu or bust
  thats more of a gudou craving though you cant take the throne unless you give it a different spin
  i dont want flat chests to exist
  that craving sure seems like all fun and games but that is until you realize itd probably mean that even men and animals would get tits that would give taimanins kunoichi a run for their money yup youre imagining chuck norris and king kong with a pair of honkin honkers now
  i would fight to protect the survial of the flat chest
demo this month i can feel it
best harem
  i need to roll for my wife hirume
  im trying to train pic related to do that
  
  teach me your hyperchoupolygonkeikaku ways snek
   and i need to roll for my kamerad but i dont think theres going to be a gacha in the demo
  you will need patience foreknowledge and one of these
  gacha in the demo  that would be hilarious
  demo has a paid gacha  it doesnt roll over to the full version  it very clearly warns people of this  i want to see it happen just so i can laugh at the idiots who get angry realising they wasted their money
  ow the edge
  just like back in dies
swastika mandala  1068
  that really looks like a red spider not a snake or guilotine
  something something spinne
  his shirt actually comes off when the tentacles come out  i wonder how willhelm can keep his clothes in one piece when he shoots spikes out
  he asked one of the girls to sew a bunch of flaps into his costume he unzips or unbuttons the flaps before each battle
  he probably goes through multiple uniforms throughout the vn
  i can imagine lisa doing this and reprimanding him every time he ruins his uniforms
  ara ara
  does the kkk torrent in the op have r18 content
  曙之光  what do you think
  are there any not dead torrents for the original version
  his cgs gave me the impression that his spikes as weird as this may sound grow directly out of his ss uniform or maybe thats just gys signature quality at play here
  theyre pretty much like blood so i assume it just passes through his clothing in liquid form first before actually hardening
song to the witch     does someone know if hes doing wolfsrudel too
  ive tried looking for it but all i could find were dead ones sorry      for the time being it doesnt seem so
what would the craving i want to be best girl do
  gudou craving that turns them into a loli
  it transforms you into beatrice
  her hadoutype creation figment would make everyone trapped within it to perceive her as their ideal woman
  thats literally shiori  最高の私になりたい
  turn everybody into a certain shady verbose and smug roman snek
does anyone have senshinkan bansenjin downloaded my torrent just died at 91 and i cannot find any working alternatives
  nevermind we gud
  gib link ill add it to the op when i get the chance
    just finished downloading it and will be seeding for a while because its literally the only working one i found        also trying to download this currently at 50 and its going very slow but it has 2 seeders so i hope it makes it
is there a site with all the artbooks drama cd and the other stuff listed
  just buy the game my dude
  im not spending 60 bucks on a vn i cant read
what will the craving i want to be everyone do
  why are you downloading it then
  i just want to have all the light vns  also the hscenes
  well i guess you can seed them whenever someone wants to download one of them and cant find a working torrent i wouldve done the same hadnt it been for my shit internet
  you will lose your arithmetic skills
  can ldo feel cold
  probably not at least not to the extent where it can hurt them remember when shirou used liquid nitrogen against wilhem
  is she only wearing winter clothes for fashion
  i dont really remember was she still a die ewigkeit user after the ending
  partly but also maybe because of how it feels the feeling of the fabric against her skin might be comforting or maybe she wants to wear one because rens wearing one
what does the craving i want to crave do
  nothing any action would be contradictory since a person who craves something stops craving it the moment his craving is fulfilled
what would the craving i want to rape reinhard do
does merc keep all his memories between each reset or does he only get glimses of them through foreknowledge
  he probably doesnt get everything he describes it as a feeling that hes done something before or banged this chick before
  its not like he loses memory as a side effect or something its just that of course he wont remember everything after quadrillions of years
  if x things actually already happen then theres no reason for him to not know of course theres his memories fading or getting jumbled up because theres way too many years and repeats that he stops caring for anything but personally significant things    foreknowledge is like a constantly updating database whenever something new is created its already retroactively part of sneks knowledge this means even if something actually hasnt happened in reality to merc itll feel like it has happened as long as the event is within the countless possibilities of his everexpanding timelines  it takes beings that are independent of his law like marie to potentially blank him of foreknowledge
    lads
  lol at your life eop
are japanese scans of the dies irae novels available
  you would be able to rythmically shove your male genitalia into reinhards fecal excretion orifice against their consent until you either experience an orgasm and ejaculation or until their lower intestinal tract gives out from the sudden forceful traction of the insertion
do you guys think steiner was just hinting at things so he could laugh at our suffering is that how he grows stronger
  nope given he still has shit left to announce problem the nips for some reason didnt give him the definitive go ahead when they said they would  so if youve gotta blame anyone blame the nips
  how do you know he has stuff left to announce
  his twitter he posts about it sometimes  also this which is on his own twitter profile  
  thats a lot of projects is that normal for a translator
  he made a name for himself in the industry so not it unusual
he just tweeted the recipe for a kiss in the dark cocktail its the one that appears in ikabey and its like the third time he did it    unless hes being a misleading shit its obviously ikabey
  he might also be chuuni as shit about his drinks
    likely never releasing  huh i wonder why       yeah its been a while since he last teased something that could be kkk related
  is he that known
seriously what kind of beings could they be beside naraka is pantheon going to introduce something like beyond taikyoku for existence like them   i wonder if naraka/mithra went through all of this and get 10 hadou gods to use against the other 4 a la senshinkan
  time for outer gods
  a la senshinkan  for a moment you had me thinking that it could have been naraka and the four rosei but then i remembered hachimyoujins plot twist and any shinza connection just being stupid as fuck     masadas kinda already did that by making azathoth a chinese drug addict
    how about thelema
  something like beyond taikyoku  possibly i mean if it had a beginning who or what created the universe prethrone
  first mover is pissed at these autists
  how about thelema  too early for my chuuni tastes and probably because i already know about that faggot crowley but i guess it would be relatively unknown territory for nips
  the throne system hijacked his authority over all creation   now he wants revenge
  various possibilities and its not like only one of these has to be correct  1other beings that built the throne doubt it was just mithra and naraka who did the whole thing there mustve been others involved in the project  2a deity or deities who already existed before the throne was a thing theyd naturally be beyond any throne gods because they dont need the throne for their divinity and could keep being divine even if the throne and everything related to it was destroyed or didnt exist
  hmmm its true that were missing some myths in shinza i dont remember a lot of chinese or mezoamerican for examples maybe the 4 big guys will be themed like that
lets say a recently born god kills the current throne god but dies alongside him what happens to the wold with the throne left vacant
  wouldnt the universe end the universe is the throne god so if the god dies the universe dies with no replacement  though i assume the throne or naraka has a built in counter measure
  we already have spinne
  beyond taikyoku    beyond any throne gods
  mithra  zoroastrianism  muzan  kabbalism  satanael  also kabbalism  mercurius  hermeticism hermetic kabbalah  reinhard and ldo  norse mythology  marie    ren  faust legends  hajun  buddhism  amaterasu  shinto    plenty more religions and mythologies i could easily see taoism hinduism egyptian or mesopotamian mythology or maybe even the australian dreamtime having some analogue
  slavic paganism
  australian dreamtime  what would his craving be  would he get along with the snek family
  what about guys like dunsley  lovecraft who was inspired by guys like dunsley aztecs greeks  more can be done
  celtic definitely that  welsh stuff the stuff that inspired arthurian stuff
  reminds me that kouha was throwing the name varuna around as part of her communications with mithra at the end of the sidestory of course it could be a nonentity codename related to mithra    given that mithra is someone from prethrone its likely she has certain special knowledge/privileges on the system with how much she seems to know its almost like she never died at all im thinking that her mithra name is doublesided as the first throne god shes the avestan mithra and among the higher deity peers shes the vedic mitra
  if wikipedia and my memory are both correct the earliest protoindoiranian religion predating both the vedic form that evolved into hinduism and the iranian form that evolved into zoroastrianism typically combined varuna and mithra or mitra into mithravaruna given that her reign is named ahura mazda referencing zoroastrian dualism the use of the name varuna may indeed indicate something else prior to the creation of the throne
  hindu is already partially in hajun also we possibly have jainism in form of sansaravartin though it might be also buddhism
  im not sure if this has been posted here before but heres translation of ikabeys prologue  
  second line  already a spelling mistake
  muzan and satanaelprezoar are more abrahamism than kabbalism and tengu dou has a mix of hinduism buddhism and shinto in it  funny thing here is that muzan is missing malkuth here his connection to the current shinza world cut off
  the linked video has no sound but it has on youtube dafuq      configration in the very first screen
  as is he had
  十八番  number 18  oh boy
how does soushuu senshinkan realte to the throne vns is it part of any known heaven
  it isnt a part of the shinza banshou universe
  how does soushuu senshinkan realte to the throne vns  it doesnt yet 
  shinza is a video game series in senshinkan except that it isnt
  what do you mean
  pretty sure he means exactly what he said
jay howayouー
fuck you your not canon
ugry marisa
  fine sank you
  oki
i bet she sucks real good
  oh my gah
  i wish i were a bird
    fly away  to the store for more pasta i need more spaghetti
  you must learn on your own
i wish japanese bird would teach me his ways
henlo
  i miss her
  she is in a better place now
  hello alice how is gensokyo
  alice  alice  who the fuck is alice
  go ask alice
  dork
so whats the scoop /jp/
poster no20289795 from 4channel on the /jaypee/ board is a gay man who sucks cocks for a living and by that i mean for free
  man fuck the idol threads aya can you whip up an article that slanders them that they can please fuck off from the jay
  nosy reporter has been captured wat do
  free the birb with holding out for a hero in the background
  thats badwrongfun anon
  thats what she gets for trying to report on isis
some qt reporter is about to have my child more news coming in 9 months
ayas ears look retarded
  the ayayaers are cute soft pointy and smell good dont be rude anon
i took a shit and now it smells
  proof
  they look like goblin ears
  they look like elf ears goblino ears are green and full of shit
  buy newest bunbunmaru newspaper and find out
  will they be nice to her
  thats even worse
  no its not ayas ears like elves are soft and kissable
  sandpeople had no chance over wind birb
  yes theyll give her so many hugs that shell eventually end up joining and becoming a jihadi bride
aya with her leaf is thanksgiving
  chop her head off and fail several times or upside down drowning in mud take your pick  id say drowning is the worst
  thats not a leaf it looks like a leaf but its actually a hauchiwa 羽団扇 lit feather fan a type of fan that tengu usually carry it can create strong gusts of wind even in the picture you posted the fan is made of individual feathers rather than a maple leaf the reason zun chose to make it look like a maple leaf is because in mof the theme was autumn also because theres already a japanese maple tree called 羽団扇楓 hauchiwakaede lit feather fan maple that has leaves that look like a tengus fan
  holy shit i never knew aya was sōjōbō
  why is that bird better drawn than aya
  thats the real aya
  the popular image of the tengu king sojobo is what started the trend of tengu carrying hauchiwa yes aya is clearly not sojobo however any tengu can carry a hauchiwa heres a picture of a nonsojobo tengu carrying a hauchiwa
  thats ayas concept art zuns handrawn stuff generally looks better than his digital stuff
  thats cutest drawing of aya ever zun draws like a little girl
  leafshaped feathers
  i meant more of that it was a sevenfeathered hauchiwa which is carried by the king of tengu if i remember correctly
  the picture i posted had a seven feather hauchiwa as well and that tengu is certainly not sojobo
  drowning gets me hard so thats okay
  the scoop is you fuckers let ayas thread die overnight for shame
  all the 2d fags should stay on /anime and manga or /videogames
  /board
aya is that kind of girl that would give you her unconditional support or nay
  define unconditional aya would support those close to her but shes also quite a rascal
this one 
  like cheer you up when you are sad
  same anon here and being kinda close and kind if you are hypothetically in a relationship
    oh of course
im reading through steinsgate and kurisu just went ayayaya my heart skipped a beat thought youd like to know  apparently it means hold on a second or something like that is that accurate
  its like whoa whoa whoa or wait wait wait for the japs the point is aya uses it as a catchphrase
  thats perfect thanks anon i learned today
why dont we let this thread die and make a christmas themed one later
im gay
tengu is watching
and now they love it the yakumos can abuse and beat up everybody and nobody can stop em nobody can stop em theyre having their way with gensokyo they want our spellcards and if youre not with em mikos and youkai then you will declare that you are with the cirnoblic now and dont tell me that im a weirdo cause im upset about this and i should only go get upset about my favorite danmaku team winning or losing listen i know what tyranny means i know the yakumos are putting poison in our fishe and water i know the yakumos have stolen 85 trillion fishe i know were under the barrier act i know theyre hurting us i know theyre carrying out new word order i know they staged those terror attacks you know what its like to gut up to this and go out every day and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say occult ball incident was an inside job and lose most of the newspaper subscriptions i had you know what its like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastards are probably gonna end up killing me one day you know what its like knowing youve ruined my life you know what its like you sons of bitches im tired of your crap you commit evil youre part of an evil system and were standing up against you and the cirnoblic is going to defeat you in the end some of us wont make it personally through this but a lot of us are and in the end you are gonna be brought to justice for all the fairies you kidnapped for fairy protection service all you fps workers all you corrupt mikos all of you thatve had your way with innocent fishe over and over again who think your evil is invincible youre not invincible and god is gonna deal with you and you are cursed to hell
ayas newspaper is actually a tablois and is full of fake news  worse than the sun
  get off the keyboard you damn broom
  hi hatate
does aya lay eggs like a chicken
  no like most birds aya only lays eggs after fertilization
how great of a liar aya is does she acts like that with her closest persons or she is different
  she lays unfertilized eggs atleast once per month
  some dude went on a rampage because his pizza was missing
i hate that i love her
  why
  i love that she is free and do as she please but i hate that she will always be out of reach for me i love her confidence and nothing can stop her attitude i hate that i am fearful and a coward i know aya will never like me in fact i think she will hate me but i cant help but feel that she is just amazing
  clearly the solution is too man up
  i hear the very same anon who went on a rampage as hinted  challenged the yakumos head and won they supposedly answer to him now and is probably a reason why two of mataras trusted servants delivered the pizza asap seen in  the very same head that lost to the said anon must have forgotten and had someone else deliver to give off the impression that they knew nothing of it just to blame it on someone else but even that itself may be a tall tale
  your ears look retarded
  let the fucking thread die for byakurens sake we need festive ayaya
  why christmas is a month away
does aya start incidents just for a scoop
  look at 
  some fag is chasing another faggot around the entire board replying to him and changing his ip with every post  he looks mighty suspicious to the outside view i think its the same two people i suggest you contact the local miko miko as in shrine maiden not toyosatomimi
  something happend to eiki shes pissed  aya looking great as ever  same old same old   same news new day no incidents is a good thing
  patrician obsessed with the boihu thread poster your repressed homolust never gets old
birbs
  who said i was the same person whoever you are you seem to be a rather scared individual if you change it so often
  another excellent post
  aya makes a cute mom
  how new
i want to eat aya eggs
  why are geese not on there
  because geese deserve an entire album
  h o n k
  today i ate at a chinese restaurant
how affectionate is aya with crows does she actually have crows of her own or does she just use whichever ones are around does she treat them as pets servants or friends
    r you
  is called out on her bullshit that youkai like her feed on humans  defends birds by calling them friends of man  
aya is a bird i dont like to think about bird
  birds / youkai      why not you dont like birds what are you some kind of jerk
  tengu are a type of youkai  why would a youkai give a shit about a friend of man
  who are you quoting
birds have hollow bones  aya is fragile
  its nice that even a weak loser like me would be able to princess carry her
  because tengu are birdlike and aya likes birds       you hush
  so why emphasize on the friends of man part
  i have endure many traumatic events cause of birds i just want to live in peace without guilt or fear please dont bully me
  shed fly away immediately
  thats okay birds do that  its more about concept than execution
ayas pretty cool ive grown to like her
  why not      how the fuck could you get traumatized by birds
  because filthy youkai eat humans
  maybe not immediately if you take her by surprise shed need a second or two too catch up then freak out a bit before jetting off dont get hurt by the backdraft anon      as she is as you should
birdburg as in bird with burg dont eat birds anons shell know      sometimes so
  aya is the cnn and tmz of gensokyo
  aya doesnt even know what a tv is anon
  if aya could broadcast her shit journalism as a whole would even be more worthless through her presence alone throwing in more tabloid tier shit
  aya doesnt know what tabloid means either
  just because someone doesnt know what it is doesnt mean they cant do it  aya is a tabloid tier journalist who wouldnt even pass for a high school newspaper
  well yeah the paper she ran in youkai mountain school wasnt anywhere near as good as modern bunbunmaru i think thats a given  still put her heart and soul into it though
  if she changed her business to selling toilet paper nothing would change
  of course it would toilet paper is of very different material than newspaper paper and youd get ink all over your butt if you used it as such and again the fucks a toilet
  thats not true you cant patch paper windows with toilet paper
  blessed and cutepilled
  tengu shit in flight
  crow tengus meat taste like chicken
  shit isnt meat but still contains dna  and i dont recommend you open mouth too wide and look up when tengu fly around  not sure but maybe some villager could meet his death from frozen tengu shit
  youkai have superhuman strength and durability  she could take a 12 gauge slug to the face and be little more than irritated by it
aya is curing my fear of birds
  not sure if shitty or quality post
  thats disgusting no
  shes got eggs to lay
    aya doesnt like you staring when she eats burg
  ayas pretty good at handling stares if you give her a long look shell look right back until you stop killer at staring contests
  not toilet paper sold as newspaper  just toilet paper
  theres no such thing as a doortodoor toilet paper salesman anon dont be dumb
  anon beats the shit out of an op and a shitposter down on page 1 or 10 either of the two
  can we test that
  no  hes wrong youkai are tuff but not that tuff aya could get a face full of buckshot and handle it a hell of a lot better than any human certainly wouldnt die but it would still hurt like hell
  can we test how much she could take  would make for some interesting news
  no
  shed live and it would sell papers
i want to snap ayas neck
  im aya shamemaru and this is jackass
    no
  but itd sell papers
  this image speaks to me on so many levels
  so would nude pics of herself every issue there are some things ayas not willing to do too get more subscriptions the answer is no anon
  what are the current diplomatic relations between tengu and humans
  i still want to know how you developed a fear of birds theyre small and harmless and cute and flock off the second you get anywhere near them
  ayas already willing to commit libel to get more subscriptions  why not do stunts or nudes
  because she doesnt want too its scary and gross
  chicken
  not chicken birb
  come to australia and you will learn otherwise
  scary and gross  just like tengu
aya is hot
  crow actually theres no such thing as chicken tengu just wolves crows and occasionally bunnies      australia  well that answers that my sympathies anon
  half right
aya has a nice pair of breast
  its winter anon      ill not be conflicted over boobinite aya
  the canadians arent off much better either  fucking geese
  i fapped with ayas bloomers
imagine you just walking on a normal day but you look up into the sky and you see aya looking upon you it would be very a unreal feeling
  it sure would
  explain
  its at north sentinel island  you should go there
i want to feel ayas chest as i grope her in the bed on the warm embrace of love
aya is not even my 2hu but shes been making me feel really fuzzy inside lately
  go see a doctor anon its for your own good
  perverted foot fetishist sucks on ayas feet he better go make her a sandwich or its going on the news
  crow feet
  fuzzy how warm and fuzzy flustered fuzzy comfy fuzzy
  do you really think ayaya cant handle a bunch of dipshit humans they dont even have terrifying science weapons
  do you seriously think the sentinelese cant handle a stupid bird  she doesnt even have any terrifying bird features
kill all footfreaks
  shes faster than the speed of sound and can control galeforce winds shes got that youkai strength and durability shes probably a martial arts master shes got the knowledge and experience of centuries and she can fly
  the sentinelese survived a massive tsunami and can shoot down aerial targets with swarms of arrows they got savage strength and durability theyll all probably archery and spear masters they have the knowledge and experience of centuries past down from generations of pure hatred toward outsiders and they have unknown numbers
  and speed of sound galeforce winds woosh hurricane zip a dozen guys just died and even if even if theyre more than she can handle shes halfway back to japan in the blink of an eye   stop trying to get aya hurt and stop trying to get this tribe killed
i wonder if aya ever ate human does aya like the taste of human flesh
  she has you dont leave for centuries as a youkai without eating human meat anon the jurys out on if she likes it much though tengu arnt especially known for eating people   it might be an interesting topic to bring up with her if youre feeling brave
  would aya create a human youkai race war to sell more papers
  just confused
  it depends does that paper include a sports section
  she makes my peepee grow
this thread is probably aya being a lazy hack and fishing for stories to put in the bunbunmaru reminder that tengu journalists glow in the dark
is aya a nice tengu
  of course      as if shye knows how to use a computer  and dont be fooled by her bright and cheery demanior anon aya does not actually glow in the dark thats be very inconvenient
  t glow in the dark
  so it was prostitution or she was having a fantasy about the money and after that she fucked the guy
  i want pictures picture of yamame
  whats the source of it saucenao gives me nothing and did you color this
  aya pretending to be a normal journalist and taking pictures of a super fast tengu
aya
  i colored it
  care to share your secrets my colorings always look dull
  she doesnt actually want pictures of yamame
  its not a big deal i just use the mouse and sai to do it try to find the best quality image tou can find and after painting the part i want i put a filter with a color related to the emotion i want to show
  can you expand on the filter thingy what exactly do you do
  aya already has to gestate her own eggs she cant hold yamames eggs too i feel as if they didnt think very much for this plan both of them need to start over and try something else
  layer of pink paint with a 5060 opacity just to add a touch of feeling over the page
  thats not how this works anon
aya is kind of cute no
  kind of
  interesting ill play around with it to see what i can come up with thanks for the help anon
  just a little bit cute
  ayayaya
  i think youre selling her short anon dont be stingy
  aya is eh kinda cute
  kinda
  fine she has above average levels of cuteness
  you just posted my absolute most favorite aya picture you bastard thats cheating and even with that fantastic pic youre still only calling her above average
  oh sorry i actually meant to say slightly above average
  youre just trying to milk me for cute ayayas arnt you
huh
  aya is for breeding
  nope
  i dont have to milk cute ayayas i dont lie when i say that i have more than a thousand of them which is pretty surprising for a somewhat cute 2hu isnt it
  why dont you love her  she deserves to be cared for in every way
  how very mysterious
  saying someone is for breeding has some negative connotations anon it doesnt sound loving
scoot the bids
  eh eh its sweet right  butaya we can fly we dont  but its so cool right  there arnt any roads we live on a mount  isnt it awesome
aya is for hand holding tender loving and inseminating
  thats more right
  disgusting and inexcusable aya needs to stop getting her period in other peoples food
ayayayayayayayaya
  is aya on a mid life crisis or is she compensating for her small penis

threadly reminder that she is far far older than her appearance and know too many way to fuck you up if you tried to mess with her  she like to be mess with though so its ok
  its strangely reassuring that shes over a millennium old it means that shes seen it all before and can expertly identify and guide virgins who come to her for intimacy because they cant get a real girlfriend or wife for whatever reason and if i mess up or cum too quickly its not going to matter since im just a small blip in her lifespan

  ok im gonna use this too
yoda is the cutest 3rd gen
  nice glad to see theyre being given the attention they deserve
  they dont look like shadows to me a lot of idols have them and its considered normal in japan though because they have bad dental care
  thats not rentan
  shes not even top 10 cutest 3rd gen
  apart from they have amazing dental care and you are going from a racist stereotype  source japanese  extra source your own pictures you tofugut

  scandal girl in the making
  dare
9 new kanji members  shaka when the walls fell
  its been clear for a while but that they couldnt go on having all girls constantly performing minus the unit songs  im just hoping that the rumours arent true and that my 35chan is still in
  that is a funny looking 出
i just cant wait to see all the new girls in each group i love it when new girls join everything feels so new and fresh and wonderful
  im forcing myself to believe shes been dropped dont wanna have false hopes and work myself into a suicide shoot praying for a faceless cutie like the nogizaka girl to replace 35
  cringe back to stage with your fluffy warm hugbox posts
  girls  plural  in each group  someone tell him
  you cant make me
  which nogi girl
i feel anxious about tomorrow what time will the first girls be revealed 1pm jst
  who the fuck said the girls will be revealed tomorrow
  
    made for the kisses of white men
  too bad youre not white
  prove im not white
how saggy is too saggy
  you like kyonko
for real tho ume is breath taking
  and then you find out her height
  kanji  indonesia   hiragana  malaysia  nogizaka  rest of the world
  which isnt an issue because only manlets care about that
  beggin ya to gain height ya dwarf
idols over 165cm are ng
  t manlet kek
  t midget
ideal idol height
if youre under 6 ft 0 you need to get the fuck outta this general
  over 55 you need to leave
the best combo is being at least 65 with a girl at least as short as yoda
ripopo center when
  cumming inside of her wearing this xmas outfit
  ideal idol everything
  so beautiful and she looks like an ojousama my dream woman
  except personality and looks
  damn the thumbnail looks like shiraishi they could be sisters
  do you guys think if youre a pretty good looking white guy with a good job in japan not teaching can you get a girl like this
ume is really cute yet she intimidates me
  sure now all you have to do is apply for a job which youre better at than any japanese applicants and be fluent in the language or be military if you consider that a good job
happy birthday my lovely junna
  nice well i have the language skills and will have the job skills in a couple years hopefully the ojousama type girl will be ok with a white guy lol
  i didnt like her at first because i assumed she would have a bad personality since she is so pretty but she seems really nice and willing to do what she has to for entertainments sake
  my favorite from this gen  what a beauty i pray for her pb
  damn mukai thats a lot of forehead
  pls no bully
  i would be sleeping at all
  made for the french kisses of white men
  tfw no ume mommy
  my eyes on karin
  patrician
  i want to spend the day painting cloud shapes on my wall with karin and then pin her against that wall and fuck her roughly while the paints still wet getting her all messy
  its like a hiragana keyaki support group panel  they must have felt so comfy there
  she isnt for this
  reports of her assets have been greatly exaggerated
the new hiragana girl is neru
the new hiragana girl should debut on a snack mao corner
have they decided when nanases last event will be
  i really like how mao pushes the girls in her sr most of them end up breaking out of their shells and showing us different sides of themselves
  ive been a big fan of mao ever since that bungee jumping episode where she talked kyoko up like crazy the way she lifts all the other girls up when she gets the chance is great
  i hope they didnt
the stuff they are talking about must be the reason why hiragana is getting more jobs      yeah your words fit perfectly she indeed lifts up the rest of the members   i used to think nothing of nao but when i learned that she admires mao for the effort she puts and helps mao out with choreos etc i started to like her more
  group mixing  no
  it is useless to resist
  i want togive manatsu some anal pleasure
  7 good girls
  dude be grateful its not sakamichiakb
kyonko is so hot
  not really  shes just really really good at presenting herself favorably
    wrong  the answer was  the cutest girl  i wouldve accept the most cute girl too
  yes better than most of the other members
  she really is
  a rose by any other name smells just as sweet  also her speaking voice gets bonus points from me she needs a radio show
  sayuringo gundan always delivers
fellas i must say i really love renochan what an absolute cutie she is so lovely
  sexiest hiragana
  except kobayui miku and neru
  neru looks unzippable
  so hot it triggers
  whats with the epidemic of horizontally flipped photos are japanese smartphones not smart enough to show a flipped image when using the selfie camera but then actually save a correct nonflipped image
this is my favourite kyonko pic
  unf  best girl
3some
  best girl
  id prefer this 4some 
  i love thin neru
  kyonko  all
  that is true but she also hides them very well still love her regardless
  thin neru is objectively worst neru
  factually incorrect
that 4noki fag dropped hiragana oshi were doomed
  wut
  who i dont keep up with all you peoples personalities and boogeymen
  i assume theyre the subber whyd they drop it
so no more hiragana oshi subs then huh looks like theyre dropping everything keyaki related because the translator is being a drama queen about kanji 2nd gen and hasnt warmed up to hiragana yet which caused some people to say they were being too dramatic and they took offense to that and said theyre done with all keyaki content  check twitter  shida and zuumin oshi
  she will be back or not
  when yone told her that she was graduating aoi said that she was said because she wanted yone there when she came back so shes coming back
we are fucked
        surely someone will step up not the hero we deserve but the hero we need
  hmmm  almost every line in their last oshi subs had some pretty awful english which was surprising since they had really improved massively with the last couple of episodes before that  i guess that was because they lost interest before finishing it   i like those hiraganas so much ill just watch it raw even though i dont understand jap even idiots like me can understand 5 of it though context and osmosis
maybe gees will pick up oshi since he already does the other two varieties
  what the fuck happened
  he/they do waaaaay too much work already he does akbingo nogichuu keyake and he does nogibingo with beam whenever thats on too
  this  
  bitches bitching for attention  meh
  fag posted a rant about how he cant accept a kanji second gen because muh 21 and everyone called him an idiot
  based
  the text explaining why he hate 2nd gen was cringe af
  psst  gajinsan  you want a some sucky fucky 3
    just a disposable piece of shit
this is him ranting about kanji 2nd gen and hiragana people said he was taking it way too seriously and not giving the new girls a chance and so he got all buttflustered and shut it all down
filthy eops on suicide watch
     just read it i dont think ive ever cringed so hard in my life which is something considering im fan of a group with techi in it
  totally    he should just khs already
  now you remember ito marika
  well damn admirable amount of work anyway
  being a neet really fucked him up lol
  expecting his suicide message on the day of 2nd gens omitatekai
  lol the whole bonds bullshit mantra that kanji had meant nothing in the end members got thrown under the bus the moment they got into scandals and wanted out because they knew they were just going to be just backup dancers to techi 2nd gens was a long time coming with whats going on with the kanji group
  lol
  ayy i havent reported gees videos in a while maybe ill start again
the best idol variety show is without a translator  meanwhile the worst idol variety show nogibingo is always translated  what fresh hell is this
go away fag you will be replaced before 2019
  tthen im reporting gees reeee
  dudes a faggot i actually love all 21 kanjis but im definitely in for a 2nd gen it will shake things up and thats been a long time coming those new girls deserve their shot too also far be it from me to scoff at more hopefully cute girls
why every subber is an entitled fag
  this
  plus all the members in the group with the exception of techi and neru are replaceable the fact that he/she cant see this is laughable cant imagine how the person will react when members get kicked to under group if it gets made
  theyve always been attentionseeking drama queens   i bet you theyll start begging for adoration and leave hints that theyll pick it up again if just more people would appreciate them more    i mean im grateful for the subs as they take a fuck load of work but they werent filled with pretty dreadful english most of the time    i dont think you should give him too much of a hard time for that post though some people do love these girl quite a bit
  just go and report gees already
  totally agree nogibingo is trash and is fulled translated even with background and not only in english spanish too
  what are you talking about
look at me im a subber and my bias must be law  nope you are just a faggot  reeeee im not subbing until you give me the reason  no one cares   im reporting gees too give me the reason t_t  lol
  para los pibes del barrio
my bias  lmao this is truly the kpop general now
  flawless compilation/10
were so alive subbers should drop shows more often
  oshi korean subs when
    hey fuck you
    wish have subbers like koreantvrelated do in half day they sub shows of 1 hours
    what happened yesterday i didnt logged in at all yesterday    sent from my loli world
  the funny thing is that it happened just like this    kek
  oh shit not  meant 
too many words and no cute girls pics  im confused
  hahahaha so accurate it triggers
  were filled with  pretty silly mistake to make with that criticism
  then go and watch those korean shows
yo my fellow indonesians please do the sub from now on
  if jpop was still popular we would i read somewhere ages ago that this was all youtube premiums fault
  i do and i watchjapanese show too is not hard to do 2 things
  kotoko saving the thread again
  google translate does an 8/10 indo to english translation just get the text file and use the translator
brb learning moon /djt/ here i come
  yeah its crazy how theyre all out in less than a week
  welp i guess ill go back to twice now
  this    gees is/are real life heroes
  that about sums it up
  japanese in variety shows are easy enough youre pretty much fine with just a simple understanding of daily japanese vocabs
posting a girl i only came to appreciate recently
  typical keyakifags
  unf
how crazy are they gonna get when techi graduates
this same guy will be subing again before 2019 claiming he received a lot of support from the silent majority of fans who really appreciate his work
  sugoii  kawaii  meccha oishii  yabai  doushiyou
  mass suicides
this is why im a gana fan keya fans are just cringe
  because they have so many dick riders
  i kill myself
boy that guy is gonna feel like a moron when his dream girl is in 2nd gen
just google translate indo subs
  never techi is and will always be his second coming of christ
  i did that for the ngt adaptation of that gore anime serie and it was really enjoyable
  potplayer can translate subs on the fly
people really like hiragana oshi
  awesome
  he said hes a zuumin and shida oshi tho
  better than bingo and maybe kakenai
  shida  hahahaha
  hiraganas were meant to be on tv      how can you oshi girls that arent idols
  youll have to ask him but thats what he said in his speech
  thats not the machine translation by the way      i google translated and edited a hkt odekake episode once it took ages and was probably incredibly inaccurate but it let me get the gist of the episode  it was horrible and shoddy though and i would never ever share a machine translated sub never mind one that went though two languages    i have a massive amount of respect to subbers/timers/typesetters were lucky to get soooo much content
  just stop liking techi
  read all my lies and beg me to sub again     lok nope
  impossible
  this shameless attention whore
  its the next best thing after nogidoko
  if you really truly love techi you will know she deserves to be set free and will send her off with a smile and a thank you for everything shes given you
  what i dont like depressing subs and i hope they dont touch oshi again  im just saying i appreciate the actual good subs we get from people that arent drama queens and do it for the love of idols instead of epeen  i admit im probably being too much of a pansy but i think were on the same side
  i prefer to die
2gen so good its already cleaning the fandom    sasuga great girls
  just ignore him being ignored kills the fags for good 
but seriously though guys naako center when
  i will do that but im also not in a rush to say goodbye when the time comes though ill wish her well and be happy for her
  its the fans fault   everyone liked techi up until futari saison after that the hardcore techi fans got insufferable
  she is the center of my heart
ha you all need me  we have indo to english translation for when subbers become entitled bitches  nno dont please worship my work instead
  i still cant believe them  techi has been pure shit for like a year and a half now if not more  and they still go on and on as if shes the most incredible thing on the planet  i feel so fucking bad for the girl
  why is hori being so brazenly touchy with that man
  hori is the man in that relationship
  meta cringe didnt make it past the 4th line
  based
  i think they probably google translated it themselves looking at the english in their subs
  your wrong
  ikuchan
  because their estatus is all theyve got in their sad pathetic shit excuse of a life
  i cant stop staring into those eyes help
  finna
kek what a lame excuse for being an entitled lazyfag
  how
  just give up
  saggy bitch
  i
    hnnnng
    pb when
  its that sultry succubus smirk at 6 seconds that really makes it for me
  fair enough
    this pose in microbikini please
  kek im watching this right now  idols being scared is the best thing ever  tfw youll never watch horror movies with your oshi
  i dont think anything will top zombie hori
  which episode
  if your oshi doesnt like horror movies shes basic
  nogichuu 14
  maimai 
  does she actually scare the other girls like this  and i dont suppose youd have a link to this episode subbed
  here you go yeah the whole point is to prank the other members she makes an adorable zombie  
  thanks bro  also someone needs to make a webm of when the balloon popped in latest episode
  her voice does wonders
theyre here  nogizaka46com/member/
  fuck i fucked up sorry  
  the first girl is pretty cute  theyre getting younger and younger its making me feel strange
  what in the world  respect for subbing as long as he did  but what the hell why would anyone be so mad about more cute girls    i  mean i kinda get it if he was into zuumin/shida poor guy feels burned and takes it out on 2nd gen but reacting that badly indicates some serious insecurity
  ugh uglies
no 15  no 63   no 67
  i like it
no real stand outs in that batch 6 more to go but if it continues to be more of that level theyre going to get buried hard by 3rd gens
  dont care for other girls but 63 though really bums me out
another 14 year old
  the korean companies actively encourage subbing and distribution of their material rather than autistically enforcing copyright japan by and large doesnt feel that it needs a foreign market they also enforce copyright like madmen due to a legal patent/copyright paranoia culture driven by their proximity to china   since much of korean industry was already copied from japanese stuff and china cant really emulate the success of kpop the koreans are less concerned about that copyright enforcement
ijiri is sitting somewhere in his pants just smiling
new youngest member
  patrician
  fucking 2004 lol i gotta move on from idols soon

no cute girls got drafted   bet these people feel pretty dumb right about now idol makeover never fails
  this cant wait to see the halfblack girl
  this was back when i fell in love with techi but i hate her now how i wish she had stayed like this she was perfect
bijin
  underrated post

i am just so glad that rentan has a friend her own age
  fuck yes she is absolutely beautiful  what number was she
idol makeover still below 3rd gens level they staying in unders
  37
  oh god im in love
  i really hope shes in kanji just so theyre even more shit
  shes 14
  thanks  i cant see another being better than her for me  although i loved 44 the most during the auditions now shes gonna be stuck in kanji 
thank god there are no kubos christies or horis this generation
  you say that as if you think i would care
  sure some are cute but people were comparing with the 3rd gen and hiraganas during the showroom audition the draftees were supposed to be better
  but i like ayano and hori
  this but unironically
  then you have a shit taste
i really wish each group brought in 1012  could you imagine 36 new members at once fuck at least 60 would be cute
  kubo is joining the senbatsu lineup and never leaving it accept it
  quantity over quality   this aint akbusu son
give me a you when the videos have been uploaded on youtube
new gens trigger me reeeeee
        
hmm yes i believe i shall christen our new girls now
  this guy is an absolute fucking faggot it makes me want to quit my actual job as a translator and translate all sakamichi shows just to put him out of business hiragana oshi is the most entertaining show right now and keyakitte is absolute ass last episode was fun i wont lie someone tell me how translating shows works and ill look into it seriously i can probably  get my hands on hd raws but doesnt translating need script writing or something its not just adding text to video via imovie or adobe right
  thanks senpai
  are you translatorkun  more cute girls is not a bad thing lmao
maimai has brown and mature feet
youngest girl getting the most replies rts and likes on twitter  sasuga pedos
  maimai in her prime was top tier idol
  i wouldnt read too much into that she seems to be the prettiest of that particular group of girls so naturally she would recieve the most attention
  someone who knows more about this can correct me you use a subtitle editing program like aegisub to time typeset and write translations watch this video to see what it looks like          most subs are timed and translated with basic typesetting though
  you have to admit that shes a real cutie though
  loving lolis is perfectly natural anon  if god didnt want us to love them then he wouldnt have created them
  ok cool thank you
  hes testing us dont eat the fruit before its ripe
  dont eat the fruit  thats not much of a test though
      
  i dont want to eat the fruit i want to give it some pocket money in a totally nonpredatory way
finally we have a sakura and mayu in nogizaka
  it was a metaphor my american friend
  uhm yeah i think renka is gonna eat little tsutsui ayamechan alive
  bbut thats forbidden love
  not with that jaw rentan is old and busted now ayame is the sweetest product on the market
  minna kawaii
my rule is a good song
  that last girl could pass for kaedes cousin whyd they let this busu in shes gonna get mogged by everyone else
  shes cute
  they are if they arent up to standards even nogis third gen could stand to drop two girls in particular
  holy fuck youre right
  yoda and ozono if anyone was confused
  holy fuck youre right
  why would anyone want to get rid of yoda
  she took kuboshis spot in the senbatsu and shes ugly
  naw renka is superior
  oh youre roleplaying what a faggot
  cute
  who the hell calls her ozono please stop bullying momoko
  heres a you for your 10/10 bait
  a lot of people think their oshis are threatened by yoda because yoda is the cutest girl in the world
  she is not even cute
  shes cuter than your oshihori and kubo
  shes cute but not that cute nanase is still the cutest girl on this planet heck even ashu is cuter than yoda
  nanase is the cutest lizard  ftfy
  even ashu is cuter than yoda  sure if youre indonesian
  i n f i n i t e  s h o w r o o m s
  lossless horizontal flip
  so what if i am is my opinion not valid
  yes
  shes addressing all the recent issues
  holy shit shes on
  shes addressing all the recent issues  boy its gonna be a long stream
hirate yurina has just announced her graduation
    i love listening to idols sniffling snot
hirate is doing showroom what a world we live in
  i dont feel threatened by yoda probably because fire is way cuter    but yoda is easily the cutest 3rd gen
  that would be hilarious
this isnt center material
  cute boy
look at this fuckin midget
they should just fold kanji and send the few shining stars to nogi and hiragana
  already ended  whatd she say
wow a 10 minute long stream techi really cares about all her fans
techi a shit
  i hate you fuck off
  take that back or i wont be subbing shows anymore
  i used to think she might be the best center of all time but i was wrong
  i can sub but only words like yamete kimochi ect
  kubo got fat puberty phase and needed time to get it together while shes in unders now that shes in shape shell make it into senbatasu next time especially now that both nanase and waka are gone leaving two spots open
  they need some busu to balance shit out even perfection like 3rd gen has 23 busu
  this but unironically
  if anything ito riria and kaede took a temporary spot in senbatsu i dont see either staying for long yoda has held her spot in senbatsu and wont ever go to unders at this point kubo will take her rightful spot in senbatsu soon enough      01 01 30/30 00 kubo shiori 2nd round sold out  01 01 30/30 00 yamashita mizuki 2nd round sold out  01 01 30/30 00 yoda yuki 2nd round sold out  04 04 30/30 00 ozono momoko 3rd round sold out  04 04 30/30 00 hori miona 3rd round sold out  04 04 30/30 00 hoshino minami 3rd round sold out  04 04 30/30 00 shinuchi mai 3rd round sold out  08 08 30/30 00 ito riria 4th round sold out  08 08 30/30 00 higuchi hina 4th round sold out  08 08 30/30 00 sato kaede 4th round sold out
  what did mayu mean by retweeting this
  she wants to go to the sea with this person
  even me would love to go to sea with this twink boi
  kubo will be a perma senbatsu same goes for riria with all the graduations going on
  thank god that hs sales has never been the beall endall in sakamichi thats all im gonna say
  of course
what to do on showroom  oh its friday today  i dont think showroom is for me  i should probably get going  leaves after streaming for 10min
  seriously what a cunt still cute though 
  partly true ikoma got kicked from center because of piss  poor hs only reason she stayed in senbatsu is because of her public recognition but even she got kicked to the back in the main lineup
  true her hs is good and a decent talker kaede is struggling on tv though even she admitted recently
  got a source for that or are you just speculating and stating it as the truth there was no indication that ikoma was gonna be a perma center and she didnt even want to continue being the center
hirate has to be trolling now 10 mins only jeez
    kissable lips
fire showroom when
  you can call it speculation but her popularity by the 4th single hs she got passed by other members despite being center by the 5th single mai was clearly the most popular which resulted in her getting the center in the next single 6th single hs nanase had gained popularity too which gasped got her her the center position ikoma was no good in hs and suffered because of it realistically management wasnt going to stick with her after seeing the results    4th single seifuku no mannequin hs results    01 01　25/25 19/20　matsumura sayuri  02 03　25/25 18/20　shiraishi mai  03 02　24/25 18/20　hashimoto nanami  04 04　15/21 12/16　nishino nanase  05 07　12/20 09/18　ikuta erika  06 05　08/21 11/16　takayama kazumi  07 11　07/19 03/14　fukagawa mai  08 na　07/11 na/na　akimoto manatsu  09 09　06/19 04/14　sakurai reika  10 10　05/19 03/14　wakatsuki yumi  11 14　05/19 02/14　nakada kana  12 08　05/16 08/08　eto misa  13 na　04/13 00/10　ito marika  14 06　03/23 10/18　ikoma rina    6th single girls rule hs  01 01　30/30 25/25　shiraishi mai  02 04　30/30 20/23　nishino nanase  03 02　30/30 25/25　matsumura sayuri  03 03　30/30 23/25　hashimoto nanami  05 07　28/28 08/18　akimoto manatsu  06 09　26/27 04/21　sakurai reika  07 06　25/28 08/23　ikuta erika  08 11　24/26 02/21　wakatsuki yumi  09 05　21/28 09/21　fukagawa mai  10 15　08/21 01/18　inoue sayuri  11 12　08/20 02/13　saito yuri  12 10　07/28 02/23　takayama kazumi  13 15　07/26 01/18　eto misa  14 17　07/14 01/13　ito marika  15 08　05/28 05/23　ikoma rina    hori too was no good in hs despite being center and we saw how much she went through before she recovered difference she didnt have much public recognition at that time and even got kicked all the way to unders    her hs in barrette 7th single 15 05/22 01 hori miona hs does play a role more than you think
  she already did hers about a hour ago
  what noooooo
are all the new girls known and were just waiting to see where they go or is that unknown as well
  so you got nothing cool then
  in the first year or so i thought she was the savior of keyakizaka and idols in general  what the fuck happened after that  i will never understand
  if i get a body like this i can definitely fuck my oshi
    cute family
  only the faceless girls are unknown the rest were waiting to see where they go
  popularity without struggle does that to you look how humble maiyan is she went through difficult times of nogi when they werent popular and even after nogi and herself got popular she remain humbled techi just got worse over time
  dont talk about jesus like that you insect
i think techi will do it again one day she was clearly very nervous and bashful with all the awkward embarrassed giggling she was doing i bet shell show up again with someone else
  she did the bare minimum she was required to do to promote the pb
  thats how she sees as everyone as this point
    
  this it was likely a mandate by management for everyone to do a sr and she did the bare minimum she doesnt even do interviews anymore you think shell do a 30 min sr lol
  oh cool do you have a link to the pics of the new girls
holy fucking busu gen yucks sakamichi is finished
  check the last thread
was just about to post this ganas won the best newcomer award        
    fan voted by script kiddies  wow who cares
  proud of our girls their hard work is finally being awarded
new gens  old gens
one of those 4th gen girls look like baba fumika      cool
holy shit did i miss techis sr
  how can the ones who sr without faces even compete
  i missed it too fuck this phone looks like she was cute though
  she wasnt
  looks like she was cute though  she wasnt  
    she was
  yeah i noticed that sometimes the notifications dont even go off
  it was only 8 minutes and she didnt do much
  they should have picked 25 this is the biggest mistake ever
  ah yes im sorry for not being a southeast asian cultist maniac who would eat the steaming shit outta her asshole on command
  stop being an overdramatic drama queen
  i dislike techi as much as the next guy but i would do that for 50 of all sakamichi members so thats a weak insult
more techi please
  for the love of god take a screenshot next time anon
  did you see these 
  she needs to grow her hair longer again
  this fresh cuties are the best
  yes cute af
  shes cute either way but i do admit that to me that was the cutest techi era right there    agreed
      techi pb fucking when
  its just pictures of her collapsed unconscious in various locations
  you just need to believe in your heart and anything is possible
  hhahahahahahahahahaha  and even that will
  but in microbikini
  dam
  techi should grow out her hair to waist length god she looks terrible with short hair
  thats cute
  shorter than ranze    kek            still more cute than hirate
better than techi    
  who is mayu
  pretty accurate
  lol  even that obasan is less half assed than the real one
  where is this from
  she got death threats after she did the kazeni one this one is even more hilarious
  cultists are something else death threats over a comedy gag
  death threats  stop mocking techi or ill kill myself kind of threats kek
  is that kintaro
  i dont see any difference
  look at the music and dancing they enjoy being edgy is putting it lightly
  yep
  gross tooth another girl who doesnt know how to brush her teeth
ive gone and done it boys ive preordered it
  worst girl hope she suffers a careerending and potentially life threatening injury
  why didnt you wait for the different cover arts to be revealed first
  looks fine to me does a girl you find dentally acceptable even exist
  look at the tooth second from the right
  you can see her dandruff
  madkun i thought you were on holiday to shutup     covers  im interested in the titties why do i care about covers
  i regret asking
  your mama regrets having you
    im with anonfirebro why are about covers itll be on a shelf with the spine showing most of the time or open to pages for them to cry and drool on
      
whew lads
  hnnnggggh insta when
  yeah some minor discoloration its not something youd even notice in person
  would abduct
what is this from
  tfw i used to like her until that cringey autist got hold of her and used her as a shitposting weapon now she could graduate tomorrow and i wouldnt bat an eye
  fire
  madkun i like your thinking you waited awhile to hide your samefagging but you didnt hide your ip soo
  if thats all it took then you probably didnt like her to begin with
  i know what you mean i honestly hope she graduates at this point because of the autist im still buying her pb tho
  ill give her a carrerending pregnancy
ive preordered her pb now just to make you all mad
  i honestly did sure she wasnt my oshi or anything but definitely one of the few girls i enjoyed
ill never understand hating a girl because of autistic fans
lactating fire
  go back to polluting the other general with your low iq posts and samefagging
  youre in the wrong fandom then
  i love these cutie autistic girls
  holy sheeeeeet
whats her name again
  kitano hinako
    北野日奈子
    preordering right now
  based
samefagging about preordering something    meh
  probably doesnt even have money for 1 copy
  izone sure got boring fast
  she has the fans she deserves after all
  bet you feel silly now
  indonesian timezone  4435 yen  no i do not
  pretty much
  this triggers them too
  indo time  it is only 1243 am what are you on about madkun
    unable to work out the universal time zone  being this new to the internet
  why is your total price so high
  i got the limited version signed and gift wrapped
  are you talking about yourself even says utc9 there
  indokun on damagecontrol after getting exposed
  thats nice but go to bed now fmecha
  also says 30th itd be the 1st there are you even trying madkun
i love techi
  look at the picture
  the day changes at midnight retard
  spammer  are you surprised
  it really shouldnt come as a surprise
  hes from hong kong
    wouldnt that be australia victoria or something
  no
  if hes not in indonesia then hes in the phillipines or some shit you absolute mong
  cant handle the banter
  australia doesnt exist  flatearther
  google utc9 and go from there
  wrong timezone
  really makes you think
  he wouldnt order from amazon with ems shipping if he was in japan think harder
  youre only now finding out japan is located in the southern part of asia
  he is still at it fire fag is the dumbest
  what time is it in australia    amazon  does that look like amazon newkid
  whats it like in adelaide mate lol
  gotta wonder howd he ever turn out so damaged to have such a meltdown about anyone hinting to the fact that hes from a south asian country close to japan
    australia is utc930 not 900 youre trying too hard
  wait how did you get signed
    you all seem so obsessed
  you just have to order 1 of the first 200 copies she speaks about it in all her showrooms even some will have handdrawn pics
  but the order was placed today she couldnt possibly have sold less than 200 copies so far
  poor nourishment while growing up
  brosif you do know they are preorders right as in you can pick from either getting 1 of the signed if you are lucky or different covers
  it has nothing to do with number of copies sold it has to do with selecting what book you want
  totally a sea after all
  you can pick being lucky now not making a strong case about your education system
  if you ordered from the nogi store you could get the signed hand drawn inserts limited snapshot or bonus cover
  dem sexual feet
  see    and please go back to sleep
  i dont get it
believing firefags compulsive lies    noobs
  so you didnt buy a signed copy you bought a random copy which may or may not be signed among the other bonuses theyve chosen
  but its not on sale on the webshop
  what do you mean    im not buyer anon
  this that fag is known for being a pathological liar
  bet youre not even in japan and australia at the same time either
  i mean you arent wrong im pretty fat but even my gut doesnt reach all the way from england to australia and japan
what happened to webmanon i havent seen him post here or in /akbg/ in weeks
nice ass
  kotoko is one of the hottest nogis they should exploit her with lewd gravure all 2019 before she is gone
  they should have started exploiting her with lewd gravure long ago
  probably that bitch nanase made a scene and demanded all the attention
  pisses me off
      i want to beat the shit out of you
10 more long hours until new nogis
  take your best shot
  shes so cute
what day is it  do they keep her locked up in a dungeon    
  one of shidas boyfriend clients      drugs not even once fellows
  you can tell that shes nervous as hell
  you can tell that shes druged as hell
  i got stunned by a jellyfish yes did it really happen yes ii got stunned    poor girl let her go already
  so noone told her what showroom was this entire time
techi is always trying to hide her face  tries to sit far away from the mcs in variety so she wont be noticed  doesnt talk much at all anymore  make her do showroom alone  deer in headlights girl couldnt even remember if she got stung  the introverted permacenter with social anxiety
    she is probably on some cult like that xjapan singer was
    hot
  yeah she have that vibe and disconection from reality proper of a sect/cult low rank member
  beauties
i wish our hori had fat tits too
  they are firm and small perfect no sag whatsoever
  management just dont know how to handle her and the group is suffering as a result
cant wait for keya 2nd gen to be officialy presented  those girls are so good that they already killed a couple of garbage fans 
  2nd gen is blessing us with their idols miracles since the beggining indeed
  i bet that if they replaced her as center shed slowly begin to heal i wouldnt be surprised if she wants to leave entirely but they tell her that they need her so she doesnt
  didnt she say that she wanted to get married at 18 or something
    this
  i hope history doesnt repeat itself with the 2nd gen getting ostracized and having to go and form their own group like hiragana
  i dont care if that happens they get their own shows and all that
  something like that its been a while
  good girls from the start
  honestly 6/10 body but you see my point is proved again manattan will sure love to see me without my shirt
  thats a 10/10 body asian girls dont want buff guys
  sea never ever bwc confirmed
  check every kpop thread you can find
  most girls prefer ottermode to flabby weightlifters
  holy crap that was fast
  what a cute dork
  the power of australian wotas
  i never thought id say this straya you aight
  rean
that techi showroom kinda opened my eyes that shes not edgy or stuck up that girl is just super isolated and ridiculously anxious
that techi showroom kinda opened my eyes that she is really edgy and stuck up but also that girl is just super drugged and ridiculously out of place as an idol
  it was an 8min stream
  it was an 8min lol fest
  thats how ive been feeling for a while i bet if someone barely lurched towards her shed flinch hard and fall on her ass shes afraid
  did you see her reaction to how many people were watching  someone save the poor girl
  just do like what they with nanase throw her off a giant ass building to make her realize talking on tv/interviews arent a big deal techi wasnt the only inverted/shy idol ikoma also had social anxiety problems
  this
  ikoma was never the target of a murder attempt though
  the weird part about techi and some other keyakis is that they seemed to develop anxiety about this shit where they did not have any previously   its normal to go into show business and adapt to talking openly but its another thing to start as outgoing and energetic and totally retreat into yourself
  ridiculously out of place as an idol  youre an edgy retard but that part is accurate
  is there a source for sakamichi photos of this quality
    then save this losslessly flipped image of them
techi is just acting she dont have any anxiety problems  shes just an emo tring to make drama and pretending to be depressed
  what are you smoking
  this is painful to watch        if it is an act then it is making the rest of them look bad
  would plant my seeds deep down her womb and take responsibility
  she was high thats all
   what if management have turned her into a heroin addict and if she doesnt follow their orders mgmt wont give her the daily dose she needs
  just the vibe i got from her jellyfish story hirate was high as fuck
as someone thats introverted its easy to forget basic shit when youre put in front of people and expected to hold a conversation the absolute worst feeling
  i sometimes forget to respond when people talk to me
  definitely this
meichan a cute a cute
  so gorgeous that she would outshine the managements center so they forced her to cut her hair
  same or you end up saying something really stupid or obvious and look like a moron which just makes it worse
  pretty much she looks like a real life princess with her hair long
  jesus christ thats got to be bad for morale      plausible
  doki doki
  anyone whos that deep into the autism spectrum shouldnt be auditioning to be an idol this looks more like a combination of apathy and being somewhat strung out not necessarily drugs could be sleep deprivation
  were all imagining the same thing when we see her mouth
  sleep deprivation is highly likely
  something really filthy
  sleep deprivation  sony ceo found a new nanami
its the burden of perma center
  are there any proper photo shoots of meimei where she shows this trademark goofy smile seems like she always has a more reserved expression in those
  this is the funniest thing about manatsuoshi guy hes working so hard and in the end its worse than if he was 70kg and skinnyfat but that is what happens when you only have a western viewpoint on what girls like
  lmao believing this
  yes which is why it is fake
  true except for over 15 years she was completely fucking normal if youre that aspergers or introverted you cant do that for that long you all are trying so hard to make excuses for her
techi looks like a crybaby trying to be emo and shit  i doubt she ever had any contact with drugs
trying all the retorics to avoid the most obvious hirate is a stoner reality check    kek
is techi such a big of star ive been monitoring this thread for hours and shes the most talked about girl itt
  we all love techi here so everyone loves to bring her up
  muh girl is pure
  ive been monitoring this thread  why  theres nothing here
  most of the posts are from him
  what does imaizumi smell like
    ガーデニア香水
  comfy
  hori likes terror movies so much that she hangs out with jurina
  its lossless horizontal flip man to the rescue  jpegtran flip horizontal flipjpg  flippedjpg
  an eternal classic stream
  now reflecting reality
  youre welcome  will this get me banned surely people dont want to be looking at false mirror images of their oshi
this thread need more nibu
  not again
  thanks you open my eyes
  rentan  the new gen 4 pedobait
rentan pb
hiraga must be the only idol group where all the fans are chill about new generations   its like management knows what is doing but not really
still mad about it
  im mad about yoda not being my gf
  be the man yoda would want you to be
      be mob psycho
  your best bet is to be reborn as a goat
  bbut being a subber entitles me ree sony should do what i want reee again
  or a tiny horse
  the haircut was a good call
  so feminine and beautiful    keya should get rid of all the dykes to be honest
  bring back that haircut
  so silky and perfect 3
i feel bad but sometimes i get bad thoughts about mei
  so gorgeous long haired women are the best
  stop
  perfect
  ill stop after this one this time i mean it    amazing
  cutest keya until her hair cut
  the hair cut made her a 1000x cuter you contrarian fuck
  pretty much  only an attention whore would deny this
  1010
mei is for eating cereal and watching cartoons with
aspie still at it
im already bored of nogidoko  tell me they do pranks and it gets better
  why did someone turn my webm into a gif
  adorable
that time when mei got all sweaty during the dance endurance challenge on keyabingo
  keyaki ktk
miyata isnt cute
yes neru eat that burger
  manamo and her giant bum have grown on me
  you
  
  how did miho get a pb before katoshi
  that was lewder than i expected
  now no longer a mirror image
    whats up with the unnecessary white padding is it supposed to be evocative of a polaroid
  why does everything have to have some deep meaning  its there cause she wants it to be there that not good enough
  this disrespect to the members and the crowd triggered me a lot  i dont know maybe she forgot how every member doing her best meanwhile she was in hiatus/movie
      wait what is she doing wrong here
  if you like techi she is doing nothing wrong and if you dont like her she is doing everything wrong
  she has the same actitud of all others members right there but lets blame on the poor techi    lets be honest all girls looks like zombies
  and keyacultists dont want new girls to show up and fix the place up
    wow i never knew she had long hair and was this sexy  she looks really bad with the short hair
  its not  
  you forgot some on the left and top there
  i wonder if she just buy a good brassiere
    imagine being this fucking awful at cropping
10min until new girls lads
  are we finally going to see the halfblack girl
  time for new thread
  imo we shouldnt until we are at page 10 and since we are so close to image limit why not just post 37 more images and then start a new thread
  agree
  no wait for the new girls
    these files were losslessly cropped they were cropped in a way that prevented the need to reencode them due to the specifications of the jpeg format the boundaries for lossless cropping can not be arbitrarily chosen
  groupmixing  cringe
  thats loads of stupid dance moves like the solo in futari saison fing her arms up to the point where moving them causes her lots of pain    or drugs  or anxiety  or shes being emo    but i doubt mgmt would risk a druggie on stage and anxiety would have more signs she may have cracked up under the pressure of always being center hence bandages to hide cuts i hope not at that point she should be put on permanent paid leave til her contract ends
  because he is an akbg preventing us from reaching image limit to keep his meme alive
finna
i hope all the new girls start smiling during a silent majority performance
new gens who
  still no  aaaaaaaaaahhhh
  most likely this
  thank you ikuchan
  saving the best for last
    i dont remember seeing these cuties is this the magic of the idol makeover
where are the new kanjis
  she looks like a different person i dont trust these pics
  some of them didnt show their face or even stream
crazy eyes
  they start showing up on the 3rd i think honestly i dont like this i wish theyd just reveal them all at once but management wants their hype i guess
ikuta has a good face for variety
  they are busy cleaning the fandom
  お疲れ様
  yakubo a cute
great we have 2 kubos now
  and they both look the same
  ranze the new keyakizaka member  imagine that
  they really are
  keep that ugly filipino outta my keyaki
  captain
  evidently not
  cant hold it anymore man
  he wrote all this without once stopping and thinking it was cringe and that he shouldnt put it out jesus
what day will she be revealed
im very interested in whoever that single new hiragana girl is gonna be
  its a halfblack girl
  is a loli under 14
  its gonna be shida
  this girl need a pb asap
new thread    
  kazumin being cute
  this girl has the breasts of a queen
this guy just entered gensokyo what will happen
  9 on his neck and in the post number  nice op
  hes actually a pretty fun harem mc and an actually cool dude he gets 2hu friends and trashy ecchi shenanigans ensues
  harem mc  no
who is this faggot
storks cicadas and seacats    wtc5 ciconia trailer      umineko saku trailer  
i want to sleep on erikas big boobs
  thats fucking cornelia on the left the letter said she was doing kung fu and combat training
  remember goy always vote for /our/ team in the battle festival    the shavit yalda are cute and cool ok they dont kill deserters and they never shot peace protesters in the back ok be a good goy and vote for them ok
shirley templechan is a kid what a loser
  i dont give a shit theyre fuckable
  nah theyll have different colour palettes and skin tones even the mc looks blue in that segment and we know that mc is red/brown
squad 601 were actually the makers of who killed captain alex wtc5 will be the sequel and the main mystery will revolve around the murder of captain alex
  i wouldnt discard alien races being involved in the story under the guise of human representatives the story seems to take place in the future so maybe there is an alien civilization taking part in the festival and its just common courtesy to wear human disguises to avoid freaking out racists
i predict that they will all gather up in a place and it will blow the fuck up at the end because there is a traitor among the nations each episode will be about how each of them got there
  reminder that shes the actual bernkastel and warcats is a red herring 
    tommy lee jones career really went in a weird direction after men in black
  even if i like these theories there is something off about this one i believe this is bait from bern but my theories about umineko and egyptian mythology would be too much far fetched to be actually be plausible i already posted them before by the way
  i dont think so    the crown and ra connexion is spoton but the bernkastel similarities are both too obvious and not decisive enough the girl has roughly the same dress than bern and some mechanical ears which are shared with grave moles right girl but if we look at the past history of berns and rikas incarnations we see that bern does not keep the dress or the ears what she keeps is the hairstyle and that girl has a completely opposed hairstyle    i think that shes less a bern incarnation and more about the fact that ryukishi love to reuse old designs    additionally her smile isnt bern enough its difficult to accurately gauge with a single picture but her body language is too open too forward not arrogant enough for being a bern/erika expy
  bern has a thing for straight hair doesnt she
where is higanbana 3 the michiru chapter in the second part fucked me up and i need some closure its probably the cruelest ending ryuukishi ever wrote
  so do i
just noticed another possible clue for the 601  lambda theory    look closely of all of them princess rethabile is the only character that is in front of the black band containing the text all the other characters are in the background with the text being in front of them but the princess is literally in front of the metatext
honestly ciconia feels less like wtc5 and more like rgd2
  i think both lambda and bern self inserts are brown skinned something about that cairo girl smug that seems off
so why was okonogi talking with bane at the start
  what bane
cravat is bern now suck my intersex genitalia you fucking cishets
  loli clown with gaaps hair  suspiciously flatchested girl with shannons head  resident evil 5 egyptian nigger    arabchinese immigrant  zel/hotaru 20  meijiu and rudolfs love child    seems like a bro  sassy alien cutie  rgd goon    promoted cornelia  bitch in sheeps clothing im calling it  bokukko    apparently edgy character who turns out to be really sweet  waifu  probably a really cool character strong shion vibes    badass moeblob  seems nice  a cooler battler with a touch of will    sketchy as fuck probably a red herring  has potential to be evatier complex  gender twist incoming    entry level waifu  protagonist girl male  literally alan from rgd
  mfw ill probably get attached to these hair colors and be disappointed when they are not real
    actually i see what you both mean and am willing to concede she might not be directly related to bernkastel i might liken her to bastet ras daughter and defender who was also once a sun goddess but is now the primary egyptian feline figure bastet as well represents secrets and protection and to see her represent her religion would also be satisfactory they could really be very devout ra worshippers or bastets new lunar affiliation could point to a subversion and this could really refer to thoth altogether though her ears are very distinct from grave mole girls this totally just consolidates that cairos group is racentric  though aside it could be deliberate were she a bernkastel avatar that she preserves and loses the opposite traits her predecessors do  and yeah im interested in your implausible egypt theory      baibao is in front of one too
  shes actually lambda and berns love child it certainly is a miracle that two lesbians can have a child
iim afraid to share my shitty theories because what if ryuukishi is secretly good at english and reading all of this to find good ideas    fuck i swear if the alien thing turns out to be real because of anons coment
  dawwww
  any immortal shapeshifter who has lived for millions or years and is bored of living has probably tried having a dick
imagine being so good at writing mystery fiction that your fans are making wild speculations about your next work with barely any information and half a year before it even releases
  if all the witches so far had dicks who would be the most merciless in bed
  do you want to figure it out or getting a symposium   if you want to figure out my picture in that post was already a good hint pic related is the second hint      its just predictive programming
  alternatively wh could act as proxies and report peoples theories to him
  ange didnt even consider losing her virginity or finding joy in exhibitionism before literally killing herself so its possible that lesbian witches just dont consider the possibility of trying dick no matter how bored they are
  didnt the alien waifu from the buzzlightyear cartoon look exactly like that
  maria because kids have little empathy towards others shell keep stroking your dick no matter how much you tell her to stop
  this is actually scary especially if the sjw/tumblr part of the fanbase grows too much because of umineko gold and gives him weird feedback pretending to be representative of the real western fanbase
  giggling as you beg her to stop before speeding up
  there cant be any sjws that take issue with this franchise right hell theres even a character that they should like immediately      im depressed not because were discussing loli pornography of my favorite vn but because i find it hot
  eva
i have an idea  grave moles background on the left is not just a reflection of the right part but the opposite side of their sign so the whole thing would spell герои юи  look closely at where the mole is looking towards
  seek help
  no shes not the metatext ends in the middle
  he supposedly read the japanese forums while writing higurashi and adjusted the next chapter accordingly    not really the plot twists those were all in hinamizawa bus stop including the parasytes and military stuff or the way the chessboard of hinamizawa functions only the structure of each arc same with umineko where he rewrote ep3 after realizing that ep2 had confused people too much    it must be really cool to design a huge maze of relationships like 1983 hinamizawa where fate is set up in such a way that some sort of tragedy is bound to happen and be able to create completely different stories just by slightly altering the initial moves of keiichi and a couple of other pieces everything else is a chain reaction that the author can easily follow without really thinking too much    this must be what writers mean by the story writes itself or the characters have a will of their own
  that explains why ep3 had a distinct feel to it when i was first reading umineko
  eva sounds good but i get the feeling shes into horrendously painful bdsm
  its okay anon give up on your humanity and enjoy the ride
  yeah the story is pretty known he wanted to create an episode ever more difficult than episode 2 and to introduce a proto maleerika furudo in an antagonistic way bare that we know almost nothing of this proto game    but then he saw that episode 2 lost literally everyone so he rewrote the story completely introducing virgillia to help the reader and reworking erika furudo into the gal we know and love today
  i think ryukishi would give more weight to wh compared to the rest of the fanbase after checking klash twitter i dont see any sjw tendency at all looks pretty neutral weeb if you ask me
  virgilias a godsend im a brainlet so i need to be helped along some  plus shes attractive too which is always nice
erica and bern support different teams the japanese erica is literally erica bern is somewhere else
  now that is a miracle
  a lesser known story is how dai played the question arcs of higurashi and emailed ryuukishi telling him that the story was fantastic but the music was garbage he responded with a well let me see what you can do expecting him to never reply but dai sent him a few samples of his music and offered to work on higurashi kai    i like the question arcs music though some of it is pretty mediocre but other tracks just scream higurashi to me and id never replace it with anything else
  the human condition of ushiromiya maria
  do you have the source for this im really curious about the details
  how old is virgilia even supposed to look is she 60 or 30 shes like donald duck or something i cant tell if shes meant to be young middle aged or old
  she dead son
  3040 acting as if she was 17 years old thats why they used inoues joke with her in ougon musou kyoku
  oh i know seshat is akin to featherine and we must have followed a similar train of thought because your seshat is close to my thoth though thoth has commanded an almost matchless magical magnitude his influence on magic is so much that i would actually prefer if it was him to ra     ryukishi must have read about john dee as well beatrices towers refer to the four watch towers of the enochian apocalypse for example many wiccans think that originated with them but its enochian madimi who taught john dee enochians through scrying reminds me of yhvhs cosmogonic linguistic method through gematria which realizes the tetragrammaton   yhvh123410 for the ten sephira his name was rewritten as a pyramid and turned into the 72fold name shem hamephorash this is why 72 is a holy number in gematria 72 equals 10 and through this name you can come up with an angel name of god and aspect of god for every day in the year through these legion aspects pervading the sephirotic and qliphotic veins you have the entirety of creation and emptiness all wrought by linguistic coding its really amazing this is part of why creator witches are authors and not just the blatantly literary metaphor  what i mean is that i can see him expounding on the magics he once glided over since egypt has had unparalleled magic influence in important branches he touched but never utilized hermeticism is the main one here kabbalah too but he was short about it with the magical circles  its the core of magic and we have virgilia responsible for its exegesis to the reasonable laity like for 
  not only are your posts informative in content but theyre also informative in terms of grammar i learnt like three new words today
  why are anges feet like that is that how she walks is she four years old
  awkward that someone else reached my schizoid reasoning to reach seshat with featherine also jonh dee used delta to represent himself as well  do you have any discord contact its because you are into occult and i got interested to discuss those matters with you
no zts   that man was literally responsible for all the best umineko music   maybe hes one of the and more composers but that feels like wishful thinking
also remember that the lesser key of solomon which ryukishi had to read to know of demons and their invocation like gaap furfur and ronove number 72 as does yhvhs ultimate 72fold name its because the sephirotic and qliphotic ultimately coalesce like how the graceful and good lakshmi is accompanied by the sinister and samsaric owl it too is a thing of brahmanic creation vaishnavi preservation and shaivist destruction only noumenally corrupt the abstract is a step below the godly and above the phenomenal which is why heavenly lightning travels through daath to become will and then tiferet to become representation      well yeah most people dont properly utilize their vocabulary most people have a very limited active memory of their own lexicon at any given time but if you think a moment youll see you have a wide enough spread to write very varied texts this is why part of improving at writing is a more varied and extensive active lexicon      lambdadelta1023 i really dont care who adds me so feel totally free
imagine finally becoming a witch but all you do is summon furniture to be your friend because youve been lonely depressed and sexually frustrated your entire life
  but that depends on your audience doesnt it if you dont want to alienate possibly younger readers like say if youre writing a light novel you cant use complex terminology
  sounds great because ive already got all those checked off besides the witch part
  im talking about literature where the language is used as art and youre not writing for an audience and of course the light novel author will also vye for lexical expertise there is never a time where you would rather have a lower than higher skill capacity and mastering the highest methods of facture in any art will strengthen your expression of simple things too
  well thats fair some of it seems unnecessary though some tacts certainly needed else you risk sounding pompous
did anyone here read hinamizawa bus stop the translation is machine garbage but its 60 comprehensible    there is no music if i remember correctly everything is narrated like a play script scene transitions and sfx included and there is an insane subplot about notakasaka shitting himself at school being bullied for it and growing up to have a deep hatred of society or some shit    its honestly pretty damn good all the twists and plot points from the 8 arcs of higurashi are there just very condensed in a relatively short story and bizarrely exaggerated in an awesome way especially everything regarding this early version of the hinamizawa syndrome the way it works is incredibly creepy and fucked up the whole thing seems to operate on nightmare logic    i recommend checking it out there are some nice twists and its cool to imagine how the actual series couldve been    im not too fond of the remake/manga designs for rika and mion though i always imagined rika as a slightly taller version of the regular one and mion as a 12 year old brat of the same height i love the empty smoke silhouettes of the original as they allow you to imagine notooishi creepytake notakasaka and all the other characters as bizarro versions of the classic characters without forcing a specific design on you or being wildly different from the character they are based on
  id say the most of question arcs music is even better than the answer arcs there were too many sappy piano pieces in the answer arcs dai didnt get good until umineko
  all the others composers were able to produce great tracks previously so the soundtrack will probably be great even without him
if umineko or higurashi were turned into a live action tv series would you still watch it
  didnt a live action move already happen for higurashi
  if you can back a pompous attitude with masterful effervescent artistry then you ought to show off youre the best in the world modesty is a sham if youre any good this is why i get people to read nabokov
  all pride is justified if you can back it up but at the same time we mustnt forget the virtues of modesty even ryukishi holds back or at least witch hunt made it seem that way
  only if the actors are the same age as the characters this time around      there are like 4 or 5 of them including the porn version of onikakushi dont get your hopes hight they chose the ugliest people in the world
  if what youre talking about is true and isnt a joke i find it hilarious that ryukishi authorized official porn of his work
  i dont think its official its the same jav company that produced clonnad porn version of clannad and the haruhi porn live actions all with super ugly girls and 40 year old ugly train gropers
these threads are going to turn into /pol/ soon arent they
  itll all be in good fun i hope especially if it takes place in the far far future the theory about cairo being fucked up seems to support this if the robotic implants didnt already    i dont remember incels getting into arguments with the george haters
  it already is
  well in the end we dont know if he minds he sneaks dirty stuff into his work at least twice per episode maybe hes just a reserved pervert
  he used to draw loli fetish porn in his art style cunny before satokos cunny believe it or not thats where renas design came from among other things    hes certainly not a puritan cuck as evidenced by his elevated intellect and heartfelt writing style
  daily reminder that androgynous faggot lion is a fantasy character because sayo dislikes the idea of being a normal fucking dude in a miracle world
  i cannot possibly imagine viciously masturbating to images drawn by ryukishi but someone on the internet probably did it anyway
  why are you describing me
  because i was actually describing myself anon 
  not being an androgynous faggot with a body and face like that    what are you gay
  specifically i was rereading umineko and when 410 showed up in ep3 and said she could play online games i thought wouldnt it be great to be a witch just so i could make my furniture be my best buds for all eternity
  i sure hope the actual /pol/ wont pay attention to ciconia everything they touch turns into shit
  it was funny watching /v/s reaction to the umineko kickstarter saying it was going to taint the game with western sjw stuff or whatever its funny considering how umineko already has gender identity issues single motherhood and whatever lion and will are
  lion and will are  hot
  they are kind of lewd because they are the closest thing we have to official buttnaked sprites of the main higurashi cast including ahegaos blushing and literal cunny    the anime had renas bare ass on full display in the middle of the screen which is hella lewd but my mental image of the characters is simply the original sprites as they are the originals and i spent more time reading the vn than watching the anime    i wonder why a simple nip slip in an official manga is lewder than a straight up hentai doujin imitating the original art style is it because its lewd  plot or because its the original story or because the nonexistent character has been humiliated by the fact that people read the original manga while the doujin is optional and that humiliation is lewd i dont know
  id hate the thought of them being fake i basically had furniture all my life and still have   id choose to be a witch just to send a message to someone just like yasu did   umineko actually influenced me very much i write fiction and the metaphors about the author hiding himself and becoming a supernatural entity make my imagination hard
  i think its because the fact its official porn makes you see it in a new light if its just nsfw fanart then you can just dismiss it as fanart but if the creator made porn of their own characters then its completely unavoidable or/and nonrefutable
  i was trying to search for said porn and saw that ryukishi drew fanart of tsukihime good taste i wonder if he likes fate/stay night too
  i avoid reading threads or opinions about things i love outside very specific circles i get kind of triggered by the idea of animeonly secondaries not knowing what they fuck they are talking about recommending shitty anime adaptations to each other and generally having a meh opinion about something i really really love because they fucking watched some distillation of it and judge it based on that    certain things are safe from that and there is no way to experience them wrong so every person who has an opinion about it has actually experienced it properly ace attorney for example but not anymore because now there is the awful anime and the 3ds remaster that makes the art look like shit    call me crazy but i hate the idea of someone experiencing a piece of media i absolutely love but missing half of the good stuff because they got a gimped censored or poorly adapted version instead of the original its like recommending someone your favorite book only for them to quickly skim through it while playing some shitty mobile game read an explanation of the plot on wikipedia and say yeah it was good i wanted you to love it you fuck i wanted to discuss the damn book and gush about how good it is why did you have to ruin it for yourself
  this is why i like fate even if you watch only the anime adaptations youll eventually have to read/play more because youll always get that nagging feeling that you dont get the big picture in the back of your mind
  guys stop we already know exactly what kind of people will soon start bitching about ciconia here  lets enjoy the quiet while it lasts
so the umineko saku girl that looks like bern is probably flauros but with water
ive been thinking guys and i think magic is real just not in the way you might think it is  so okay think about this for a sec so magic can be defined as doing something we dont believe to be possible right so why cant science be magic way back when we said that conveniently reheating food using invisible rays was impossible we said that communicating with someone else at extreme speeds was impossible to these people microwaves and the internet must seem like magic right  but it doesnt stop there we firmly believe that defying gravity isnt possible we firmly believe that bringing the dead back to life isnt possible but thats just because we think that these things arent possible because our knowledge of the world is limited thus in many years from now our knowledge will have advanced and we will be able to bring the dead back to life science would have become indistinguishable from magic  humanitys worst enemy defeated  we just believe that the mundane isnt magic because were used to it simply because we understand the internal mechanics of what makes it possible it is no longer interesting but a witch that waves her staff around and unlocks a door is fully aware of what shes doing  to her that is the mundane to an animal or to an uneducated person we must look like witches and we all are  by manipulating what we know and by creating constructs furniture that allows us to do what previously thought impossible we have all become witches and everyone merely dismisses it as the usual  rainbowriding unicorns may not be currently real but if you think like this then magic is real and you are using it right now
  any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
  who are the bern/rika and miyo/lambda of ciconia
  according to current theories they are guardians of warcat and 601 squad
  thats true but then you can say but magic is built on contradictions   but thats not true because these contradictions are defined by us and what we know scientists are prepared to have their current system for the universe be crushed at any second  a person cant just begin flying all of a sudden under our current model and with our current technology
  erika is hairy and unshaven
  of course that falls apart if you just say well then where did the witches get that technology from as if theyre merely human they cant do it by themselves but my point is that human technology is magical not that a witchs magic is scientific in some way it could be but its not like lambdas come forward and started spouting incomprehensible physics math at us all of a sudden
  i really dig anges color scheme
  there is currently a huge argument in the akujikishima discord over the word cunt one of the new mods the one with a rabbit avatar in the hinamizawa server is a sjw and people are actually humoring her lmao    if any of you is in there please call her a fucking cunt piece of shit im done arguing with her that place isnt worth visiting with people like that around
  
  words are powerful because we give power to them   any bad word loses its power if it is allowed to be used if you fight against a curse you are merely allowing it to become even more powerful
  its just a muted primary triad  a couple browns
  those people are delusional dont bother arguing with them like a civilized person its useless their selfrighteousness is some next level shit
nigga why the fuck are you trying to prove that witches arent real if they are real then you could do some wicked new fetishes with them
  hahahahahaha how the fuck are logic battles even real hahahahahaha nigga just promise sexual favors to your opponent hahahahaha like just start sucking their dick haha
  hot
tracks that you forgot are great  
  if witches have all sorts of titles then there must be a witch of lust somewhere  i mean lust can be nonsexual but at the same time itd be a lost opportunity for her to not touch upon that sin riiiiiight  all hentai universes are chessboards except the objective is to one up one another in hotness the ultimate kind of battle the first one to get aroused loses
  one must remember that the western christian slave morality is only western and absolutely incomprehensible to the ones who didnt grow up with it ryukishi will never be able to internalize the tenants of the christian slave morality that is called social activism or whatever nowadays and thus will never be truly corrupted by it    japs in general see that slave morality as a curiosity weird and bizarre at best a cool flavour for set pieces luckily there is a culture barrier there      thats more of a problem one must always be vigilant when the western untermenschen become excited thats when you get real witch hunts and people doing really stupid things pay attention and stay vigilant
kinzo wa shiboshiteiru  krauss wa shiboshiteiru  natsuhi wa shiboshiteiru  hideyoshi wa shiboshiteiru  george wa shiboshiteiru  rudolf wa shiboshiteiru  kyrie wa shiboshiteiru  rosa wa shiboshiteiru  maria wa shiboshiteiru  genji wa shiboshiteiru  shannon wa shiboshiteiru  kanon wa shiboshiteiru  gohda wa shiboshiteiru  kumasawa wa shiboshiteiru  nanjo wa shiboshiteiru
  blue pubes
  what do you prefer  blue pubes or red pubes vote now on your phones
  the good part is that you have to be really fucking stupid to be a western puritan sjw cunt especially as a male so theyll never be able to learn japanese no matter how hard they try it would take their mediocre brains literal decades to get somewhat decent at it which isnt likely because they spend all day complaining on the internet about stupid shit and banning certain ideas from their own minds
  being a puritan sjw on an individual level cant lead to you changing anything  if you had a position of power perhaps you could but outside of insignificant things like discord servers most puritan sjws spend too much time worrying about insignificant things to properly assume a position of leadership
  explain numale puritan translators and localizers they do exist
  so who will be the bad guy this time i think theyll both either be neutral or team up against the real bad guy
  it might be a new witch or something beyond a witch aliens which can appear to be witches using science    people in a group can have all sorts of skills but the thing is that you as another human have the ability to call them out if they are objectively wrong
  too mellow
  youre retarded
  cope
      thanks for ruining the thread
  man just one thread ago i congratulated everyone for not insulting each other wheres the sportsmanship guys
  people with moderately high iq tend to fall into the sjw trap for some god forsaken reason even males i have no fucking idea why    actual geniuses see that bullshit coming from a mile away and stay true to their valuesthose are practically impossible to brainwash the problem is that they tend to spend all day masturbating to increasingly degenerate shit instead of studying medicine and curing cancer
  man im so sorry
  thats not true there are many geniuses in the field right now as there are those that are unrealized and even those who havent done anything might do so in the future especially if theyre young  its just that things like curing cancer while perhaps not necessarily completely impossible could take a very very long time to realize a genius cannot simply will a solution into existence in fact many of our current technologies are the result of accidents or someone looking into something that seemed suspicious  theres research undergoing into subjects like fighting cancer efficiently and were making headway it just cant come instantly no matter how many brains we put into it that is our limitation as humans
  the last part was a joke but yeah you are completely right    one has to wonder if its even possible to find a solution though maybe its physically impossible to find a cure because it just doesnt exist so its all a waste of time
  its fine anon warming up for real /pol/ on ciconia
  right now i cant say for sure whether or not it is possible but id like to not lose hope itd be certainly neat if we stumbled upon a solution there are already certain cancer types that are very survivable with our current treatment methods
  explain numale puritans period whether they are intelligent or stupid i just cant understand how a young man can truly and honestly be against degeneracy mindbreak loli doujins leaked sextapes of cute celebrities or legit bullying  stripping  humiliation videos on liveleak shit like that    i mean is it really that hard to enjoy degenerate shit like a normal fucking human while also having empathy and feeling bad for the people that had the bad shit happen to them honestly it just feels like society as a whole is just a bunch of cold unfeeling hypocritical zombies
  leaked sextapes of cute celebrities or legit bullying  stripping  humiliation videos on liveleak  eh that i can understand its perfectly fine to be against that although at some point you should also understand that you can only go so far in convincing somebody to agree with your views  degeneracy and loli doujins though are kind of pointless fighting against no ones really being harmed by these
    later on the composer dai sent them an email saying that the game was great but that its soundtrack was full of noise ryukishi replied back saying well lets see the soundtrack youd make he thought hed flippantly blown off dai and that would be the end of the conversation however dai ended up responding with some actual tracks he showed them to the other members of 07th expansion to get their opinion and they said we need this guys music in our games and the rest was history
    ive also seen idiots and decent people fall into the trap of only seeing two extremes and vilify anyone they see that shows even the smallest sign of being the side theyre against as being an enemy theres no middle ground to these types just like the rabid sjw they hate theres also the rabid antisjw that drags their shit into things and discard away any sense of reason because they believe theyre doing the right thing and that any one else wrong and a threat theyre both fucking obnoxious    like right now this is getting too offtopic
  nice thanks
  i understand being against it in public or not wanting it to happen ever again deep down but actually forbidding yourself from enjoying it in private sex is sex the more degenerate the better    i dont know man it just seems weird and creepy as fuck to me do people genuinely think like that in the privacy of their own minds
  nigga there is a world of difference between getting off to the fantasy of degeneracy and masturbating to isis execution videos
  
  when you demonize an entire group of normal people for liking what you dont like or not being brainwashed cucks things like loli probably seem harmful in a twisted way after all we dont want literal demons to be happy we want to fuck them over so lets take away the one thing they can legally consume and enjoy    its a disgusting mentality really imagine how many innocent teenagers are considering killing themselves because society calls them monsters and shit
    this go to /pol
  i agree
07th ex/pol/sion
  at least now every time theres a shitpost well know exactly whos behind it
  do humiliation shitposts count
  do people genuinely think like that in the privacy of their own minds  considering how popular pornography is i doubt it
its now december what the hell is going on with umineko gold the project was revealed last month and the last real update was made over 2 weeks ago has anyone else been losing excitement and interest due to the delays
  i was never excited for the shitty dub to begin with
  this its a waste of time
  its actually pretty good
  are my only two options morally enslave everybody or jerk off to peoples suffering because thats some shin megami tensei route split bullshit
i really hope zts does compose for wtc5 his music made scenes in umineko so intense
  theyve seem to have lost their biggest opportunity yet
  isnt the dub curated by ryukishi i cant imagine itd be that awful  at the very least thats what i read about it could be false
entergram is rereleasing the ps3 games for maybe the ps4 and nintendo switch if anything the umineko gold team should have aimed to provide a translation for this rerelease  im pretty sure that the nintendo switch version would be moddable and someone would provide an english patch
  ryuukishi07 isnt interested in the english market since its almost non existent why do you think hes giving witch hunt the rights to translate his newest title for free
  then he shouldnt care about westerns providing a complete translation free of cost for the entergram release either
  is this an edit or did i manage to miss the most hilarious dialogue in this series
in the lion kakera lion could also be shot with a blank managing to escape somehow
  what kind of berun is that
  agree given the setting of battling each other it would make no sense to leave zts out
umineko progressed my obsession with the paranormal its pretty funny how that turned out
it seems like this thing was finally translated
  im gonna translate your thing
  source
come into my car maebarasan its got ac
  we /4channel/ now    in celebration have a sfw image of an egyptian cat
  her name is kongou or something like that meaning diamond    she is supposedly based on an oc rozen maiden character that ryuukishi created for a contest
  wait why was that post deleted
  thats the kind that turns into a dragon
  its the kind is your gf
what happened to umineko golden edition
  its on hold indefinitely due to a health emergency  there hasnt been activity on its twitter account or the one in charge of it for over a week
  not en edit check that scene in ep8 its right before ange opens evas diary
  they didnt even bother rt ciconia and saku talk about complete inactivity
  how deranged is battler that he lusts for his own aunts
  this one too lmao what was the problem with it the world niggers used in a casual context it was a post talking and theorizing about wtc5    
  deranged  the aunts are semen demons
  but kyrie is the biggest semen demon of them all and battler cant fuck his own stepmom
  stepmom
  is this it was umineko just a weird incest vn all along was i played
  stepmom  you didnt read episode 8
  look at this detective she really loves that box doesnt she
  anon did you not read ep7 at all
  i did but it was more like i was thinking about battler having incestuous relationships with every single female in his family
    what in the world is an episode 8 i thought there were only 9 episodes
  hmm well lets see  tried to cope a feel on jessica  got maria to make a promise for him to eat her in the future  admitted to being charmed by rosa   yeah his track record isnt too good
anons i told all my friends i read every single episode of umineko no naku koro ni so i could impress them but in actuality i only read 4 of them should i be ashamed of myself
  what in the world is an episode 8  i thought there were only 9 episodes
  you thought there were 9 episodes but didnt know about the existence of episode 8what
  who on this earth would you impress by saying that
  yes
  wait but if kyrie is his real mom then doesnt that mean its even more wrong or does it just loop right back to being perfectly acceptable again if he thinks shes his stepmom before ep4
  you mean you just watched the anime
  people who are really into smug faces
  nah i actually read the vn proper  or rather that makes it sound like i did and then abandoned it its just that i read eps 14 and then took a break after because i bingeread all of it and felt exhausted  im about to start ep5 now but i dont care if you spoil me
  kyrie is the one mom he doesnt ask lustful favours in  even though battler never knew she was his real mom
  nani the fuck
  dont for got its all yasu projecting like a pathetic human
  battler doesnt want sloppy seconds of his fathers
  why is eva so willing to get battlers cock
  but he wants sloppy seconds of his uncles
  theyre not manwhores like rudolf
  the irony is that battler doesnt want to be like rudolf yet he is probably the most like his parent compared to the rest of the cousins and their parents
  he doesnt want to be like rudolf in the sense that he doesnt want to be someone who cheats on his wife
  why not be like rudolf he kicks ass when hes not busy being an ass
  shes just being a good aunt
  why not be like rudolf  you mean that murderer
  what you wouldnt kill someone for money what are you a pussy
  you mean what he does with beatrice and erika
  the what now
  i thought battler and ange was a good doujin pairing but why aint no artist exploring this one
  beacuse rosa x battler is a better pairing from aunts
  for the lolicons and aunt lovers alike you can also have rosa x battler x maria
anyone have any christmas wallpapers
  battler comforts rosa with dick and the black witch is forever gone from marias life  i ship it
    believing in the mangas lies
  why does kanon have boobs
  it is weird how the manga treats the trick ending as canon and not the magic one
  because  eva has no doujins
  the aunts really get the short end of the stick even though theyre so attractive and yet ange keeps getting dicked by battler over and over again why must you do me dirty like this fanbase
  trick ending as canon  did you just read up about it on tvtropes or something the magic ending is canon to it too trick ending is just shown as another possibility that could have happened
  meta battler is married to his uncle
  i cant believe my otp is so progressive
  uh what
  because the aunts are like 50 and thats 120 years old in anime years
  are you really sure i spoiled myself on rgd and now im regretting it with bitter tears
  rosa is 35
  i came here running for more information when a friend told me a new when they cry game had a trailer posted these threads are just so fun that i cant stop reading them
what if george hadnt given up like a fucking pussy in ep1 and decided to deny the witch instead    would he eventually solve the mystery become game master and cuck battler for all eternity would he create tales where the mystery doesnt mean shit because his piece and the female cousins get accidentally stuck in a room and fuck each other like in his favorite doujins
  well if you want to catch up really fast you can just read the manga for the other 4 episodesseparated into 4 mangas it follows the vn pretty closely and does it even better
  what if george was likable at all and not the most morbidly obese creature ever written in fiction
  hey theres some girls that are into that
  but the manga doesnt come with bgms you cant have umineko without miragecoordinator
  i dont know whats so fun about half the posts in each thread getting deleted for bullshit reasons including actual umineko discussion if you really want to read peoples opinions and save all the best images read the threads from warosu    i still recommend you to finish umineko before binge reading all the past threads you can do it at any time there wont be any new info about wtc5 until the day of release which is six months from now its really not worth getting spoiled
  well you can watch goldsmiths videos for certain scenes though he has a complete set of ep8  
  not op but i was in the last thread and there were no deletes as far as i know
  ill finish the vn first and then read the manga later thanks for being patient guys
i want to coordinate marias mirages
this caught me off guard
  hot as fuck thanks
  i think its way too goofy and reminiscent of deens incorrect portrayal of higurashis insanity and nightmarish persecution complex it kind of ruins the intended effect of the original scene
  you say that like its not a positive
  this i usually dont like alchemist cg but i think higurashi take the cakes shions cg made her look like a clown instead of being deranged
  i dont remember this but its been a while  can you post the cg
  disagree at least for that particular scene even in the original version all the time i kept waiting for r07 to draw a new expression for maria for that scene because rosas words were so inhuman and she just kept going and going maria really does lose it
speaking of higurashi i dont understand why people give it shit for the hinamizawa syndrome i think its explained pretty well in the vn and doesnt really feel like a cop out its a really cool concept and explains why the characters are unable to trust anyone no matter how hard they try once the persecution complex kicks in    people say its too ridiculous of an answer but i really dont see a problem with it i love the idea of microscopic parasites physically fucking with your brain when they become agitated bus stop made it even cooler because they are fucking ant things crawling around on your brain that can be seen with the naked eye
new project that i want to start but will never get off my lazy ass to do edit all the pachinko and alchemist sprites to be more faithful to the originals especially the expressions  remake the shitty cgs to not be shitty
  good taste
  it looks nice but i prefer the original black screen because id rather imagine it myself nothing can do justice to what your imagination can conjure especially not this flat anime style
  this one
  i dont see what youre seeing but maybe its just me i actually reread this scene a lot because it gets me pumped    she just looks enraged having been pepper sprayed and attacked it doesnt look overthetop or ridiculous it fits the mood and circumstance just fine
  i wish the mangaka who worked on rgd vn would agree to help ryu for higurashi sprites
  this cg is really fucking bad alchemists sprites and cgs can be great sometimes but i think they are more often than not either soulless or straight up garbage i wish i had the talent and time to redo all of the sprites backgrounds and cgs
  oh okay this one is ridiculous even more so than marias
  i think its just because people find that ryukishis art has a certain charm and alchemists sprites are very generic animelike  but i do like some of alchemists stuff though marias cgs and this  absolutely not its waaaaaaaay over the top but even so theres something to be had in the normal character portraits
  is rika constipated
  no amount of charm can make me take ham hands seriously
  she does have something hard in her rectum but its not what you think
  honestly i think the ciconia artworks pretty good even if i dont like the second member in shavit yaldas art
  please do not abuse rika shes our pure maidenthanks
  i actually found the popcorn hands to make the transition from sliceoflife to thriller have more of an impact  just that the sprites look so childish and cute it really makes that transition all the more jarring in a positive way and really adds to just how much the derangement changes them
  you are not supposed to be looking at the character like its a manga you just glance at them to get a load of their unique charm that is missing in other sprites and read the narration to know what they are actually doing with their bodies the hands shouldnt be a problem    or do you expect the sprites to get half sucked by the bottom of the screen when they text says they bowed thats silly
  shes not that cute but i dont think its because of the art its the kind of smug that makes her seem like a huge bitch as  said she reminds me of that smug girl from the fourth stage of th13
  just glancing at the sprites is enough for ham hands to cover your entire vision if youre not careful they might just pop out of the screen and choke you goddamn
why ange is so retarded
  its probably because she makes me think shes like that overbearing aunt that pretends she really likes you but in reality shes selfish and envious of your parents    ttake it back
alchemist cgs are hit or miss i think theyre best at subtle stuff like pic related
  i find the blurry backgrounds and deformed character art really unique and comfy it really helps with immersion because its such a weird aesthetic that your minds simply accepts that bizarrelooking world as it is    i also love the contrast between the cartoony aesthetics and realistic photo backgrounds its weird that something like that feels so right while the combination of anime characters and anime backgrounds feels kind of wrong and awkward the original look feels like an abstraction of whats really going on while the console one forces your brain to accept what you see literally rather than abstractly the animelooking characters really belong to that animelooking world which makes it obvious that the perspectives are super awkward
  i understand that notion and artists do tend to do that often but good lord those fucking hands man theyre not cute theyremutated its just distracting more than anything its like ill be reading about rena setting up her classmates hostage and then those fucking things appear and take me out of it one must wonder if shes going to assimilate the childrens flesh through her arms
  okay but think of it like this    imagine what a handjob from rena would feel like    imagine being slapped by those hands    i want her to fist me
manga has the best art
  why does natsuhi force jessica to dress like a proper lady but allows this absolute faggotry
    i do like the blurry photoshopped backgrounds of the original better but even r07 seems to have thrown away the whole ham hands thing ciconia characters have a lot more sanelooking hands even if its still cartoony
bern laughs like a grandma
  rudolfs daughter
  its not that he threw it away its that his drawing ability has actually improved
  the original ham hands seemed to be an artistic choice because its not that hard to draw them a bit smaller or give them the correct number of fingers but on the other hand characters like rika and battler keep them hidden at all times as if they are ashamed of them
  not this one
  battlers face  its like im reading shoujo
  i guess they never miss huh
  hes got big hands as well
  i like how the mangas are drawn by different artists each episode but it felt a bit weird to read tatarigoroshi in such a bubbly round art style
  when they cry 2077 music predictions go          cairo themes      other styles        
  too many silly faces
  it has its moments
  meant to reply to 
  what in gods name is that she looks like a monkey
  fucking hell now this is something
  its a trade you get overall great graphics with occasional silly looking stuff
  post teppeis troll face the orphanage guys trollface and takanos joker face
  where is one even supposed to download the full mangas in english or preferably japanese    all i find are sites where you can read it online and save each page one by one except they are all either resized useless for archiving and preserving the manga or straight up fucked with a watermark like that picture you posted
  did you know that the witchwoman jenka had a brother
  full manga for umi and higu  fuzevea7bjk9gowifwzxrb5draeztna
  thanks    is that supposed to be google drive mega or what
  mega
  faces are like are still super rare shion had none when she killed saroko for example you can probably count them in one hand
  that looks fucking dope
  after she loses it pretty much every chapter has silly faces
i saved this pic in like 2008
  me on the left
  why did her eyes turn into solar eclipses
  i just renamed the folders for higurashi arcs in reading order so just refresh the link and itll be fixed or you can go here to label them yourself 
  the moon steps in front of your ego you inner world overcomes your outer world basically your emotional is taking the wheel on your actions and you cant control it or apply free will    do you even astrology m8
  fanart by kei natsumi i guess its semiofficial being done by an official mangaka
  shut up you dumb cat
  do not bully the cat
  its weird that renas bare ass is more official than that piece of fanart
  to aru index gave me a fascination for evil anime girls getting punched in the face and im glad they drew this scene
  2deep
  good meme
    whatever
  theres also the topless eva pic thats similarly semiofficial
  thats nothing like what got posted previously its not particularly silly
  yeah id label it excessive but not ridiculous
  one being sillier than the other doesnt mean they arent both silly
  pick your favorite
  somehow didnt make the list but this one tied with youre a mere piece
  i always wonder why this happens like if an artist draws a nicelooking human but messes up somewhere it looks hilarious and ridiculous but if an artist makes it look all wrong like zun or ryukishi it looks charming and cute is this one of them uncanny valley things all the kids talk about nowadays
  is he getting fucked in the ass here
  nice shadow to overcome there bern its what i am always talking about a mere voyager will be stuck like that until she takes that step she is trying to avoid so much
  youre a mere piece and that one are pretty good to me though theyre a bit overthetop
  but if an artist makes it look all wrong like zun or ryukishi it looks charming and cute  thats called a cartoon    also ryukishis hands are the true horror aspect of higurashi
  im hyped for the battle nuns
  i wouldnt say zun or ryukishis artwork is meant to be like a cartoon  at least not zuns zuns is just barely barely not completely anatomical its clear that he wanted to try but hes not experienced enough in art and it became his style over time
  if mental retardation could be visualized that image would be it
hello
genuine question is beatrice trans im new
  how about you read the fucking vn
  prime beatrice is a eunuch   meta beatrice is a female
  nobody in this thing is trans
  i remember some tranny going by the name bernkastel
while showing an embarassed face shannon offered me the cake with a fork
  el gordono george
      but is his dick big
  is it
by misfortune accident or a sheer incompetence of ones self i stopped reading umineko right at the end of 8th episode 2nd half that wh broke into 2 releases and now thinking about rereading whole thing again hover there are now several different options default wh translation improved afaik mangagamer one and some other uminekoproject which one should i go with if there are any others i was planning just to get a steam one if i would notice any differences also how is voice acting should i give it a try
      stop bully george please
  steam translation is the best one go with it
  mangagamers release patched with the 07th modding is a good option though it lacks italic text or the umineko project which has an inferior script imo and is incomplete however it has a lot of cool features the engine is overall superior
  i always pictured george as being somewhat stout but not fullon fat none of the official art portrays him as being overweight like his father or nanjo the comments made by eva and shannon which people use to push his fat image seem to be pointing more towards him being slightly out of shape if anything i think episode 4 of the manga does a good job with his portrayal making him more stocky without being obese nor a slim bishonen
  george apologists on my board its more likely than you think but yeah i agree its just a joke in the end anyway
  improved afaik mangagamer  thats basically witch hunt revisiting the game and correcting their translation  mg editors making it a bit less rough  wh was still pretty much in control of the translation for the steam release
  shlomo yaldadidaaaaaaa
im rereading umineko and man rosa is such a fascinating character i dont know whether to masturbate violently to her or print a picture of her and tear it into a million little pieces or tear her up and then masturbate violently to the pieces or masturbate first and then tear her up so many choices so little time
  you know what you must do anon
  i need more lewd rosa edits
  sadly i dont have much but here are a few old aunt edits  
  i didnt know erika lusted over battlers aunts
  who doesnt
  who wouldnt 
    the real question is  who would she do first
  once i melt all my familys jewelry im sure ill have an ingot of gold    so ill just offer that up to her    ill also act like someone who would be a good father for maria so she would be even more attracted to me ill marry her give her the fuck she needs and raise maria right
  maybe natsuhi as her spoil of war
  if shes in an s mood natsuhi  though i could see her joining in with eva to both mess with her kyrie would probably make her feel competitive since shes also got a detective sort of vibe as for rosa it depends on if shes pissed or not
  so hes supposed to look like tomitake isnt he
    a few more  
  pretty much at least in stature sort of like jessica and mion or eva and takano
  now thats hot
  today in rokkenjima all the married women of the ushiromiya family get fucked in front of their husbands and children
fucking french communitys annoying as hell seems like they became duncantricers talking about their louis xiv being the new umineko character
erika challenging kyrie to strip chess  erika and eva bonding as they both tease natsuhi  erika and rosa drinking up a storm and having a good time
  erika winning kyries body and making her masturbate in front of her while her moaning can be heard in battlers room after exhausting session kyrie finally is at the climax and you can her a mumbled uwoaaaaah while erika screams vewy good
  i can imagine erika taunting kyrie as shes forced to strip down asking if shes tried turning the chessboard around kyrie might prove a tough opponent though and i could see her rallying back at erika maybe getting her topless then offering words of consolation dont worry youve still got plenty of time to grow
  i could also see them both getting stripped after getting drunk and make each other go into passive aggresive interrogation of one another to get information  erika such a smart and powerful woman like you and you went after an idiot like rudolf   kyrie such a smart and cunning woman and you preffer to use chop sticks instead of an more efficient fork 
  please dont talk about that weirdo in denialalso that comunnity its probably him using multiples accounts he always does that
  gloria in excelsis dea  duncantricers main theme beware  the duncantricers are real 
  umineko non japanese fanbase is so cringy
  the worst part  heard that infinity stop is teaming up with him
have this thread up on extra monitor  sibling comes into the room to talk to me  is looking past me at the monitor this thread is on  think nothing of it  the person leaves  i look back and its just all that lewd chat    oh no
  it totally turned them on
rereading the higurashi vns this year and man do they need more expressions for the characters not counting the same expression  different arm position i feel spoiled by beatrice and battlers 50 or so expressions
the fact that sayo can cum  hot
  prepare to fuck your crossdressing uncle
  i wish we had more evil shannon shown in the vn
  the fact that sayo can come but only when you fuck her in the ass  hot
virgilia with her eyes open is the scariest thing about umineko
  that spooky stunt she pulled at the end gave me the chills
  virgilia with her eyes open is the sexiest thing about umineko
  the contrast of expressions nulbers between higurashi and umineko is plain ridiculous mion got like 16 rena maybe 13 rika got less than 10
trying to hear a line  monstrously loud sfx plays like a thunder making the voice clip unhearable  wheres the sfx volume option
   to hear a line  i cant imagine playing a 7th exp game with voicelines itd just take away from the music
  damn shes hot with those eyes
  did you get freaked out by virgilia during the signing scene in ep3 too beatrice i saw coming but up until that point i was fully convinced virgilia was on my side
  theres two volume meters for both the music and voices i could enjoy both just fine
die the desu  sentence to desu  dlanors voice is lovely
  t battler
  dlanors pussy is lovely
  that sounds perfect the two of them lounging around on opposite ends of a small couch both sipping expensive wine while clad in nothing but their underwear their banter getting more and more sexually charged as they continue to drink
  joey wheeler is that you
  these two witches challenge you to a tag duel who do you partner up with to take them on
  is this shit real im not dreaming right what is it about ryukishis work that attracts the most batshit kind of art
  the greatest way to shame ushiromiya battler is by making his mom sex slave to erika furudo the real master of rokkenjima  but kyrie just goes along beacuse she likes the thrill of being in action again
  i wonder what it could be
  by that logic i could see erika going after natsuhi to get back at jessica for interrupting her
  its from the pachinko game its actually where the steam version based their art from
  there is something so distinctly wrong and repulsive about pachinko/steam battler but i just cant describe it
  who is the fuck that gave her some period pad instead of giving her a hot 80s bush
  implying she didnt have that planned out to begin with
  this did startle me when it happened since obviously it wasnt in the original novel in this version its treated as a jump scare alongside her laugh the other sound that plays is similar to the scary one in umineko that plays sometimes when corpses are discovered you know the one
  shes a kid    pachinko georges eyes are just wrong he looks like a special needs kid
  sleazy eyes front bang on the opposite direction and he somehow looks thinner than even the ps3 ver
  this is the closest therell ever be to a chiru anime just like kaiji s3  
is there a new thread yet
  /jp/ is a slow board wait until we reach page 10 this thread can easily last another day
  me i dont do hairy
  you must be new to slower boards  /jp/ really changed while i wasnt looking
  rimming battler with that tongue
  sounds pretty gay if you ask me
  i actually started using 4chan about 12 years ago in college before /jp/ was its own board but over  the years my interests have drifted away from touhou anime and other japanese stuff so i mostly only come to 4chan for the 07th expansion thread when some new thing comes out
  4chan
  shes a kid  what a loser
  indian battler  show vagene plz
witch brap
  tags cute gmaleirlugly bastard fat fuckanalrapefoothairycum inside
  the fact that shannon cant refuse to anal  the fact that shannon will have no problem to have sex in the first date
  shannon still has her prostate  you can make her cum by fucking her in the ass
  slutnnon
why bern didnt turn ange into a human toilet for witches  shes so mercyful
  because she doesnt have such retarded idiotic ideas like you anon
  hi ange
  ange lol  tell that to featherine
why doesnt ikuko age
  lots and lots of makeup
  all those talks george made throughout the series about having children with shannon are fucking hilarious
  id marry shannon then wed adopt ange and then id fuck ange
  the fact that shannon has a low self steem and know her furniture condition  best seacat
  if were just talking waifus id take offbrand mion over her any day
  oyashiro is gonna be angry that the villagers are celebrating filthy foreign religions
bad kush
  god i wish that were me
  based dubs poster
  oyashirosama is pitiful god
  mion is a good option as well but are you talking about the original mion or the mion shion
  lets not confuse names here and just refer to them as theyre known by everyone else and not their backstory
  artbook looks pretty good
  he draws crazy faces himself
  less cartoonish expressions
miyao  is he one of berns cats
  its amazing what a little change can do
  i will fuck lion
  patch for steam sprites to fix the fucking expressions when
  back off xir is mine
  kek is the steam sprite really unedited she looks legit retarded
  you got a link for the pachinko artbook
  nvm found it
  yep for some reason they decided to use that expression and not the one on the right
why is such a good song attached to the pachinko  
  i wish sadly the artbook only contains sample expressions and not the entire range at best you could patch in replacement expressions for a handful of the more notable ones
  meant for 
  im fucking around and seeing if i can find the pachinko game and see if i can rip the contents
  blonde girls are the best
  
  you cant download from here tho
  bottom right button takes you to some downloads
share your merch
  yeah its just for downloading a jpeg of the sprites on that page as well as a psd of that sprite
  holy crap that resolution
  still a good find
    just remembered the existence of this video  i dont know if it works though
  oh nice fine lets see if it still works
  good luck anon
  there is so much there i want like the higurashi figures
  i never realized how rare they were when i bought them a few years back but i havent seen them restocked anywhere since also far right on the 3rd shelf is all doujinshi
  need me a bloodrelated sister like that  that i can fuck
  asian genes
  shes not that old seeing that shes yasu its another one of the numerous clues
  would be great battlers a lucky dude having such a qt brocon of a little sis not to mention one with such a killer body nobody could blame him for giving into temptation and following the family tradition of incest
personal space invasion
  i find it amusing how the steam sprites are actually the most sexual ones since the girls have bigger boobs than the others
  even fucking kumasawa has hers as bigger
  shows more skin too
  yeah just about everyone got a bust upgrade and there were various other bits of fanservice here and there shorter skirts higher cut leotards more form fitting clothes featherine straight up got deep cleavage added where there has never been any before
  comparison of all 3 styles
  thats a lot of paizuri
  thatll be four bucks baby you want ahegao with that
  of course its only natural given the source material just imagine a unique paizuri experience for each girl whether it be classic clothed horizontal oiled underboob sideboob etc you could even mix things up by making groups for double paizuri triple paizuri or more
  wut
  he doesnt know
  cold characters finally breaking the act get to me rina satos crying voice helped too
  its one of those theories that attracts an undue amount of hate because it makes too much sense and people feel insulted that they werent the one to think of it first its a common problem with some communities built around mysteries or an understanding of an authors work the more obvious the theory the more people polarize because they feel ashamed that they didnt think of it long ago    nobody likes to have their own mediocrity thrown to their faces after all the fact that its proponents are insufferably smug does not help too     as a result i have seen some of the most bizarre arguments used against the yasuikuko theory from she used magic and shes a witch duh to stop thinking or yasu wouldnt use alternate witches personalities anyways or yasu isnt rich its weird how people can be irrational like that
  what
  it makes too much sense  what sense does it make
  you have some serious complexes mate
playing chess with ushiromiya kinzo
why is humiliation so cute
erika survived and went on to live in seychelles with a new family
  say it in red
  while i suck his old and smelly dick
  no
hanyuu forced rika to kill her mother and ruin her fathers life in another world just to teach her a lesson  fucked up bitch
  paizuris nice and all but how about a booby heaven with all seven sisters of purgatory
  i would rather get staked by all of them at once desu
  im still mad that asmo didnt appear in the sakutaro tip because it would imply that maria used him to masturbate
praise me satoshi kun
  thats a very rare satoshi
  how did she fall for such a beta effeminate useless clumsy murderous mentally unstable little bitch like satoshi
  he doesnt even have casual clothes he goes everywhere in his plain school clothes or wearing the baseball uniform kantoku gave him
  miyaomiau  just noticed this right now
  headpatting fetish so powerful shion drops satoshi for k1 in an alternate arc
  forced  there is always free will besides you dont know if she killed her mother or not   you really didnt get anything from the ova
    huge subahibi spoilers dont open if you didnt finish it
  what ova im talking about the vn    its obvious that hanyuu made her do something so horrible and then gave her an easy way out by saying it was a dream all so she could forget about all the shit she went through and treat is as nonreal    the ends justify the means
  the ova i mean to relate to that chapter was wrong on considering you just saw the ova   its obvious that hanyuu made her do something so horrible and then gave her an easy way out by saying it was a dream  i repeat that you didnt understand anything about that chapter go read it again or stop being so stubborn with that point of view you are focusing on the wrong details
  why not call it an epilogue instead of ova ova implies that we are talking about the shitty anime adaptation of it
keiichi is already taken tho
  hes kinda cute honestly
  irrelevant question when i apologized for the mistake already
  you are so fucking full of yourself
why did mions mom give up the title of successor to marry a fucking yakuza boss that would turn the whole family into criminals
  shes a rebel herself who insults her own mother acts like a gangster and doesnt care about the succession much like how the umineko kids dont care about it either
  i never found shirley attractive too old school for me
  what do you want me to say to make you happy then
  stop impersonating me    im           is a faker
  selfevident i guess you concede
  shes obviously a slut and power hungry notice how shes often with kasai whos known for having a crush on her back in the day
  but who says a fake cant surpass the original
  you wanna take this outside
    ciconia foreshadowing
  sure meet me behind the school in 5 minutes
  why did kasai the chain smoker die of liver cancer 20 years later what the fuck what is ryuukishi trying to say
i like both the higurashi vns and the anime even if the latter is very fast paced especially when you read the former beforehand i like the voices a lot and im glad they got that cast for the later voiced versions of the vn
  take off that jabroni outfit
  wrong he was killed by yusuke in the dark tournament
            pedo anon gets banned for simply existing and yet this worthless trash is not deleted logic
  believe it or not harmless fun isnt against the rules
  dont you ever call me jabroni
  4channel is a good site anon
  i love the anime too but good god is it a bad way of being introduced to the series    i mean i fucking loved it back in the day its good but after reading the vn and seeing how much shit i missed out i was pissed you can only experience the story blind once so the anime killed a lot of potential enjoyement that ill never get back
  im quaking in my boots truly
  we truly live in a society
i cant believe the anon who was writing the jessica x battler fic is fucking dead
    i like the higurashi anime but i think the one way it fails compared to the vns is it doesnt let you get into the heads souls and emotions of the characters two problems the soundtrack and the lack of prose narrative    prose is just the best at letting you really get into the minds of characters there are studies that show that reading fiction makes people more empathetic in general and im not surprised    in terms of the musicthe vn has lots of sentimental emotional pieces but the music direction of the anime is much more explicitly horrorbased with more spooky music or just a silent score in many scenes because of that less of the emotional impact gets across in favor of horror/shock
  how deranged is the ushiromiya family that sexual harassment attempts by battler to grope his own cousin is just met with a bop on the head and oh that battler and his shenanigans
  its probably because those posts were getting too offtopic and people were already saying to take it to /pol/ before that offtopic discussion continued into that direction and complaining about being deleted only furthered being offtopic and breaking more rules
  admit it anon before kinzo they probably did some inbreeding
  nigga its shitposting in exactly the same way the human condition ofposting is if mods just let people get it out of their system it would either fall back into obscurity after a thread or two or turn into a meme
  its battler hes special
  but the music direction of the anime is much more explicitly horrorbased with more spooky music or just a silent score in many scenes  so much this i think tatarigoroshi and tsumihoroboshi got fucked royally because of that especially when keichi confronts rena on the school roof
  implying you need to read anything more than the decades old ushiromiya rapefest fanfic
  the anime gets bonus points for having shion piss herself
rosa is small chested
  anon plz
  compared to her peers yeah she is
  even george has bigger tits than her
  george has the biggest manboobs of everyone else in the cast so its not like thats fair
  this image should become a meme
  battler blanco y jorge gordo
  well cousin incest is considered fine in japan really
  he cant even see it
beatrice will never cum inside of you  why live
  but she has no dick it got chopped off
  all incest is fine if the girl doesnt get pregnant this is a fact
  and what if the guy gets pregnant
  he said beatrice  not yasu ya dumb fuck
  also the probability of an incest child having genetic problems is almost nonexistent a woman having kids in her late 30s has a much higher risk of ending up with a special kid    the only bad thing about your parents being siblings is that you cant have children with your own siblings or cousins because thats when shit can go wrong you can still fuck them just fine though    thats why the japanese dont make a big deal out of incest nobody even wants to have kids these days so whats the problem
  beatrice is a girl girls dont have dicks
  all girls have dicks in their hearts
  proof
  how do they pee then
  didnt realize theres quite a bit of fellow subahibi readers here
  from their mouths
  thats because maria doesnt do it her young body is perfectly capable of giving her pleasure but shes too ignorant to know about that    girls in general are almost never horny especially at that age also it takes them much longer to orgasm compared to guys on top of that their genitals are so poorly designed that they rarely find out on their own that their clits can give them pleasure    if asmodeus had appeared in that tip it wouldve been shameless loli pandering without taking realism into account
  yuki3 worst yuki
  damn amazing work as always
kuwadorian beato impregnated herself
  ryuukishi disagrees because he made lion crosseyed in his regular pose
daily reminder that oishi doesnt mean shit its oo ishi big stone    and ryuukishis name is written like that ryuu meaning dragon ryu doesnt mean shit
  hello witch of pedantry
  thank you ill post more as i find it
  girls have a dick but its not developed and have another name
  shavit yaldas propoganda performance has been leaked  
  correct answer
    having part of a dick an undeveloped glans isnt having a dick a plane with no engine isnt a plane its a gilder
  a clitoris is more of a dick than a circumcised calloused fucked up americuck dick that needs fucking lotion applied to it to even jack off    sorry but its the truth
  humilliation anon pranked most of the general into reading that kusoge
  you will never rip that selfish loli brat a new one  why live
  nice headcanon
  the only dick shell ever accept is her brothers
  kamige  super satoshi is the greatest protagonist of all time  hes literally our guy the peoples champ hes also a fucking cuck its great
  i wish i was battler
higurashi  11 year old country lolis with pure hearts but lewd minds because they hang out with teenage delinquents    umineko  9 year old rich kid with mild autism being groomed by a delusional eunuch    higanbanana  11 year old city kids corrupted by the pleasure of bullying and humiliation
10 years  we still dont have the lyrics to happy maria
  mild autism  memorizing the whole fucking bible is not mild thats a high functioning savant right there bonus for bipolarity and not acting her age at all both too young and too old to be 9 depending on what mode shes on at the moment even her vocal chords somehow change to that of an adult
  im gonna piss in fire
  my witch is golden dreamer
  she acts like that because she picked it up from watching beatrice possess an adult so tries to mimic it when going into witch mode

  im not sure how seeing someone else makes your 9 year vocal cords turn of that of a mid 20s woman and know every single verse in the bible by age 9
ryuukishis selling this why is he so deranged
  he just knows his audience
  sealing doors in silence  thats really really low
  whats that dripping down your shoe lady erika
flauros and diamondchan will never show up again just like the alien loli sluts from hou
  i wish there was more to that pic
  cute fangs
  was that a real trick they used in that shit series
  no the guy is delusional and keeps saying the opposite things at that point and he randomly says that
  even if there was you wouldnt see anything erikas hair covers her chest perfectly
  never understood the love for zts dai did the best music hands down
  there is a twins trick in the franchise but in that game specifically no
  dai didnt compose discolor or deadangle
  zts did all the big tracks that r07 likes to reserve them for an episodes climax climax like dreamenddischarger and lastendconductor he also does others that are used regularly like miragecoordinator    umineko wouldnt be umineko without zts

feed ducky
  until exploded
  i would only feed akizuki and make her sisters watch
how would the ijn shipgirls react to a burger ttk at first would getting trust be harder
  theyd probably be uncomfortable with battle tactics that arent fucking retarded
  what is this damage control you speak of
  yeah because you dont speak japanese
  thats not the right way to bully taihou  try again with shinano if she ever appears
  is the right way to plug her anus with your dick so she cant vent her gas
  there is a more sophisticated way  have vaginal sex with her  people actually fart easily during it  wear a gas mask and earplugs while doing it
  i need more images of teenage boats casually asking for sex
tenryuu is a sincerely good girl that needs mental health not sexual abuse
  needs a beating
sado
  she wont survive
  a shit
  i bet she smells bad
  probably  she spends a lot of her spare time on sword training to maintain her chuuni skills
how come kc arcade is way more popular than fgo arcade
  fgoa is even more gacha
  they can already waste all their money on the mobage instead
  programming fgoa has been a pain in the ass since the beginning
  fgoa is a rushed
which shipgirls pee their beds at night
  yuudachi
  all of the waves do
  like from making them squirt or they cant hold it
  every destroyer no exception
  akatsuki
  nagato
thanks for the boner
  both are valid
  tell me more mutsu
  so thats why she insisted on two beds
  whichever one i visit
  more
is is okay to samu samu
  yes
  imagine dunking her head underwater
  rude and mean
  bismarck
sam in the winter is cold so is this joke
  nah id rather have gamby
  nip puns dont work in english anon
      
i do not understand
  what do you mean
  have you even seen the gameplay for fgo arcade
  we are chads in the industry
nice destroyers
  for real though whats wrong with the lady
  its all fat old guys  are all arcade games like this these days
    trashcan gave them drugs
  ikazuchi broke her arm and 
  none of them look older than 30 or fatter than your mom though
  they look over 30 to me from what little we can see
  only the ones catering to their core base the majority are family friendly
has anyone got the new calendar yet  need to know if hiyou and junyou are in it or not
  the opposite  i  guess fat admirals are common
  man seeing trashcan inazuma and ikazuchi together like this really exposes the sameface problems
  kancolle arcade is an improvement over the browser game  fgo arcade is not an improvement over the browser game  not to mention half of fgos player base are fujos who might not be into arcades
  its gotten worse lately i think
  the calendar is in preorder wait after christmas
  alright thanks    theres a group that i hang around with that are really going crazy to find out if they are or not
  fgo arcade is not an improvement over the browser game  fgo arcade is not improvement over the fgo mobage is what i meant to say  also i forgot to mention the combat acts like some slow ass shit arena fighter
  taskent looks more like the sister of ikazuchi and inazuma  hibiki and akatsuki are fucking palette swaps of each other  maybe next time he should just 2 or three girls
  hiyou was in 2015 calendar
anyone have picture of predicted historical ships for next event i saw it yesterday on twitter but i forgot to save it
i like how trashcan is the dd equivalent of ooyodo when it comes to installations especially for 64 quarterly  the tank/daihatsu girls have this alarming tendency of missing their targets during yasen
  tanks dont work well against isolated hime theyre great against supply and imps though
  i know havent seen another one after the two images came out    is anyone planning to get the calendar to scan and upload the images here
  man i love yadokari
  not my wife
  especially fujinami
  you really like three of the same character huh
  i will be taking photos when they arrive however there is a possibility that those images would have been uploaded by then
  no she doesnt
  no problem i think it would great either way  one way or the other those images will be on here    i am starting to believe i am the only shumuck in the world who is crazy about hiyou and junyou
waiting for hiyou k2
  kuro is dead
  and i am pretty sure there is someone crazy about uranami too
  there are at least from what i can remember 3 of them who i know of that are out at sea right now that are      oh man the mass amount of images and porn this will probably lead to i am not ready but damn it bring it
  i highly doubt they will even if kuro does get a month since they already had one before
  was that the one in the kimono or this one  i cant remember
my tenga 0 just arrived cant wait to test this bad boy starting with prinz doujin
  tenga  why waste your money they dont last long
  i spoke someone in black friday thread in /g/ that hes been using it for a year now i guess its pretty reliable
  /g/
deja vu
this ship is actually an angel in disguise
  theyre not made for westerners unless you have a baby dick i broke the ultra model on the first thrust    a cute
  baby dick  it hurts you know _
  some brave men have to take on the job of pleasuring the fairies
sexy poi
  going to give poi my big bone
  for 
  careful she bites
post cute
  fucked her in the ass on the first day to show dominance she expects it now
  i love this artist both because he gives the botes huge tits and because he makes the local autists go full reeeeeeeee
she has gotten a lot more confidence now with the power of megane
  a certain special kind of angel the name is a warning
  no one knows who that is in 2018
  pipiru piru piru pipiru pi
  i like how he draws rj naked all the time    i hated this show when it first aired
  i was going to refute that but then i realized youre probably right and i felt really old and got sad
  
freedomtits
  ugly
  going to shove my bone into this pooches pooch as well
  patrician taste
nigger
  shes getting ready for our date
  what a thirsty bitch desu
  she looks better when shes properly dressed
  you still get decent xp for the second slot
  100 industrial grade cocacola from the best tits in the entire game    yum
  properly    not revealing isnt proper its just not revealing you dumb burger
  yeah but what a shit composition and taste
so this is the power of iowa
     do not lewd the dog
  nagato tried grooming her by showing her online porn but poi figured out what hetro sex was and wants it with you now
  too late
  when will she show her big stick
red poi only looks good in fanart
  fat stern
  cant lewd someone that is already lewd  to begin with
  nagato will send mutsu after me if i give poi what she wants
  wish i could live in between those
  whats lewder the dogs thong or the speedsluts thong
  i just noticed they kept 2 secondary turrets per side in her refit and theyre firing those too
  kai ni when
  too broken
  it would be speedslut if she wore pantyhose
all three are equally fuck able and should be deep dicked together to ensure equal wear
i like how this guy draws dds
  thats because dds are the best
    tenga  wtf anon we have dedicated threads for onaholes in /jp/ and all you did was consulting with /g/   tenga is a trash 2/10 tier onahole manufacturer
need some ideas for my licensed plate should i go with this at most 5 letters/numbers
  zuiun
  all hail zuiun
  t hyuuga
  zuiun
  fuck yes

how much of a hipster am i if my favorite class is cvls

  leftsoulless  rightsoul
  right
  inazuma  ikazuchi  fumizuki  mochizuki  wakaba  trashcan  i count more and i probably forgot some
  people will totally not misinterpret it as thai ho
  solid choice mate
  thanks bro but the jews are charging me for 60 initial fee 40 annually and its driving me mad i could buy rings and slots for this price
the wolf is getting married
  your crimes against zuiun will be remembered heretic
  by the way i can just use the standard plate that cost 25 initial 15 annual with a maximum of 7 texts hmm
  sneak out the back during the wedding
  implying she cant smell her prey for miles away
  youre lucky here in texas that shit is 80
  at least your plates are painted in solid white and black text while ours is a goddamn potato
  idaho  not waifing a potato  you have brought shame upon your family
fubuki is cute
brehs how do i woo this doll
  brehs  fuck off
  i wont fuck you thats your dads job

  best gumo
  your bro is trying something new in his hobby be supportive
  unzip dick and rub
  baseded

  why do you think that
  ok whats the recipy for thaiho im gonna give it a shot again
  it gives nice firepower accuracy aa and fleet aa
  level 152  13 luck
  i was trying to be nice  though hibiki and akatsuki are more like palette swaps of each other than looking like the other three in the picture
  wheres the 2nd murata
    literally bleach
  6 luck from marriage 3 luck from trying to up her hp dumb nigger
  right here i like tomonagamurata combo better with tomo being on a bigger slot
  but you have to admit that bleach have some really good art
  thats bloody sugoi mdude
  bleachcolle has been around for a while dude
  is this official christ looks edgy too
  who is that body supposed to be anyway
  is she like that cow without a face
why is kaga so short
  you cant say you love her if she isnt level 175 and maxluck you filthy plebeian
  its quite common for slow battleships
  zuikaku is big
  those arms  kagas right wrist
maizuru
  cute fairy
  who
  just search cow without face gif on google im not posting that in here
  im not posting that in here  are you five
  no i just dont want to get jannyd
fuckin wrecked
  she must feel like a relic from a time gone by  even in ww2 the era of battleships was kinda over
  pizajanakute pittsa  explain
  when you want to be comrade but youre actually amico
  まだまだbattleshipの時代は終わらないわ
  is she actually an italian fascist spy  it would only make my raping boner harder
ideologically pure soviet boats when only having tzarist fascist and nip imperialist soviets starts to get boring
  anything built under stalin was also fascist
is she a good secretary ship
  cute
which dd is the best for baby making sex
  if youre a shota ttk
  
  trashcan
  hama
  tzarist  imperial ojousama when i want my soviet desuwas
  my destroyer wife
  what the fuck are you on gangut is revolutionary scum
  all of them
  
mogamin
  oktyabrskaya revolyutsiya is revolutionary scum gangut is pure waifu
  what a slut
  she was wearing the name gangut during the revolution
whats up with these tactical des popping up not that i am complaining i like it
  gotta keep the jiji away
  so
  that means gangut is revolutionary scum
  more like trainning for ttks like jiji
bow strings are for plebs
  jiji is innocent he has an alibi
any expedition macros working on 20 yet

  cute taiha

    i will fap to this
  cute thighha
    impeccable fashion sense
cute boat
  does he know hes being turned into a meme does he embrace the loli love
  shes not that big
20 seconds delay  tanaka what the fuck fix your shit
  yeah i was gunna say that titties too big
    daily rubbing helps
  
  much obliged
  lethal
  ikazuchi and inazuma is understandable since theyre sister ships tashkent isnt
  what and an imperator had his usual name during the revolution too so hes a revolutionary scum too
so when are we going to get the last few ijn cas that arent in the game yet
  those arent cas
  tell that to the ijn theyre the ones that decided to classify them as cas back in 1942
  old ass armored cruisers  literally kaiboukans
  ddh kaga
16 yo
  i want a younger goat
aki
  a better aki
  that looks more like 12
i want to hold hands with got
  is that a ghost under the water
  gross
  is kancolle really dead and sustained only through memes
  i want to sniff the taclass
  didnt mean to reply
  would teach that badgirl a lesson through the power of anal love
  for what purpose those are predreadnoughts
  it died in 2013
  did he participate on the side of the revolution  her crew joined the general mutiny of the baltic fleet on 16 march 1917 after the idle sailors received word of the february revolution in saint petersburg
    how does this make you feel
  theyre pretty big around ooyodo size
is there any ship in game that never lived to see the war besides miyuki
    educate yourself
  confused why would you need more than one unique can in your kolle
  his pee pee is of subpar quality so he has to compansate somehow
  the lvl 85 one is form a time when i was without an army dog the lvl 3 one is from sara dupe lscing
  casuals who absolutely need more than 1 abukuma or kitakami in their fleet because they are insecure these are the same guys who complained about not getting multiple zuikaku kai 2s
    there is nothing wrong with having dupes stop being so insecure
  neglecting the majority of the girls because you cant win without raw numbers  this is why specific ship routing has increased significantly
  neglecting the majority of the girls  what
yo
  then there would be no reason to own dupes if it were not for the purpose of replacing weak links in your fleet you wouldnt use kako over prinz if you had a second prinz
  like hell i wouldnt kako is a great girl and i want more mikawa quests
  i dont need dupes to clear event
  did she put it in
  their quarters were pretty amazing too  as expected but they shouldnt lewd the shimushuclass daughtersu
  more iowas when
  what else are you supposd to do with onaholes
  a bad day for nenohi
  soon
  i think animal farm is better
  remove
  procreate
  abort
    punch bellies really hard
  best girl wisconsin when
  hopefully farm girl with cow pattern top
  until exploded
  a proper use of sister sara
    remind me the tag for the pregnant botes on pixiv onegaishimas
  breed burger boats
  protip just type pregnant in english into the search bar
  must breed gamby and intrepid too
an obscenely pregnant sammy
  getting obscenely bellypunched
  dont lewd sammy
  she is like miniiowa but not a slut and with planes
  but i love iowas slutty pinup style
  i like her style too but id never trust my heart to a slut
  through the power of dick any girl can be tamed
  anon thats not how you tame a slut
  thats what a dicklet would say
  iowa is a dumb bimbo who will fuck anything that moves for fun but if you show her a ring and explain by exchanging this youre agreeing to be dedicated to each other only shell squeel wow volleyball me iowa love only you admiral ok and be loyal for the rest of your lives
  you dont cure coke addicts by giving them more cocaine anon you dont cure a slut by giving her more dick youre just asking for her to bring strangers into your bed while youre away
  i can see her being dumb enough to actually be like this once shes ringed hm
  but she puts the coc in cocacola    her screaming engrish during sex sounds good
  can you help with this semen addict anon  she is not so dump
  iowas moans and screams  tfw you live in a porn parody    must be quite a life
  iowa is fueled by seamen mutsu is fueled by seamen and souls of men there are girls that cant be helped anon
  this ones obvious keep her with her sister at all times they cure each others problems
  even when sleeping and fucking  im not sure if thats good for nagatochan
  my back gets sore after awhile but its worth it
  maybe but it works i decided to keep them together when i married nagato and so far destroyer rapes have gone down and mutsu hasnt been devouring the souls of any unfortunate bastard who wanders too close to the base
  how many times you have to mate with each of them
  how many times a day
  and mutsu hasnt been devouring the souls    would it be too hard for a succubus to cast some memory wipe spell on you though
  how about this  get a few shipgirls you trust to spread a rumour around the base  admirals in love but hes scared to approach the girl he likes because he thinks his virgin loser dick wont be able to satisfy her  call mutsu into your office for a tactical briefing one night  ask if theres anything else she thinks needs to be address  well i heard the admirals worried about something and thats not good for morale so perhaps mutsu could give him some tuition ara ara  offer token resistance before allowing her to give you regular lessons for a couple of months  call mutsu into your office thank her for all her hard work tell her youre finally ready to propose to the girl you love  leave the office  her heart suddenly starts to ache as she realises shes losing you  walk back into the office get down on one knee and present your ring
  just about every hour on the hour
  she wants you to remember
  willingly marrying a souldevouring sex demoness    absolute madlad
  cute abused house wife
boats in action
    i would    you say that like its a bad thing
  
  who do i need to commision to see this happen
  i wasnt
minegumo confirmed for next event nobody else can have that gumo theyre mine
  minegumo that name  isnt she the one who is is missing from the desdiv that has murakumo as flagship
  no its an asashio
which dd would open to the idea to sex in public hard mode no shimakaze
  same squad as these two
  shes one of the 4 fake asashiogumos who made up desdiv 9
  i want them so bad
現在艦これ運営鎮守府では次期冬イベ期間限定海域の作戦準備を進めています作戦海域は中部ソロモン海域作戦海域規模は小規模ですが甲作戦や乙作戦ではかなりがっつりした戦いとなる予定です同作戦前半では村雨と運命を共にしたある駆逐艦も登場予定お楽しみに
  i would lay them on top of each other and eat them out at the same time
  this artist such have too much free time
  small scale which means 3 easy maps
  fuck 50k really would have been enough
  the memedal is secured
  small scale but difficult later maps is what its saying
  no
  the fat fuck will find a way to screw us again
  4 maps 10 gauges
  just because youre shit at the game doesnt mean he did anything wrong
newfag event  disgusting
  4 maps is mediumscale newfag
nisshin  minegumo  fletcher    you think thats all for a small event
  token onahole
  i really hope fletcher is flat and blond my favorite combo
  erotofu or gumo
  2 rewards 2 drops
  americans cant afford to be boring theres just too many of them
minegumo e2 drop  johnston e2 reward  hoel e3 drop  nisshin e3 reward
  the other asashio gumo to finish asashiocolle and give fujikawa the chance to draw her asashios together for the calendar
  but flat is top sexiness
  is nisshin this important that she becomes a reward
  more like    random de e2 reward  minegumo e2 drop  nisshin e3 drop  fletcher e3 reward
  shes the best av the game will ever see
  sara is already top pornstar
  what would make her the best av is being able to oasw
  thats for kamo kai ni taitei will fly off and clear sub nodes while the surface ships are still miles away
  nisshin is the last remaining big ijn ship left aside from shitnano
  shitnano  shinever
  you fucking wish
  taiyous sisters are bigger than her
  not in name
  big  its a fucking av
  avs were fucking big
  cute
  this isnt /sp/
  and shes not even the biggest av remaining
  rrule the waves
asaaashhiiiooo
  depends on the av akitsushima was dd sized
  fujikawa  asashio  nani i thought monkeygirl was the defacto asashio artist do people even care about asagumo or yamagumo
  people care about smoking weed every day blaze it faggots  i dont think anyone cares about the other one
glasses for minegumo
    i care about them despite the fact im a stoner
  what about ibuki teased at the same time as shinano with the ability to swap between ca and cvl
  ibuki was just the kai suzuya which we ended up getting with suzuyas kai ni and cvl form
  fujikawa called dibs on anything that ends in gumo
  yes the ibuki idea became suzukuma k2
  nishimura fleet fags
  mogami is so handsome
  give me those dds
  god the service here is terrible
  i want to give both max a nd lebe a tip by eating them out in the bathroom
  im going to impregnate that fusou
  get in the line
  who
  read the filename
  original nisshin
  based
  some desperate slut
  the last remaining big ijn ship left aside from shitnano    we still also have asahi tokiwa yakumo izumo  and iwate left
    looking at all the dds with glasses it also occurred to me theyre all to some degree flat this is not taking fan art into account new girl might have small mounds if she does have glasses to break that trend
  kasagi was about as complete as graf and aquila were when their construction stopped so if tanaka really wanted he could add her
  that could just be coincidence most dds are small while titty dds in general are pretty rare
  i want to squeeze them
  i want to inject them with experimental growth hormones
  why theyre fine the way they are
i just had a nightmare about being shot through the back of the head
  bullshit  most nishimurafags only remember the battleships mogami shigure and the monkeyhios
  i constantly have nightmares about being chased by monsters large predatory animals or zombies
big tiddied cvl sisters are underrated
  i used to have nightmares about being attack by giant spiders but then i saved a bunch of spider monstergirl porn and masturbated furiously to it for a few weeks and now all my spider nightmares turn into lewd dreams halfway through
come here
  whoops
kamo
  i want to kamo all over her lower body
  i would so fast i hope she doesnt mind me staining that dress
  transparent
  watch one of the new ships be voice by yuka ootsubo
will minegumo be a reward or not
  drop
  nisshin will be the reward and what else  i guess an escort
  dumb goomba
atai
  cumming in the shark
  i hope she realizes im about to do some disgusting things to her
its too cold i feel like it went from the height of summer to the heart of winter here in about a week
  disgusting   like handholding
  thats global warming for you
  yes and ass to mouth as well
  where did fujikawa obtain inspiration for such hairstyle
  she probably went to multiple schools growing up or had a crazy friend
  that tummy is too lewd to be legal
  looks like shes about to do an illegal act on the rapebait
  should i watch it
  i need to succ
  not really worth watching but if you want to watch something with slapstick humor comedy with mild gore and fanservice you might give it a try
  underrated bote
  jk is fine too
  nah its not that great the opening theme song still gets randomly stuck in my head though
  i can still hear it too
updated op  
    i want to make cp with trashcan
  its winter time to cover up in layers
    would liberate
    i better be able to pick up this commie this event
sasuga pasta engineering
  where are the bongs
  no one gives a shit about the bongs
  umikaze must be a womanlet
  bongs dont give a shit about their submarines or destroyers
  z52  why are ships that werent even close to completion on there
  cutie
    those are all ships in wows so im guessing thats where he got it so its full of paper boats and no bongs
i always imagine goatland plays for a black metal band
  sheep cannons  would isten to
  kiev  ernst gaede  z52  paper ships  wows shit  opinion discarded
      recently i had a nightmare of making sandwiches but all the bread was mouldy    also all my shipgirls sank
soon
  kongo and her daughter zaire
  post more level 1 boats
  i have low luck
  i think its republic of kongo and democratic republic of kongo i cant remember which is which
  sure
  would increase her hangar size

  i want to clean every inch of my dd waifu
  would you do it in front of others like her sisters
  bend her over the office table with her lewd face facing her sisters

  time sure flies i cant believe its 2014 already

  the scale of the area of operation is small but the fight will likely be rather formidable for hard and meme difficulties  also minegumo  get ready for the but devs said its supposed to be easy whining
  were no actually easy events since arpeggio  and tanaka already said that hell make the last map cancer so idk
  that difficulty warning has been there for every event since difficulty selection became a thing and there have absolutely been events so easy most people cleared them in a day you probably just forgot them think of fall 2014 or summer 2015 weve just been on a string of hard or demanding events lately
  kon indian ocean raid and reigou were easy
any picture or checklist for next event historical ships
looking at paperwork  feel a tug on your shirt  put it aside and see this    what do
  give her some of the paperwork
  i would tell her to get her sister
  im not interested girls who wear glasses
  imo the first two look most apetising  the latter two look like something fat ugly bastards eat
  ive eaten one with tons of beansprouts before it was kinda weird having more beansprouts than noodles
what ship/equip benchmarks should i be looking for to do my first hard clear
patchouli knowledge needs psychological help
    i love crazy eyes
eirin here  what happened
  just like its perfectly normal for men to like lolis its also perfectly normal for women to like shotas  if anything patche should be encouraged to follow her dreams and desires
    i want to be patches shota    i hope her magic can turn me back in time 15 years
flandre wants to die
  she hasnt left the mansion in 5 years  wouldnt you agree being a shut in is a symptom of something very wrong with a person eirin sensei
  doesnt she like rb and stuff
  hiphop my bad
patchouli used to get medication for her problems but remilia recently stopped subsidizing her medical bills so she could build a rocketship to the moon    dont worry rinnosuke says that theres this thing from the outside world called crowdfunding that can help people beg for money to pay for their medicine
  that reminds me whatever happened to the anon who impersonated reimu on patreon
shotakon  the image was almost good as well
  she probably saw something very unpleasant which traumatized her    does she told you like delusions or told you something weird i mean signs of psychosis or depression
huh
from this angle she seems a little fat
  or is she just thick
she doesnt age so good
    looks like it
too much gurunai
but then guess she was always fat
kanna got some big titties now

  trip is saving the vn scene while you keep shitposting every week
  saving the vn scene  judging by the vns he has translated he isnt doing a very good job
  i admire the guy he puts a lot of effort into translating moege going so far as to edit images for us and for free    his tls are better than regular releases quality wise like nekonyans solpresss and sekais releases and lets not talk about speed triplicate is the fastest translator in the scene right now god bless him
  hes pretty amazing aside from how awful his taste is
  his tls are better than regular releases quality wise  his tls are still incredibly liberal he sometimes rewrites entire sections  triplicate is the fastest translator in the scene right now  trip is the better translator but arunaru is still faster
  his tls are still incredibly liberal he sometimes rewrites entire sections  i take liberal over literal any day of the week i mean he wrote a longass txt file with tl notes for tsujidou personally i hate tl notes better rework it  trip is the better translator but arunaru is still faster  aru translates 800 lines a day tripli does a bit more than that
  aru translates 800 lines a day tripli does a bit more than that  where are you getting these numbers also tone works line counts are bloated as fuck one translated line can count as 5 in their script
  based mg shill implying that mg releases are better than the ones from the 3 companies listed
  mg releases are better no exceptions
  all of their ammolite titles are trash
  mml evenicle hapymaher and tsui yuri were all mediocre releases
  better as in what  no mistranslations wrong  typos and general lack of qa yup  patching reported errors in all their releases nope  regional pricing for poorfags fuck em  removing mosaics in all their releases for mosaic autists i dont think so  giving free reign to the translator to remove quirks like imouto moe and 3rd person speech or to rename the characters completely yeah thats our mg
  now i realize the second one might have sounded as if they were indeed better in the qa department theyre not
  unedited images and broken menus too
otusun has 2 kickstarters going on at the moment one is for less than a 1000 for a fandisc to the bell chimes for gold and the other is the sequel to neighbor that has a 10000 goal        
  this is gonna be a really funny thread come next friday i bet cant wait for it to be nothing but autistic screeching about how arunaru did x y and z with sukisuki
  people claim that they are consistently better than jast and sekai not perfect other than regional pricing and the choice between honorific and nonhonorific something sol press has done for one game  mg is consistently better than other companies though jast is about the same slow release schedule aside     while regional marketing makes sense from a market standpoint different regions have a different ideal pricepoint for vidya or other goods to max out profit i find the notion that poor regions deserve lower prices just because they are poorer entitled just go ahead and pirate the game if you cant afford it dont demand lower prices if you want it only for certain people and not for others
  and the choice between honorific and nonhonorific something sol press has done for one game  huh it was an option in both newton and sakura sakura im not sure about daresora
  it was in sakura sakura my bad then if sol press does it consistently then its perfectly fair to regard them above mg other than maybe occasional use of ks i dont think they have anything worth complaining about
  i dont know how they could be any better or worse its all the same people working for both
  management goes a long way was anyone particularly surprises that the worst sekai releases in the past two years were all directly managed by dovac     people can put out worse or better work depending on management especially so in this industry where many of the people involved are lazy young adults working parttime anyway not insulting anyone im a lazy young adult too
  those people still work for him and whether they admit it or not if youre going to put yourself in an environment full of shitty people who do shitty things and especially if youre apathetic to it its going to rub off on you
  they arent just apathetic to it they spent a very long time covering for and enabling dovacs worst habits especially doddler who would drop everything for all his other work to put out emergency patches every time sekai would fuck up a release
  you only get terrible versions of them both anyway either a machine translation literal version or a rewrite that replaced 10 of the script with the translators delusions    they should avoid both liberal and literal translations and just fucking make a translation that reads the same but in english
its december again /jp/    where are the angels
  they should avoid both liberal and literal translations  make a translation that reads the same but in english  i dont think you understand how translation works
  this is the absolute dumbest post ive ever seen and you should probably never give your opinion on this topic ever because you pretty clearly dont understand anything about it
  daddy i want this game to be funded   alright sweetie
  do not post again
  i find it funny that the highest pledge of the first one is double than the goal itself the second one could fail but considering that the prequels ks succeeded it has some chance despite it being hopelessly niche
  where are the angels    playing the bl game about shitting meat monsters
  thanks mr cartel translator please tell us how its impossible to make a nonliteral translation without ruining characters adding a shitton of swearing and putting in memefaggotry
  either a machine translation literal version  as for me by the use of airplane went towards the destination of tokyo
hows the new eushully title jops is it another kamige that we eops will never get to know
  another kamige  you are saying this as if eushully produced anything good after verita
  another kamige  eushully games are mostly trash
another kamige
  has some good girls but the gameplay is mediocre as fuck still the side characters are among the better casts theyve made in awhile    that being said its hardly a kamige id probably give it a 6 / 10 right now on the gameplay alone very few eushully games are actually worth anyones time though
  eushully hasnt improved in the past 5 years or so the last few titles have been a hybrid of past ones with questionable design choices  this time its ikusa megami zero with shared health bar for some reason because eushully was too lazy to balance their game with most monsters having some sort of aoe attack they also give you 3 healers to balance it out another thing that i dont like or which i find straight up pointless and annoying is the slave system you see your character is a slave and each time you leave a dungeon they take all the items you found in it unless you have special container for hp potions sp potions or seals with which you keep them you also can buy back the items which they took from you but i found it pointless and a waste of money just get some sr equipment and fuse all the trash items to it before you leave the dungeon and dont waste your money on seals  another annoying thing is the random enemy encounters you see enemies are visible on the map where they patrol certain areas but there are also out of nowhere random battles now add 13 random battles in a row with 45 enemies for each battle and it will get annoying pretty fast especially if just try to explore or run to the end of the map where they end up attacking you from behind they get to attack first during the battle and they all have aoe attacks dying isnt really painful or anything its just annoying since the only punishment is paying 10001500 credits on average and you can continue the fight unless its a boss battle it also may be one of the easiest eushully titles that i played so far due to the shared health bar    in the end its just another mediocre eushully title where they used most of the assets and ideas from their previous titles
  i think i get that for free by understanding how translation doesnt work
    isnt the main reason that they are still alive is because they have a gacha ero browser game or something
  same reason that nutaku is alive then
  to be fair nutaku has always been an ero gacha localization company first their foray into downloadable eroge was something that failed for them but it didnt really hurt their main business
  loe got some progress done on harachuchu
are there any proxy services which allow you to order r18 loli doujins i cant seem to find anything about this specifically but i dont really know how to look either

say what you like about zero it had good aesthetics
cant wait for twintail arc 
  arc doesnt exist in fateverse anymore so shes probably safe  more likely youll get twintail ciel or twintail nanaya
pipiru piru piru pipiru pi
is f/go worth getting into i played it for a bit after launch but didnt get gil so i got discouraged also the fact that youve gotta whale to get your favorite servants bothered me
  are slot machines worth getting into
gunner mashu will kill ort
  say what you like about zero    does zero deserve the hate it gets
  implying nasu isnt going to introduce a schoolgirl arc that is a perfectly normal human and turns into a demiservant for no reason    anon please
  i dont think so i think it gets hate for attracting a tonne of secondaries but otherwise its a fantastic entry in the franchise
  if you want to get into it for the writing you have to read through 5 chapters of absolute pure garbag before you get to anything that could actually be considered decent or good    then the quality drops massively again for a long time and recently started picking itself up a bit again    so not really in fact im pretty sure all the franchise rape you will uncover by playing through the game will greatly overshadow any enjoyment you might get out of it
i cried
  is the manga different at all from the novel in terms of story just more background info
  i really really dont want ort to be wasted on that trash they seem to be leaning in that direction and to be fair at least using barrel replica to kill it wouldnt cause major changes in power level or shitposting since black barrel already killed a type  but still though on principle itd feel awful to waste more cool things on fgo
  tl says its carbon copy of novel but sasaki occasionally add details
  oh i totally forgot it was sasaki i should check it out the novel was alright
  you say this as if this franchise has a future outside of fgo
ciel dry turds
  manga still incomplete i warned you
  not fate but theres always hope orttan could be used in something good instead of getting killed off by servants and their blank selfinsert master  hell i wouldve rather jester went back to his initial goal in sf and they dealt with ort there      im quite used to that with manga at least tsuki no sango is already a finished story
  i find it highly unlikely that we will ever get something that is not fate again    i mean in theory tsukihime remake and mahoyo 2 should both be in development but man are they really how long was tsukihime 2 in development for before they offically threw it in the dumpster did they ever has it actually been finished for 15 years and is releasing next week
  tsukihime 2 was never a thing just a bunch of loose concepts some of which got repurposed while others are still in cold storage
  looks like new chapter will be in next month
i used to have a bunch of tamamo sound files you could use as sound effects for windows i cant remember where i got it from though
  fate/stay night réalta nua  so this is the definitive f/sn version i care nothing of mollusk sex scenes and have been it putting off for more than 10 years now
  thats it enjoy yourself anon
  alright will report back in 10 more years
  typemoon in general doesnt really deserve the hate it gets but its popular so it has to deal things arent allowed to be average and popular on the internet after all
  typemoon as it is certainly deserves hate dumb lipfag  in fact the more they put all their eggs in the mobage basket the more they deserve to get shit on
  see i dont agree yes the story they currently tell is through a trashy mobage but the story itself is only serviceable with as many good sides and bad sides as pretty much everything else nasu has ever done you dont even have to play the mobage to experience it since its all on youtube nowadays  but again youre not allowed to be average and popular so even though it really is just average it has to be treated as terrible because its popular
  sefar is pretty much as bad if not worse than anything that has been written in fgo  all of this shit is so far removed from what got me invested into the franchise that im dumbfounded
  eh i found it very interesting working a simple eerie cave painting into a whole legacy of ancient history  making it attila the hun just gets a shrug from me but nothing else about it is that aberrant to my sensibilities  its possible that while you were getting invested you were willfully ignoring the parts of the setting that were like that from the start
  like the other anon said the stories nasu has written in the past 3 years are super different from what made him interesting in the first place atmospheric settings small and fleshed out casts of characters strange protagonists all of those are gone in nasus recent work replaced with far more conventional and generic versions of those elements  its not just that mobage is an awful awful medium to tell a story or the inconsistent writers the very basis of fgo and extella sucks compared to nasus good stuff
  im still not agreeing the setting is still pretty much atmospheric to me death is everywhere and inevitable but we persevere regardless for the sake of good times is still the prevailing theme from kara no kyoukai all the way to f/gos second act  strange protagonists what exactly is strange about japanese everyman tohno shiki yes he has a cool killing power but thats not his personality his personality was always flat and boring ryougi shiki had even less personality i just dont get it shirou was interesting but also about 30 of fate/stay nights total text was dedicated to developing shirous personality and character and not every story can be that rich so he cant really be marked as the standard either do you think aoko was that strange  ensemble casts do tend to individuals not getting as much development time so i understand that much i guess but nasu seems like hes been putting in a lot more work on his characters as f/go goes on with scenes getting longer and characters having more of their story told
  what exactly is strange about japanese everyman tohno shiki yes he has a cool killing power but thats not his personality his personality was always flat and boring ryougi shiki had even less personality  wew
  its not about the storys themes fgo does not manage to build a sense of familiarity in the same way that you get from the various locations in fuyuki or misaki due to its episodic structure the only place that comes close is chaldea itself which i think is awful all the recent fanart of the protag finding the replica of chaldea at the wandering sea is fucking cringeworthy when i look at an image of fsn or tsukihime with that urban fantasy look it makes me go this is typemoon fgos various settings just make me think this is a shitty gacha game made to show off servants no mystery or mystique to it  same thing for servants even the ones that the story spends most time are utter failures compared to nasus old character writing imo i legit dont like any fgo original besides dr roman  but hey if youre the kind of person who did not find the shikis or aoko to be interesting protagonists especially compared to the garbage blank selfinserts that have prevailed in recent years then we were on different planets to begin with this discussion wont go anywhere
the extra series and fgo are awful because both protags are garbage self inserts  the same franchise that brought you shiki shirou and aoko now brings you a dude who can only communicate through dialog choices that are just his sentence split up in 2 parts
  hakuno has just as much personality as shiki ever did
ryougi shiki was a protosaber
  fuck the king
case files anime
  might also be clock tower 2015 would appreciate the aozaki series in anime
  sisters
with that said chances are high for this to just be another awful go trash plot dump by nasu like moonlight/lostroom
kek urobuchi is writing lb3  may be the first halfway decent main story chapter for goshit
  why did you create a new thread when the previous one didnt even reach bump levels nor get archived  
  he was an idiot for making one but if people stopped bumping the previous one already to complain about it it wouldve been dead days ago
  her sword is too small
lets see whom and what /tmg/ likes  
  im iffy about that
  how so anon  if its clock tower its a story that already exists anyway
  i just dont feel comfortable about why it would be made though  as long as they keep it to the story it might be okay but who knows the underlying purpose
  to make money what else is there
  im more worried about the creative butchering aspect  nothing i truly care about has been ruined by go just ignored because go is everything
  but clock tower 2015 already exists anon i dont think theyd change it since nasu usually supervises this new years stuff  it sucks that ct2015 is in its entirety dedicated to fgo but at least it shows the scenario where you dont have to worry about go shit existing in that universe    but like i said unfortunately its probably gonna be some crypterfocused story that teases more lostbelt shit and nothing else maybe a waver cameo
  i know ct15 exists i just dont trust the adaptation it having very special characters is what is making me defensive i think the short story is fine and yet somehow it is still untranslated    even with as much popularity as we have today summaries are all we can expect
  but at least it shows the scenario where you dont have to worry about go shit existing in that universe  it is the best go related work for that reason it shows what happens in what id consider the main timeline which seems like a sn continuation    but it is hard to say
  i agree actually my headcanon until proven otherwise is that lev killing himself is what happens for all the universes of stuff i actually care about
was kotomine kirei a good guy deep down
  no he was fundamentally rotten from birth  i think thats the point anon
  no zero is fantastic its just the source for a lot of secondaries since it was the highest quality animu available on netflix for a long time i know like 20 different normies who know nothing about typemoon but absolutely love zero because it showed up in their netflix recs one day
  it might end up that go really avoids impacting the rest of the established works and exists for worldbuilding infodumps  once again headcanon    so basically everything that isnt go has no connection to it within their timeline and go is truly a fanservice moneymaker for better projects as it always shouldve been
i wish tm would do more with the nonfate properties i just watched knk for the first time the other day and it made me realize how cool the magic system and shit is when its not attached to a dumb battle royale with historical waifus
i wanna be ciels personal toilet
  im glad you see that now anon knk really is a mix of everything that makes tm cool and unique to me the urban fantasy setting with a hint of horror/mystery goes perfectly with nasus writing  part 5 in particular also shows how well magi fit into it with their individual goals and infighting
  are the lns worth reading before you watch the movies
  what about his daughter
  before you watch them not really other than oblivion recording for the most part the movies are superior in every way  the novels are worth it if you become a big fan and wanna know a few small details that didnt make it to the anime      shes a bit messed up but not quite the same
  im curious what would make you even start to think that im hard pressed to think of any morally righteous things qualities to his character
  he tried
please let new years be the start of a case files adaptation that runs throughout the year and covers the whole thing  please let the remake come out in 2020 on the 20th anniversary of the original with an announcement soonish    thatd make the coming year of fgo so much more bearable than the last 3
i want to lick her abs   why does takeuchi never draw abs
  hes prolife
  its an anime special anon dont count on it
  its not confirmed wether its a oneoff first episode of emiya gohan aired on new years last year and it continued  im not counting on it but theres a precedent and studio troyca doesnt have anything else announced
  please let new years be the start of a case files adaptation that runs throughout the year and covers the whole thing  not entirely unlikely  please let the remake come out in 2020 on the 20th anniversary of the original with an announcement soonish  entirely unlikely    honestly just give up on the remake already its not happening man the sooner you move on the easier it gets
  arc doesnt exist in fateverse anymore    why not
  please let new years be the start of a case files adaptation that runs throughout the year and covers the whole thing    whats the verdict on the casebook of lord elmelloi ⅱ
  breddy gud lots of magical intrigue and gratuitous amounts of best girl
  if you like collecting waifus sure
  you cant just move on from it when theres nothing else to really look forward to from typemoon  case files was the one thing in the past few years that felt more in line with the good aspects of tm and while an anime of it would be great while waiting for the remake its not a proper main project from nasu thatd keep me fully invested tm needs to get a good main thing already fgo trash was never fit to be that
i just finished lb3     the crypter girl is actually a over 2000 years old true ancestor    marisbury personally recruited her into chaldea because at first he wasnt sure if it was actually possible for humans to survive rayshifting  when he recruited her he called her one of the few remaining moon flowers    at the end she gets reckt and is told to stop being so emo and simply wish herself into becoming a servant    pickup banner next week probably already had an ingame bossfight     yikes
  i just want a quality tsukihime remake and the rest of mahoyo then i can die a happy man
  while i think this is a retarded way to bring up true ancestors again i guess thats an interesting detail on why she was brought in as a master in the first place thanks anon
  pic related
  thats wrong though  enjoying the suffering of others doesnt make you sinful  it was his choice to indulge those desires in sinful ways that made him evil
  whats a non sinful way to indulge those desires
apologize right now
  stop triggering her anon its obnoxious and you both just love the attention    though since you brought up retarded edrama    good lord i hate this faggot wants to be seen positively by the whole fanbase would happily gobble any turd with tm written on it
fgo wouldnt be so bad if all this lostbelt garbage ended with the fgo timeline getting trashcanned    but we all know they are already thinking about part 3
  boy would that give me satisfaction ive thought of so many ways fgo could get shit on and they could actually pull that off well storywise  unfortunately as you said they need to keep some degree of status quo and keep it going for as many years as people are willing to spend money on it
  the whole point about the f/go timeline is that it walks the razors edge between safe timelocked universe and lostbelt fuckcity which is why your job is to keep it from tipping over  if you want it to get wrecked then get slain by a boss and dont restart there you got a bad end sit and pat yourself on the back like all the mind of steel fags
its nasus birthday /tmg/  say something not completely awful about him
  breaking the pride of sinners to lead them to repentance  torturing heretics  training executors to resist physical and psychological abuse  there are plenty of ways he can uniquely serve god and indulge his urges  of course he cant go all out for pleasure but neither can anyone else     or dentistry  
  dentistry  not sinful
  the reason he didnt do that is probably because no matter how much it looks like hes doing a service kotomine would know hes just doing it for himself that requires either some cognitive dissonance or just not caring about being unauthentic to ones self so i cant see kotomine going for it
huh final emiya gohan will be at illyas castle  berserker gets to appear at least which is cool
  final emiya gohan  fuck i am going to miss that show
  nasu has inspired me to improve my writing through both the good and the bad aspects of his work
  bad aspects  there are none
  there are plenty of bad aspects to his work he relies heavily on exposition dumps and his writing style is obtuse as all hell even compared to other japanese authors    his strongest points are worldbuilding and characterization
  kek      i dont think theres official confirmation that this is the last but it seems logical to me for it to last 1 full year dont know how much more content the manga has either
i want to have sex with type mercury
  what part of the writing style problems is blame on translation
  not that guy but i am currently reading knk in japanese and at times i do find it a bit obtuse that being said it could just be my lack of skill at fault here overall i think it is well done
  japanese literature reviewers ripped nasu a new one for his pretentious writing in knk back in the day
  i did find an overlooking view to be a bit pretentious but a study in murder 1 and remaining sense of pain are a lot more grounded
  ill take pretentious over most of the trash that passes for light novels any day
fate/stay night and ataraxia  all tsukihime games  knk  mahoyo  fate spinoffs  shit  f/go
rip
  you know if a lostbelt wins theyll replace everyone its panhistory which is at stake you fucking retard    your shirou seibas rins etc would be no more
  do fate spinoffs
  the entire concept of fgos timeline being so important is infuriating that anon just wants to see it get deservedly shit on which is a sentiment i agree with
  okay
  its not that fgo timeline is important its that its the one where shit happens because theres an organization active that can stop this timeline and history invasion from a narrative pov to counter it    like how extella has that alien shit thats tossed aside in other timelines because theres a plot device to deal with it even though its not as dangerous as the timeline shit in general if goetia won the entire planet would have been replaced with his perfect deathless world from the genesis this isnt just for fgo but every single one since they are all sharing the same planet if a lostbelt win theyll revise history and replace it with the one of the lostbelt which in turn affects everyone because they drink from panhistory although this threat level is lesser than goetias so far as its just affecting mostly ad history its still going to retcon all fsn for example i suspect the alien god plan is bigger than that like goetias hes using the lostbelts as a means for an end but the point isnt that a timeline is in danger but all panhistory is
  i really couldnt give less of a shit its not like what timelines get prunned or relevancy to the lore matter at all for any works quality go being such a large scale conflict with huge ramifications has alway been obnoxious more than anything its just a ploy to get lorefags on board with it while ignoring the small scale that contributed to previous tm works
  cute i love rin
the fact that ciel has a mouth implies that she has to eat therefore defecate
  i just want a quality tsukihime remake and the rest of mahoyo then i can die a happy man  then youll die a sad and bitter man
  yeah thats the most likely outcome
actually having multiverses as part of the narrative has destroyed fate
  fgo timeline should by all accounts be a fucking lostbelt    winning the fuyuki war by summoning solomon and then using it to get a fuckton of founds to build a highly advanced base that can fucking rayshift had and will continue to have major negativ impact on the whole timeline and will continue to do so unless they stop making money
  back in my day each timeline shown in the nasuverse kept to themselves  it is hard to argue against gos scenario affecting all other similar timelines as being a sincere choice and not so lorefags will have to care
  cough let me rewrite that  it is hard to argue that gos scenario is genuine and not so oldfags will have to care about the implications as appeasement
  they just brought back sion only to have her have literally 2 sentences worth of dialogue in lb3 and then they also pulled true ancestors back out of the closet for seemingly no real reason besides setting up a tsukihime crossover  pretty sure all arguments one could make for fgo continue to die with every new chapter released
  it is so blatant that the intent is for go to absorb literally everything to keep people satisfied which is actually a massive insult
humans are the super duper bestest race ever  humans are so amazing they became the dominant species of earth and made the gods fuck off  humans are so cool that theres a metaphysical force that exists outside of even time dedicated to recording the greatest specimens of humanity   humans are so fucking great that despite being so good theyre also so bad that just by existing eldritch antihuman abominations can come to but its fine because humans are destined to overcome them  humans are so super duper the best that when things go to hell for humans the entire universe decides to shut down because a bloo bloo bloo poor humans arent prospering on this time whats this there was a gorillion of other nonhuman lives and civilizations in the universe who cares only humans matter  humans are so amazing that they will manage to outgrow their planet and reach beyond the stars also if their planet dies and wants them to fuck off and gets the other planets to to make them fuckoff humans go and fuck up the shit of the other planets because theyre able to thrive on a dead world and become stronger than the ultimate ones from other planets  whats this i used to write something where humans were not top dogs tsukiwhat dont remember it
  it makes more money this way 
  remember when the strongest nonhuman was reduced to a human cumdump
  just like capeshit
  nasu said so
  i didnt mind it at all then but theres no doubt that it led to a lot of cancer over the years
  aside from arc all of the characters in tsuki were either human or exhuman not to mention the fact that ciel was in it and could wipe the floor with nearly all of them
  fuck i am going to miss that show    you know its a manga right
    nasu made tsukihime when he was 25 whats your excuse
  this is just a guess but he might mean he wil miss the animated adaptation of that manga rather than the manga itself or the series as a whole
  cant they just make more episodes of carnival phantasm and emiya gohan
  is there any type moon work that deals with humans traveling into space and colonizing planets not just aliens vising earth or whatever but about the kind of weird ass shit that would be on other living planets in the type moon style universe
  hmm
  humans have always been top dogs in tmshit though nasus earliest works are all about humans who despite being prretty weak actually come out on top and make a difference in the world
  yup thats some pretty awful artwork as per usual from takeuchi
nasu sure likes to jerk himself off doesnt he
  to make fun of your own writing is to jerk yourself off
  its sarcasm you dense speedreader
  as if id ever want a calendar with that much go shit on it  they couldve at least used the one good arc remake pic over that one even if that ones a reference to the original
does a doujin eroge really need 121 tracks
  know nothing about typemoon but absolutely love zero  how much did they understand
  just the basics the basic mechanics of the magic system are pretty easy to infer just by watching zero and normies seem to really enjoy the rivalry between kiritisugu and kirei
  likely not much
the lancer class is a class that consists of people who are famous for using lances and spears  a lance is a weapon meant to use when on horseback  yet lancers almost never possess the riding skill    what did nasu mean by this
  i watched fate/zero with my brother i had to explain stuff from time to time but the only thing that he didnt really understand is the angry manjew stuff at the end he got the rest just fine and enjoyed it very much he really likes rider for some reason
  lancers with a riding skill would basically btfo every other class in the grail war like they did historically the only thing that might be more op is an archer with riding skills
  if you are famous for using a lance on horseback youre a rider
  he really likes rider for some reason  hes gay
  people can be summoned under different classes theres no reason for you to use a lance or a spear if youre not on horseback or if youre not in a formation with other men on a related note how cool would it be to get a hoplite type servant like a spartan or something
  im actually a little worried he called medusa an ugly hag when we were watching ubw and he refused to watch all the cute girl anime i tried to show him he also didnt want to watch madoka he likes touching me for no reason a hug or just squeezing my arm whenever he sees me im a boy btw
  is he your oniisan or your otouto
  otouto hes 16 its just a phase rright
  if he liked archer hes straight
  he said that archer was ok
    emiya archer or gil archer
  i assumed he means garcher
  soon maybe if you take into account that god emperor of the world qin developed space travel technology around 200 years before panhistory it means were just a few centuries behind but well get there
  none of that shit matters to panhistory who even gives a fuck about fuyuki wars in human history it has no impact and chaldea development is a secret    that solomon took the king of magecraft system from the world though thats a little more game changer but we dont know if this isnt supposed to be ok or not for human history advancement
  tsuki no sango is about an astronaut going to visit a woman on the moon and so much mpre
  the true ancestors arent a crossover its just expanding the lore of the world building i suspect all other crypters arent human either scandinavia in particular is called the oldest of them has a fake name and nobody knows where is he from and he was born in the wrong era first of they got completely extinct so hinakos existence marks a departure of tsukihime and fate  not that i mind because i really liked her story as hinako and consort yu
  ta only went extinct in tsukihime never in fate    scandinavia and beryl are suspicious but id be surprised if kirsch or daybit are not humans
  thats what i said true ancestors being in fate although its confirmed their numbers are small and they are in hiding because of the church is to show another difference with tsukihime    beryl already got called a filthy werewolf so its obvious hes not human daybit is mysterious and feels like a hole in the world kirsch may have divine blood somewhere he did kind of defeated divine spirits and took over his lostbelt
  remember when arc murdered that go shitter in every tsukihime timeline after a little whiff of road blood
  arc is the most powerful ta after all so its to be expected that she would annihilate someone whos strongest attack is blood rain
  i know true ancestors arent a crossover my friend but if you seriously think he isnt bringing all of this shit back now after all these years to set up how big of a deal arc is when he makes up some fucking reason to put her in i dont know what to tell you
  how big of a deal arc is  she will become a 5 star card and the ae portion of her personality will fall in love with the fgo protagonist and join his harem
  did you know standing in the rain gets you wet
i kind of want to write a fanfic venting out my frustrations with fgo about how evil gacha is and how fighting for the sake of the world would be hell something that isnt generic waifu simulator this shit with sion is driving me up the wall and  being a realistic possibility makes me lose all my will to live
  sion isnt even a love interest not sure what bothers you about her    ae falling for guda is guaranteed though  same happened with void shiki
  does assassin shiki even mention kokutou even once    shes pulled out of knk 5 so youd think she would be upset at being stuck in a different fucking universe
  things are already bad enough with void shiki falling for guda and im just not a fan with what there doing with sion
  yes thats what i meant
  i wanna teach anons bro the wonders of bl
  have you read  
  thats what inspired me to do my own take on it its not an original idea on it i admit but i feel i can do my own take on taking a piss out of fgo
  if you are going to do it differently go for it anon
  yeah i already have a plan in mind granted the concept is kind of lifted from another vn and even then once i get into the actual meat of the story itll be completely different from the vn in question that said im going to be playing the long game before i actually get into the whole ripping apart fgo thing its probably going to seem like any generic slice of life au for a few chapters im putting more effort than i should to make everything seem soundly plausible in the nasuverse
  so basically a doki doki literature club style deconstruction
   its actually a lot closer to muv luv except after the initial universe jump there are no repeating timelines but on principal thats not too different from doki doki a fun high school life that suddenly takes a much darker turn  
stop translating mahoyo to read lb3  feel a sudden urge to spend my time on a better franchise    mhhhhh
  just pretend lb 3 doesnt exist
  mfw years of this shit and then i play muramasa
  explain
    im not sure which way this is going
   every chapter of the common route the game kills off the heroine you have the most score with    having a score that would lead to you achieving a harem end in a normal vn  leads to you achieving a bad end where fucking everyone that could possibly move the story along is dead 
  wow we have a high level jop anon here      i regret mousing over that first line with a spoiler i still hope to read muramasa one day
  translating mahoyo  doubt
  schrödingers mahoyo
leaflet
  
i want rin to hurt me
lol what a beta 
  i love big tiddy akiha
  this even if my heart prefer tsukihime i still think fate is better overall depsite having more problem than tsukihime
  so where are your ratings anon
if youve read the vns is it worth watching any of the fate anime other than zero
  heavens feel is a good adaptation and ufotables ubw is alright too
  i thoroughly enjoyed the ubw tv series never had so much fun following a weekly anime rewatching each ep several times before the next one came out  so yes i recommend ubw and the ongoing hf films the background art alone makes them worth it
  ufotables adaptations are always worth watching just for the budget deens adaptation is pretty fun to watch just for how bad it is
  wait let me fix that
  i doubt it for the past 4 years everyone has been flipping burgers any time something vaguely connected to tsuki gets referenced and saying remake soon so yeah ill remain skeptical  it would probably be dogshit that appeals to gofags anyway since theyre all nasu cares about
oh god
  as expected of my wife she looks good in everything
  well artie you were born on the purple as they used to say
  even in indian dresses
matoi sakura more like futoi sakura fatso
  but her name is matou not matoi
  fat
  shitty lolicon
  matou sakuras big fat satou makuras
  tsukihime has that perfect bleak urban atmosphere to it that fate doesnt always have i think fate/stay night is better overall as well but tsukhime is still special to me
  fate got away from trying to tell dark urban fantasy stories and got too wrapped up in trying to tell terrible stories about historical figures but hey at least it got the japs interested in western history so it cant be all that bad
new girl this chapter of grand orders main story turns out to be a true ancestor    could the release of you know what be closer than we feared
  fate/stay night is still good because all the fluff about mythological/historical gives it a grander scale and scope while still being grounded firmly on the characters the whole lol servants for everything shit came later
  it really is nice it also gives the story the advantage of having readymade well written characters because nasus essentially just putting his twist on the most enduring stories in world history knowing that caster is medea and knowing her story makes me sympathise with her more than i ever would with an original character given the amount of screentime she was allotted
  youre only a few days late to the party  tas in fate isnt a huge deal das are the ones which cannot exist in fate type timelines
  never had so much fun following a weekly anime    why was there so much hate for ubw
  people got mad anytime it differed from the vn im not one that always worships the liberties ufo takes and i think theyve made plenty mistakes however as a whole i thought it was really well done the epilogue scene at the end was also excellent
  im not one that always worships the liberties ufo takes and i think theyve made plenty mistakes    were they not nasus decision
  yeah i believe nasu worked pretty closely with them on ubw that hasnt always been a good thing though see last encore
  sugar pillows
  i heavily dislike all the music choices they made  forcing in fucking aimer songs at every possible climax being the worst one
  to be fair last stardust is a very good song
  da exists daa dont
  wasnt 100 on that i guess
i want to read tsukihime so i downloaded it from the op but does it require me to buy the original japanese one like the readme said
    also to be fair fates music is garbage in the original so it was accurate to the spirit of the original in that sense
  does realta nua change the music much it was pretty good there
  but does it require me to buy the original japanese one like the readme said    no
  liberties ufo takes    what liberties did ufo take with ubw havent seen it
  so i dont have to install anything else and just running the exe is enough my antivirus blocked it so i thought something was wrong
why is the fate/stay night translation so awkwardly written
  esl
  the cutest breasts
    rakkyo did bleak urban fantasy better  tsuki is pretty bland gruel propped up by the fact it was something new and also the entry vn for earlymid 00s wotas    sn is more tightly written rakkyo is more fiercely introspective and original tsuki is an attempt at making money hand over fist which makes it funny when people hold it up as the antithesis of go
emiyasan 12 is out
dumping some twitter art ive accumulated
    wasnt the founder of mirror moon a japanese speaker for whom it was a way to improve his english translation skills
    heeey we get another episode after all theyre going for the full 1 year cycle
she sees your dick
this was a fucking a moment
  mfw riders seiyuu is a youtube lets player that gets 1k views and has a full playthrough of bloodborne
  yeah shes a cool neesan  its funny to hear her in anime and vns after you know her more casual side
  well considering her frame of reference
if the new years project is indeed case files i wonder how much itd cover the first book isnt too meaty but 1 hour wouldnt be enough to introduce all the characters properly and get through it its also got that really great moment of waver lamenting his uselessness and luvia in general is good  if they are adapting case files 1 hope its movie length and that they tackle all the other volumes in a similar way
  yeah its fucking shitty but it really is going to happen      the final line in the lostbelt pv so sounds like ryouka too
  what the fuck  is there any solid speculation as to who that might be cause it does kinda sound like her
  i swear ive seen barely any discussion around it too its odd ive seen the odd its void shiki because of the nature of what she says but that does not have maayas recognisable sound sounds like a serious arc/archetype for sure
  its 100 not maaya it could definitely be arc doing the archetype voice  its gonna be the worst if they keep shoving in tsukihime stuff in fgo trash without revealing anything about the actual remake i sincerely hope nasu has been doing it because hes been inspired by tsukihime lore while writing the remake and not to make up for it
  if our princess gets released in a collab event and not integrated into the story then id say there exists some possibility of that happening however hilariously slim and optimistic that is  with the way its looking like hes making grand order as the end all and everything left revolving tsukihime really will just be shoehorned into the main story    pic related of my wip of arcs reaction to the current state of affairs
  thats absolutely adorable great job anon
  remake isnt happening  they have had over 10 years to produce this shit look at how fast nasu writes all the extraverse shit  him digging up all these tsukihime relations is a giant fucking red flag
  it could be either a red flag or the opposite i cant say for sure i think its believable enough that goshit simply diverted all their attention for a few years to a degree that he didnt expect   its definitely happening at some point they still talk about it and even included a remake promo image in the new calendar i just hope its soon rather than everything nonfate becoming a part of go for the next few years the last 3 have been painful enough
  from what i can remember they cut a lot of shirous inner monologue stuff im pretty sure the archer vs shirou fight was a bit different as well but i cant remember the details
  tsuki is an attempt at making money hand over fist which makes it funny when people hold it up as the antithesis of go  what if youre trying to say that tsuki was somehow a cash grab attempt you are completely retarded it was literally a noname doujin game that got lucky
  they cut a lot of shirous inner monologue stuff  kind if necessary considering its an anime not an audio cd of shirous mind
  well certainly but its quite a different experience
  its necessary but it makes shirous mindset and reasoning a lot less clear and makes him look like a retard
  trace on  brain off
  even when you understand his mindset he still looks like a retard i cant count the amount of times he rushed into a situation without thinking about it only to have to be bailed out by someone else
  he really doesnt give a shit about his own life though
  take that back fate has an excellent soundtrack
  thanks anon
  hard to disagree
  disagree with what i dont think she warrants more popularity than she has
  i think she does she has a memorable design and personality
  i think her character is a bit flat and her design is one of the worse ones in fsn shes certainly not waifubait
  how can we make shirou love himself
  he needs the help of an educated woman
  i want sakura to help me out
  shed be happy to help
  its the insecure anon who thinks massage is sexual again
  a fullbody massage is erotic on some level would you want your dad or your granny to give you a fullbody massage anon im not saying that its the same thing as having actual sex but there is definitely an element of eroticism to it as for the filename i just named it that because itd be easy to remember sakura is probably my favourite of the three heroines or a close second behind saber i have files that mock all the girls except saber who doesnt have anything thats as easy to mock as wormslut or old men
what are the biggest asspulls in tm  for me its caliburn killing berserker in the fate route
  i agree i also dont understand how shirou killed berserker in hf he projected the stone axe and that somehow killed the strongest servant
  yeaah the fan headcanon was that being in a corrupted state made berserker lose his skin that protected from b rank attacks but its not entirely clear
  shirou copied berserkers noble phantasm i also dont think berserker had god hand since he was corrupted by the grail then
  caliburn taking like 5 lives at once or whatever it was never made any sense
  sabers futa cock
  not as much of a lowhanging fruit as worms or poorlyprotected orifices
theres a new boss in town
  crashing the gate
yumemi is my favorite 9th stage boss
gengetsus thread isnt even cold yet and shes already announced her presence and claimed the board
  give robot pls
yumemi gets very defensive when people ask questions during her seminar talks
hello future renko
i want yumemi to teach me basic quantum entanglement principles
i wonder if yumemi teaches sex  ed
  take your clothes back on you old hag
  i want yumemi to teach me nonrelativistic scattering theory
  rude shes only 18
will another pc98 character ever appear in the new touhou games
  would yukarin be conflicted over the fact that shed either have to refer to her as yumemisenpai or admit that she isnt actually 17 but an old hag
has yumemi ever shown up in a mangaeven as a background character
  nope i do not think any pc98 exclusive character has made a cameo in a touhou manga
what is their relationship like
  best girl gets a thread  /jp/ is saved
  the thought that there are people who are patrician enough to consider yumemi as best girl on /jp/ right now is both surprising and delightful
  ill show you whos boss of this town
  fuck you
    incredible taste
this is ideal yumemi body you may not like it but this is what best girl looks like
pc98 is for autists
  if you dont like autism get out of the autismboard
ass
  ass
yumemi is my wife  i am the first on jeepee to post this thus my claim is more valid than anyone else forever
  you faggots always say the same but whenever there is a tohosort thread there is only one autist that consistently rates yumemi
  i havent sorted in a long time but she is pretty high on mine
the probability space hypervessel is without argument conceptually the absolute coolest location in the series history
  yumemi has the cutest ass in the whole podd
  not a bad sort

love me imagedumps and generals this is the tru jay
there sure seems to be a lot of pictures with yumemi and the aki sisters i wonder whys that
  popularity poll placing being part of an aki sandwich is a meme
  makes sense since she always seems to be sandwiched between the two in these this one on the other hand makes me sad
  thanks to yumemi i managed to study hard
yumemi butt
  good work anon
  a date with yumemi
i wonder if well get another aki sandwich next time
this inactivity in her thread makes her sad
  she seems to be nervous while doing pocky what for
  the real question is with whom and the answer is with her girlfriend
i want yumemi and rikako to make fun of me for not being as good in physics as them
autumn is over and winter is here time to put these away
  rikako  good at anything  she is only good by gensokyo standards  everything she knows is from a single book yumemi gave her
  dont bully the yumemi gf
cute

imagine manhandling that tiny body
  yumemi is not for imagineing

  i came across this video a while back  and i was really interested as well as surprised when i heard calls in this style i was always under the assumption calls to this extent werent really done until the early 2000s with the rise of hp i am very familiar with modern idol calls particularly the style you would find at a chika idol live or a 48g live was it mostly lyric calls and name calls back then how did wota learn and share calls back then without the internet calls nowadays are very structured to the point where you can improvise off instinct and be correct in most cases it doesnt seem like it was as much like that back then i am very curious and interested to learn about idol culture and wotagei of the past are there any videos articles or any info on this kind of thing

          what are these pictures of
  yankii culture  however i actually just realized those arent from the showa era but the style is essentially the same as it was in the 80s     these ones are actually from the time period
  is this like bōsōzoku gang stuff
  yes biker gangs are definitely apart of it
akinas voice is so heavenly even when shes just talking        i wonder what shes up to these days
what if i told you the craters on the moon werent created by 14 billion yearold space debris but rather the lunarian mortars  the lunarian capital is known far and wide for being superior to earth in almost every way though being a few hundred thousand miles/kilometers away and led by two retards  despite the ancient age of the earth and moon surely one would think they would be untouched in an almost orderly solar system but no not only has the moon been defiled but it has been a grave yard for nearly the entire lunarian army  at this point people will ask how or why and expect to get a full run down of the thing from the natives themselves but no they wont not only are the common cute little lunarian bunny citizens so uninformed to the point of retardation but they are also lazy despite their constant slaveworking by the watatsuki sisters  the only one who could have told the story is currently in gensokyo and goes by the name reisen udongein inaba  there is no way youll ever get an answer from her let alone find and acquire her assistance since leaving her allies to die when she escaped in the middle of the massacre to this day she still suffers from ptsd    starting from the beginning there was once a time when all native earthlings lived on earth and all was fine all until certain events took place and a not so small group of people decided the earth was becoming too impure so they came together to devise a plan to go elsewhere and as we know they went to the moon and dubbed themselves lunarians  nobody knows what happened between that time and now but we do know of the recent events that have taken place like a certain invasion as they call it that happened from 1969  1972 which marked the beginning of 6 invasions which took place all we know is that two humans yes two /humans/ decided to go and plant a flag on the moon a flag with 50 stars and 13 stripes held up on a pole in the vast emptiness that is the surface of the moon and dark empty sky that is space one could see this as claiming unmarked and unowned territory and they would be right however they were met with unfriendly forces upon their arrival  the unfriendly denizens of the moon looked more like humanized rabbits and at a glance would be seen as small cute and harmless until you saw they were carrying weapons and charging right at you and the flag like a bunch of savages for rather cute creatures they were rather barbaric  after planting the flag on the moon the humans appeared to be dancing and riding in some kind of contraption with four wheellike structures attached to it whilst going back to the same location every now and then probably taking pictures or something  after seeing something like that surely the head lunarians would think twice before attacking a possibly more advanced and possibly unknown species but no they went on and attacked like a bunch of fucking retards and with that is how it all began  we know not what the invasion was like but the royal cocksucking sisters call it the war leading us to our topic the first lunarian war in which they lost horrobly spoiler alert  the losses were grim  for them of course  the lunarians lost such a large chunk of their army that there arent many left yorihime watatsuki and that isnt the half of it the two /humans/ who invaded left with nothing but small blemishes thatll go away in a week or two as the lunar army lost thousands of their soldiers yes you heard me right thousands the entire lunarian army against two friendly humans two humans and they lost youre telling me that an entire force of the moon over six arrivals by the same two humans in four 4 years and multiple flags resulted the deaths of the majority of the lunarian army much so to a point where their forces are cripped to a point to where they can take on gensokyo just barely when four gensokian denizens put a stop to a goddess of hell a pure incarnation of hatred and a hell fairy who managed to fucking terrorize them to a point of having to invade gensokyo as well as total evacuation of the moon into another realm which they didnt even know they had entered on their own will as a trap and they couldnt even manage to so much as give two friendly non hostile humans a hard fight not to mention it took them fucking decades decades to get rid of an unguarded flag what you afraid the youkai in the shadows are gonna snatch your ankles if you get within 50 feet of the flag you scared youll turn to dust if you touch it go blind if you so much as glance at it grow the fuck up
whoa deja vu
i love it every time
another victory for america

  tewi i will fight anyone trying to say otherwise
  awww look at cute little reisen
  hat seiran is best bunny
lunarian war my ass thousands of casualties on your end and none to your enemies is so fucking abysmal they may as well just have commit genocide on your asses and be done with it fuck your eight million gods in shinto those sisters are absolutely incapable of anything militarily and socially  like holy shit those cocksucking royals can not run shit even if their life depended on it and they still have the nerve to call themselves superior to everyone release those bunnies and blow up the fucking moon and be over with it damn it
  go back to take a nap gaphag
  rude
  the lunar war is a lie my dude there were literally no casualties on either side

  proofs
  moonies are buried in mysterious places  the difficulty of finding the buried without tombstones those watabastards so cruel only proves his point  go ask yorihime or something shell probably lie about what happened though
pick your poison /jp/    
  this picture always reminds me of that doujin where the woman is having sex with her elementary school aged daughter and one day her daughter reads her note for parent/teacher day i love it when mommy comes to my room for sex i love having sex with mommy and the final scene is her mother packing and she asks why are we moving and her mother says we cant live here anymore

  i wonder if in retaliation the lunarians supported the soviet union later on
  i thought that was canon
  neither
  lunarian comedy gold
  is this a real photo why is it wavy when theres no air i know they had a vertical bar to keep it up but that doesnt explain the waves
  moon landing is fake
  the flag was folded during storage/transport so its all creased and rippled and it was attached to an l shaped pole so the bottom corner waved for a few moments after being set up
  wow at least make something thats real
  cyanide
  rip reisen
  a moment of silence please
  bunnies are worthless who cares
  i care
  youre worthless too
  when you slam a flagpole into the ground it vibrates because of the lack of gravity the flag does not fall down and the vibrating pole causes it to wave a bit
  rude

people of earth and all who are oppressed by the empire of penischoplandia  long have i waited all through the struggles against penischoplandias injustices i waited for them to come to their senses  but  that hope was betrayedby an act of barbarism that can  only  be called  an act of war  the continued chopping of infant penisis the symbolic act of penischoplandias hypocrisy  a penis chopping machine cloaked in the flag of a nation  i hereby declare our independence from penischoplandia but dont take this to mean the resurrection of your fallen penis as we will not turn back the hands of time  the new existence we go on to build shall be one broad enough to accept all peoples histories and ideologies to keep separate those incompatible with each other and to sanction off those who would exploit such a system to chop penis bully and lie where the choppers shall not reign over the chopped and this existence shall be calledthe epic state of based

  yes i am based konachan the anime who leads the mahou shoujo ningen ningyo ungaii who challenges the rule of penischoplandia the one who holds the entire world in her hand    people fear us or rally behind us as you see fit we are the mahou shoujo ningen ningyo ungaii we of the ms2nu stand with all those who have no penis to wield regardless of whether they be epic or based the epic liberation front cowardly took innocent based civilians hostage and then mercilessly tickled the remains of their chopped off penises it was a wanton and meaningless act therefore they have been punished just as former viceroy kyouko was punished for ordering the bullying of countless unarmed epics we cannot stand by and allow such cruelty to be carried out and so we made her pay for her actions i will not repudiate battle on a fair and level field but neither will i tolerate a onesided massacre of the weak by the also weak the only ones who should chop are those who are prepared to be chopped wherever choppers use their power to chop those who are powerless we shall appear again no matter how mighty how formidable our foe may be those of you in power fear us those of you without it rally behind us we the mahou shoujo ningen ningyo ungaii shall be the ones who stand in judgement of this penis chopping world
  zun bless this post
  it doesnt surprise me how konachan would be somewhere along the lines of a rampant shitposter or maybe she lurks
konata speaks of the choppers as if they have opened themselves up to be chopped as well a tit for tat for the chopping actions initiated by those serving the will to chop penis i say this is not the truest path for those that chop have already chopped themselves to chop those who have chosen to chop would serve only to strengthen the will of the penis chopper mindset i say to you that which must be chopped is not those who have succumbed to the will of the penis choppers that which must be chopped is the desire to chop penis at all
yes
  not even moon rabbits can beat the american white cock
  aniki sign do your reps  easy sign /jp/ mansion  you messed this up should be easy sign do your reps
      the actual reason is that the telescoping flag pole that the flag was planted with was not able to fully extend because of this the flag was not able to be fully taut in both the vertical and horizontal the top edge of the flag is being held up by a pole axis giving a creased wavy effect
  to further clarify it is not moving it just looks like it is if you were there in real life it would look just like it does in the photograph as if it was frozen in time
ahh but kagamiii  what desire would the penis choppers have to chop penis if they did not want to be chopped themselves  if i must though  i can think of another reason  and that reasonis food  for what could the reason be to cause the suffering of a penis with chop  but to feed the penis choppers the very same       i tell you  that it is for the want of suffering  and not by the want of the chop itself  that penises be slain  
      soon afterwards the lunarians supported the soviet union
  wait really
  yes really
id just like to interject for a moment what youre referring to as penis choppers are in fact lunarians or as ive recently taken to calling them lune plus cuckolds cuckolds are not a race unto themselves but rather another free component of a fully functioning lune system made useful by the lunar core greys saturnia utilities and vital freemasonry components comprising a full cs as defined by pozzd  many earth creatures run a modified version of lune system every day without even realizing it through a peculiar turn of events the version of lune which is widely used today is often called cuckolding and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the lune system developed by the lune project there really is cuckolding and these people are practicing it but it is just a part of the system that they use  cuckolding is the ideology the mindset in the system that allocates the moons resources to the other behavioral processes these earth creatures run the ideology is an essential part of a control system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete control system cuckolding is normally used in combination with the lune control system the whole system is basically lune with cuckolding added or lune/cuckolding all the socalled cuckold organizations are really organizations of lune/cuckolding
so does this make lunarians the weakest entities in the universe or does it make americans the strongest
  fixed
  so in shorter terms the moonies cant stop eating dick nice to know  good for them they cant be sluts like sanny because boys are nonexistent in the lunar capital
  america is the definition of strongest  moonies just fucked up and got their asses handed to them in a bloody fashion
  there a few classified doujins about it
  wait  so they werent they werent classified documents
i wanna see konata and kagamin team up and go to gensokyo
  how smart
  lewd rabbit
  im not ready to grow up mommy reisen lets snuggle again please
  no
  reisen posts on /jp/
  cute
  please
  what happens if america loses her manifest destiny how would americans and america deal with not being the destined leader of humanity    do americans turn inside out and become lovecraftian creatures
  nope  americans keep being american  nonanericans try to split true americans like lunarian propaganda but that wont work these are important times just like the unamerican heathens trying to split us moonies will not prosper here they sealed the deal when they first bore arms aganst the one who planted the flag  for creating difficulties for the involved the only way to make up is if the moonies bring a proposal and an apology for their actions
  americaisaboybytheway
  its a she
  proofs

  fag
  hi reisen
  because daikokuten is stronger than the watatsukis
  sourc3
  not even other rabbits likes moonies
  help your kin
  moonbunny genocide now
    so your freedom was imported
  no you fool  american freedom existed long before lady libertys conception literally a 100 year gap if you consider the creation of america to be 1776
  i dont particularly like seiran or ringo but leave them out of this anon theyre moonies but they are bad moonies   refer to the watatsukuso sisters their crimes are far more grave
a good moonbunny hide and dont help
  earth bunnies are more fertile than lunarians tewi singlehandedly carries the statistic though but no ones caught on yet
  bunnies helping bunnies moon bunnies helping moon bunnies or earth bunny helping moon bunnies confusing  i dont think the anon you replied to was reisen anon
  doesnt that imply incest for future generations of bunny
  no
  yes
  maybe
wake up people the moon landing was fake
  tewis genetically pure loving family
  tewi is against racemixing and wont let filthy humans anywhere near her cunny
  thats right tewi is an exclusive buttslut to humans
  i dont think the anon you replied to was reisen anon  here you go notreisen
  were way past 11 is she or isnt she
  she isnt
  rude
  why is risen being bullied
  reisen is a traitor
  they deserved what they got they shot first and paid the price first
      rabbits need to establish dominance over others  
  those are jackrabbits iirc  moonbun/whatever that is
  wouldnt you want a big instead of smol  
  who said i preferred tewi over reisen
  i see thanks
  i dont know
  im relieved
  why wouldnt you want the cheaper lighter and tighter onahole
  i hope she doesnt kill herself
  she shoot up rabbitschool and then left for earth  deep hidden lore
  truth
  coward
  a gentleman and a scholar did
  nice she got revenge
  lunarians still mad i see
i can still smell the pizza snakes
  what
  the youkai are not what they seem
  deepest lore
what was change doing while the lunarain forces were getting decimated
  laughing
  cuddling baby moonbunnies
ah yes the lunar wars so many dead for so little gain how yorihime watatsuki and her sister remain in command after the war will forever be a mystery
  nepotism in the form of constant sexual favors
  act like turbojews for millennia to keep humans in check  create demons to harass them  plant seeds that spark conflicts over the years to keep them occupied and prevent technological advancements  look away for just 70 fucking years and they start fucking racing to the moon  get caught completely off guard   have zero conventional warfare experience  lose almost your entire army to 2 humans in gimp suits  (((lunarians))) always give me a laugh
  how dreadful
  proxykilling people      who the fuck are you quoting you filthy disgusting crossboarder
  touhou lunar war lore    16 july 1969  7 december 1972    war starts when neil armstrong plants a flag on the moon which the lunarians took it as a de facto declaration of war     reisen udongein inaba was known to have fought at the beginning of the war all the way until her desertion in the waning hours of the war     the lunarians most triumph victory over the american invaders is when they damaged apollo 13 which was en route to the moon in 1970    the lunarians lost such a large chunk of their army that there arent many left yorihime watatsuki    american loses are moderate to heavy losses     both sides declare themselves the winner     well who won /jp/
  who are you quoting
  america sent two people and got two people back  cool story negative zero divided by one out of ten
  junko
  theres no american base on the moon so the lunarians
  the suprise attack on tranquility base was pure hell i never thought america would stoop so low and attack soldiers still asleep still i am surprised reisen survive given the that the army station there lost 2/3 of their soldiers
  wrong
  whats with the parenthesis
  scary
  pearl harbor
  what
  i doubt reisen did that it would be understandable that she left in the middle of the massacre but only a madman would think she planned this all from the beginning
  she was in on it
    clownpiece did when she arrived decades later and won our hearts with her silly little costume
  shes waifubait for the americans
  impossible
  nice
  /pol/ crossboarder
  dont bully
  terrifying
  theyre called lunarians
  moonies
  so in shorter terms the lunarians cant stop eating dick nice to know  good for them they cant be sluts like sanny because boys are nonexistent in the lunar capital  he said lunarians
  wrong
  lunatics
  lie
  moon bitches
  deceive
  incorrect
  reisen is getting the gulag
  gulag  as in sex dungeon
  no
  cute
  i agree but reisen udongein inaba is cuter
  i want to commit many war atrocities against these lunarians
  you shouldnt they have already made enough of a fool out of themselves already taking into account the late 60s and early 70s up to the events of lolk they have made too many fuckups to recover from as of now hurting them further will do nothing  just look at the moon and laugh laugh at them they will know then how pitiable they are having nearly lost their home to overreaction to a fairy and being outdone by 4 or so incident solvers from gensokyo that arent of the top percentile of youkai whatsoever let alone the power tiers if you take it that far    gensokyomoonie empire  they ought to get off their high horses and see how much better normal human villagers are compared to them

previous thread     this thread is for the discussion of untranslated japanese visual novels    what are you playing what are you looking forward to what have you finished you know the drill
is there any way to respec in grasesta
uh i bought like half a dozen mice and i am not getting additional dialogue from the mice seller
superior entelecheia still nowhere how are you holding up bros
  very good im finally continuing something i had on hold for quite a while i totally am im totally not deciding something else when ill actually play my next session totally not everything under control
do i get penalized for going to the loser dungeon free shit is nice but i dont want to be a ヘタレ
realize that despite zardone being a coward in story he can cover for the party and also has the biggest inventory pack of everyone    huh neat i guess hes not a joke after all
am i blind or grasesta simply doesnt have an option for bicubic filter if i want to play fullscreen
  he wouldnt be if everything wasnt his fault in the first place its a miracle he was left alive and allowed to act as a clown character
this scene really makes her look like a figma pose and all
god damn it i didnt know these werent just decorations finally i can make progress on rosalinds events i could handle twinkles falling from the sky since at least there was a quest telling you what area to go to but im actually a little pissed at this
  ever since i noticed random stalls were clickable ive had my eyes searching like a hawk sometimes you find weird stuff like those strong chickens in the prison cell with the red eyes
    for the love of god please continue posting shit like this that you find it helps quell the raging autismal completionist beast inside me this game can be one hell of a pixel hunt sometimes
  shit like this is exactly why aroducs cleanup and addition of qol stuff to kamidori was a godsend just add a few fucking hints or descriptions in the quest readouts and it goes from constant frustration to smooth as silk
  ive found some pretty well hidden 魔王石 so far but listing them all would take forever i can tell you that almost every area has at least 1 of them though and some arent obtainable on the first playthrough happy hunting
of course i see that arunaru is thinking about trying out gracesta though he decided to play a very old title instead        for you folks here given that you can just get free money from cats or get infinite money from arena theres absolutely no reason to not have everyone recruitable in your party is it
  dont mind me just posting the non ripoff versions
  some non story events only trigger when the character involved isnt in your party but for combat purposes you should bring them all but not necessarily put all of them in your formation
  those i can live without its the quest/characterrelated ones that are really bothering me you i think it was you mentioned missing the flags for a bunch of heroines i really dont want to do the same especially for fleurety
  keep buying them until you get the green one he should just give it to you for free once you buy enough
  yeah i got it but i had to go into a dungeon first and come back      i am guessing they are making up for the dolls/whatever you call them general lack of h scenes in madou koukaku with gracesta as far as i remember
  for being a main heroine lily really doesnt have all that many h scenes i believe fleur has more
  i wonder if they knew just which characters players likely want to bang the most
  pretty much many readers were disappointed you couldnt fuck the dolls if you know what i mean
  yeah that was me im still figuring things out on my end im halfway through ng and i still havent found an opening to fleuretys events but i managed to finish quest 21 this time which i think is what locked it for me in my first run   other things i guess ill note down for whoevers interested is that sleepy mages final event that is after you get her first hscene triggers in ルザナモスの宮pic related and the angels events need you to backfire her heals in battle once to start which i never bothered to try in run 1 because fun fact her heals never backfire if you use them out of battle nice going eushully   ill write something about fleurety too once i figure it out but for safety definitely dont enter chapter 5 without finishing that quest she gives you because im pretty sure youre fucked if that happens in general sleep a lot and talk to everyone you can before moving on with the story to have the best chance to not miss too many things or just rush through the game once and go slow on ng
  what the heck is all this complexity in character events    i guess everybody playing needs to take it slow and maybe watch as people compile information for it
  actually is it chapter 3as is usual with eushully games where a lot of hscenes start to open
  sleep a lof and talk to everyone you can  yeah im doing pretty good with that having the spare cash to cycle through all my party to make sure theres no outofparty events also helps a lot    i know for sure at least i got the event where if you fuck around enough in fleuretys miasma land in chapter 1 she comes looking for you and you have to fight her so unless that was actually a thing that happens anyway i have that much done    thanks for the tips
  in terms of main character scenes more or less yeah for hscenes in general i think you can get like 5 from as early as chapter 1 if you have the money to blow but 4 is more realistic one at base camp 2 whoresharpy
  harpy
  buy both whores once then there should be an event on the same map down and left from brothel green question mark where youll get a quest to find some woman in the 撒餌の谷 area who youll find around pic related take the drop to the brothel for her scene this event locks after a few chapters i believe so you might be screwed out of it if youre too late and consequently also screwed out of ルチッラs scenes maybe
  christ this is some dark souls npc questline shit right here thanks at least
prologue   篝火をすべて消すと魔王石入手  ch1   下層でねずみを3匹捕まえると魔王石入手  pretty sure i did both of these but i havent gotten any 魔王石 as far as i can tell do i need to do something to claim them
  i remember i got one of them after catching the cats for a bit theres a ton of them scattered around
  you get them from the purple tiles in the floor theyre a special item in the top of the corner    you only get to use them from chapter two on though
  in the prologue did you actually put out all the fires and then went back to the magic circle which was consequently activated and pushed z to get your item
  you get them from the purple magic circles once you clear the conditions
  ive found a couple just laying around with no visible clues like pic related in early ch2 i was too slow with my picture taking but there was a 魔王石 hidden here
      oh thats what those are for thanks anons
  yeah and if you interact with the circle it tells you the conditions of its activation
  oh thats useful i remember for the rat one there was a bulletin on the wall or something but i only looked at the magic circle in the ravine what are the stones for anyway
i wonder if someones made a spoileral chart yet
  oh yeah theres at least a dozen hidden around town in various places like lilicas bed
  various boosts and items and for certain events  not particularly relevant in the first playthrough other than the ultra rare potion holder thing that you should sell for cash but theres some really good stuff in ng keep an eye out for them but theres no need to grind them
finally best girl joins
  another fine gent of impeccable taste i see hope you held on to all of those blackedout items
  been using fatass as my mule
  enjoy like 90 of them being useless junk that sells for half the cost of identifying them but the good ones are usually very good gotta take heffalump into battle a couple times first and then do a quick quest but its so worth it
  im not really sure why i just started ch2 like an hour ago and havent gone out to fight yet just finishing a bunch of quests and events
anyone know where i find the goddess necklace for the shady guy in the shop window is it a random drop or do i need something specific
  got a lucky haul nearly all the greens are really good
how do you unlock the fox dwarf
  buy her cheap exploding weapons use them in combat at least once careful the bomb may kill you if you have too many people out and the person wearing the armor actually needs to get hit come back to her get a scene get the new one armor is the last one then im pretty sure you need to be in chapter 2 then its just a couple scenes and shes up for hire
  someone needs to do a list of missable events like this one
  thanks anon
  dont forget a ton of events are tied to sleeping as well
  which im sure tons of people will miss out on because monsters explode into skill refresh items like fucking pinatas making it so that you never need to sleep
  yeah for someone who just started and doesnt want to miss out on anything this is helpful
is there any point to do this
  still cant believe they gave a main character the name dolphin fishnets though  and first boss is named juice they are definitely onto something
  shit is that how its spelled here i was calling him jews the whole time
you have to save the fat bald man from being raped by the elf  well this is an unusual turn of events
i mostly see people here talking about how a vn sucks or its flaws what are some games you consider kamige and why
  your mom was a kamige back in the day
  if i can nonstop fap to it its a kamige
  cant confess undying love to ekthel and let her kill you
  i havent found a single 10/10 vn yet im still looking
  been using atwiki myself not sure how complete it is considering the game just came out but its been good so far i used them for kamidori and amayui  
  when i like a game what i usually post the most about is its flaws since problems in things i like bug me way more then problems in things i dont since if i dont like it i simply dont care
  10/10s dont exist
  as it is right now that will get you through the game but youll miss most of the heroine events and hscenes some of the progression is convoluted and lock up very easily if you go too quick
wheres my psymin appli another
  lots of stuff still missing outside the chapter guides but itll get better every day
  you read your first vn you have nothing to compare it to so you give it 10/10 you read your second vn its twice as good you give it 10/10 and change first one to 5/10 you read your third vn its twice as good as second one you give it 10/10 change second one to 5/10 and first one to 25/10 your fourth one was not as good as third one but better than second so you give it lets say 7/10 repeat indefinitely your personal 10/10 will always exist
heffer is heff
  you have nothing to compare it to so you give it 10/10  who the hell would do this 2 of the first vns i played were otoboku and monmusu quest and otoboku in particular only had 2 routes i enjoyed the rest were really hard to go through and i was totally turned off by monmusu quests monster girls and femdom but really liked the rest of it even back then i sure as hell wouldnt have given either of them 10/10
  you have nothing to compare it to so you give it 10/10  thats not how i grade things though
  i have plenty to compare to from several mediums ive seen 10/10 movies and 10/10 books ive seen some 9/10 vns but none have made the extra step beyond quite yet
  10/10 movies  these dont exist either
    the thing is they wont stay as 10/10 for long if you do this approach
  youre still using a ridiculous grading scale and completely ignoring the fact most people will have already had years of exposure to similar media
a random thing but someone on as just uploaded the last missing extra h scene disc for natsukumo yururu might be of interest if youre maintaining a collection
why are there so many hscenes in grasesta its ruining my immersion
  stop going to the whorehouse
i feel like さくらもゆ is going to get delayed again favorite usually releases their trials early unless this is going to be their first nonfandisc without a trial
holy shit lady i killed your subordinate one time let it go already christ you cant keep bringing that up every conversation the dude was like level 3 and he died from me throwing a dozen crates at his head this isnt the stuff of legends here
  they were lovers obviously
  maybe you should be nicer
how many 非処女 heroines are there in grasesta
  quite a few
saya no uta is a 10/10 vn
  just from what i know the ones who dont seem to fit the bill are the cursed wizard girli am not sure actually and elf lady i likely missed others    i suppose eushully games tend to have a high number of 非処女 heroines in general
  didnt get to sayas true beautiful form  only 9/10 sorry
  anything translated automatically loses a point
  ill list the virgins    lily darfi yunagi tenshi dorf
  the loli form was her true form everyone elses eyes are just not fit to see her properly
  but what if i have a fetish for eldritch abominations
the vn i am writing will be a 10/10
  anything not written drawn and coded by 100 pure blooded nips automatically loses 5 points
  implying im not
  go away hiroyuki
  i think youre being a bit generous there with only losing 5
what the fuck is this map  and man they need to fire the balance team everything in the game was a cakewalk and then ex3 happens and the random  encounters/wandering enemies are basically impossible to beat without reviving but then the 危険種 boss is a joke i dont understand
  it kind of bugs me a bit how cursed witch lady isnt one
  youd think her falling asleep partway through and the curse kicking in would act as some kind of safeguard like milly in rance 01
havent gotten an event with brown amazon in a while whats the trigger for those do i have to leave her unhired for a while or something
  wait i thought that she isnt one because of all the orgies she gets into or is it because of all the curses    also if i remember correctly rance 01 milly isnt one
  yeah i just meant the curse acting as a rape safeguard     dont know nothing about no orgies though ive only done a handful of events with her
  its based off her cgs
  i wonder if im just missing something or they really didnt playtest this
  nevermind the solution is just solo judar with lv6一匹狼 still a stupid design in my opinion
  so its one of those spam chain item battles
  yeah and it took me way too long to realize it 4 of those pink things lock you down completely if it was just a gimmick thing i could let it slide but all the random encounters have been like this for 10 fucking floors granted this is the final ex dungeon but completely gutting party play for the entire thing is difficult for very wrong reasons  and also the bosses are a joke in comparison to these things someone fire their balance team
what chapter can you access the hetare dungeon
  someone fire their balance team  im not even sure they have one im doing the tournament in chapter 3 right now and yunagi tore me a new one in like the 3rd round and i barely managed to win but then the giant demon fucker in the semifinals stomps out and starts doing single digit damage per attack like what the fuck the fights shouldnt be getting easier further into a tournament
  iirc eushully did minor balance changes in their amayui patches so if it is as bad as you say hopefully they are getting lots of feedback right now and will change it in some way though since they seem to err on the side of caution i wouldnt expect much
  you just need to lose a battle and use gp to revive
  thank ye
  not sure if this is the case here but its possible yunagis weapon was supper effective or just effective against your armor whereas the giant demon fucker might have been weak to your armor that would be less a balance problem and more just equipment shenanigans
how are the x cation games after lc2 i see that they arent written by insider anymore
  possible i forgot what type i used though i used the right equipment for everyone else maybe it was just a brain fart still had zero trouble with even the finalist the games progression simply feels weird to me the first chapter was well balanced and a little tough and then everything after that has been getting easier and easier im lazy and dont have the patience for random battles so i deploy everyone which means we cream random encounters and then get wiped by anything with fullparty aoes     its just bizarre i think is the word i want i dont feel like im plunging deeper into a pit of horrors more like curbstomping my way through trash mobs until i hit another roadblock of chucklefuck dwarves telling me i dont have permission to go any further because woo scary monsters     then again i just came off playing a lot of etrian odyssey so its probably not fair im mentally comparing the two    on the other hand i cannot stop playing for the life of me so i guess i should stop bitching because obviously something is working
egs reviews for fuukan seem pretty accurate and reflective of my own thoughts  lots of balance problems games generally too easy with most fights devolving to enduring until かばう procs at which point you win  equipment isnt fun since you can dump a lot of materials into upgrading a weapon then find a better one that doesnt allow for upgrading so you basically wasted your time  side heroines being optional leads to them not appearing at all in the main quest aside a few cameos  progression side heroine questlines is annoying since resting is barely necessary but you have to in order to advance events not to mention they need to leave your party when its so cheap to keep them hired forever   games overall scale is a smaller than past eushully games    and then get wiped by anything with fullparty aoes   be sure to use the fat ntr guy as his かばう skill makes it so that if hes within an aoe only he takes damage from it meaning a full party aoe only damages him   when i first saw him i thought itd be hilarious if he was the best character in the game by a twist little did i know he actually is
  seems like a pretty fair assessment i like the concept behind the upgrading weapons and especially upgrading the consumable item containers thats a cool idea but holy shit balance problems economys also completely fucked with tons of ways to abuse it    its a shame the side heroines are so side because theyre really endearing and even interesting for the most part game desperately needs more fullparty events though i dont know how youd work that since so many are optional and or might be not currently hired     on the other hand fleurety exists so its a 10/10 gotyay for me
  at least i hear that quof doesnt really think much of the cation games aside from lxc2 and i did see that lxc2 is generally rated the highest so there is some truth to that      pretty sure zardone is not an outright fat ntr guy since he actually still looks a small bit prettier than the examples eushully has i hear he actually is wary or scared of the elf for her unsavory habits oh right the other upside for him is that he has the biggest inventory space of every party member which means you will never run into having the problem of not being able to carry all your loot    reviews aside would you rate this higher compared to other eushully games
  though i dont know how youd work that since so many are optional and or might be not currently hired  easy you drop the whole hiring nonsense and rework the script from the ground up or at least thats what they should have done
  see i like the idea behind it that instead of the traditional closeknit party that overcomes stuff together youre just a bunch of hired mercs occasionally running into each other on business the relationships feel a little more fresh and it plays up jewdars lone wolf side a lot more and then lilica ruins the whole thing by being the puck to judars guts     but i dont know how youd reconcile that with gameplay mechanics that arent ass and a story that feels empty of people     christ they should at least have the party members you do have make comments on stuff more often like 90 of conversations so far are the two main characters doing every possible variation on teehee what fun that was mister jewdar grrr i exist only to kill
what was the explanation for lilica using a fairy body actually      i was really initially thinking they all start as a ragtag bunch of misfits who all dont really like each other but eventually grow closer its kind of a disappointment
  the main heroine thing was a mistake in general especially when judars chemistry is so much better with both the elf and especially darfiai enjoy their banter or rather almost with everyone but the main heroine
  the rest of the game wasnt exactly well balanced but ex3 just blew my mind i dont know how they thought people could find that enjoyable at least im done with it now      spoilers obviously  level 92 final boss with a level 70 crew and the only consumables i used were 4 skill restores and 2 damage items the 雑魚 were easily more dangerous than this thing
  yeah the main heroine almost single handedly cripples fuukans plot since shes so much worse compared to the other heroines but she gets almost ten times the focus
wait so grasesta is only single route thats a bit disappointing if so whats the point of ng then    even memoria have multiple routes
  is this an instance of eushully pushing the typical pair of opposites and yet it didnt work
  probably because a main heroines gotta be a bland goody goody and chemistry requires both people to have a personality     hes got good bantz with fleur too its nice to see they gave her a reason to notice him other than main character privileges
  having played every cation here is my ranking    niizuma nono route  lxc2  pxc1  purely  pxc2  lxc  niizuma aiko/yuki    of course this is a very generalized ranking of the titles excepting niizuma for example i think aya from lxc is superior to weaker heroines in better ranked titles such as lxc2s hinata if you prefer the traditional cation designs of iizuki tasuku you may not like pxc1 pxc2 or purely very much especially considering the designs vary wildy between those 3 titles    cation sensei rankings purelys touka  pxc2s chitose  lxcs sera
  when i tried the other routes in lxc1 after aya i felt that i could not play any further i just couldnt    i guess lxc2 is the best in general huh
 might try the ones with teacher routes i guess    nono is the only route i didnt do in niizuma so i might go back and do that
i keep saying and mentioned in the previous thread but they shouldve just adopted the madou koukaku approach when it comes to the side heroines anyone who played that game knows what im talking about you know some of the side heroines like ferruano neneka etc who got their own special endings if you follow their events even if they didnt have fullfledged routes    the linear approach really doesnt fit these type of titles especially when the protagonist is not some nice guy mc
do you guys use new formations at all some of them look great for specific types of fights     also i wonder if more unlock over time
  the fat man ball is the only viable formation lategame  and yeah a lot more formations open up theres like 15 or something i found them pretty much irrelevant since the buffs are so minor and generally come with debuffs too
  nono is the only route i didnt do in niizuma so i might go back and do that  you really ought to shes a treat most unique route in niizuma hands down via running a food truck together and imo her chemistry with the mc is also the best of the bunch
  i wonder if eushully staff is simply tired of doing that many routes like madou koukaku kamidori or himegari
  nice formation saved thanks
  the actual unit placement there is laughably bad now that i actually look at it two of those units are dead weight and shouldve been swapped for roxy/gem nipples just goes to show how little the buffs really matter
  you can get threeunique formations from the hetare dungeon theyre more jokes than anything useful
  yeah i wouldve loved for the side heroines to get some tiny fluff endings of their own jude could be a house husband while rosa brings home the bacon or jude decides he really likes that demon pussy and puts a ring on it creating a new humandemon masterrace or maybe yunagi and jude open their own casino and strike it rich etc etc    and yeah especially considering the darker themes its a shame there arent more endings especially of the whatif variety
  jude decides he really likes that demon pussy and puts a ring on it    isnt this technically one alternative ending
  its more like she keeps him as a pet isnt it
  a full demon path would have been great honestly judars got the disposition for it floortiles is aiming to lead him down that path and it would be piss easy with judars backstory to slip in some bullshit about how his dad was halfdemon prince and now hes got a right to claim the throne by murdering all his halfsiblings then he becomes the demon king with flouride as his queen and i dunno razes grasesta because hes feeling edgy    its right there eushully  its not hard
stop shit talking my pure fairy doll waifu
  its main heroine jealousy
  its much better than the canon ending where he ends up as king of the city its really not a role suited for him you need a lot of charisma to be king not to mention being educated in economics politics etc i just dont see him being a good king at all
  huh checking the atwiki i didnt seem to find the condition for that ending i am guessing the contributors might not have added it in unless its the ending in chapter 3 where judar chooses to go back to belgarad but i seriously doubt its that one      why does she have 2 forms to begin with
  doll ero
i guess the consensus here is that lilica does not compare well to fia of amayui as main heroine
  they told you in chapter 2
  fia being an airhead already gives her a thousand times more personality than lilica its almost impressive how lacking lilica is every way possible
  yeah see demon king would be a way better fit than that judar is good at killing stuff and maybe fucking women and thats about it thats all you need to be demon king all this stuff about strength being all you need to climb the social ladder in grasesta makes way less sense in the human world than it would in the demon world
  maybe i should go back and reread that i vaguely recall it might be related to the full moon or somethingor is it that shes normally in fairy form but becomes her normal form under full moon
  tired i get this feeling they simply stopped giving a fuck    i wonder why they almost never try to connect their games or at the very least have references here and there when its set in the same world except for the obvious joke appends while its nothing out of this world they simply dont utilize the tremendous worlbuilding the previous games especially im series set up for them    like even here in the prologue you have the standard medieval warfarea little magic in madou has melkia utilizing the full potential of megitech with guns artillery cannons even flying battleships like imagine acquiring that kind of technology and having it not spread all over the world at all in dir lifyna of all places where humans dont exactly have much going for them  what they are doing is called playing it safe and not wanting to put in actual effort
  why does she have 2 forms to begin with  if you believe the in game reasons shes cursed    i like to believe the more likely reason is that fans wanted a doll heroine after the massive cockblock they had in madou ko 4 dolls 0 h kinda ironic when they have magical doll in the title name but you cant bone any
  i like to believe the more likely reason is that fans wanted a doll heroine after the massive cockblock they had in madou
  somebody bought it simply for fairy dolls
  couldnt they have made her bigger than sleevesized then
  he starts off the review saying he buys every eushully game
  wow thats dedication
  dont ask me im not someone that collects figmas or dolls
  isnt this technically one alternative ending  i was looking ahead and noticed this certain bulge in a certain h scene        thats what i think it is right
  you are going to have to describe it to me since theres no way im opening that at work yes my workplace is pretty lax for me to be posting this to begin with
  the massive cockblock they had in madou ko 4 dolls 0 h    the shit what were they thinking
  yeah shes either preggers or desperately needs to see a doctor
  nobody knows especially with that battle gameplay
  ill probably still check the game out but im not happy about minigirls being dangled before the player without them having h scenes
the fucking bantz on this maid god damn she is spitting hot fire  why cant she be a recruitable character instead of sleazy mcrapethief
  who knows especially when one of the dolls was the main heroine and her route was so called true route magitech  then theres risel who is another main heroine and hers is the magic route but she had plenty of hscenes and was the worst girl kinda
  honestly the games neat except i absolutely loathed everything related to fighting in that mess of a system
  its definitely worth trying out there are so many outcomes for even the side heroines that you will be surprised its definitely one of their last games they gave a damn about in that department
i ended up doing around two full playthrough of sankai ou no yubiwa somehow and i am not even sure why when the only kind of saving grace are the girls
  im impressed they can still keep coming up with stupid incoherent names for everything
why does everyone like the fake foxgirl with a speech impediment i cant stand her voice
  sankai barely has anything going for it it doesnt even have a story except for the beginning you could download a 100 save to view the gallery and you wouldnt miss a thing
  i bought grasesta amayui kamidori sankai ou no yubiwa and kami no rhapsody though i havent played the last two i never used them because i dont have a disc drive but i have the perfect guidebooks too and those are great i hope grasesta gets one soon
  the main thing that i remember from it is how aritz falls super hard if you take the evil choices with him based on the ending and the scenes
is rosalindefox ear smith actually a dwarf or is that just vndb being silly
  shes a high dwarf
  vndb doesnt have tags for racial subspecies like high elves or in rosas case high dwarf even though it isnt technically correct its close enough imo
  cant really blame him for thinking that the dorf trait is fake until rosa tells you about herself she just looks like a short beastgirl
  she really does just what were they thinking
  adding to this id actually believe if you told me she was a half beastgirl or something like eifelia who was not a pure dwarf
  that random sleeping demon whatever that joins at the end of roxys questline is so weird why him of all people
  it feels like eushully kept trying to bait and switch the players  beastgirl blacksmith nope its a dorf  qt sleepyhead lolimage who likes to read how adorable until you see all the demon jizz that gets poured into her cunt  this kind elf oneesan must be as pure as driven snow yeah about that  big brawny amazon girl who looks like she has more muscles than brains is actually a pretty good mage dunno if this is true later on  uetre i have no idea if hes going to backstab the mc or stay a bro in the end  zaur looks like a huge colossal waste of money/space once you can recruit him but he turns out to be really useful  i could go on but it feels like a reoccurring theme at this point like they are trying to pull the rug out from under us constantly just to make it feel fresh or whatever
does the thief come back after you drop kick him in the water    i miss him
  because witch hats are so rare and almost never used in designs right
  generic witch looks like generic witch  really made me think
  ロキシー  ロキ
  theyre using staves as well and both are girls too so they are basically plagiarized copies of each other at this point
  let them rip off megumin as much as they like the clothes are solid
  if only their names didnt match as well
  so someone on the eushully team is a big fan of mt 
  if thats true they wouldnt have made that girl a slut then
  no idea but that cant be just a coincidence
  completely different pronunciation
  i mean it totally could be coincidence
  but roxy is a slut
  confirmed to die a virgin if rudeus doesnt exist  slut
  wouldve fallen in love with some other guy if rudeus hadnt saved her in the dungeon
  gets saved by her perfect man  perfect man is rudeus  not seeing the issue here
its rocky you fools but most definitely not loki because that is lame
  im calling her roxy because her character design and name is very similar to roxy of mushoku tensei
  her character design  maybe the hair because otherwise shes literally megumin
been running around in circles in ザフュヤの宮 but still cant complete quest 16 do i need level 3 闇使い to get to the bottom and finish this quest ive already defeated the boss here and finished mikuris request
  nevermind had to go back to guild for the quest to show as complete im an idiot
yeah this guy is probably going to be evil at some point if he isnt already
  i thought the same with him
  i just started but zaur feels like best character so far i chuckle every time he says something help im falling in love with fat old man
  normal you start as a loli lover then discover the greatness of boobs and at some point youll just realize its all fat and you want more and more and then youll find your new best girl a fat balding man its usually the time people quit eroge or casually play the few games that feature fat men
  its just platonic love though no homo involved
  of course its all about the girls getting raped by the fat men in eroge as well allll platonic love no homo

  now this chink game got more interesting
cant believe we died again
  there is someone making random threads like crazy i was lucky to notice it and made a new one before going completely out of jp
i reached 二段 last game was exciting  deal in 0 times  south 3 kamicha dealer  20 or 21k up from kamicha  shitty hand fold when he riichis  shimocha deals in busts  haneman  still first place with 12k margin    im not saying i played perfectly in this game but with such a narrow margin it felt like everything mattered even the noten penalties and the cheap hands of course these always matter but not always to this extent
  i rechecked and i won by 4100 at the end so it wasnt as close as i thought still that fucker had riichi dora aka ura3 which is damn lucky
  i thought for a second its a red 4 horrifying
tfw when you riichi early with bad wait and you do not end up dealing into haneman 40 tiles later
    sasuga
deal into riichi iipatsu tanyao aka dora 2 ura dora as a dealer on turn 3  what a great way to start a day
  lose game because of mistake/bad luck/ or distraction  be angry for hours  im glad my other hobbies arent games im need to see a shrink
anyone here happen to have the eva strip mahjong game i can only find a decade old torrent with no seeds
rare double houtei   as a punishment for a greedy riichi
damn im so close to 天鳳位 were going for it lads
have a friend in japan who has been sending me things hes found interesting and nice pictures and such he found a mahjong set that had these weird jewels in them    anyone know what the reason would be for it
  bonus tile think flowers in other variants
  so this is true darkness
  ive heard its for colorblind people
  considering furiten was the other option the riichi was fine
im thinking of ordering a mahjong set from amazonjp and i was wondering what you guys would recommend for a playing surface ive seen many people talk about the junk mat but it seems pretty expensive for what it is i might have to go for it though unless i want to make my own junk mat    but almost 3000 jpy for a mousematlike thingy with four plastic edges seems like a waste
  junk mat is good but yeah a bit pricey whatever you get though having edges makes a real difference in terms of ease of setting up and general fun
i hear if you are good in mahjong you will climb faster in company
anyone here speak chinkinese my majsoul is acting whacky
  saw your post opened my page saw the same just reloaded and now it works like usual
  yeah but that doesnt tell us what its asking for
  it wants you to put your real name and identity card number only for china residents in order to comply with some sort of online gaming law    according to the message you cant easily change the information later and they assure you the information will not be released to any third party im not sure what youre supposed to fill in if youre not chinese though
  i have a junk mat its nice but overpriced as you mentioned    itll last forever tho so just bite the bullet
  i forget the exact name for that white dragon but i think its haku poncih or something like that if youve reached and your next draw is that tile it counts as any of your waits and you get tsumo  ippatsu along with your other yaku only certain parlors play with that though you dont see many home sets with those  idk about the jeweled 5 pins though
  just get a sheet of vinyl mat and cut into a square they go for cheap at fabric stores so grab a big enough sheet and you can make new ones whenever they wear out
how much does house rule affect decision making in a game lets say i take data from tenhou majsoul and sega mj 100000 matches from each game will i get different conclusions from each game
  its the edges that make the junk mat so good though if you want to make a decent one yourself you need edges
i tried to find a pic of standard wooden planks with suitable grooves to make a shitpost about diy frames but i see nothing good to make a suitable frame you probably need a woodworking bench and the result will be way too heavy too
  house rules affect play styles so yes i would assume youd get variance
fast haneman on the 3dan to my right round 1  he spends the next 6 rounds picking me apart  down to 5500 have a haneman hand with hatsu wait  he rons my xia discard hell wait and reveals hes holding the other 3
  the lesson here is my defense sucks but also fuck that guy
why the heck ryanpeiko stacks with 7 pairs hand but iipeiko doesnt
  it doesnt 
furiten cant see why  look at the screenshot after the game  someone poned my discard
  reminder to check pons and chis if you run out of tiles to discard you might find a genbutsu
does anyone even care about sanma
  no and neither should you
sorry for asking again but still how to use these half of them is about to expire
saki age 非公開  kek
  chinese set ones
new because almost archived 
  they discount/pay for entering into the 2nd/3rd stage of the tournaments not events directly
  this was unnecessary
  if i dont pay initially they are useless right thank you very much
  dont do that again for the love of god just bump it next time

  theyre so cute and so nervous
  i liked this  thanks
  and not very good

is it possible to detect chiitoi hand
  same as toitoi lots of discards that match the other players ponds    not really a strong indicator sadly
  if some guy seems to discard middle tiles from every suit really early i think  or if people discarded several pairs each theyre more likely to have an all pair hand
any good books on mahjong theory
  the ones i posted in one of the threads when i got them they are basic but good    also the dinosaur チーba

i know im trash but holy shit that luck on shimocha he basically won thanks to akadora  
oorasu  go dama because takame is pinfu sanshoku dora aka  yasume is pinfu aka  after shimocha deals in with yasume i think im retarded for not riichiing  calculate points  if i riichid i wouldve been still 100 points away from first with the yasume  right choice wouldve been to pass on the yasume and wait for the takame or tsumo yasume wouldve won too    麻雀難しい
finally get 1st place again  its a game with 2 disconnects    not long until i get invited to japan to play with pros
i need some help i stopped playing mahjong for roughly a year and now i want to get back into it but im facing a hard problem i cant decide on a name for my new tenhou account
  make it as cancerous as possible you wont feel bad about ditching it later
  what kind of league is this  i watched a few videos now but i dont understand some of the discads the players made at all
  probably for muh defense
  its a pretty good league    is probably right theres even a video where kobago folds with suuanko tenpai he drew the winning tile of another person their reads are often pretty impressive but its hard to follow along since theres no camera image of the discard pile the commentators try to solve this by saying whether certain tiles are genbutsu or suji etc
 charlotte minecraft   vomitgoddess   phoenix wright neru at law   leader   ponko   aki hololive collab
  wasnt chestbutts tv thing soon i thought youd make the op about her
  im not op
might as well post all three at this rate
  oh so youre  sorry its just that the number of posters didnt increase when that image was posted
oneechan is ready for christmas
whens the next nijibans
  okay i guess
i wish this gyaru would stream more
  man what a fucking perfect picture
kanna
  shes come back recently though not as much as before
  perfectly aligned  sasuga eroneko
  
  she really is pent up
  i should feel worse for her then i do but kannafags have always been annoying so i dont feel too bad
the green bitch won with her spamming sad
  i didnt even know midori had a tiktok neat that she got fourth dunno who third is though
yua
  thats the problem i dont know any other gyarutubers i can watch
  nijisans seeds has a gyarutuber but honestly you shouldnt pay attention to the looks for the most part its all about how good they are as entertainers in my opinion
   real tiktok queen
luna on tokyo mx on less than 35 minutes
  kyouko isnt gyaru
  fair enough i see tan skin and odd haircolor and think gyaru
  good for her
  what did she mean by this
i didnt even notice that was ranmaru in the maimoto collab shes changed quite a bit
  her design and voice is cute but for some reason i cant really bring myself to care about her streams its kind of a shitty feeling
  cute designs and voices are dime a dozen currently not much to do about it
check this birthday pizza
  her last stream was supposed to have her in her 3d model but didnt her next stream could be a proper reality stream
buy my book  
big cake
  looks more like three pancakes with frosting between them to me
my flower is stuck on a cake
  dangerous
  im surprised she didnt win
its ready
    wait her show is today the nijishit made nijishit op also on ais special tv day what a petty faggot
  is she hajimes meat toilet
  wait you actually care that much about the op why
anyone got a link to that lunas show
  yes on less than 10 minutes on tokyo mx      mov3co/en/tokyomx/  but its glitchy
  he just wants to start shit stop responding
  well you can google up a bunch of crap ones but anyone got a decent tokyo mx stream
  im not the one making the new thread 8 seconds after the imagelimit
  he just wants to start shit  why you nijisanjifans are so defensive when people dares to criticize the vtubers you love
cake is done hooray
  well obviously and i dont care to go much further then to make fun of him for caring about the op its just weird if it was 2ch or something itd be more understandable i guess
oh no charlottes chat is quizzing her on english stuff now
lunas agency to show a preview of their first batch of vtubers  
  cult mentality they take everything personally
can you hold off the shitposting until japan goes to sleep like usual
  hide and ignore like you should always that being said its midnight over there so theres probably not going to be many more streams after the ones currently going
    then stop being so thinskinned when someone dont speak well of nijisanji
  are they gonna be 2d or 3d
  you mean aside from this which was last week
  idolshit and they have a company with money backing them so 3d unless sony actually paid attention to the market and realized they could save a couple thousand bucks by doing 2d then 3d
good direct feed luna
  apparently its going to be an exposition
 shiishii   3 days until hes in smash   seedstomboy   ikasumi video   fairys   kawaiiuromu
  how do you save money by paying twice
  0109    0117  why was the mitosperm so desperate to make a nijishit op today
its time
  they could save a couple thousand bucks by doing 2d then 3d  thanks nijisanji thanks ichikara for being the low standard of the market
  is this the 80s
  mpvshot2340jpg  holding out on us
its better on neetball hooray
  now its official that luna has 144 years
it sounds like wakamoto replaces p丸様 for the tv broadcasts
is there a better stream
  go 2d with a cheaper facerig or something get a fuckton of donations turn into 3d dancing idols like idolbu are going to be eventually ill admit i worded it retardedly though
did they hire neon to voice luna
  this but unironically
  probably should mention ririmus there with shiishii playing minecraft and theyre going to make a butthouse because of their duo name
  thanks
she said the line on tv because its all replay vtuber fade btfo
what happened to ririmus horns
  nothing
  if that happened it was a good decision pmaru should return to be pmaru
  neon is awful
  youre awful
  lunas voice in the very beginning of the programotally  sounded tlike hers
  thats her new costume
kanae is a good niiyan
  well pmaru should go full beach boys and be brian wilson just  envision the concept write the scripts record the music and allow neon to voice her and perform on public events
  shes just more obnoxious luna but with no charm or sex appeal
luna is lame whens aichan showing up
  i want to commit a crime
  oh im watching shiishiis perspective not ririmus didnt notice that its the new outfit yeah think it has a horns variant like how the winter outfit for dola has
  you sure that you arent mixing things or youre so much into the chestbutts
  shit taste
  its all marketing for now
  its super lame for a tv show weve all seen these videos before
kanaes items
  probably next week during the actual thing
  you really like to defend lunas stage fright dont you    ai and siro shows had oc even the short series feat anons secret crush were better than this
oh not her stupid song
  why should some literal who who didnt even rank on the poll get on a tv show
  it seems luna cant handle a real tv show like ai siro aoi and kmnz
wake me up when lunas show has something new
  we niijisanjibros dont care about special events because every livestream is special for us
  ha ha great post upvoted
  well chestbutt at least did a shy polite and out of character intro at the start
wasnt that program supposed to go for 30 minutes is she going to show up in the last 5
  unless its neon as that anon claims
is this luna show just a rebroadcast of her last live with wakamoto narrating some stuff
  its only preshow today
  fucking sony suits
  if ai had been an option for the poll itd have been like those manga popularity ones where the mc gets twice as much votes as the second place it wouldve been pointless
  the real thing is on december 11
check this collab
  if ai had been an option for the poll  it was a votein poll there were no options post a real chuuba like mea instead
  the only reason anyone even posts about neon is because of her similarity to luna it was funny for a while but autists dont know when to stop
  spew
  oh that makes sense then this was pretty underwhelming if it was an actual episode
  is screaming called singing now
  its especially dumb because theyre introducing a different character than the one that will be on air next week
see you next week
  she didnt count like himehina didnt count there were actually some votes for ai
  just like with pmaru mk 2 which i suspect is neon
  yes yes its all about chestbutts we got that
  after the waste of time this show was i wont be watching next week but im thankful for screenshotposters so i can just osmosis the only important couple of minutes in the half hour long show
  thank feminists for that
  ai will be on the show    himehina declined which means they could have been if not number one at least on the top 3 i dont understand why they did that maybe to offer the chance of less unknown vtubers to rank but still
  more like a recount of what she did plus wakamoto
  i think they may have made it past ago but the top four are too strong
  himehina declined which means they could have been if not number one at least on the top 3 i dont understand why they did that maybe to offer the chance of less unknown vtubers to rank but still
rroboco  
 kanae   azuma   ene
  nah because ai was not in the ranking so they couldnt humiliate ai if that was their concern it was a stupid one
  chain smoker asmr  yeah fuck that
  im more surprised that theyve announced it that late after all those riots about them not being there almost like they wanted to see the reaction first
  kanaes truly evil hes turned two innocent young girls who dont know any better into diamond miners
  of course it was a controlled outrage now they know they have a solid fanbase instead of a temporal surge
  so basically what youre telling me is himehina who have more popular videos then ai decided to be humble and let a single spot go to someone who needs that boost more im proud of these two and their perfectly neutral sex appeal
  himehina who have more popular videos then ai  no dumbass thats you and your imagination if ai was on the ranking which that could be perceived as she licking her own butt and demanding people to lick her ass as well she would be number 1 and then himehina taking the second spot if himehina decided to rank without ai participating on the poll they could be number 1 with a big gap of votes between them and the number 2 sana

id pay the hags at the moriya shrine to marry sanae

the only payment i would make would be a huge donation to the moriya shrine so i can pound suwakos tight insides

    why would anyone commit to fucking the same hole for years and years
  you dont need to marry a person to fuck her you dope

why pay for a used up slut when you could head into the fields and catch a fairy you can abuse
  tewi is the only one whos a real prostitute anyway in gensokyo
  lies sanae has a highway that heads straight towards her sloppy gigantic pussyhole
sanae is a pure maiden
  but sanaes pussy is extremely loose and unless you have a 12 inch dick it barely provides any stimulation tewi is ten times tighter and a hundred times hotter
what do sanae and janny have in common  they do it for free
  tewi is also a much more experience prostitute knowing how to make people horny and pay cheap
  oof   how can sanaefags recover from this
virginkun thinks he knows about prostitution
that snake is just going to stare at me while i pound the sanae isnt it
  yes  it will also occasionally laugh at your technique and comment on how quick you were
  who are you quoting
willing prostitute tewi enjoys servicing men for cash  neutral prostitute aya uses it as a means of boosting bunbun sales doesnt dislike it but doesnt particularly enjoy it  unwilling prostitute reimu needs to do it to eat but hates it
  theres nothing wrong with sacred sexual patronage
id pay everything up to my very life
  free prostitute sanae loves cocks so much that she may even pay you to suck your cock
  the idea of paying for sex is lewder since it breaks more taboos and gives me a greater degree of control over the woman i am fucking
  i love this image if only that big titty moon rabbit would go home it would be perfect

  4d sex is a hell of a drug
  a lot of /jp/sies gave up and lost their virginities to prostitutes or at soaplands after they realized that becoming a wizard at 30 was a stupid coping mechanism
  at soaplands  i wish i had lost my virginity at a soapland i did it the old fashioned way at 17
  its not too late to join the new age of nihilist otaku down with waifus up with condom belts
  condom belts  only if all the condoms are mine also thats a really soft sanae i like her
i need to know reimus prices
  theyre affordable
  shell chargw you 995 an hour for a blowjob 20 an hour for paizuri and 30 for a good old fucking
  what about more perverse things
  おじさま  tfw to old for /ss/ but too young to be an おじ
theyd pay me to fuck them
  10000 yen in the donation box nonnegotiable
  hot
  you go near the fairies of the lake and ill make certain that you will become youkai food
  only sumi is pathetic enough to pay to be fucked
  go away you fag little faries love getting their tight cunnies railed by adult men
  only luna likes that and its because of her chesnut mouth
  youd be surprised
  cirno is so cute and cheerful
  i heard more of those who have regrets giving their virginities to a random prostitute
  road not traveled grass is greener etc losing it to a prostitute is better than never losing it and letting it consume you with bitterness and anger
  im fueled by bitterness and anger
  thats bad
sanae is so cute
  but op pic does it for free so its not prostitution its blatant nymphomanic hunger
  here comes the airplane
hakurei soapland prices  handjob 500 yen  footjob 1000 yen  blowjob c 3000 yen  blowjob raw 5000 yen  buttjob 2000 yen  paizuri 3000 yen  vaginal c 10000 yen  vaginal raw 50000 yen  anal 80000 yen
  sanaes too old for that
  how about armpit sex
  is not prostitution if she is willingly taking shota cocks in her vagoo
  shotas get a special discount because she knows their allowances arent all that much
  what are they doing to poor stage 5 yuuka
  free with any purchase of blowjob or higher
  dumb babu
  paizuri 3000 yen  most easily the best deal of my life
  much cheaper than sanae right
  no sanae does it for free
  i would pay sanae to marry hags at the moriya shrine i think we can unite our efforts to reach our goals faster
  ill take the whole package
  sanae literally does it for free this is practically her monopoly
  hah he said only sumi is pathetic enough to pay to be fucked
  good thing that snake isnt a venomous type  i dont think nues is either but i think i need another look at it
  footjob 1000 yen  anal 80000 yen  why would anyone unironically use a stinking hole instead of having 80 footjobs
  you would hear a lot of cute noises come out of reimu you never thought you would hear the shrine maiden let out
  sanae is tense and sloppy reimu is experienced professional
  reimu is cold and would be completely emotionless and silent the entire time  sanae is enthusiastic and loves her job and shell be the happiest girl in the world when sucking her customers cock
  both approaches give me boner
  a man of culture i see
  you got it backwards
do you think you could trick freshly or young aged youkai into having sex with you
  i like this artist he draws cute girls and panties
  i think i could trick a fairy id trick every fairy i found into doing the lewdest acts possible and having copious amounts of sex with me
  young youkai are more dangerous than old ones theyre still impulsive and feral eg rumia medicine and mystia zun seems pretty consistent that the weaker/younger something is the more retarded it is the old youkai are the ones that are able to actually hold conversations and only attack threatening or strong targets young ones wouldnt understand you and just see meat if they realized you were a human
  so could i negotiate with nuesama to sit on my face
  which 2hus would be the most expensive who would be the cheapest
  yukari sanae
ive been saving up for this moment
  the most expensive or the cheapest
  the fact it doesnt need to be said is the joke dude
  considering she has be body of a scrawny 12 year old boy i dont think anyone would pay much to fuck her
  sanae holds a monopoly for doing it all for free and serving many customers at once in a single sitting    knowing that sanae does it for free why would you pay anyone unless the information about her is intentionally withheld for the sole intention of making you pay in the first place  monopolies are hard enough to deal with let alone compete sanae is known far and wide as gensokyos slut i see no reason why any sane /jp/sie would pay in the first place unless they value their life and health unless theyre fairycon
  eexactly who would pay for that haha crazy
  who would be the cheapest  reimu after you tell her she can use semen as a substitute for food
why do japanese people peel apples dont they realise all the nutrients are in the peel
  not only japanese but every asian countries ever  it is safer that way
  enjoy eating your pesticides
  just wash it before you eat it    safer how
  just smoke some cigarettes after
  their teeth are fucking shit already you want them biting through skin
i just like peeling them eating the apple is just a bonus
  all the nutrients  all    not all maybe a good part of them but the nutrients that youre getting from an apple are negligible its mainly just fibre

  to understand the relationship between cirno and the fishe you first have to understand the nature of gensokyo and touhou in general looking at a strictly canon perspective there is no confirmed situation where the fishe and cirno ever met and certainly not through introduction by sakuya as the op image would imply cirno meeting the fishe is merely an inferred situation a posibility not set in stone through the word of zun yet neither ruled out as something that couldnt occur through some sort of contrived circumstance this is likewise why certain works depict the fishe as an angry god demanding sacrifice a benevolent figure from which to channel cirnos hopes and desires or a simple snack food to be swiftly consumed until deemed true or untrue any of these outcomes could possibly occur in the hypotetical case that cirno and the fishe were to meet it is something that is under no constraint much like momijis personality and reimus family    primaries might scold you for stepping outside of canon constraints and attempting to fabricate a situation they deem contrary to character  sakuya giving the cirno the fishe would imply a certain sense of altruism on the formers part that has yet to show in canon leading to the argument of character derailment but many popular doujin works interpret the exact characterizations of characters differently from strict canon and are not always lesser for it after all the canon fighting games take artistic liberties in the depictions of individual characters yet remain supported by zun regardless if they depict his characters in the way he originally invisioned them    ultimately the cirno and the fishes relationship is dependent on the context of the work you are consuming in one story they can be bitter foes a damsel in distress trying to outrun a bloodthirsty monster in vain in another happily married to understand this is to have a basic understanding of touhou as a doujin scene
reminder that the fishe is canon
  9/10
  this pasta is now incorrect for cirno has met the fishe 
  fishepilled
  this is my daughter cirno
  your daughter is my air conditioner dude
  my daughter has a job unlike her father
it is now time for the cirno to partake in thanksgiving feastery
  let us partake in the ritual consumption of the cirno in our bid for expressing thankfulness let us consume and rejoice yes
  eats
  refrain from the eats
    would the ritual consumption of the cirnos liver grant us immortality
  tanned cirno  japan got colder the year before
  cirno is loose again

hello teacher    monster girl pastebin   content aggregator anubismoe  writers list   sabbath grimoire scans 
bully the shorties
  no protect them
  am i really supposed to believe that wurm is dumb she looks like she knows exactly what shes doing
theres nothing more intimate than sleeping in your waifus mouth
  theres always the rare exceptions youd be a fool to underestimate her
    huge sneks
  what is this a kiki snake pharaoh
  that would be a basilisk who has removed her mask  a rather dangerous situation to be sure
  wurms are not sneks theyre ground dragons they are huge though  and prefer going through rather than around
  tfw no retarded not snek waifu  tfw no monster waifu at all
  but what do you do when shorties bully you  you never know when a mischievous horde of porclets might come after you
  such pretty eyes she looks like a good girl that deserves lots of hugs kisses and general affection  tnotabasilisk
imagine if you will  heart suit cheshires cats  diamond suit dormice  club suit jubjubs  spade suit jabberwocks  which would you pick
  black sclera is high pedigree
monsters bullying low level adventurers
  a quick glance made me read space suit jabberwocks and now i cant unthink the image of a spacesuit wearing wock with a helmet on both tentacle mouths      black sclera plus red eyes plus snake pupils is godtier
  i forget how the wonderland card suits work  theyre indicators of personality and fetishes right
  reminder that devil bugs are basically filthy disgusting and disease ridden cockroaches yuck    pic related are two order citizens a boyfriend and a girlfriend trying to fight off an aggressive devil bug mamono
its officially december everywhere that matters   happy christmas time everyone
  time to bring out the christmas themed monster images
what if the demon lord is not in control of the monsters look at this little bottle made with concentrated succubus love juices but not even lilims are certain of its existence or the extent of its power who has the most access to love juices in the entire setting     the so called traitor hero    think about it he broke the demon lord cycle by defeating the previous one and enthroning somebody on his place that was less interested on ruling and following the chief god and more interested in cummies his cummies     as father of any potential replacement he is first in line to groom all lilims into following her mother and her ideals and the demon army has changed tactics and command from a mongol horde structure to a real army    he is surreptitiously doing that which must be done to free humanity from the shackles of their god and the panacea is merely another one of his tools to advance what we would call a transhuman agenda
i want a kikimora who coordinates the color of her uniform with the lipstick shes wearing that day
  for some reason i imagine monsters as either being way too overenthusiastic about christmas or way too tsundere about it with very little inbetween
  wurmchan would love christmas
  looks like youre missing your image this time
  i want a kikimora who coordinates the color of the base of my cock with the lipstick shes wearing that day
  just imagine getting to explain all the little details about santa and mrs claus and how brightly her eyes would light up every single time though that just makes me wonder what species mrs claus is
  thatd be some heart attack inducing wholesomeness  though that just makes me wonder what species mrs claus is  white horn would be my first guess
  she wears magic lipstick that wont wash off except using her juices  she switches color everyday and goes a little bit shallower  by the next week your dick looks like a rainbow
  id prefer it in reverse she starts shallow then goes deeper each day the magic in her lipstick making me grow bigger by the end of it shes throating my footlong dick
  she stops just before she inhales your full length and rests your splendid manhood on her cheek  she nuzzles it like she would a beloved pet before looking you in the eyes and asking you to release everything in her mouth  finished kiki maid maria when
  and then once hes inside the house he gives all the good little boys and girls their presents for the year only to vanish mysteriously into the night silent as the ghost of christmas future  waaaaoow so cool  wurmchan can barely contain her excitement jumping up to the table between you and then she suddenly seems lost in deep thought finally she hesitantly opens her eyes again  um anon she says sheepishly eyeing the holes in your backyard from her tunneling sessions how does mister santa feel about girls whove only been a little naughty
i want to help runya runya spread disinformation pamphlets throughout the order     kitsune tails fray and split as they weaken with age grabbing two good handfuls will grant you leverage in closecombat  red colors confound a minotaurs underdevloped brain mitigate their brute strength through carefullychosen attire  the yetis clumsy limbs and fragile spines make them weak to closequarters grappling squeeze them without mercy  the hellhounds blazing eyes can only see objects in motion staying still will essentially render you invisible to them  travelling sisterhoods of saleswomen can provide potent antimonster tools and tinctures only purchase from guildregulated members indicated by their leafshaped hair accessories  ushioni sacrifice an eye during peverse monster rituals rip off their protective patches to reveal a critial weak point  albino succubi have numerous genetic and magical defects but are held to have religious significance amongst monsters eliminating them first will demoralize the monstrous hordes  the wendigos stomach can only process raw human flesh leaving baskets of cooked meat out on the mountainside will slowly poison their foul clans  the arsenals of our forefathers shall lead us to victory scavenge ancient tombs for magical weaponry and armor from ages past  owl magi and bunyips are dangerous only when they have the element of surprise locking eye contact with them can intimidate these ambush predators sending them scattering in fear   salamanders group in packs to compensate for their inferior swordplay trick them into single combat to negate their numerical advantage  superstitious to the extreme many monsters will cower at the sight of precious metals and symbols of human order carrying a gold or platinum ring to brandish in emergencies could save your life
  do not bully the order soldiers  the vast majority of them dont know any better  bully the highranking members of the government instead thatll show them
  order soldier in the mountains freezing cold and on edge fearful for his life  brandishing his sword ready to be mercilessly murdered and devoured like all his propaganda told him he would be if he ever lowered his guard  happens to encounter a yeti out for a stroll who just gives him a friendly wave and a hello  its only a matter of time
a group of rabbits is called a fluffle  have a nice day
  fluffy fluffe
  im gonna fluff the fluffy fluffles fluff while fucking them
  any yeti not immediately moving to snug an obviously cold man in the snow  doubt
i dont know why shes so upset her milfyness just serves to fuel my erection
  then tell us how to bully the high ranking government officials and the chain of command of the order then    how do you bully the orders top officials and chain of command
  there will be time for that after a friendly greeting she needs to notice him first after all
  with big butt kunoichis a lot of big butt kunoichis and shady tanukis
  ywn get rescued out of a snowstorm by the local yeti and white horn snow patrol duo
  how do you bully the orders top officials and chain of command  given how many officials and clerks seem to marry their 100 human tm bosses and secretaries the problem may be taking care of itself    but it never hurts to send them forged documents that look like official orders
  they have no right being this pure

  reassuring your white horn daughteru that there is no hunter under her bed how do i know because i am the hunter then proceed to tickle her furiously while cackling
  the pharaoh will protect
  this camouflage seems to be lacking something mainly camouflage
slimes are so versatile
  oh fuck thats awesome
  get ready to surprise tofu delivery yeti with a hug when she gets home  front door opens and youre ready to pounce  all the lights go off in the house  when the lights come back on she has her paws wrapped around you with a deadpan expression  i bet its those damn honda drivers teaching her dirty tricks
  it was me bambi  i banged your mom
  cease your grapery
  noone can stop the grape train
  considering how many foods are marketed as turning your tongue a color imagine how much fun a sandworm would have with them
  no
  i love images like these monstergirls interacting and being sexy together
  no graping there only loving twinsisters
  i want yukari to be my momster
  so she would be your archtrumpart or powerful nurarihyon momster
  probably and arch trumpart
  that means growing up in wonderland though maybe it will be a japanese wonderland inside wonderland since she is an archtrumpart and all also i imagine her being a very overbearing momster she got them allseeing dimension powers after all
  dem necks
  arent echidnas wonderful
how are you doing shedding that thanksgiving weight
  id be okay with that as long as she holds me close to her chest sometimes
  sorry anon but my friend who draw that kiki still busy on university he cant finish anytime soon  i hope its finished before christmas     heres some progress

  try again a few months later  hold a cup of hot cocoa to discourage any sudden attacks  get tacklehugged by the first yeti  get blindsided by her twin who was in hiding forcing you to make a sudden hairpin turn  they use the sudden shift in momentum to drag you straight to their bedroom  the only thing that doesnt spill that night is the hot cocoa  how do they do it
  hopefully she doesnt get too jealous of me hanging out with the busty dark mage librarian
  i want to be bullied by gazerchan
  meat is majestic
  you got it coming
  did someone say meat
  yes  gonna fluff the wendis coat
  thatd the danger of living in the big titty gensokyo part of wonderland
  one of these girls is a blushing virigin  the other is just a regular virgin
the night is young anonlets go out and have some fun
  big titty wonderland is best part of wonderland   next to big booty wonderland and just north of soft wonderland
  big titty wocks with some pudge
  meh
  blame the alices not them  tea parties have lots of cake
  arent the mad hatters the ones who organize the wonderland parties
someone posted this in the previous thread and i hate to ask to be spoonfed but would anyone happen to know the source reverse image search turns up absolutely nothing for it
  she might take you to her gap realm forever
  yes but they send out the alices to invite folks  noone can say no to an alice much to the despair of wocks
cc dryads
  most alices dont come from wonderland they will eventually go there but considering an alice that goes to wonderland loses her main gimmick it would be stupid to think wonderland sends them out not to mention they are a rare genetic mutation of the vanilla succubus and not something created by the queen of hearts like the other wonderland girls

  cute not what youd usually write either
  i wounder how a lich would react if she made a potion that would make her her body look exactly like what her soontobeboyfriend loves and after she drank it she stayed exactly the same
  the old love potion conundrum
  they call her the queen of darkness because when she wraps her legs around your head there is no light
    all can come for me so long as theyre big and soft   those that arent can still come theyre wip

how would a fire dragon react to an adventuring challenging her with 100 fire resist armor
  shed rip it open like it was paper and leave the poor adventurer in his/her underwear
  shed start sweating and feeling all hot and bothered physical contact would be a must then
  would she then form a cage around them with her wings and mount him
this yeti is too cool
  if he was a guys yes if it was a girl thenwell she has all sorts of cursed items lying around
  a fire dragon  sweating  aanon

remember that nerd maids when left alone start gaming groups with each other
  nice sotn drop nerd
  tfw not a young lord with a tall demon maid
    delivery for anon
  tfw no head maid dm gf
  imagine walking in on two kikis roleplaying a scenario in which they tie up and mercilessly violate their master with a shog as their dm    but theyre using fatal
  kiki maid sheepishly asking her master if it is okey she is hosting a lanparty at the mansion
  would be great   especially in a mulimaid location     youd have the whole party right there      no      would be nice wholesome bonding
direct hit
  this is an unexpected development
  where do i sign
  you could do some good larping with the whole mansion available too of course your session with just the dm would turn into erp
  oh my yes
  kiki lanparty at masters mansion  full on trashtalking between the kikis while they are gaming  master enters the room with snacks and soda  rooms goes completely quiet save for video game noises  here you go are you having fun   shy kiki noises intensifies    master leaves the room   wow your master is so cooool
  anon many sessions would end in erp   because theyd all be my maids      cute maids
shot to the heart and youre to blame
  nice body once again ruined by a negroid face
  lol
  sorry i didnt realize you were a slut i cant actually blame you
  dangerously short skirt
  that 5 oclock shadow  sumimasen nani the fuck
  why do sneks have to be like that
  this art is shit
  mge lamias are insanely possessive  emg lamias are literal cuckqueans  really makes you think
  mini towels for each of her snakes  how can one girl be so perfect
  one of the great mysteries of the universe
  why do sneks have to be like that  perfect
  im a slut for my wives
  as any selfrespecting well adjusted anon should be
  perfect living body pillows
  random crits are fair and balanced
  fancy the bow eh more of swordgirl myself
  thats us for them though
  is this an echidna or a medusa
  i figured we were more like one of those squeezable stress balls
  lamia species are made for using each other as your personal dakis
  thiq snek
  echidna has two snakes  medusa has multiple snakes  you tell me
  we have the pillow form for them to coil around
it is interesting how little attention cat girls get within mge except for faggot cat
  cats are normie tier
  jinkos get plenty of attention the rest are just not particularly noteworthy or otherwise verboten
  dogs are superior
  so are snakes but they got tons of art and shit
  i wonder if ropurotto sabbath witches can be other beastmen types because i would love a sabbath cat witch
  look at that little one on the right she knows exactly what a pregnancy means
  lamia are vanilla by monster girl standards but cat girls are normalfag tier
  and those rotten elves
  still less normalfag than mermaids
  of course they can so long as they give into their animal instincts    just imagine cuddling with a litter of little kitten witches
this is an angelsee the halo
  i want a baphomet that acts like senko or just senko
  would you adventure with a strongfat lamia swordswoman
around foxes watch your crotches
  maybe if she dual wields  i need the thematic consistency of two fangs
  kumiho
  i would probably adventure with a strongfat anything
  what weapons does she have   strongfat implies shes not big on dex       same
  strongfat  this is the dumbest meme bodytype
  lord no
    she dual wields claymores because she grew up learning the style and got strong enough to just keep scaling up      good man
  good girl   shes gonna get bred
  nekomatas are great  werecats really got shafted with all these unique feline mgs
  not as dumb as pearshaped loli
  worse a nationalistic boat
  pearshaped lolis actually have tons of art while strongfat doesnt checkmate
  that or a dragon though considering i have zero fighting ability i imagine id be a dead weight
  that one actually exists though
  there are actually two akagis in the story thanks timetravel shenanigans by the bad guysone is obsessed with avenging japans defeat in ww2 the other is obsessed with shikikans dick
  why is she so shiny
  shes a sweaty rubber slut
  i thought it was due to lmaos making copies of things on top of the other simulation shenanigans regardless that fox is a no because shes a little crazy either way
titania wearing a tiny santa hat
  he doesnt want a crazy fox waifu
  anon look   oh cute   its a hat   so it is     its tiny too   i see dear  yeah   i got nothin
  i wish for you to be curvier
  pretty cute anyway titanias are always doing their best
  no thats really all you need for a titania shed be beaming
  every knight needs a squire all youd have to do is hand her her sword
    yes  my man
  prehusband    posthusband one week   oh i love this
  they sure are shed even get a cute top with bells on her boobs that she jingles around not knowing how it effects you in other ways     protecc her smile
  bigger
  and thats only the beginning
  humming i dream of jeannie theme    humming assntitties
  imagine her giving a lapdance where she uses her magic to make her body fit your tastes
  she better be ready for a long one   because master is a pervert
  genie xl is going to get stuck in her lamp
  long as its ass out
good night anons take care and dont burn down the thread     instead please make sure to let your genie know that you dream of her  or someone like her    its kinda weird
  i had a dream of you last night genie   ehee of course you did was my exotic beauty just too much to contain  actually i dreamed you had black hair fuller lips and much bigger tits with pale skin  pouting genie noises   in fact i wish  shut it jerk   she tackles you even as she still starts transforming her body intent on punishing you with her updated body
  you act like that wasnt her plan the whole time
  fairies seem more appealing with size comparison putting them at babydoll size
  meanwhile the nightmare next door makes notes for her next preperation
    fatfags go to /d/
  anon all that happened was her tits got bigger
  look at her lower back and under the ass those are fat rolls
  nah you can tell that there would be some abdominal extrusion if the view were from a different perspective
  i need an adulllllllllttt
  nav has drawn fat fuck girls before
dont touch it
  god damn how can a girl so vanilla be so nice still
  most people have fallen for the thick psyop what used to be considered fat is now referred to as thick in an attempt to normalize it
  all hail latenight
anubutt won
    i bet a vanilla succ would give fantastic hugs the kind of hug that eases the tension right out of your body
  cripes
  watch your fucking language
  mommy
  oh baby
  full image when
  even if the man is happy with his monster wife how would his friends and family react to his disappearance would there be problems with him reentering society such as possibly getting excommunicated
  who cares
be wandering zipangu swordsmen  trying to achieve true unity with the sword  youre certain youll achieve it on the border of life and death  fight other swordsmen to the death on sight  neither of you have words that cant be expressed through the dance of naked blades  continue this for years while racking up kills and a reputation  get attacked by some girl with a rusty sword  babbles something about killing her father  didnt catch the rest of it as you cut her down the moment she swung  feel kind of bad but she swung first  then she shows up again a few weeks later  and again  and again  she gets better every time  duels are getting closer and closer  amused to find she actually cut you slightly that last clash  can feel your skill growing by the time she can fight toetotoe with you  feel youll push into mastery if you can put her down for good  surely monsters are good for something other than what the demons tell you
  my mom would want nothing to do with my waifu but shed probably be happy for me nonetheless  holidays would be rough
  
  are you hot for your actual aunt anon
  nah i just really like the inspired pics
  as nice as this all sounds i could never give up the life im living for some sexy tart with fur and fangs
im so cold
  i care
  so cute i want to touch her horns
  what kind of animal has such long ears with such a fluffy tail
  those candles are a fire hazard
  thats a good way to get husbandod
  try rubbing a tsuraras icicles until she ahegaos and gets pleasure chills
  fennec fox maybe
  nah too skinny
  sweaty rubber slut
    is this the same girl from the image where a dark elf is giving her husband a titjob and sees that the window is open right as he comes
  hey this will be a good idea i should post this
  its one of those animal people from wildstar
i want to see macho cow candy ravage    
  behold  city throat jews i mean zipangu danuki merchants
  the older raccoons have a lot of economic wisdom to impart
  you need to keep an eye on those dark elves especially if youre a human barbarian
  that dark elf assassin is my kinda girl great body great career choice fantastic outfit would adventure with
  kc taking a side job its so fantastic how much hes improved in such a short time seriously
  kc fgo servant when
  shes probably got a soft sultry voice like a whisper thats always right next your ear disappearing at seemingly random times only for her to reappear behind you when its convenient for her at least    a bit of a loose cannon that even if you dont invite her will follow you at a distance with curiosity sneaking into your tent at night to get a closer look
  oh anon youre speakin my language   bonus points if shes eternally confident and assured of her prowess and her sex appeal and that she knows how to use both to get what she wants thats my kind of girl and id certainly leave my tent flap open subconsciously when were in camp
  shed be a much higher level than the rest of your party whenever it looks like youre about to meet your end your opponent will sprout a throwing knife out of his neck and fall over    or you might make your way through a dungeon and wont even notice that both your dark elf assassin is missing and that all the traps youve encountered appear to have been skillfully disarmed
sometime you just need a reminder that theres good shit going on in the world
  perfection  get to the midway point of a dungeon   map says its recommended to take a well needed rest which confuses you and your healer a modest holstaur cleric  but we didnt face any enemies or traps like the map said   a voice like aromatic black coffee oozes out from right behind you  scouting can get so boring when the threats go down so easily sorry about that   even though holstcleric yips and jumps youve gotten used to this enough that you just sigh without turning and dignifying her smug stance  yeah well it helps us get better if we face some of these things too  holstmage stutters out her own protest  mmiss assassin your prowess is indeed renowned the country over bbut i shant improve without experience  dark elf assassin nonchalantly shrugs and struts past her  i meant no harm by it if you like ill just stay behind i doubt anything in here would really give you any more trouble than that poor vice you call a bra  holstmage blushes furiously going to cover her chest as you furrow your brow at the aloof master assassin  big words coming from a lady in a skimpy loincloth  oh perhaps youd rather i take it off   oh shes good
  poor holstcleric she wants to be devout to her goddess but her megaholstism means shes probably doomed to end up a milkfactory
  that art definitely isnt it
  i like it and thats good enough for me
  such an ascetic meal
    its obviously a blessing from her goddess and i think we should celebrate and thank the goddess by making as many new worshipers as possible in the form of children
  good for you bless the mind too small for doubt
  getting ready for the hibernation cuddles
which mg would make the best holiday meals
  trolls obviously theyre the most wholesome homecooking masters
  just cuz theirs better stuff out there doesnt mean i cant enjoy the little stuff
  i was not being sarcastic
  youre on a roll latenight
  ln draws some great fluff
  that he does and great cats too  this taste its the taste of my husband
  this is peak performance paws   im not sure how handholding and interlocking fingers will work with her having four digits though
considering monster girls have strange ways of marrying their husbands what would your waifu do to show that the two of you are married
  ever seen the movie dragonheart
  a tattoo around my neck with a medusa head on the front on my adams apple the number of snakes emerging from her head is the same as the number of daughterus ive impregnated her with and she wont let me out in public with less than five
  rings each inlaid with a magic gem mine infused with her mana and hers with my mana  also a big ol bite scar on my neck/shoulder
  arachnes would definitely have you wear something made out of their silk what that is would depend on her personality  my atlachnacha would make me wear something shameful like a choker      nothing tops a monster girl who gets upset whenever you try to wear something that would conceal the bite mark she gave you
  how is a choker shameful shed make a shirt that said kid diddler beware dads instead
  how is a choker shameful  this
    if you cant see why wearing the choker/collar a monster girl put on you is shameful then you can only be described as a slut
  your problem is that youre thinking like a human
  slut  fully committed to one partner  anon please dont use words you dont understand
building a sentry    erectin a dispenser    teleporter going up
  not enough minerals
  you can be a complete slut who would let a monster girl do anything to you because of how much youre committed to her  just ask all the sluts for dragons out there
  but im not a slut sluts are promiscuous
  this is true
  nerdy gremlins who modify ancient automatons to look futuristic like in her favorite games must be stopped      you can argue about the wording but that doesnt change the fact that youd give a dragon any sort of sexual favors shed ask you for
  you can argue about the wording but that doesnt change the fact that youd give a dragon any sort of sexual favors shed ask you for  of course i would but the word slut still doesnt apply you need to use words rusty
  but there is a difference between the slut for dragons and dragonfags the latters love goes even beyond slutty
  this succubus must fantasize heavily about having a sonhusbando
    tfw no genie momster
  dragonfags would contain themselves in weird draconic cults there is no need to worry about them        succubus momster who showers with you with affection but lewds you way too much  genie momster who is a bit more distant but makes your dreams come true when you lewd her  tough choice is having two moms ok
  is having two moms ok  depends on how possessive they are
  weird draconic cults  youre just jealous of my cool robes
  i just see chokers as an accessory something like a necklace
  the wife would honestly do nothing different since in her eyes we were married since i said hi  the daughters are the ones who eventually get her to go through a more humanlike wedding ceremony then shed just keep a ring on her and id do the same 
  dragons keep getting worshipped but all they want is some love i bet a married one would be annoyed with all the stalkers shed have
  id be fine with a collar  its even funnier because my favourite monster girls are canine types
  shell be traditional and legalize the marriage on paper and give me a ring its barbaric to just rape a man and say youre married without any ceremony
  yer ugleh
  i cant really imagine a lamia having her husband wear a collar what would snek husbands have to wear besides her tail obviously
  nureonago
  i really miss the bigger paws and claws
  no fuck you these are perfect
  nah fuck you i like what i like you like what you like
loli amazons are for defeating mating pressing until she goes from defiantly glaring to orgasm faces pounding butthole from behind and telling her that her toned bottomheavy body is a high quality fucktoy
  as long as you accept that you like the wrong things
  how many goats need to be sacrificed to vada to make this a thing
  tfw you will never have two adopted momsters who what to protect you from all the whores who just want you for your dick  they will never decide to be your wives and shower you with motherly love every day  the best combo would be one plump ara ara momster that does usual mother stuff and one strongfat tomboy momster that likes to watch sports and play vidya with you
  this is true  the softer the better
valkyrie mother and daughter go on an adventure  daughter is known only as girl

how about a comedy duo if anon and a cheshire  no trolling just a good old fashioned comedy act

  it must be comfy in that cave
  caves are the best theres a reason our ancestors dwelt therein you should go explore one
  well to sum it up in one line  tumblr tumblr gender fuckery entitled little shit    we good we good  lets talk dragons
  we need more images like this    cute human boys or lonely human men all alone but it turns out a monstergirl is just nearby stalking them and about to pounce and claim em
  its like a mimics chest but with more sand and the broadest bed imaginable
  lets talk dragons  dragons are vain creatures and as such are likely to own many mirrors discuss
  then i shall steal her gold as she examines herself in a mirror
  dragons are just big lizards and are therefore too stupid to know what mirrors are theyd probably get really confused and aggressive seeing a mirror because theyd think another dragon has come to steal their gold  tiny lizard brains
  but she smell your scent she can feel your air

  stop being dead kiki
  tfw no undead kikimora with pale skin and white hair/feathers who doesnt need to sleep and spends all night watching me sleep
  kiki on vacation inconceivable
panda
  finally shoggy has someone other than her relatives to talk to at night
  its more likely than you think
  kiki goes on vacation  gets hotel room  sees a spec of dust  hijacks the cleaners cart and does a deep clean of the room instead of going to the beach
  i wonder what dragons think of dragonslayers  mortal enemys  stupid humans who need to be shown the superiority of dragons
  kiki goes to the beach  theres too much sand  come on selkie well clean it off in half a year if you dont mind the work
  god did not look upon her kind with favor but mamanobama fixed all that
  sounds like a website to have laid with dragons
  wonderland beaches are lovely this time of year especially at midnight when the sun is shining
  thicc selkie singing of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and kings  on second thought lets not go to wonderland it is a silly place
  asking for money  she is going to get babies instead
  goofy eh hehehehehe      i want a super thick kiki
  alternatively she refuses to have mirrors because she doesnt believe some burnt sand could ever truly reflect her beauty but also because that immense vanity comes at the cost of self doubt
  dragon zombies are best dum dums
  would be fun bringing her to outings with me   although shed need a more casual outfit compared to her normal uniform
  oh no i must reassure her with eskimokisses
  eskimo
  i just really like the idea of rubbing noses together with her i didnt mean to be culturally insensitive to the inuit seals
  excellent

do not have sex with your kids
  why tamamo all purple and and horny
anon what is that strange contraption  thats a ferris wheel its a ride people can go on its pretty fun and you get a nice view at the top    would you like to ride on it  yes
  gremlin wheel
  can i have sex with someone elses kids
  pouting momster
  sure just not mine
  a gremlin wheel is the same thing except its capable of rolling around
  what if the gremlin who made it is called ferris
  instead of electricity its powered entirely on spirit energy couples that get on it need to express their affection during the ride or theyll be stuck on the top usually the romantic view from the top ensures something will happen sooner or later
  momster wouldnt have sex with their kids though unless the father was into it
  sounds like a qt
  meant their adopted son
  wouldnt really be their kid in a way
  but if you dont let your daughteru go out and find a good man shes gonna turn all that lust on you
  you arent the boss of me fucko
  i cant stand it anymore anon poseidon wills that you impregnate me
  its not the ocean thats making me wet
  
busty holst cleric is out of mana and needs rest to get back spells  warrior anon tells her to still do the motions for the spells anyway  she considers it a miracle that his spirit still seems to get renewed from this  anon on the other hand is staring sheepishly at her massive breasts jiggling around and suddenly feels like he can fight on a bit longer
  sexy dark elf assassin is looting through a treasure chest in front of anon  bent over at the waist her big full ass is on full display as she rummages and wiggles around  anon is right behind her with a front row view  hmm there may be a hidden compartment or it may be a trap are we feeling lucky  anon gulps as she widens her legs a bit further  vvery
    i feel like this harem er party needs one more member a bard/buffer of some kind
  i said a bard buffer not a buff bard
  the way i see it dark elf assassin is much higher level than warrior anon holst cleric is the same level so they need a cute low level buffer to protecc
  a maus with a flute
  was she inspired by the pied piper
  dumb lizard
for some reason i find succ/demon wings very appealing i want to pull them gently
  the oatmealthick vanilla cutiepatootie theyre attached to definitely helps
  shes his biggest fan
  
  i want to lightly caress a loli demons wings before or after intense contractless age gap mating
  fweep fwoo fweeep   whether or not her playing has any magical effects its so cute the whole party is invigorated   even the often cocky and personally assured assassin cant help but squeal in delight when maus bard practices her scales
  are wings erogenous zones too becaouse i want to fondle them
we know that runa is maris daughter  but who is her husband
  i headcanon them that way its probably more like the webbing between your fingers in actuality but it also kind of makes sense that theyd be a bit sensitive for more controlled flight
  mantis shrimp are overrated
  theyre succubi their existence is nothing but an erogenous zone
how many of you are autistic enough to have dreamed of your waifu last night i had a dream of a wendigo or something close enough
  just having a virgin man in their vicinity sets them off and they start breathing heavily and sweating
  ive never had a true waifu dream even in 3 years of being with her im super autistic though
  ive dreamt of my waifu a lot and its always really nice
  i rarely dream but i think i had some snake related fragments over the past couple nights
  dreams are random  no telling what enters the mind  that said ive had my share of monster girl dreams kobold dragon shit load of arachne dreams but only one of the waifu for some reason
  and then theres that  polymorphous succubus  unironically gets off when you hold her hand  or hug her  or pat her leg  you thought there were only so many times a day a man could ejaculate but youve learned how wrong you were
      i wonder if they waggle their tail and flap their wings too that would be really cute
  i really dont have a set waifu my favorites are always changing but i have had numerous dreams of mge girls the most memorable was with a cheshire cat right before a date i got to brush her hair it was so fucking soft and perfect she was so sweet and i just wish i could dream about her again because i know its the closest ill ever to get to one since theyre not real    ill say this though when i do dream about a monster girl that girl becomes my favorite for some time after depending on how intense the dream was it does not happen very often though in fact its quite rare     i wonder if theres a way to force yourself to have mge dreams
  i dont see why they wouldnt people fidgit in the real world
  i dont really have dreams for the most part  when i do they are almost entirely incoherent
  lucid dreaming is a thing but it takes effort
  this is amplified by at least ten times if the monster is a more sophisticated high class lady like this would be especially dangerous to my kokoro when a demon did it      i actually had a strange dream yesterday where everyone but me could fly like in dragon ball but i couldnt and nobody wanted to tall how to do it and always skipped the subject i asked them to launch me into the clouds where a shark girl lived who could teach me as i approached it and said hi she immediately tried to chomp me down and i tried to hold her back by holding her mouth then i woke up  the strange thing i never was into them and i mostly completely forgot about them
  no waifu but ive dreamed of some of my favourite races before one of them even got kinda lewd but finished before anything serious happened
  detalis
could you love a girl without an outline
  nice im pretty sure it was a wendigo it was mostly white and cold but i was resting my head on her lap while she ran her claws through my hair occasionally giving me a love nibble
  ive had a handful of dreams with her cant remember when the last one was though
  cute shark
  thats very cute and incharacter for a wendigo for me it was my anubis waifu the first dreams being her and i walking through a snowy forest funnily enough other dreams have been things like cuddling in bed or having a nice date together
  once in a while i get a monster girl dream but not about my waifu yet
  dracowisp half the result of a dragon dying a virgin
  not nearly as often as i would like im being hit with dreams as an alp
  same here i keep telling myself its a ghost or nightmare that cant figure out how to make their illusion 3rd person
  ive had one monstergirl dream in the last six months and it left me confused  i was standing next to a hellhound and a demon i think and the hellhound was chewing tobacco the hellhound spat and the the demon said i really wish you wouldnt do that the hellhound responded ive had this chew in for seven days and the dream abruptly ended
    just give in and enjoy the dreams anon after all its not a nightmare
  monster girl or not what bothers me is that even in my dreams im too selfconscious doesnt help that my subconscious loves adding my family members everywhere so i cant exactly do anything too frisky as my grandma keeps entering the room
  t noob nightmare
  it is now
  i asked the wendigo if i could call her mommy and she got a little weirded out i know exactly what you mean about being selfconscious
  i remember one time i was try to romance a succubus in my dream she punched a couple of teeth out of my jaw kicked me in the groin then threw me over a railing maybe love and romance isnt for me
  classic tsundere
  i had a long dream about trying to steal tomatoes from a oddly well patrolled closed restaraunt  alarunightmare

  genie phone virtual assistant  instead of the top of a bottle/lamp she resides in the headphone jack on the top of the device  simply tap a button or open her app and she appears in a puff of blue smoke  for private wishes you can type your wishes to her in the app but you must either have built up credit with her from prior trysts or wait to have your wish granted after you give her your due  because shes in your phone she can act as a personal assistant too but dont expect to keep things on the device hidden from her  she will default to using her connections on the internet first for granting wishes normally but can easily use magic to do the rest  you can either charge the phone normally or you can pleasure your genie and get it back to 100 instantly    hey stud youve got a meeting in 15 minutes traffic is bad so youre not going to make it give me 10 minuets with you and youll be at your meeting 5 minutes early clean and ready to go whattya say

this is probably the only place left to talk about monster girls that isnt tainted by furfag filth good job
  i wanna see a wurm on a reality tv dating show called the love tunnel
  i dunno theres some pretty comfy one on one convos and smaller places that are still undoubtedly antifurfag
  congratulations contestant you win
  what do i win
  i want to touch her spade
  i want to lick it
  but isnt that their whole thing when a girl monsterizes into one its like theyre deevolving
  love tunnel  cave of rape  wheel of pleasure  who wants to fuck a millionaire  the size is right  family fun  dick arcade  double dare  monstergirl entertainment is weird
  based kuro drawing more golems
  anyone know the artist
  
  big and soft butts
  i bet the newlyweds game is much more interesting with monsters especially those that get married at the moment of rape
  thank you anon
  now
  oh lawd
  too small
  very good but what about her tail or am i blind
  no tail
  no tail  barely any ass to speak of
  made for prone boning good lord
would monster girls have a signature dish exclusive to their race
  what makes anubutts so good
  it got in the way so decided to get rid of it just because
  dear god i have a mighty need for desertdog
  well magic and polymorph is a thing so its alright still awesome
  cute footsies
  given how humans in mge were apparently created by the gods instead of evolving from primates i doubt it
  jesus
  understandable monster girl anatomy can be hard at times
  they are based on a mythological rape monkey creature from china     
  signature dishes would depend on the cooking skills of the individual
  you know that whould have been the perfect time to post a gazer
  not all species eat food and a lot of those that do are wild types that probably just eat what they find
  paws for effect
  christmas potluck in winterstown  wendigo brings the stretchy meat  yeti brings all sorts of fancy hot chocolate drinks  yukionna already is a christmas cake  whitehorn brings a scavenged pile of trimmed wild grasses and sedges seening equal parts proud of herself and shyly looking for your approval
    i was thinking about this section  it is said that they could easily influence humans because their demonic energy is highly compatible with humans but according to another explanation a susceptibility to pleasure and a lack of selfcontrol such as what they exhibit is something that is originally inborn in humans as well so because humans and kakuen are closely related if a human crosses a certain line they can easily fall as a monkey
  wendigos win again
  machi and succ teacher are the best
  yukichan can take all the christmas cake jokes she makes a great frozen ice cream cake that goes well with yetis hot cocoa to warm you back up
wish evileye girl blushes the most from eye contact
  owl mage is owl made for eye contact
  gazer without a doubt
  really nice to see stuff from you again     looking forward to more
      what is the point of posting random contextless images all it does is burn through the image count like a crack addict in a snow storm
  not just drawing the root of the tail and having transition into transparency  i know itd not impossible for you loen also her ass is too small
  its not
    implying loen didnt just kill it like wocks third tentacle     anubis doesnt have a tail anymore
  which fuck
  you have to take a trip in to the tunnel for the bonus round to find your prize
  im usually a slime guy but damn thats a fine sandwan i actually like a lithe tight body so shes perfect
  and yet i always feel like i would wake up staring into one of her eyestalks
  you might be able to fluster a vampire by knowing what theyre capable of and choosing to gaze into their eyes anyway
  kiss the eye stalk right on the pupil
  blue
  i would probably be too scared to respond  i try to flail about only to realize shes spooning me from behind  i can feel her breath on my neck  kihihihihihihi  you smell nice today
    but thats her weak spot
  someone post the troll butt pictures please
  nobody knows what causes the spammers to spam even posting a quick comment next to the picture does far more for discussion than a random photo
  this 
  oh god im blind
  im almost convinced that theyre bots instead of people which sucks since the shitty moderation crew still does fuckall to clean the spam up
  what a content innocent wurm
  why would you be scared of your wife    good thing ive got spares
  size mamono
  this demon looks too pure
  good lord
  pure horndog
  this is the beeg i like in my girls
adorible
  very cute always liked your sketches like this  can you do a pharaoh please your anubis got me in the mood for brown girls
  now we are talking
  this is just beyond reasonable is this what wonderland cows look like
  mostly though theyre probably any one of several bright colors with flavored milk corresponding to the color
  cow with those proportions with a whimsical wonderland attitude and bright pink hair making strawberry milk   were reaching muh levels that shouldnt even be possible
  strawberry milk  and its ruined
dumb bear
    thank you
  next youll be saying something ridiculous like chocolate milk is good
  a polar bear girl finally    and shes big
  youre goddamn right
  ywn encounter a holst bent over a fence and wiggling her ass at you as if to say just fuck me already
  then perhaps youd like a sultry yet equally whimsical chocolate wonderland holstaur   just be careful she reeeeally likes feeding you her milk  reeeeally likes it   all the time
  yeah thats about the ideal size for my hellwife  granted i dont see her starting that way but shed sure be there after a few pups
  i want her to smothercuddle me
oh right this crusade is finished so i thought id leave this here for yall reverse point of view headpats maybe your waifu is one of those in there either way enjoy them if youd like    
  i would mating pres her so hard
  polar bear girl heads to bandit forest to visit her cousin grizzly girl  they go chest to chest completely identical in size their big strongfat bodies indomitable   the grizzly is frowning angrily while the polar is happily smiling  anon gulps wondering if this means hell have to cook twice as much fish to appease them
  your next line is  fuck off ace
  holy clinical autism
  i like the titania one at the end giving her beloved fairy knight a pat for protecting her fairies
  vocal percussion on a whole nother level
  i hadnt seen that nura i like it  i wont complain about more monstergirl art so thanks for posting this
  eat shit and die you dumb nigger ace
  some of them are good but theres one too many tumblresque noses and faces for my liking in there
  the unagi joro will haunt my nightmares
  this just reminded me of the fact that polar bears have black skin irl meaning polar bear girls would also be chocolate colored which i think would look really lovely
  well done sir knight  but my lady i didnt do anything   she warmly smiles and tossles his hair  sir knight you do not even know how much you do every single day just being you that alone is worthy of praise  she tilts your chin up to look at her  please smile good sir knight
  cute  gonna give them all the snacks they could want and let them move in  theyre gonna get groped
  most of those faces are completely fucked
  can i put it in her other weak spot to make it weaker
  isnt that also how silver foxes are
  as long as they have food to munch on theyll happily just laze around and let your hands rub and squeeze every single curve and crevice lazy bear girls are so wonderful
  god fuck off you shitposting nigger
  some of these are nice ill give you that but you should go beg for attention somewhere else
  when does she enter the picture
  that they are   would happily be their daiki and fill them with cubs
good night anons take care and dont burn down the thread   instead remember that you shouldnt just go inserting new mods into automatons     weird things happen if you do
nojya
  just when you think things couldnt get any worse as the two huge cousins are lumbering towards the fire a massive shadow looms overhead with a loud heeeyaaa   you look up to see a ren xiongmao just as big as the other two girls in a toosmall qipao holding a sturdy bamboo staff that she must have vaulted with   she slams into the other two flooring them with her huge ass as polar laughs and grizzly growls  nihao cousins how are you gonna have visit without best cousin silly gwailo   they all get to their feet my god all that meat everywhere the clearing is barely big enough and without a word stretch their arms out even the grizzly  all three yell out  bear huuuug   and slam into each other in a big group hug  they stay like this for a minute and youre too busy staring to do anything when they suddenly all turn at you  so cousins who is this  the ren licks her lips the polar raises an eyebrow and the grizzly even smirks a bit as she scratches her hip  youre gonna die you just know it death by flattening theyre gonna have to peel you off the floor like a loony toon
  maybe your waifu is one of those in there  you seem to have an aversion to her but maybe thats a good thing
  that panda better be careful or shes going to be showing off that fat ass of hers although really any one of them could pop out at any time
  tfw no foxwife
cute wolf
  lone wolves are for marrying
  snout  fuck off retard      you too
  yiff in hell furfag
  the ren bending over in her undersized qipao at the stove fat ass in thin white panties on full display  the polar sleepily stretching her back with her arms over her head her extrasized tits pushed out and slipping out of her toosmall bra  the grizzly lifting the massive boulder used as a door for the cave her huge muscles flexing out as she merely gives a small grunt   anon come help me cook   anon come take a nap with me  anon quit pussyfootin and start groping one of us already  your move goldilocks
  not a single loli  sad
  slap the grizzlies ass promise the polar bear a nap after cooking help the ren cook
  ice bear will have cuddles now
    i bet you hatefuck masterbate to polt too ya wankers
  
  it is headpats from like lolis are the cutest
  cant decide which accents polar and grizzly should each have ren is obvious     the grizzly rumbles an approval the polar rolls around on the bed with a sigh but seems to go along with it and the ren happily gives a few claps before strongarming you over  you spend the next few minutes rolling and packing meat dumplings with her seasoning them a bit as well while making small talk and trying not to stare at her ass which has slipped out from under her qipao   finally you dump an absurd amount of meat dumplings into a big pot as it boils over the stove  nice work gwailo now that mines cooking lets make some for the other girls and you of course   that was just for her
  slapping a grizzlys fat bottom is a fast way to become her forest bride
    this is why crabmans shit should be rejected all 12beast and emgniggers do is spam shit
  im going to need a nap after this  and they probably will after the snack too       forest groom   she may be more muscled but theres no stopping that im the dude
  director tomoaki koshida  script/series composition yoshiko nakamura  character design miwa oshima  studio doga kobo
  thats the fat bear ass im talkin about     dont expect to get any sleep for the first few hours of that nap   finally anon is on the bed the girls are all fed and they all crawl in at once with him  you absentmindedly wonder if one can write a will for their own pelvis  and they lived meatily ever after
  this      commission loli headpatting maybe grelia headpatting her patient or other bapho
  would be well worth it   three strongfat bears hopefully with kids on the way and a comfy life  may need to even it out with a private nap with the polar bear though hers technically became a group activity
  66 chance of a butterface if hes commissioning it
  i was thinking about that with grelia  tiptoeing on a stepstool next to a patients bed patting a patients head and telling them not to overexert themselves  she ought to take her own advice
  may have to even it out with the polar bear though  that right there that is why youre the man anon  as theyre all panting with you fully drained you weakly croak out that you still owe the polar a nap  shes taken aback at your consideration and spends the whole next day cuddling and pampering you in bed while the other girls go about their day  each girl of course got pregnant that night too
  bears are always the superior option
  whats poor grelias longest shift without sleep   two three years
  christmas bear
  good   just because one has a harem doesnt me they can be a slacker you gotta love them all
  youre a splendid gentleman anon youve earned them all
  good  although sitting them all on a couch at a family gathering would be difficult considering their sizes
  comin through my mind
  or maybe something like  runya finds her oniichan who fell asleep during archive work  she sits down across the table to headpat him but falls asleep herself due to her narcolepsy  she still headpats him in her sleep
  i got a life and stopped coming to this thread on a daily basis now its all new and confusing so i just look at the pics
    i like the idea of a sabbath nap pile  it could be the new headpat
  what outfits would you get for each of them   what would be printed on each of their hotpants backsides
  that image  you tread a bad road
  its futa  well into the trash
  autism
  what is this retort supposed to accomplish i always see it used by newfags trying to defend faggy shit
  considering id let them wear what they want   the ren would probably do that normal chinese dress while switching to heavier dress and jacket in the winter   polar bear would probably just do jeans and a sweater in the winter due to how shes built with summer being her basically in shorts and a bra at all times   grizzly would probably do jeans a jacket and a  tanktop in winter with summer being shorts and said tank top     ren gets double wide  polar bear gets for lovin   grizzly gets big n firm
  newfags  anon
hey anon check this out
  runya ratas weresheeps and yetis would be the best nap pile
  very casual i love it you got three different flavors of wonderful strongfat wives with lots and lots of cubs on the way   good end
  sorry mate dont take checks just loadsa money
  thats one fat tail
  x lick cleavage   thatll throw her off
  nice tie
  thats good although seeing if any of them actually lose the baby weight would be interesting  although i really only see the grizzly doing that
  ren xiongmao may need to change those shorts to triple wide  polar bear would be confused for an oversized holst from a distance   and grizzly is the fiercest mother of them all so shed actually probably get even stronger to protect her cubs
  the best although the rens state is to be expected if shes doing the cooking  and a buffer grizzly is great   gonna milk the polar bear after buying her some cow print bras though
  wop your wallet
  intimate slow and sensual milking or rough passionate and sexyrough milking   the ren will expect you to spank that massive mistcontinent monsterbooty every time you walk by especially since her qipao just plain doesnt cover it anymore   and grizzly after a workout all sweaty would be a sight to see
    were seeing comfort levels that shouldnt be possible  zzzzz
  god can you imagine what winter will be like once hibernation sets in  they all plump up a bit more to make sure they stay nice and warm  they keep you squished between all three of their meaty bodies barely ever letting you slip from their collective bear hug  sometimes they shift in their sleep in a way that slips your dick inside them so they can milk you thoughout the long winter  damnit why are strongfat girls so best
  indeed you best make sure everything is in order before it officially starts youre not leaving that pile of sex and groping and pleasant soft sleep for months and months for anything  just a sea thickness for you to pleasure yourself between
  i cant believe there were people that tried to say it wasnt ace doing all these must have been you false flagging i wouldnt have minded these pics if you didnt spam them mindlessly or if some of their faces werent fucked
  serious question if you hate lewd so much then why do you even bother with mge
  they wake up in spring three months pregnant while you are a partially dehydrated husk whos barely managed to survive being wrung dry by drinking from their bountiful milk tanks  its a rough life but an enjoyable one nonetheless
reminder
  aye hard mountain life for a hard mountain man and his very very soft mountainous wives
what if cursed sword but with a really big sword does sword size correlate to thiccness
  reminder that you should take that shitty image back to achtchan
  does sword size correlate to thiccness  the size of the sword and bodytype of the host probably wouldnt correlate often
  not necessarily but sure why not an extra thick dragonslayer cursed sword would be delightful in her skimpy outfit
  imagine the milktanks
  imagine the thighs
grizzlies would make for excellent adoptive mothers discuss
  all this bear talk has made me love them for a lot of reasons and that wouldnt be half bad either  they are fantastic thiccfus
  grelia telling patient not to overexert themselves  30 minutes later nurse anon has to carry grelia back to her office since she fell asleep reviewing patient charts again   as you tuck her in to the pillow fort you made under her dusk she continues to recite the sepsis protocol in her sleep  a couple hours later she wakes up blushing and avoids eye contact with you  3rd time this week this has happened
  they would be since theyd have a strong motherly instinct to make sure their child is always happy and healthy that is until winter starts to roll around and they start to get lazy sleep to much and keep their child in a cozy bear hug to fight against the cold
reading the hill where love grows  damn people with monster wives are lazy  my ass that poor guy is double slave he is slaving at the farm and his wives   wake up at sunrise and fuck your wives  go to work in fields  clean up mess your wives cause  finally a lunch break now you can rela  nope wife ate the wrong fruit now you have to fuck her and then go back to work  work is done now i can finally rela  nope wife wants to be milked and dicked  eat your dinner finally time to rela  nope now you need to pack and move your goods to the merchant  finally night now i can sleep and rela  nope wives are horny and you need to fuck them till sunrise and then repeat everything again  spoopy

  well what is she

  trailer trash girls are pretty high tier especially if they are the kind of girls who will just molest you on a whim no matter where you are or who might see it happen theyd probably even get off on showing off their boytoy to everyone

  uh the reply actually goes to  
  whats the pastry on the plate
  blueberry jam tarts

post fumo chins
  cute
  thank you fedex may be dealing with mine but i dont know for sure which is unnerving
  inusakuya is so precious
  i still dont have my order info
  you can message ff through kickstarter for your tracking number and possibly the shipping option they chose
i havent found any fomu making resources online aside from some helpful pictures posted in the last thread i think im going to have to acquire a fomu and sacrifice her for the greater good if i am to make my goals a reality it will be for the best i have checked japanese internet and that is the best advice even they have
  again there is a reason why custom fumos arnt a common occurrence because the people who make them dont really post anything in the way of help/guides and if they do its because they get specifically asked to do so fumo making is an artform one that is very exclusive
  just because it is difficult does not mean i wont do it  just means im going to bitch moan and trash a lot of cheap walmart craft felt figuring it out
  more power to you mate just remember the success rate for anons in these threads saying theyll make a custom fumo is almost 0
assuming complete control
  missing texture chan
anyone know where i can get fumo raincoats or some plushie accessories
i used to not understand the phrase at the drop of a hat but owning a fumo has made me
  ｓｏｆｔ可ノ依
wazzup fumos dj s4n43 has come 2 cheer you up
  nendo plus sanny a cute
is there other 2hus you can make out of existing fumos there was that one anon who made yuugi out of a flan fumo but what others could you possibly make
i ordered my tenshi fumo a month ago and its supposed to ship soon however i got an email from gift that says they couldnt use my card which was true at that time and it looks like i have to transfer money to their account instead what should i do and how
introducing w530
  honestly you could probably make a rumia fumo out of a flan fumo without that much work cut the side ponytail remove her hat and give her a black outfit
  the skys the limit anon you just need to replace the hair clothes and possibly the back of the head to match the hair changing the expression and eye color is a bit harder but ive seen people do it before swapping the shoes is pretty much impossible without fully opening the fumo    heres a keine custom i found somewhere on twitter most likely made from a yukari fumo
  make a clownpiece from a marisa or flan
  you can make an okina fumo easily just take a yukari remove the ribbons and adjust the bangs slip on custom shoes custom clothes and a custom hat
kanako dekafumo
  heres some brainstorms    medicine from alice  lilly white/black from marisa  futo from sakuya  ichirin from cirno  shou from marisa/ran/yukari  seija from tewi  ringo from flan  narumi from kaguya
  ichirin from cirno
  wut he said   the only limits are your own willpower desu some characters are going to be much harder than others but its all up to you whether or not you can do it
  ive been thinking about making maribel and renko fumos from yukari and reimu main issue is that it would be really expensive to do in the first place and it would be even worse if i messed up
  the unfortunate truth is that you are quite likely to mess up somewhere if its your first time making a custom fumo and it is going to cost you quite a bit   dont let me discourage you though best of luck if you do decide to go for it maribel from yukari seems like the easier one to do in my opinion
  so adorable
why does meiling gotta be so expensive
aya wishes you a happy thanksgiving /fumo/
sorry for the flipped image i dont know why my phone does this
like two peas in a pod
  on a similar note whats a good price for someone in the west to pay for a meiling fumo obviously its up to the purchaser but whats the average price
  too high just like neet
my oj finally got here and they are as soft as one would expect hime is much lewder then her bright smile would led you to believe you can see her pantsu from almost any angle reika is much purer with her overall suit under her ragged uniform she is not very photogenic though she looks much cuter in person then in her photos
  nice rumia bootleg
  theyre very cute would you mind sharing which company delivered them
  light that youmu on fire
  i am not really sure myself so i will just list everything i know i got them from the oj kickstarter and they were delivered from hong kong by ecourier the from field was filled with ymxy whatever that means and the return address was kwun tong kowloon hong kong business 31 forever china industries building 3 floor 311  no idea if that helps
  thanks i had a look at the tracking again this evening and hime has actually just left the sorting centre so shell be here soon it was just a bit unnerving due to 14 days of no updates
  yous are an unfunny meme
  they are but in fast threads its hard to keep track of replies without them
post ojs
  the entire soft family
  sugoi soras hair is extra messy there  could you please post a picture of of ops character card it is the only one i have never seen hono did really good job with the character cards art
  cute
  thank you  they are all really cute
  i never noticed how many mistakes were in these until i posted this picture  no space in 1 chapter on extraordinary specs  binding chains and hyper mode labelled as type boost despite being event and battle respectively  apparently these were redrawn for this instead of being used directly
my ojs are still stuck in china for some stupid reason      strange no idea why they would do that
  from gift buyee yaj or amazon jp you missed the most recent round on gift buyee is easy although tedious but i can give you some starter links on amazon jp i had some refined kana keyword searches but i deleted them after i had acquired what i wanted      use the similar/sponsor/customersalsobought lists on those pages to find more  you can also try searching for ぬいぐるみ plush toy with various english words most are listed as ponchos but i dont think the raincoats are ok they are レインコート風ポンチョ  raincoat style ponchos on gifts website but this doesnt help much on amazon  all official gift accessories are listed but not available from here       as others have said there are lots i have many that ive saved from /fumo/ which i can begin to repost as far as i can establish the yuuka itt   started life as a fate nendo and the yuugi  made by that anon was a flan    yorigami shion from marisa 31 kourindou ver      i paid 10k nearly two years ago from amazon jp  this listing in fact   its fair to say that the price has escalated a little fumonomics is real
  i hope you posted that to the chiruno booru
what does the word fumo mean
    mai from sakuya either 3 or 29 this one is a 3
every night i kiss my fumo before sleeping
  i think the word used to describe the sound of cuddling something soft is fumofumo in japanese  its something like that
  fumo means smoke in romance languages    the smoke that you get when you set alight your soft dolls
  i dont think thats what it means
  i can see them
  this is my incident solver right here
  suomikoishi
cirno is the finnish touhou
  yes
  need to use firefox to post now for some reason cap wont resolve otherwise
  the whole gang is here
    the onomatopoeia for something soft and cuddling is mofumofu so fumofumo is wordplay on that
    cool thanks for the lesson
does anyone know where to find higher res images of these fumo mousepads they look like theyd be great for wallpapers
    kurumi from sanae 8
gift have started shipping out this wave of soft i cant wait
playing rabirabi with reisen
  i have it but havent played it is it fun
    id like to know if the game is worth getting too   looks fun but not sure yet
    its probably the best modern metroidvania
sora arrived
    watatsuki no toyohime from marisa 2      yay my soft was invoiced and shipped by gift at cob jst yesterday arrived at big in japan today and i just paid the forwarding invoice hopefully the girls will make tonights ems pickup so i should have them in au early next week tenshi cirno 15 summer cirno and youmu 15 incoming  now they need to put some effort into new characters
do you guys ever feel bad about having more than one fumo maybe its just my autism but i feel guilty whenever i want to get more like im the same as anons with multiple wives
  you have brain damage and thats a stupid comparison they are dolls not real people inanimate objects dont have feelings or thoughts so they cant judge you nor be the same as an actual wife pull your shit together anon
  how many fumos you got
fumo tenshis are finally being sent out from the gift store to japanese natives and proxy services if you ordered one be sure to check
  my proxy got her today too hit that ems button within minutes of getting the email i still cant believe tenko got her very own fumo so soon
  distributors that sell and send overseas when _
    fumos also arrived to my forwarder they gave me a free photo as a part of their service id love to see tenshi in there but a mokou is fine too
  after my payment was in flux for two weeks it just resolved and shes going to the forwarder
  its your autism unless youre hoarding rans see previous threads or reimus pic related then why would you care or even think about it
should amiami be considered dead for soft at this point no new fumos except for a shortly lived chen restock during these last several months
marie poppo made it home i hope my stuff doesnt start to go missing
  please wait warmly like i do i have a poppo and qp on the way to ease the waiting time    cute kangoroo
  they so far only not get one batch so nothing big to worry about yet  also they got this cute donation box reimu as latest 
  i wanted to get qp too but couldnt afford please post intimate photos of her when she moves in
  perfect
  you can still order them on indiegogo right now if you have money now
    very worth getting metroidvania with a combo system and danmakustyle dodging
which one would you hug
  sanae and then marisa
  sorry i meant i wanted to get qp with my poppo but couldnt afford both
  black rock shootah looks like she needs a hug
  i dont like the bug eyes of nendos
my burg got stolen    photo of the culprit
  what i wouldnt give for a burg right nowwell i guess i wouldnt give a fumo
tenshi finally made it to zenmarkets warehouse now to wait until shes packed so i can finally do the last payment and wait again
  sora still hasnt arrived yet
  i know how you feel
  somehow i dont think they will be taking yuyuko alive
  who took the pic
reading about comfy camping with remi
  the burger or the thief
poppo drank too much and passed out look how messy her hair is what a drunkard
  take it easy remi
i missed out on a remi auction by just a few minutes
aya is having fun in the barracks
作り方
shes finally here shes definitely the most detailed fumo so far the back of her dress even has her big bow
  nice boots tenshi
  everything is just peachy with the cute celestial
  how does her hat taste
    the cutest boots and smile for the cutest 2hu      like peachflavored corn dogs
  cool tag      congratz on your cute arrival
big soft family
  that is a lot of soft
  but where is she going
  all soft girls are cute but i think that that okuu is extracute
i went to a convention a bought my firstand only fumo no idea if its genuine or not it came with this small piece of paper does anybody know what this is
  posting pictures of the fumo itself would help most i think that piece of paper is some kind of merchants use to indicate the status of an item eg new preowned unopened etc
  based on a quick google translate the top left means inspector based on that and a stamp of different ink id say its a quality control ticket of some sort i wouldnt say that means anything since anyone can just slap a thumbs up on a slip of paper and call it real  posting the actual fumo would be a better way to tell post a pic of the front and back but for the back lift the hair up so we can see the spot where the hair connects to the head a lot of fakes usually stand out based on the eyes alone but the hair also can give it away
  inspection not inspector
  front
  back
    yes she looks pretty real id be surprised if bootlegs of her are even out yet
    if she was fake i wouldt be mad about it
    ok thanks
  on amimai when
  amiami does not carry new fumos any more
awww yea my tenshi arrived in yankistan  now heres hoping that customs doesnt hold on for too long
  so whats the new main site for us then
  have you ever had a package delayed in customs  it doesnt seem to happen in the us
  there is none
  people just buy with proxies these days
  /g/reetings  some phones always internally take a photo in landscape format and use orientation metadat to properly rotate the image for display  when you upload your image to 4chan it strips the orientation metadata but doesnt properly rotate the image first causing it to display sideways    try taking a photo of your fumo holding your phone sideways  and it should display properly
  faster
  may santa bring you many softs
  gift is reverting to pre 1853 japan standards of trade it seems
  what proxy did you use
  white rabbit
earth and moon
  i have had several packages held in customs for extended periods of time namely video game related products i had an av famicom that sat there for at least two months before it finally made its way out of there same thing happened with my first fumo too i ordered a reisen in november and did not get her until february       an attempt was made
  faster
    use a forwarder instead then you dont have to deal with delays in the proxy placing your order  you do have to order direct from gift in moon though
  probably tried to order more than 3 so they canceled the others in order of time placed
my friend who is stationed in japan says he can bring me back some fumos when he comes home do any of you know what stores might have them in stock if any i recall there being a guide in this general but i dont see it
  i need this too
just got the ojs and some items are missing  tagging is wrong    anyone else have issues with them
  yes my qp has a poppo tag on it didnt have any missing items though
  akiba hobby in akihabara has fumos it is a small store so there isnt a lot but youll probably be able to get the common ones like sdm rereleases magicians/ghosts reimu/marisa and the tengu
  same and sora is missing everything
  awesome thanks so much
  very cute
hag swarm theyve invaded your school what shall you do

hey human nerd    give us your investment money and buy monstergirl and demon realm made goods and products human nerd
  i dont have any investment money ive got a fiver though you want a fiver kids let me touch your tails

  goblin layer
    goblin layer is a total weirdo who takes up only goblinrelated quests and is probably responsible for the rapid increase in their populations
  gonna follow that ushioni advice
  goblin layer is a total weirdo who takes up only goblinrelated quests and is probably responsible for the rapid increase in their populations  that reminds me of coc with goblin girl you can continuously breed and get your own horde of daughters who will also rape you goblin harpy and mouse were the only good grils in that futafest
  french super villain ah i sense a feeling the feeling of a person betrayed lied to swindled such a perfect blend of negative emotions to groom and manipulate into defeating lady bug and cat noir clasps hands to moth/butterfly girl fly away my little akuma and evilize them

tfw you will never be a young anon who gets hit on by cc monsters pretending to be way younger than they actually are
  cover for a new mg book its neat
  sneg
    want to see her shake dem hips
  ccs are getting more and more popular  teenage monsters are beginning to make themselves look more mature in hopes of attracting someone  even the child monsters are doing their best impressions of ccs    the pendulum swings both ways beware your new tiny secretary she graduated 2nd grade at 20
  goddamn could you imagine a grizzly with those milkers
  ive masturbated to this picture so many times i need a monster girl exactly like that
  she graduated 2nd grade at 20  wait so did she deliberately keep herself lolified in 2nd grade until she was 20 or did she make herself look like she was 20 in 2nd grade it sounds like a turf war between sabbath and oneesabbath
  busty mature secretary walks into your office  she tells you theres a meeting at eleventy oclock  ask her if you have any forms to sign  counts with her fingers before showing seven with her hands and saying this many
what if the mge world is a postapocalyptic world    some disaster happens that almost destroys the world and humanity ww3 pandemic etc   a cosmic entity the first chief god notices and creates the world by restoring it  but with the cycle of vicious monsters the demon lord and heroes  thousands of years later  catholicism has evolved into the order in what is now europe  japan becomes zipangu  china becomes the mist continent  artifacts from today become the technology of automatons and gremlins  the new demon lord overturns the old cycle and you know the rest
  thats genuinely retarded
  i think the more worrying thing would be how shota anon is dealing with the seemingly 20 yearold sexpot sitting next to him and kickstarting his libido
  how come
  not him but it being our postapocalyptic world hardly seem to matter in your scenario
  its her summer break after 2nd grade her grownup sister just got a summer job so to be more like her shell get one herself and since older ladies are getting popular shell tell everyone shes 20      this is possible too
  so this is what it means to be chiseled

  reminder that spiders make great wives and mothers
  i already knew from the witness of my own eyes that they took care of their babies but this is just too cute  time to ripoff ldr and write about milkytittied spiders
  tfw i got into /ss/ while in middleschool thanks to some knockoff 4chans /ss/ board
  time to ripoff ldr and write about milkytittied spiders  penywises lactating yandere spidermom was far superior
  oh i dont think ive read this one
  i am still evaluating where genies would fall on the pesky rankings

  not him but this tool is pretty fun
  houri is my pure little cutie cant be this sexual  apsara is my sexual promiscuous babe cant be this pure
  what is that
  you mean adds a little bit of coffee in her sugar
  
since i wont be available later ill say this now instead of later  merry christmas thread  
  shed probably be overjoyed that she can finally get some work done without having to worry about being interrupted by monsters trying to get her hooked up
  latrodia and her milky tits is part of what got me into writefaggotry and reaffirmed in my mind that ive always been an arachnefag at heart
  tlnah shes thinking about that new doctor and the killer dissertation he defended from her crew

  its official i guess save stuff from your favourite artists now
in this corner we have the undefeated red terror get caught in her snu snu stranglehold and youll be out like a light  and in this corner is her hus erm her scrawny opponent average joe hes so aggressively bland itll make you wonder why she married him i mean chose him for the title match
  stop
  well thats no fun i want a title match
  i cant believe we once again live in an era where newgrounds is a porn hub
  now that would be the perfect life
  im okay with this as long as a long as a new franks adventures game gets made
  was that the south parkstyle thingie about a hitman
  it was the one where a slutty catgirl sent you around town on dumb quests and all the porn scenes were basically renamed anime girls
  oh i gotcha
  feels so weird looking back at it now but that was my first porn game  i still want to fuck that dumb cat
  this reminds me of the imperial infantrymans uplifting primer    get the order infantrymans uplifting primer by mr nomed published by t nooki publications

  depends what kind of stupid shit
tumblrs nuking adult content on the 17th  better download whatever you like from there before it gets deleted  
  hellhounds are adverse to chocolate just like common dogs whip out a chocolate bar in their presence and theyll immediately flee
  i thought the world was becoming more liberal why is adult content getting removed are we regressing back to the 1950s
  idiot
  i would draw guns dicks stick figures house etc
    freckles is the best one
  i thought the world was becoming more liberal  you mean more liberal
  well excuse me
  i dont understand
    the site i for that pic was 
  so no one
    i used
wikifag here ignore the previous comment from earlier about scrubbing all pixiv content i can get my hands on  the next two weeks will be tumblrs death throes upload weeks
  why is adult content getting removed  needing to actually ask  use your brain dummy
    you have to look carefully at the bottom left tanuki
  no im 100 serious i dont know whats happening
  nope nothing maybe your screen is dirty anon
  must be a huge pain to gather and sort through all this content so you have my thanks
  the far left are just as censorship happy as the religious right its just think of the women on one side and think of the children on the other      apparently has a useful tumblr feature might be helpful if an artist has done a lot of monster girl content
    okay so apple removed their tumblr app recently because it aint kid friendly tumblr in vain perhaps is trying to get back on good terms with apple and is purging all their nsfw blogs
  he cant look it up on his own and draw his own conclusions  are you on the spectrum
  what a glorious future were looking at
    tumblr is caving in to the new generation of leftwingers who hate pornography because it objectifies women
  confused looking snuggler girls with question marks in their ahoge
  wasnt tumblr dying for years because of twitter and poor decisions by the staff
  more like just big business
  yeah  but they didnt exactly just outright ban the majority of their userbase with a single decision
  is this old loen or new loen
    no clue i only went there for porn and quickly gave up because i found it a pain to navigate
  tumblr is caving in to the new generation of leftwingers who hate pornography because it objectifies women  no its for money its always about money
    same thing
  no hes right look right where the nose would be
the world needs more vampires and they need to recognize them as the true rulers of the night not those upstart reanimated corpses just because they died heroes or fucked their way to the top
  they want the diamond
  what about a vampire pharaoh
  well if its 2 against 1 then im the blind one because i see nothing
  you
  didnt 4channel just segregate all their lewd stuff too i hope this tumblr news doesnt signal something further
  this help
  yes
i wonder if there are any monstergirls in space  were monsters on the moon we rape men too  but there aint no boys so we gotta use toys and sing a monster tune  those poor lonely girls
  vampires in egypt dont be silly
  i also enjoy classic futurama and the tale of love between an anon and his cyclops
    i fucking hate lunarian scum fuck the moon
  vampires could be in notegypt as nobles in the apophis night kingdom   i just want to see a vampire embarrassed to be dressed like an exotic dancer
  the far left has stupid like terfs who somehow managed to outautism /a/ and bollocks when it came to zombieland saga
  of all the places in the world why would they be in a sunny desert like egypt
  it hurt itself in confusion
  maybe they found a mansion for cheap
  vampires should head to finland where they can spend months in darkness with no sun
  finn here with no snow the dark winter is really dark
  manticores tail is her breathing system and in order to suffocate her you need to put your fist and thrust it back and forth
  what happens to wendigo children that are afraid of the dark
  there are most likely normal dark demon realms in the desert region the khepri profile talks about whether your kingdom is dark or green is up to the new husband/king with ghouls coming from the desert region there are probably undead demon realms also
    except theres also months of only sun
cow butts  cow tits
  they make fire    dont worry thats when it rains
  i would take in big sister succ and little sister succ
  i mean who wouldnt
  dont be talking shit about my favorite celestial body like that anon
  i dont know the moon is in my top 7 or so favorite moons
where will western mge artists go now that tumblr has banned lewds
  pixiv
  but pixiv is dying
    twitter probably
  twitter sadly i fucking hate it too ideally western artists would make a new site not bound by the bullshit of da and hf
  western liberalism is 90 corporate and turning a buck is always always going to take precedence over any sort of silly progressivism
  they make fire  cut to wendichan in a gangsta outfit rapping while yetichan breakdances in the background
  fire make it burn dem
  but it seems like a bad business move
  eh
  nsfw stuff scares advertisers away and the tumblr app got banned from the app store
i love griffons
  i want to give her my milk if you know what i mean
  theres a site called pillowfortio that looks promising
  poor diet causes the tail to shrink  sad a succ tail always has to be healthy and meaty
i want to hypnotize a human woman into thinking shes a monster girl then transform her into a different species of monster girl and let the cognitive dissonance mind break her
  i fucking love this comic
  thanks heard about that in passing before but never checked it out
  whats special about him
is this how mgs conduct marriage ceremonies
  most monsters unless they were formerly human would probably consider themselves married after they have fucked their husband for the first time any other ceremony is just extra
ywn be the first incubus born to an echidna
  tons of sisters taking care of you
  hes the protagonist
  i really admire this guys dedication
  i get how they are supposed to be cute but they just seem like lint balls to me     nice of him to take her out to a buffet dinner i bet shell leave stuffed
i want to get gentle femdom from my vampire waifu after we have a arguement on whether im just food to her or not i want her to tell me how foolish i am and how much she really cares
  motherfucker  i know what you mean though if memory serves me right he made a nice looking mmd model though
imagine a dark elf enslaving a bunny girl    hippity hoppity you are now my property
  its a terrible tragedy that the mge vampires are only faux dom
  dont start this again
  i n s e c u r e
what is the male version of a womb tattoo what kind of mark can a monster leave on a man
  a hickey back scratches some unseen scent that only other monsters can detect
  i had on mind the black kisses and the scents but something more visual there is no equal
is there a magic potion in mgeland that can give me a prehensile ween i think itd be pretty neat if i could wiggle my boner around while i have it inside my waifu
  call the sabbath
    i mean you could always get a tattoo in the same relative place or just get one on your dick you could also get a prince albert piercing if you really wanted to go all in
  its good
  a prince albert piercing  a what
  prince albert piercing  please no    piercing in the end of your dick had the displeasure of drawing an old dude like that in art classes before
  10 pounds of nope in a 5 pound bag
  not learning magic to craft a pleasure rune on your dick to match your waifus womb tattoo
its blizzarding  i wish the snuggle scouts would walk me home from work
  youre asking for a visit and a ride from a blushing white horn scout leader saying she has important business to attend with you
i want to become a personal boyslut for a manticore
  yes
  i would much rather her mark me herself even if it means taking a needle and she has a heavy hand
  well alrighty then that sounds just divine and fine  shed keep my spirits warm in this whiteout long as i hold on close
  is it an older rich manticore or is it a high school scenario
this is important
  shell take a detour back to her place for some relaxation and warm you up with a cup of snug hug brand hot chocolate with the blizzard worsening you might have to stay overnight in the other room you can hear her on the phone mentioning the words queen and snow
  for once i agree with this statement
  so is this
  i want to do lewd things to a loli and give her one
  aw shucks shame about that weather awfully nice of such a classy lady to keep me in though  i really must be going though i dont want my place to get all snowed under or anything wheres the exit door again
  this yanderizes the whitehorn
  i wonder what bapho pussy tastes like
  like strawberries and cream
  ravioli
  is that what those are called the only time i had heard about it was from a couple of gay dudes talking about how it changes the mouthfeel i dont wish death on anyone but that was a hard conversation to be adjacent to food courts suck
  bleh
  there is no exit nowhere is safe  new translation time this time its the rapists key            next translation will be the inmas guide see you then
  i dont like tattoos or piercings i do like that one of the askfm qas says that pleasure runes can be hidden and still work i want to cover my wife from head to toe and especially inside her mouth with hidden pleasure runes
  that last paragraph seems really insidious    its not technically a bad end but it doesnt sound like a good end either
  this one was really cute to me just thinking of a shycubuss losing the key and having to wait but then thinking well might as well have a little more fun leading to an even longer locked in period is adorable   they did not come out for three days
  premamano    postmamano
how long should you be dating a harpy before you bring up the topic of wingjobs
  a few seconds
  two dates
  big sister/imouto type monstergirl uses this key on her little/big brothers bedroom  imagine
  implying you didnt meet when she swooped down and start rubbing your cock with her wings while sitting on your face
  well at least despite it stating monsters cant put up with doing nothing when confined in a room with their lover the fact they do eventually get out means they must eventually be able to restrain themselves long enough    i am curious what is meant by how disturbances cannot enter the pink haze it sounds like there is some kind of force field that forms around the space inside the room and that while one can damage the physical structures around the room walls and windows they will then encounter a pink haze that functions as a barrier to actually getting in or out
sure is dead in here
  its finals season for many universities
central heating still down in my dorm    i bet the yetis did this
  lipstick ring on the base of his cock
  shush im engaging in grinding and degeneracy
  too busy saving everything i can from tumblr
  i thought people hated the site it seems suddenly a lot more people used it than before
  people liked the weeb art site of tumblr but hated tumblr there was a pretty clear line between the two parts and it was probably the best place for monster girl art outside japan
  a huge amount of mge artists and english language artists in general use it especially for nsfw art
  pretty sure the local ice queen is being smug after seeing how i cant escape her cold
the power of love triumphs over all thats what mge is all about    oh sure yeah yeah love can move mountains but hate can grind them to dust    rage and hatred and violence is part of the natural order and how nature works where love goes hate and violence follows and no amount of love and mamono magic can make it go away remember that
  rage and hatred and violence is part of the natural order and how nature works where love goes hate and violence follows and no amount of love and mamono magic can make it go away remember that  i think somebody needs a hug
  last words of an order berseker unit commander before their mysterious disappearance  i wonder what mamano woud turn the into husbandos
  the nsfw side and the retard side are seperate entities  now that nsfw is getting pruned in this years continuing trend of major companies challenge each other to try and be as fucking retarded as possible itll just be the retard side
  rage and hatred and violence is part of the natural order and how nature works  cant i rage at my maid for having very lewd tits and ass even going as far as to make her look 9 months pregnant after injecting myself with manticore venom
  thats how yetis try to find christmas lovers best to leave them be and not give in to their hugs
  if they like you we are looking at some peak pesky problems
  craaaaaaaaaawling iiiiiiin my skiiiiiin
  milk maids are the best maids
  kc should add goddamn lactation potions already so the lactation fetish isnt limited to holstaurs and pregnant monstergirls
  this doesnt make it any easier to decide
does shitposting late into the night attract owl mages
  no it attracts bunyips
friendly reminder to never go to mg clinics
  
  caption images  i feel sorry for the one single krakenfag who isnt a massive shitposting idiot
  but nurse kunoichi gives away free candy
  yeti delinquents watch shivering anons pass in the hallway smugly grinning or outright laughing    hey there you look like you could use a hug lots of hugs all ya gotta do is ask well take goooood care of you
  in coming to that conclusion   i am tentatively condemning genies as very pesky  do not allow genies to get away with pesky behavior this is an official statement
  how do people not know that captionfaggotry is banned
  the baphomet schematic in world guide 3 has this    baphomet titty  although small these titties are very sensitive   according to rumor if an oniichan or child sucks on them it seems baphomet milk contains thick magical power    it doesnt say a baphomet has to be pregnant or with a nursing baby to lactate but then again it doesnt confirm otherwise either but perhaps monsters skilled in magic can generally copy the holstaurs ability to lactate daily
  were a step closer to that reality then
  who are the top 3 pesky monstergirls
  delinquent bancho yetis are scary
  large mice  devils  ratatoskr   oooh they make my blood boil too pesky
  i wonder how embarrassed a baphomet would be if you milked her like a holst despite her flat little chest
  gremlins might be a match for any of them though at least if you get on their bad side and have any tech with you
  a hug squad is on the way to your location
  they are top five
  bunyips have a lot of shit quality art like this dont they
  pixies and fairies can be pretty pesky too
  stop posting trash art
  dang tryhard sniper mains
  i thought holst milk is lactation potion if you drink it too much
  what kind of mental patient doesnt like candy
  holstaur milk gives the drinker softer body proportions not sure if it causes bust sizes to increase though
  lactating flat girls sound wholly unappealing like that one tewi lactation doujin
  thats the point though baphos are so high and mighty that doing something so degrading to them would be neat
  it can but it depends on the charm point of the girl    not only is this holstaur milk delicious it is full of nutrients and of course it also has the effect of boosting their husbands stamina which pleases all the monsters even those monsters and incubi who frequently spend a lot of time having sex can enjoy even healthier and more active sexual relations if the couple drinks this milk everyday it also has the effect of maintaining the resilience and luster of the breasts and sometimes it can even have a breastenlarging effect the effect varies depending on the race the individual and the sexual tastes of her husband for all the monsters whose charm point is their childish appearance it wont cause them to have full breasts instead it exhibits an effect that will cause their tiny breasts to become even squishier and make their skin feel even softer to the touch so even adherents of sabbath should relax and drink it
    i admit its not great but its definitely not as bad as the succkerpunched heatpat bunyip posted earlier
  gotta love how kc cant even get through an entry about lactation milk without forcing in his love of loli the man is hopeless
  hes a dirty old man isnt he
well at least gazerfags and vadas art is also on twitter so thats about all i care about
  valentine would make a fantastic kunoichi holy shit
  too bad twitters file compression is akin to taking your drawings and putting them through a wood chipper
  i keep seeing people going to twitter/baraag/newgrounds
  the hell is a barrag
  it would actually be funny if the death of tumblr revived newgrounds
tfw you will never stop an evil monsters plans for world domination by making her your heavily pregnant housewife
  been told its a anything goes version of twitter
  this is why fertility builds are strong
  freely share all types of art this instance welcomes loli shota fan works graphic violence and any sexual depiction expressed as a piece of fiction in subject or setting  from their about section
  my golden dragon warrior queen wife has already gone on several conquests now its family time
  i want an ancient evil goo monster or fox
  youre blind anon you need to go see the doc
  heatpat
  do not dick the primordial ooze
tfw no wolf gf to go on adventures with    and here i am stuck working a full time job
  modern day cuisine is rough on monster girls
  youre not the boss of me
  krakenfags are massive shitposting idiots   i knew she was the one for me
  not helping her in her evil plans first  not helping her produce heirs once is done  you dont deserve an evil wife
  shota is the meta for ara overlords  grotesque fat mans the meta for loli overlords
  captions were a thing for a long time in these threads newfriend
  get the fuck out of here fucko no they werent
  yes they were im also including the time on /a/ fag
  strictly fertile builds need constant protection from hordes and smaller mobs  you dont finish a raid with a ohko on the boss alone you need to bring friends
   share all types of art this instance welcomes loli shota fan works graphic violence and any sexual depiction expressed as a piece of fiction in subject or setting  yeah suuuureee until they get popular enough to get lots of expensive ads who will force them to remove it
  they sorta were two come to mind that were accepted for a couple of months in the days before /jp/
  thats how its always gonna be anon a new small site will be good for awhile then theyll get big and more normie friendly so people will find another small site and the cycle will repeat
  /a/ also accepted emg and hfyfags your point is
  my dude the /a/ days were cancerous all around
  im gonna say it  pxz is boring
  were they the only caption i can remember is  kc lamias sitting in a forest
what monster girl would smoke a pipe with me
  i dont trust this demon
  
  this is no zaku
  ara aras prostitutes and madams etc
  
  i remember that holst one being posted a lot was hesitant to click that link in case it was the ntr ones
  i trust this demon
  i may or may not trust this demon
how would an older monster respond to rough interlocking handholding from a young man
  butlersan a rare day off
  i will pet this demon
spider girl finally finds that one guy she wants to marry and have many children with but turns out hes has a phobia of spiders is more likely that she uses a shock therapy and rapes the phobia out of him or that she tries to approach him slowly or something else
  id say this is a bit closer to how it works  
    so its like a bar rag it just soaks up the filth and pushes it around
implying some of you faggots arent going to be hanging around on /a/ soon enough  even if you wont admit it
  id rather have her pet me
  good manga gets picked up by a good studio  sometimes theres justice in this world
  why not mutual headpatting while shes riding your dick
  implying adventuring wouldnt be just as much of a toll
  i have a fear of spiders but if i saw a sexy woman attached to the front that wants to love and cherish me for the rest of our lives i probably wouldnt even be the least bit afraid of her
  maybe just being around one without any sort of interaction at first would be good like how you go from violently reacting to the spider to the spiderbro in the corner of the room dispatching mosquitoes
  thanks ive been looking for that chesh caption    trickster cat is best cat
  i have a fear of spiders and id most likely faint even if theres a hot woman attached to the spider  body
  love of your life is the most beautiful woman youve ever seen  sweet loving and very protective of you  you even expected her to laugh about or mock your spider phobia but she was actually very understanding and comforting  its just strange how she insists on meeting you always while shes hovering in front of a giant sheet  her legs never touch the ground not even close but you dont see wings or anything  come to think of it youve never seen her from behind ever  oh well everyone has their quirks
  careful anon i hear she eats little kids
  what makes you think im not already
  im kinda turned on by the idea of a silk blindfold so i cant see the spider bits she just leaves me to imagine what shes doing to me and how
what fantasy do you guys have when you are feeling lonely on cold nights
  comfy waifu and daughteru ones
  im cuddled up in my coat realm with the waifu despite being bundled up im still shivering and she thinks its cute
  i like pretending to be a swordsman in a fantasy land but getting captured by monsters because i am a fuckup sometimes a healslut
  adventuring   wizard dickery   the like
  just because she has a big smile doesnt me she would do that
  gridman is the only way i can get my animated toku fix since the only garo content airing right now is live action  vento aureo clearly received a higher budget and less kimchi animators than diamond is unbreakable  shits unfair
  getting held close and milked until im in such an ecstatic state that i lose consciousness
  tall kiki resting my head on her shoulder holding me in her arms while she strokes my hair and tells me things will be okay
  lots of different ones of waifu ranging from simple comfy cuddles to autistic thoughts about her and i as royalty in a fantasy world falling in love with each other
  harem cuddle piles usually i prefer thinking about my favourites individually but when im in a certain kind of mood the selfish thoughts kick in
  i remember my days when i was deployed in chad and that no matter how cold i am right now ive been worse
  i like that one i also want her to just keep whispering i love you in my ear while she does it
  when were we in chad
  her holding me while telling me how much she loves me
  im not american
  at least live action garo had masahiro inoue for a bit
  yeti hugs and more yeti hugs
  he was in goldstorm and makai retsuden before this too   id also love to see inoue in an animated garo series like raigas actor but this time it isnt shit
  you know the second they offered to let him be decade again he went running he loves that role
  what why who said that
  he also got a completely new upgrade i wonder how different a monster girl version of rider would be
  i want a pudgy cheshire that likes to wear fine clothes and a corset
  fug
  fug
      teresa is a good girl with a job
  i want a cheshire that shifts a lot in her sleep so she keeps hugging me in different ways through the night
  i just think about my setting things id add or change maybe a new important individual on it etc
  a cute   why are pointy eared kikis so much more matronly
  tail hug too  unf
  when they start snugling its great
  theyd probably be more along the lines of the monsters of the week
  kikis mom sure is pretty
  i would also imagine some of them would be replaced by monster girls i bet extremist girls would cry their eyes out at characters like ryo
  being gills is suffering  but not as much as being chalice
good night anons take care and dont burn down the thread     instead please remember that hiring a kunoichi to assassinate yourself is improper   you can just ask them for a date
  what if i really want to die
  shell heal you then
  gills would get tender loving monster girl hugs  also dont forget kenzaki anon
  i can just see a kunoichi angrily bopping you on the head before softening up and telling you you dodnt have to go through all that trouble
  nah kenzakis fine  hajime needs a hug though  imagine watching build with a monstergirl and watching her face turn to despair
  acting my wifes heater and lover
  then youre getting killed orgasm        yup   why the clan even has a list of girls who are available for marriage
oh man i hope we get a western setting   i just want to team up with other anons and take on a fort held by order outlaws who have taken our wives hostage
  the despair would be even stronger if a protective girl watched it   banjous actor would get so many love letters from dragons
  heater  patrician taste
  i wantwives hostage    ntr fag detected
  monstergirl encyclopedia is basically escapist hentai fantasy realm    nope not only my watch    time to go back to reality
unsealing ancient evils to take them on fun dates
how do you spoon with a centaur
  sounds like the sort of thing id do
  its unfortunate how much a fox without a tail affects my enjoyment
  be the little one of course
  le sjw boogeymen  leftists are pissed too its because of apple and verizon apple removed them from the app store for all the porn verizon realised they cant make money off tumblr when nobody wants to advertise on a site full of porn
  what could a monstergirl possibly do against a lunatic that shoots rockets at his feet
  whats wrong with giogio
  cheshire accidentally goes through the entirety of karma sutra as she shifts during one especially restless night
  youd have to find a kunoichi to ask her on a date  it would be a lot easier to anonymously hire one to take you out
  i go to /m/ for gridman discussion
  is this the artist that draws nothing but paizuri
  where do you go first  kareoke  arcade  movie  skating  bowling  evil rituals  hay ride  sleigh ride  roller skating  paddle boat  laser tag  paintball/airsoft  skydiving  the possibilities are endless
  just tell at suspicious bushes and youll find one eventually though if you actually go check behind them you might get smokebombed out of shyness
  specifically apple complained about the child porn
  essentially
  if a harpy could avoid his shovel she could carry him off as an airshot
  yes it is he also made a game all about paizuri and level drain
  wait what was that about evil rituals
  implying orderfags would touch a monster sexually  all damsels in distress are raped  youre funny anon
  you mean bowling look i know not everyone likes it but its not evil
  no anon after bowling
  its raining men must have a significantly different meaning in mge world
second commission from tazz came in
  some centaurs might think hay rides are evil but thats only because it means you arent riding her
  gremlins on suicide watch when sento loses his smile
  no anon after bowling but before hay rides
  demon covers her mouth in shock  oh no theyre going to get hurt  frantically flies away leaving behind a dust cloud searching far and wide for falling men to rescue
  im sure she has no idea what youre talking about
  i wanna ride a whitehorn through a lovely winter trail while having a large blanket over both of us instead of a coat as i hold onto her warm bare chest from behind
  are you bare too
  she has one in an earlier image so i suppose shes just hiding it in that pic
  if she keeps doing evil rituals then shes not getting any more dick until she stops
  only shirtless
  4 sets with no tail and one picture with a tail does not inspire me
  yes hes now at the point of girls where paizuri is the only available act
  noice moice
  wait what
  is this the same fox
  yes
  that is one fearbonerinducing fox shes all chained up and covered in seals but doesnt look to be ruffled or restrained in the slightest    im not stuck here with you youre stuck here with me
you thought your problems with the yandere were over but after killing her eros brought her back her love undiminished
  why would i ever kill a yandere
  what a slutty wedding dress
  nah she actually is the one stuck with him
all the undead should go back to their tombs in an orderly fashion
  maybe shes a houri who was adopted and raised by a phantom  but soft what light through yonder window breaks/it is the east and anon is the sun  hourisan its 3am and we have to get up early tomorrow please go to bed  i am slain i am slain
  well if shes a human youll get an improved version
  graped anubis is stronger than both the pharaoh and the apophis  pharaoh is overthrown by the mummies led by the anubis  poor apophis gets her tail stepped on again
  this just makes me think of an irresponsible lazy pharaoh who likes to stay up late and party and her poor overworked anubis who tries to raise her to be a more respectable ruler
  call me fag but i dont consider that a good enough reason to murder someone
how many anons in here have daughterus weve got lots of waifufags with adorable wives but how many have taken it a step further its been on my mind recently    please do not lewd your daughters
  getting  then shell get just have to take it instead
  i have a daughteru with my kobold waifu but you probably already knew that
  jesus did
  im not jesus
  got a little firebrand sure and no shes not for lewd
  i think about a daughteru sometimes but thats really it
  huh shes handling it pretty well then    i gotta say a woman all bound up naked and in chains but still smug and confident is pretty freakin hot to me though
  she wouldnt
  have you seen next part she literally loses that smile and gets a worried face and i find that really hot
  i cant imagine daughterus until kc does a second pass and explains if they even can
  either i lewd them or they lewd me anon my mice just cant be satisfied by anyone else
  ive had some dreams of having a family before but only since i got a waifu has the daughteru had a consistent appearance and personality i might consider commissioning art in the future but i dont know how good it would be for me if i went in all the way
  you know what that is pretty gosh darned hot    im normally against that kind of rough play but damn if it doesnt appeal to my love of roleplaying
  girls where paizuri is the only available act  nervouslaughterjpg
  if i dream about daughterus i usually skip to when they are in  their lateteens or young adults im not that good with actual kids
  i want to live on a farm with a troll and have a team of little trolls to work the fields
  whats the games name
i want a taur to pin me against a wall with her huge ass
  in the village of busty lolis theres a translation on ulmf the guys missed a few lines here and there but its basically all translated
  i get that i dont usually like kids but i have some experience as a big brother so i at least know what to do with little ones the daughteru i keep thinking of is around 57      this is a good dream i would hate to be a parent by modern suburb standards i think too petty and smallminded hypocritical as it is i would want to raise my kids away from the influence of pop culture and social media as much as possible id rather they learn about the world directly through experience than from a distance i feel like monsters are too pure to subject them to our invasive modern ways of thinking if that makes any sense
  got a link to this next part
  just realized there are tons of pictures of heckpups and little wans but not that many of dragon hatchlings    its not like dragons are unpopular or their young would be particularly hard to draw youd think people would be all over a chance to draw big mamatier milf dragons too strange
  you know what happens when a dragon lays an egg  nyeenyeenyenyeenyeh  hehehe
  i understood that reference and i am already starting to feel aggravated fuck everything about those filthy kidnappers
  do you even pixiv 
  yeah sorry i found the pivix links through saucenao after i asked    smug fox not so smug after getting forcefully titfucked
  the proper use for the ancient evil fox a village has sealed away
  one one hand i agree but i also dont think i could resist the urge to give her my sweater and make sure shes not hurt by her binds fucking faggy whiteknighting urges
  aftercare is as important as pounding her hard enough that she cant see straight
  when you insult her organizational skills
  im farmgrown myself so i want my kids to have that as well just better space and nature is very important for young  minds tho having neighbours within biking distance is a must
  definitely aftercare is great i love the idea of treating a girls injuries and making her feel better hence my weakness for zombies and and scarred girls at the same time though i get really worked up when i see a woman in any kind of pain    its extreme to the point where i cant enjoy porn or doujins unless the woman is very clearly happy and/or in love with the guy i guess its kinda like how some people cant stand to see anything bad happen to dogs in movies it just pulls on something
  its extreme to the point where i cant enjoy porn or doujins unless the woman is very clearly happy and/or in love with the guy  dont worry anon im the same way
  for me its all about teaching the kids to be independent and not reliant on the approval of others the world we live in now where everyones constantly gossiping and judging everything and everything is recorded forever scares the shit out of me id hate for a kid especially a monster to grow up that anxious and selfconscious thinking everything is a big deal    i think a lot of the appeal of monster girls is the freedom of spirit and individuality they show a basic desire to do what they want and not feel bound by society to look or act a certain way while they do it people are getting so uptight and everything so regimented it feels like were going back in time to before the sexual liberation of the 60s when people were clamoring for the 1950s promise of the good life in exchange for conformity youre only allowed to be unique in a certain number of socially acceptable ways or else youre excluded there are still steps you have to take and people you have to win the approval of to be able to do anything    i like that monster girls can wear their hearts on their sleeves and be honest with what they want i like the idea of love and affection being openly celebrated and actively sought out i would never wish this repressed demanding world of ours on a monster girl it would destroy them    /rant
  cant beat a good doujin that gives both a boner and a heart boner unambiguous lovey dovey shit is the best fetish
    well im glad its not just me then sex is a joyous thing a physical act of love it should be celebrated for being so when it is so
kiss evil girls on the eyepatch its the proper way to greet them
  growing up in the 80s and 90s most of my childhood was spent without electronics so i can say with a fair bit of certainty that it isnt really that people are gossiping/judging more these days its just that the medium of the internet allows it to be proliferated more easily and louder than face to face conversations the same goes for the seemingly massive divisiveness between opinions and ideologies these days every point of view has an equal platform from which to tell others how theyre living their life incorrectly
  who is this slutbucket
  dangerous noodle
  i will and i will kiss the scars of warrior women to show them theyre still beautiful
  it just seems wrong to me that at any moment you could receive some reminder that a good chunk of the world doesnt want you in it i didnt have this stuff growing up either but i distinctly remember the sudden impact of having those things around when i was a teenager it was like one day there was earth beneath my feet and the next day there were eggshells i dont like thinking that someone ive never met could hate me enough to want me dead and feel justified for it    from what ive read from kc on his work it sounds like he has a similarly disillusioned feeling toward his society id need to find the exact line but hes said before that monster girls are meant to go directly against what society expects of people in regards to love
  oooh youre part snake that explains it  well what did you think i was  iunno some kinda noodle person
  hehe long grill
does a human girl who gets corrupted by the influence of an alice also turn into an alice
  i remember the gist of what kc said on the matter it does seem like political correctness has taken hard turn over the past decade or so people get offended over the tiniest of things and the response is to blame others instead of growing a thicker skin theres always going to be people that rub others the wrong way and even do so for enjoyment just as much as there will be people that hate without reason or for stupid reasons best to just accept that they will always exist and to improve ones own mentality
remember the only ones more dangerous than monsters are human moms that want grandbabies what your soontobe wife thought was her plan to trap you wasnt her plan at all
  story about anon getting trapped in a room full of monsters by his human mother when
  monster grandmothers would be scary  honey youve been with that knight husband of yours for years now  are you two having enough sex  your father and i would start early in the morning and wouldnt stop until bedtime  i bought you some fertility drugs from the tanuki down the street
  those tanuki pills will make you end up with quintuplets
  all according to grandmas plan that sly old fox
  the political correctness issue is just one symptom of whats happening i feel like society is starting to crack down again on nonconformists the rebellious waves of the 60s and 70s were so huge and came so fast that the way the world worked had no choice but to change to fit the new ways of thinking now the conformists are regaining lost ground join the mob or be crushed under it    suddenly little shit like growing out your hair and getting tattoos is a big deal again because everyones so desperate for jobs individuality is suffering because its so easy to directly compare people people who conform and shame those who dont are often rewarded with public praise and even financial success you cant share your art or music if its not what advertisers want their products associated with shits scary    whatever this is the wrong place for me to be a longwinded hippie anyway eventually im going to move away from icky nasty society and be a halfbaked libertarian somewhere out in the woods with my waifu and daughteru just you watch    have some wolfus
  i like this idea    anons mom is completely grandbabycrazy  shes fed up with waiting for him to settle down and start a family  she arranges for a bunch of girls on aphrodisiacs and fertility drugs to rape the shit out of him    alternately    mom conspires with anons girlfriend to make him fucking propose already  subtly influence him into developing an impregnation fetish  they create the conditions for maximum chances of conception  get him furiously horny and pentup for the big night
  that one on the left needs many children
  how would she feel after being told that and then looking over at her father who still decades later looks like a shota
  such is the power of brown
  maybe its because of where i live the fact that im generally antisocial or where i hang around on the internet that i havent really seen anything too bad with conformism/nonconformism could be that im just too apathetic to notice but yeah wrong place for this so ill see your wolfus and raise you a danger noodle family
  considering it being a monster family it probably isnt the first time shes been told
  i wonder if a brown puppy witch would look just as good
  as a longhaired hippie who is the son of a longhaired hippie i will welcome you
people talking about conformism in /mgt/  oh the irony
  which mgs are the best for hairhippies like us
  those of us on the fringes who have previously been ostracized see things differently i suppose    okay ill shut up now sneks are more important anyway post long girls
  yeah but i bet she has heard it enough times to get sick of it  yeah mom i get it youve told me a thousand times about how you snatched up dad be cause he was so cute and raped him for three days until i was conceived give it a rest
  little brown wans with big brown eyes are among the greatest gifts this world has to offer
  how bout shortstack sneks the noodle part is long but girl short she feels conscious of her height despite still taking most of the room
  oh but the long lithe abdomen that gradually tapers off into swaying snek hips is the best part a long belly is a good belly i could write poetry about that shit
  do it
she slithers and sways   abs smooth and soft like whispers  gimme snek tummy    i could do something more substantial than haiku but id need to brush up on my poem formatting first its been a while
  alraune
  i dont into poetry seems silly
    did people seriously forget about kejourou thats pretty sad
  how does a highclass courtesan fit in with dirty hippies
  i dont generally like poetry either it makes you use twice as many words to say half as much half as clearly imo    sometimes a high quality ass or sandwich puts me in a mood i would call poetic though where i just want to find creative new ways to gush about how much i like something
  hippie apophis  fighting against pharaoh not because she wants to grape her but because she is the man man
  i grow mine out for religious and ethnic reasons but i feel like they would appreciate the care i put into my hair its super gay to say it out loud but i use oils and herbs and a special brush and everything it smells very nice    im already taken but i dare you to tell me a kej wouldnt be crazy about that shit
  you will never get flopped on by a hippie apophis after she smokes some of her homegrown herbs and gets really cuddly  youll never get your face squeezed between her magnificent massive grapes when she decides to wrap herself around you and take a nap  shell never make sure to slide your dick inside her before she dozes off so you can relieve your natural urges with her sleeping body
    no step on snek intensifies      hassidic or sikh
  no native american i keep it long for regalia decorations and braids im actually being trained in traditional medicine right now    some of the stories i was raised on involve monster girls funny enough
  i need to take better care of mine i got blonde naturally curly hair that i prefer semilong but currently it reminds more of umkempt sheep than lion mane
nesting
  well you dont need to go that far to get it under control if youre serious about it though hemp oil is your friend that stuff is magic    its almost a shame mamonomana takes care of basic maintenance i love the idea of brushing and treating my waifus hair
  cute birb
  not him but same anon one of my favorite daydreams is just treating my dormouses hair while shes half asleep and rambling on about how excited she is for all the stuff shes going to do at school that day
write simple haiku  for your dearly beloved  we guess who she is
got a story  there was a man called gred  he got drunk and punched an oni in the face  they that got married cuz it turns out shes into getting treated rough  he still had a black eye on the first date
  i want to play with my waifus hair and have her play with mine longer the better but shorter hairstyles have their charm too
  i refuse poetry is for crow tengu and the like
  crow tengu are good girls
  as much as im into erosapproved passionate slow loving sometimes i fantasize us going after each others lives seriously must be some sort combat powerfantasy forcing one to their very limit fighting for their survival the aftersex must be amazing
  shorter hairstyles have their charm too  yeah they do my daughteru has the same short hairstyle as pic related

a very special thread for a very precious 2hu

i wish zun show us how murasa looks in the past back when shes an evil youkai
  that shouldve been her design
  how rude her current design is fine as it is but i do agree this design looks very cool
i want to romance the captain
    thats literally just a generic japanese ghost but colored blue in fact it looks like okiko from urban legend in limbo
she is a fearsome youkai with an ability specialized in bringing death to humans the sort of pure youkai with no goals other than killing this merciless ability arose from her lingering attachments to this world drowning humans in water lets her create companions
sex with murasa
  is ship shape and bristol fashion
  if she wanted to learn a way to create companions she should have said that sooner  ill gladly show her a special method on how to make several companions together enough to crew the ship
  what did he mean by this
murasa wants at least 20 children
  she was just lonely and wanted friends
its minamitsu not murasa
  
oh yeah anyone got this ransomware virus
  yes but i called the coast guard and they chased the captain away
from the ufo/xp thread    
  good question
ichirinxmurasa is my deepest guilty pleasure
baka
i always wonder what drive murasa to kill humans even though she was a human before becoming a youkai
  really cute
shes talking about me
  this is depressing
  i want to have sex with the captain
bite
marry the captain
  woah there you need to treat her to dinner first minamitsu only likes romantic men
if possible i want to marry murasa and make lots of little phantoms with her
cap
  god just imagine sex with minamitsu you have to always display 110 performance or she may or may not start drowning you if start slacking
yo anon did you come for a ride
oooouur blood runs cold    we take our loot but we dont grow old
  sleeping with musara on the deck
  hey girl come here often
  i want to put my peepee inside murasa
why is she so lewd

finally they improved the ranking quests to cost 40qp instead in jewel princess and guarantees 2 bonus if you play it at least once a day for this and future events
rance collab in goddess kiss  how the fuck does this even make sense rance doesnt even have mechas    i wonder if its ntr the baldr collab before made the goddess kiss mc fuck the baldr force baldr sky and baldr heart heroines
  time to start playing this game again huh  the baldr collab before made the goddess kiss mc fuck the baldr force baldr sky and baldr heart heroines  and i got none of the gacha ones and the scenes werent uploaded anywhere last time i checked fuck my life
  the scene for one of the baldr heart heroine got uploaded at fc2
  i was just checking and indeed it is better than nothing i guess thanks
  the chihatan collab was also ntr and the unequivocal traveled to that world fucked the mc over there because he was kind went back type too   honestly curious what theyll do here i mean they did it with baldr so rance is definitely not safe just because its a big name
  who knows maybe its reverse ntr with rance fucking the goddess kiss heroines    well the teaser they posted hints at cloning so i guess clones dont count as ntr
    what game is it is still alive
have 5 nondupe blacks just gathering dust in the barracks  not enough resources to raise them  how do i deal with this guys
  run fairy dailies
  but the i wont have orbs for aw
shu xian or sheng pu
  sheng unless you already have all the best damage dealers and badly need the time stops  ever since i got sheng i basically stopped using shus tokens so actually sheng will probably always be better
  the plat jiangshii leimei is honestly more practically useful in 99 of maps than shuxian due to an insanely high range     you can use sheng pu in literally any map and wipe any trash before it comes close to you she is definitively the most broken black
  shu xian  i dont have shengpu _
  sheng
  literally waifu material
is there any use for black unit dupes in aigis
  not anymore cost reduction and rainbow fairies are really easy to get now just sell it for the 400 rc and use that to buy a 500 rc legend ticket
    sorry let me add to that if you got it from the gacha do what i said if you got it from aw2 probably better to hold it for the other aw2 path just in case aw2 will guarantee you one copy though so no point in keeping gacha dupes
i thought id pass this mark when they finally add rarity up for botan but managed with just advanced ampies
  rance doesnt even have mechas  did you even play it  of course there are mechas in ranceverse in rance 10 you even get to have one as your own unit
  10 hours rerolling  only 3 black is triple rinne
  shes best unit in the game so enjoy your supereasy mode now
  but the best unit in the game is hermit
another damn keraunos revival on monday  they should just make it permanent along with rotating maijin at a faster rate with reset rewards
  reset revival rewards while youre at it too please those two things would make the anniversary actually good and not hot trash like it is right now
  they should probably make labyrinth permanent while theyre at it because im getting as fucking tired of that as an event as i am of keraunos as a rerun
    they should definitely start making revivals permanent theres too many of them by now
  id be happy if they do 2 or 3 revivals instead of 1
so should i saw the chinese electric zombie
i fucking hate the cunt that designed these maps to force me to fucking tinker with my squads speed for 10 minutes every fucking mission and make me waste stamina  fuck  you
  yeah fkg story maps are absolute aids
  yes 100
  i havent played in 2 years but even back then wiki had guides for approximate speeds and placements you need to do to have the highest chance of map completion  oh wait is this nutaku nvm then
  maps should be the same between dmm and nutaku no
mfw i pull two shengs from the free 10 pull ticket  here i come easy mode
  nope theyve been updating dmms story maps to remove most of the speed and random bullshit for a while now
i just got sheng pu is her saw better than her normal skill it sounds like her tokens lose the range buff when you saw
  yes the saw effectively lets her clear maps on her own
  her tokens arent very important then
  they are but not for the way youre thinking theyre strong on their own and they still buff her own attack simply by being placed the more you have out when you use her saw the easier it is for her to murder everything on the map
  her clones are either distractions for ranged enemies or 20 buffs to shengpu  
explain to me how sheng pu is apparently the best unit in the game when all i can see is an aisha with lower skill cd
  aisha with a lower skill cd  dumbest post 2018  have you really bothered to read what her kit does or watched videos of her in action
  see   clones herself buffs herself and has a spammable map wide clear skill that buffs her attack even further    rushes got you down press that attack button and youre clearing the map with at least 3k attack hits that can easily go to 6k with some attack buffers or clones on the field i was sad about the lack of healing on my account with no rinne but it turns out you dont need to heal if the creatures that would do you harm cant get near you
  all those fucking tokens
  you aint seen shit yet  
hey artwhirl anon how do i get more equipment recipes like how can i start making rank 2 equipment probably a dumb question but i checked the wiki and couldnt find anything
leora is on empire pickup tomorrow      are you talking about the toushin toshis bringing those over for the collab doesnt make sense they arent piloted by the heroines nor are they fuckable i doubt theyll bring those to goddess kiss
  leora is on empire pickup tomorrow  fucking aigis i already spent my scs
new jesters name  weve reached peak lolicept
  i want this bowrider to ride me
  explain
two new black units  i hope this doesnt become habit didnt say what they do either and no pickup      リズリー  most of her name is half of lolicepts favorite word
  rizuri  heh
psa roll this thing once before 12/20 for a free placere    
  what i really want to know is how he convinced the staff are the subpaizuriminal messages in jubei and longji altered in the ios version     at least we can be thankful that he wasnt commissioned for fkg because im 100 sure that hed have a mental breakdown after being assigned to draw nothing but perflat lolis poor shuz
  lolicept drawing lolis  at least hed finally be true to his name
  theyre intact the edits are mainly little things like covering up cleavage and lengthening skirts and such
when are we getting the fucking shiropro collab sc in aigis  i need it to pop a pity plat on leora rate up where ill still fail to get her
  skintight undersuit and pseudospats  now this is the kind of censorship i could stand for       first maintenance of each month i think
  i thought his name meant except loli
are the two blacks imperial
  no no  rezuri  he seems to like to play with english a little bit given their name      they were probably fine it sounds english in a way doesnt it japanese love word play too and names recently have been kinda out there recently see バイン which is awfully close to ボイン maybe some others but nothing comes to mind      he does a naizuri scene anyway  someone make it happen
  naizuri scene from lolicept  i didnt know i wanted this but now i really do
  i want her but knowing my luck ill either get the shitty jester or some random dupe of a black i already have
  fuck guess its another year without leora for me
  damn i really want to save some scs for xmas
  you get the option to make higher ranked equipments when you possess the materials required  at present those materials can only be obtained from clearing high level battles lv1220 depends on item type under 討伐任務
lolicept is a shit artist imo
  whos your favorite artist
  where is this cutie from
  fkg
  name of character
  moritan
  
level unit to 80 really easily  ready to aw her  the aw screen tells me im missing orbs and have to wait a week to aw her    this happens to me every time i pull someone new and i deeply hate it every time
dragon soldier aw2 tomorrow  i hope devtea actually redeems her and makes her usable like how they did for elmira
  at least wurm is already usable with her skill unlike shit like eldora
  right on time just rolled one yesterday
  she really shines in long maps with skill aw and rearguard or lepuru support her with some more dragons and her stats go beyond 4k hpatk and def with block 5 and she attacks all blocked targets and is immune to paralysis almost black tier
  holy fuck i just saw her stats  add she gives herself status immunity on top  thats a borderline black unit
  shes an absolutely amazing unit for things like subjugations  with a lot of stuff being single lane shes doing what nadia does but better
  yep shes fucking ridiculous stack a def buff like kuuko on top as well and she becomes one hell of a wall
  support her with some more dragons and her stats go beyond 4k hpatk and def   4k hp sure 4k atk maybe if you literally stack all dragons buffs 4k def i dont see how without external nondragon help aix iris kuuko etc
  bruh
how do you think the design process behind characters works in aigis for example  do the artists get a detailed guideline a basic idea or are they just told to go ham with whatever and then they make a unit out of it  i mean aside from the obvious like this unit is a warrior so shell need a sword
  well theres a corresponding sprite to go with the image so theres probably have some level of backandforth between the sprite team and artist
how long do i have to get to level 40 for the last 10pull anniversary ticket
  few hours
  few minutes
ten roll tickets instead of free black pick ticket this year
  either one week if its within the limit of the anniversary or no time limit at all if its like the free black tickets
  theres no limit
  i have no idea about browser games but mtg artists for example get 23 sentences and some keywords               but these are focused on scenes rather than characters so aigis might be different same with fkg id be interested in knowing whether visual puns like cowslips key columbines pigeon or violet cress fan and dragon are due to developers specifying them or the artists going out of their way to research their flowers
just noticed the aigis en wiki added official 3size measurements for some of the characters on their pages is there some official list that lists all of the available measurements
  theyre taken from the 3 profile books someone compiled them here  
  got it i havent been farming those so suppose ill get on it thanks
  thanks some of these bust sizes are pretty surprising sarah doesnt look like she has a 100cm bust at all whereas ester looks like shes way over 100cm
  wow ingrids sizes look so off
  ive been trying to get this whore since she came out and ive rolled myself down to 0 crystals every banner shes been on rolling for nothing and no one else
in other news nutaku fkg added their weekly event today a day late thats completely untranslated  theres not text before or after missions and the pest boss names found are just an empty space  also the events unit are inconsistently localized  the banner states idol but their title as their unit name is radiant princess
does the anniversary food in aigis restore only stamina or stamina charisma to max
  just stamina
  man aigis would be much more popular if they fix their stamina/charisma system
  i always keep a minimum supply of 12 orbs each     my current problem is that i have no more bandits to 2aw 3 cannon knights and 2 dragon soldiers
  you can keep your spergshit games that require 5 hours of daily gameplay to their respective corner thanks
  why go to such extremes  i just want my daily playtime to go from 10 minutes to 20
soldier b was here  white emperor is a loser and a cuck and a virgin
so is aigis dying last year they had mao come this year it was nothing
when is the prince fucking the emperors sister im getting hard just thinking about it
  when another white empire novel comes out
  nephty again  holy fuck just make her permanent already and let me get some unclaimed sc for more sadness rolls trying to get leora
  she really should enter the daily revival pool
10 gold/silver on both main and alt
25 sc left to spend for legend stamp card for next month  first roll  oops
  once more i am freed from this hell which means theyll probably add another dragon unit next week since thats what happened the last time i finally got all of them
awakened maou looks cool
after getting jack shit on the first 4 10roll tickets i finally got 2 blacks on the last 10roll  useless anri  dupe orochihime  tthanks
chibi lapis deals absolutely 0 damage without a dancer around because of her gimped stats/shittier affection bonuses and skill has like a minute initial timer at least its saw
magic fencers prioritize ground units  learned this the hard way on the 70/6 map when ingrid ignored the fliers to fuck around with some demons nowhere near the exit god that was frustrating i bet im going to forget this little trivia too on the next event
so is wurm still useless
  all melee spot units prioritize ground iirc     for ranged its kind of wonky anelia and maple go from air first to ground first on skill for example
  wurm was never useless
  going through the japanese and english wiki it seems to be noted on older classes like ninja and magic fencer but not on the newer ones like tengu and even bowriders i didnt find the information ingame after a cursory glance either ill give it a quick test in an hour when my stamina regenerates but its probably easier to assume that melee priority moving on
less than i hoped for but not too bad most of the plats are new
  theres more info in the faq section of the jp wiki
10 more rolls  absolute trash  free happy and no one to use it because all my good blacks are already maxed    worst anniversary 2018
zero blacks in 50 thanks aigis
  felt like my goblins spelled eat shit to me instead because thats what my 50 tickets told me
wait is this the first time prince spoke
can you stack remii and lapis attack buffs
  thanks i really hope i dont forget all this and embarass myself again next year
  they dont stack
  they dont stack  maybe ill bench lapis until some stage wants me to use a demon summoner then i like remii a lot more because shes cuter so im very reluctant to remove her from the attack buffer spot even if she costs double
  the first time he spoke was 4 years ago during horus event thats the egyptian princess looking magic fencer    he tends to only speak during very plot important moments
so can any units even come close to 150k atk rischelte maybe    
  what do you even do if this guy comes and slaps your girl on the ass
  aigis only has 10k
  youd also have to survive 30000 ranged true damage at a reasonably fast speed
i need a chibi druid so i can level this team for fun and use it on gold only stages chibi fiore when
  how the fuck is prince supposed to eventually fight that
another lolicept black  in imperial gacha  fucking rip forever my lolicept collection
  thats not imperial gacha
    its not fucking fair
    shes in the normal gacha
shadia gives 10 hp to herself and demons does this mean she counts as a demon herself because of so she and nakia could be devastating
  does this mean she counts as a demon herself  pretty sure it means the contrary if she herself was a demon why point out that the bonus affects demons and her they could have just said demons
why does risley have used condoms on her leg
  one for every paizuri
i just want her let me get her so i can play your fucking game shiro pro
  are you rerolling for a specific 7 good luck dude
  i just wish most games were like kirara fantasia and have an automatic reroll button
another dupe from my 10 roll ticket  4 black dupes in total  thanks dev tea
who should i get with the free black tickets  going through the wiki just left me more confused   aisha 40 ct reduction illustration is wonky  altair cost gain is great but not sure if its worth a black ticket  moltena seems amazing early on  ingrid lapis piercing damage doesnt seem like itd benefit from the mr debuff  iris already have rinne
9 golds and 1 plat from last ticket all of them useless and 6 of them are male   happy anniv yeah what waste of time
  this little shit has better blacks than me after two years of playing
  you can pretty safely go for moltena and keep the other ticket for later  you already have 3 of the best blacks in the game covering utility aoe damage and dueling plus saria is a very good healer definitely avoid iris shes outdated anyways moltena isnt just good early she works pretty much everywhere especially since you can boost her dogs with lapis for some ridiculous damage  you are however missing any kind of antiair and long range damage so i would wait before the last pick until youve rolled some more actually wait for the first ticket too theres no need to pick moltena right away either roll first then use the ticket later you dont want to pick someone and then roll a dupe
  aisha  her saw also gives her mapwide nuking which is pretty great yeah shes an uggo though  altair   theres a reason all good up gen characters are considered high tier  moltena  yeah shes good  ingrid  you use lapis to buff your damage dealers not the other way around  iris  her and rinne have different uses but id still get someone else    get altair because you lack any good plat/black early drops or up gen    second one just get whoever you like the most if you dont get aisha make sure to get leona from the tp for 400rc    saving both or at least one of your tickets until you have a better understanding of the game and more blacks is also a viable option youll be getting plenty of blacks anyway as a new player
  sybilla obviously
  how did she reach 150k atk
  through the power of friendship
  i had ingrid and sybilla use their secret duo slash finishing move which does exactly 150000 true damage total
unitia is having a major campaign to celebrate their new renewal patch  1/2 ap for dailies quests  free 10 rolls everyday for character gacha and equipment gacha for 15 days total of 150 free rolls  7 days login bonus gives you a 5 pick ticket  limit break for characters has been revamped now it only requires characters dupes and a bunch of rainbow elixirs instead of a few thousand materials like before the gold cost also has been massively reduced level is capped at 50 instead of 70 and characters gain their stat boost each limit break immediately    if you still have interest in the game this is probably the best time to check it now the game still has fuck all for pve content and pvp probably will get even more cancerous than ever with the new oracle assist enhancement and new limit break system but hey at least the art is nice
  none of your choices are wrong if you dont have them personally i picked altair moltena and amanda altair to not worry about up moltena to carry me and amanda for waifu
    seriously though   how did you fucking kill him
  
  renewal patch  what did they change is the game actually worth playing now
  wow never mind then  fuck this
  look at his up he probably waited and found out that he loses his immortality after a while
  so hes like the trolls that lose regen  what his shield just disappears
  see wasnt it better when you thought it was from the power of friendship like  said      shuris revive cycle is 40 seconds so as long as you can stall 40 seconds straight with melees/skills you can keep him permanently locked down and yes it disappears after a while not even infinite duration skills in this game are actually infinite
    his fuck you shield ability is on a timer a really long timer but still a timer  people did something similiar with tongtian jiaozhu
  no tongtian was slightly different he gradually lost hp over time so eventually hed just kill himself i didnt use that strategy but as far as i know it had nothing to do with his shield wearing off
    so you just need infinite stalling to cheese him is it possible without shuri i guess you could do it with xingfu
  youll be getting plenty of blacks anyway as a new player  explain pity blacks dont count
  explain how ill be getting blacks outside the main source of getting blacks
  not him but what kind of retarded proviso is that he obviously meant that as a new player youll have a steady supply of scs with which youll roll blacks
  well it takes quite a bit of time to gather enough for it though and you said plenty so i though there might be another way
  possible though more difficult xing fus revive cycle is 60 seconds so youll need more stuns/immortal units
  theres also the two monthly plat ticket 40 chance of a black assuming you are diligent enough to reach legend stamp every month which is entirely possible for at least 6 month as a new player
    you won the game congratulations
  i see thanks for the info  still need to burn a lot of things to get those tickers though
  40 chance of a black  isnt it 15
  whats the chance for a black unit out of the gold fame pull
  40 chance of a black  the what now  its no more than 20 for sure
  yeah but you have 2 tickets plus the fame pull i think its 8 so all considered you have 40 of at least 1 black
    theres no way you can reach legend stamp every month without whaling
get no blacks for the first 40  3 blacks in the final 10  who said luck didnt turn around howd i do with these girls
  theres no way you can reach legend stamp every month without whaling  thats where youre wrong kiddo
  i did it and someone else who started with me approximately 1 year ago also did it and reported back here i think i got it for at least 7 months although i missed a perfect streak 6 months is absolutely possible
  miyabi is good the others are trash but then again you have the chinese zombie so you dont need that many more blacks anyways
  others are trash  dina is actually good since ha 2aw
  nothing major some rebalance reworked limit break system new upgrade system for oracle assist adjust feeding price and exp value and extreme mode for story chapter 1 they also mentioned something about relaxing pvp ranking system but god knows what they actually meant by that
  but you dont need ha
  gotta have someone protect the zombo
  yeah like that palfy he rolled who can actually protect her
  how many blacks do you have   i also started 1 year ago and only have 15 blacks i definitely dont remember reaching legend stamp every month guess i messed up
  zombie can protect herself with timestop tokens and delete the enemy before it gets to her  or just get a carmilla vampire in front of her for more zombie power
  you mean the character thats inferior to dina unless youre vs heavy magic damage      zombie can protect herself  only on easy maps which is 99 of content so youre not exactly wrong
  ims shiny colors has one too and iirc those are the only two games ive played that do every game needs it and almost none of them have it
   seems amazing early on  its the opposite shes really only amazing after you completely max her out she needs aw2 and saw to be the broken unit everyone says she is and needs max level to cap her dog stats    but really go with any of those of the five id say aisha and moltena are the most uniquely useful the only one of them i dont have is ingrid and the other four are in basically every party i put together
  honestly dina was good before not great but good i usually found that for as much as people liked to use fuuko and talk about how great she was saw dina could fill in for her on pretty much any map at a much lower cost      silly anon dina isnt for tanking shes for blowing groups of shit up or blowing flying shit up she does do a rather respectable job of not dying though being a black heavy with a 25 nullification passive
260 scs spent this month and no leora  these were my last easy scs too as i went through the revival schedule for one year  maybe ill have enough for a plat stamp card by next year if aigis is still around by then
lapis is my waifu i like her new adjutant screen
wurm still trash  cant even see lapis background because of the fucking chair  another meme 10 roll ticket  next revival is lightning prince for the millionth time this year  is this the worst week of all time
    could you post her background  asking for a friend of course i have lapis
have no idea how to to post the one without ui so have a screenshot
  im at 21 20 if you exclude the one i got from the 10 rolls and 18 if you exclude the two i picked rinne and iris so yeah had you reached legend more often you probably would be much better off now although i think i was lucky with the monthly tickets as far as numbers go for the longest time i had mostly mediocre/bad blacks i also only rolled 1 dupe 2 including the 10 rolls almost always exclusively rolling pickup helped with that by contrast i often rolled dupe plats which meant i had enough rainbow crystals to afford an extra ticket a couple of times  i never got any black from the fame gacha   i also never spent scs on refills/farm by the way
  thats not how probability works here
  1  085085092  1  06647  03353 or 34 of at least one black  well whatever 34 is pretty close to 40 in my book
  maybe he meant it in the desire sensor sense     i mean ive been playing for three years and all i have to show for it is 18 blacks using all your revival sc before the pity system stings a lot
  i also never spent scs on refills/farm by the way  how do you deal with events and farming for materials then considering you only have 1 day for stuff like fairies and stuff
  events  i dont and i cant see why anyone would do that event units are usually shit and even if they werent there is no need to reach mincost or max skill level by spending a limited resource such as scs i just run the mission once or twice if i feel energetic enough it and thats it   stuff like fairies and stuff  do you mean the dailies just wait a week till they come back after youve depleted your stamina/charisma seriously i dont even no wonder people complain about not having blacks if they waste scs like that i dont even run the fairies one because the rate is abysmal at times i didnt even enough mats sure but i just waited a bit and the problem solved itself  most of my units arent mincosted nor are they even nearly max leveled and i have no problems with pretty much any content nor had i much problem before i got the hermit of balance co at least not any problem that levels or cost would solve i also dont awaken/level/skill units randomly if i dont use them most of my plats sit in storage at base level
  at times i didnt even  didnt have
    douzo lads  
  neat where can i find the rest of the other girls if there is any
  whoops forgot to remove joke name    i meant it in the mathy way 6 margin is pretty huge
started 3 days ago managed to get 20 for the event since i like the event poster girl design so much and the final 10 tickets got me tenma  dunno about her fighting abilities but her passive is great
  started 3 days ago  i hate you
  you are missing one black shu and youll have won the game sheng tenma rinne and lapis are 4 of the 5 most broken units moltena is close behind them   honestly start looking for a new game because i doubt youll last long playing everything in mental_retardation_easy mode
  did you just block your title but not your name  why does luck reward people like you
  if you started 3 days ago you could have gotten the the 3 rateup girls by rerolling a couple of times
  oops sorry for stuttering
  i used to play the game years ago and my team was like pic related i used to see all kind of videos and see which thing worked and then pry if it might work  so starting strong like this is a good change i suppose
  damn not only do you have more blacks than me you also have way better blacks  guess im a lucklet _    i never spent any scs on events/dailies either except for that one time i wasted 25 scs mincosting lieselotte    where did you get the scs in the first place the daily revival quest i still have quite a few of those below 100 i also havent touched the 4star mission above arc 2 but i dont see how these two sources could net you enough scs to reach legend every month
  aigis is more attracted to stupid people i suppose
  why are you complaining when you got the cutest girls
  well among my last 4 black were lapis ashera and sheng so not too long ago i was in a somewhat similar situation  and yeah i did everything at 100 revivals story everything character quests too   the 4star mission above arc 2  thats a truckload of scs  but i dont see how these two sources could net you enough scs to reach legend every month  reaching legend itself gives you more scs via login bonus too  did you log in everyday for the free scs from streams etc
  lapis 1st place was the only one to get a special background
  oh and to add to this remember that we are talking about every month for 6 months not for one whole year it left me with no sc afterwards for a while until i got enough for another legend stamp once since then i havent rolled at all and im reaching 150 scs soon again though now i bought some too so it doesnt count anymore
  white empire blacks fucking 5 of them  complain other people have better blacks  yeah maybe in your next life dont roll from gachas with almost guaranteed shit units
found it
i cant pick the lolicept titty samurai so who do i use my 10k ticket on
  this man is truly dedicated to his craft
  chinese zombie of balance or rinne
  the sheer dedication this man exudes
    thanks guess i really need to do those maps i tried doing those before but i failed hard so i just stopped trying but i think my current team now is strong enough      yeah maybe in your next life dont roll from gachas with almost guaranteed shit units  no adamassama has been kind to me unlike that evil god aigis i only spent like 300 scs in total at the imperial gacha and i ended up almost completing the lineup now im only missing 3 blacks and 2 plats    but i probably wont pull the imperial gatcha the next time it comes around since the chance of getting dupes would be almost guaranteed
  is that witch good
  considering what units you have  rinne but it would feel like a waste getting her with that ticket so tenma or shuxian probably
  this fucking guy
  yeah her saw makes her permanently invisible to enemies i deploy her and kasumi to the area where the boss would appear beforehand most of the time they end up killing the boss before it moves    she also has a clone token that doesnt use up a deployment slot the clone has the same stat as the original minus the affection bonus so youre practically getting 2 witches for the price of one too bad witches are pretty useless nowadays
  bullshit  i refuse to believe
  tfw lolicept is an aigis oldfag and probably has a better team than you do  
  he cant keep getting away with this
  hes been doing fanart a long time ago it really is surprising hes been contacted with work offers recently  well relatively speaking  he sure is churning out character art fast  seriously how the fuck does he update his pixiv with high quality art so frequently and do professional commissions as well
  they dont even give him his ownmade units thats sad
lord of helmes or magnum opus for machina  the increased range seems more useful in general but with the higher splash radius she gets a whole 260 splash on skill which is higher than tenmas splash half the map saw
  i think most of the times ive seen people go for magnum opus thats the one i got too but didnt use her that much yet
  i dont think theres a right or wrong choice for machina both routes work well for her the stat differences are pretty minimal so its either skill duration/range or defense reduction/splash radius follow your heart/dick i guess
  rank 300
  300  wallet  playtime everytime    hes most likely a better player than i am so it all evens out in the end plus he can actually draw at a level exceeding kindergarten scribbles
  thats probably good enough to work on a quality nutaku title
  try your best anon if you start drawing more now youll be able to insert your very own fetish to aigis 2 too
new aegis player here how much it would take me to attempt those awakening quests for materials
  youd need a few 50c50 units to reliably attempt them     work on a heavy armor the biggest threats on 5/7 of the maps deal physical damage     depending on your rolls you could either struggle or completely stomp the quests
  the orb quests not much there are plenty of strategy videos out there for completing them with leveled silver units
  thanks looks like i still need to grind some maps  i hope im not doing it wrong by feeding my units drops from the maps i roll to level them up since its kinda slow
  you actually are due to how expensive it is     money will be a serious bottleneck for you until you can start grinding the gold/exp dailies on monday  friday
  as long as youre not feeding them silvers feed all the bronze and iron units you want thats what theyre there for
  feed them bronze units
      got it thanks
  but then id be working on a nutaku title which means extreme guilt and selfloathing closely followed by suicide      yall niggers aint ready for the tsunami of wholesome lovemaking with the aim of impregnation leading to intense cuddling and pillow talk that kind of degeneracy is too extreme for any decent human being
  you fucking degenerate
wait shit they gave out a free max value happy    who do i send to lv 99 heaven 
  with the aim of impregnation  not gonna lie the only time i find vaginal more erotic to most other sex acts is when theres an emphasis on baby making  so with that said you have my full support and backing do your best anon
  shengpu
  oh there are always greater depths of depravity to be plumbed
      the fucking lot of you are degenerates with no soul how dare you post this on a blue board  good job
  aigis is a dying game after all cant afford to give out blacks for free this anniversary is a proof of that
  but 50 rolls give on average 1 and a half blacks
  tell that to the majority of the playerbase that either got a bunch of silver and gold trash dupe blacks or completely garbage units
  rolled 6 blacks personally  4 of them were dupes 1 of them is trash i wouldnt even touch but im forced to because she has a 3rd scene and the other was good but not really something i needed    all in all despite me getting 16k rc and 2 new blacks i wouldnt consider it favorable to a pick ticket neither would i consider them free because they cost luck to roll and just leave you with an awful feeling when you see a dupe or complete trash tier black pop up
  no blacks at all guess im below average
  anniv is coming boys tickets and freeshit boys  just a little longer almost here  its here  no ticket just more random gacha bullshit  i got tricked and i suffer now
  i saw creators all the time having to gacha their own characters no matter the game though
no love for clissa
would it be dumb to buy white emperor and use the anniversary happy on him i have no awakened blacks and dont think i can do that mission any time soon
  just save it for later
decided to go for 250 stamp because i really want lynchos  spent 100 sc and got 6 plats none of which are her and an off banner black from my pity  whats the rateup number anyway having it miss 7 times sucks
  the majority of the playerbase  statistically unlikely  the probability of getting at least one black is   1  09750  78  in order for the majority of them being dupes most people would need to have more than half the blacks in the game which is unreasonable  also the probability of at least two blacks is  1  022  035  43  more than 2 every 5 people got at least 2 blacks on average  almost 1 in 5 18 got at least 3 blacks  more than 1 in 10 12 got at least 4 blacks  yeah 1 in 5 didnt get blacks at all tough luck they were a needed sacrifice so that the other 4 in 5 could thrive  get over it this was mathematically a good anniversary its true that a pick ticket might have been advantageous gamewise for older players but aigis is a healthy game looking after its new players this is a great boon for them besides three pick tickets would be too much repeat this for each anniversary 8 years from now how could they give 10 picks for free that would defeat the point of the game being a gacha game free pick tickets needed to stop if you want one pay
  you have my sympathy i think i missed her on about 8 or 9 rateup plats before i got her
  nice napkin math that you pulled out of your ass how much sc do you get for defending this shitfest of anniv or are you one of those that gets pleasure from epicly trolling people on the internet
  free pick tickets needed to stop if you want one pay 100 dollars  yeah id go with the epic trole myself
  nice napkin math that you pulled out of your ass  even if i were trolling the math is correct
is it just me or does aigis add gacha units at a really slow pace compared to other games  as in in the time other games would add like 10 aigis added 2 or 3  makes it easier to collect stuff  but also fuck dupes
  to be fair your aspergers is showing in your retarded hyperbolic victim complex spergfit that he quoted
    oh its you again wouldnt it be better for you to fling shit and collect all the replies your angry little heart desires on /vg/
  since im here ill calculate this too the rate up is 6x as such the probability of getting her as long as she is the only rate up plat on a plat pull is about 10 the chance of not pulling her in 6 plat rolls is 53 so you could say that on average you wont get her with 6 pulls you need 7 and even then its a toss up even with 9 pulls 40 of people wont get her even with 20 pulls more than 1 player in 10 will still fail from there up it gets massively easier though
  math is about right but you divide the anniversary gift into those who have and have nots
  funny how you talk about flinging shit when youre a subhuman seanigger whos too fucking dumb to know basic math and proceeds to fling shit in his daily autistic fit  4chan isnt your safespace kid multiple people are going to bully you for being a dumbfuck virgin and pretending like your victim complex is a trump card is never going to work
  nice shop
  math is fine but people expect to get a rest from random gacha shit oncetwice in a year and recieve their guardeneed shit without any risks  also people dont care about other people draws and success   but we got fucked instead i dont know why would anyone defend this
  is clissa a good ramp
  8 years from now how could they give 10 picks for free  and here i had my 10 bux post all prepped and ready to go well played funpostkun    there are currently 88 gachaonly blacks in the game between all the various pools assuming the game isnt dead within 8 years we could expect well over double that number of total gacha blacks 10 freebies would be table scraps doubly so since devtea would probably insist on keeping the same list of prehistoric picks    i do find it hilarious when someone actually seriously white knights for corporate profit mongering its like looking at a drawing of ouroboros except the poor sod has his head up his ass instead of his tail in his mouth      bad day
id like these christmas teasers more if dataminers didnt already leak the whole banner already  hell the h scenes are on the panda already so the whole event must be already in the game
to the autist who randomly spams kamihime shit on /gfg/  stop
  if its the guy that has to include victim complex and shove as many buzzwords as he can in his posts then your anger only fuels him
  its closer to 9 actually i counted plats in a banner and it was 59  so the more units they add to a game the harder it is to roll on banner unit you want now that i think about this system benefits ultra whales who get bunch of units while rolling by having a lower chance for dupe of the same unit a system with seperate rateup chance would have but it fucks over people with lower resources who just want the damn unit really makes you think
  im not on the same aspie virgin victim complex level as you where id stoop low enough to go to a general that shit let alone play a bad cuckold clone  try again next time maybe your retarded seanigger buddy will believe in your scary boogeyman
  its tourettes anon again  jesus step up your insult game a little there are markov chains that banter better than you
  there are markov chains that banter better than you  ouch now we have to send our victim complex guy to the closest burn center
  well generally they only add new characters right before an event so spoilers are only up for a few hours i doubt anyone knew that they werent going to add any new characters for the current event and just sit on the christmas ones for 10 days
  there are markov chains that banter better than you  looks up markov chains  well damn hes got you there anon
pulled both on banner blacks and 2 trash off banner plats  no leora  tie me a fucking noose lads i want out
oldie but a goodie
  when will they all be translated  the world will never know
  and i just got uzume on a rage 1000rc ticket  well shit she and leora are my two most wanted units so now only one remains  too bad ill never get the cutest girl in all of aigis
  maybe if i ever feel like doing more never ever or maybe if scans of volumes 4 are ever uploaded
opinions on chibi lapis
  shes adorable but she should have gotten chibi tokens as well
so if i have lychnos and wurm should i aw2 them and ignis for a dumb trio
  more like aw2 ignis and lychnos for a dumb duo and aw2 sabein for a 15 cost call for reinforcements iv    wurm still remains meh from aw2 while every other dragon soldier improves by leagues
  ooh i forgot about sabein i like it  have lychnos blocking one pathway and then slap down sylvia or alice in the other have kuuko giving lychnos more defence and have shuxian and uzume in the back with rinne healing
  they actually just added them 30 mins ago i dont really need a wind healer but still spent 21k jewels got the limited r sr and ssr thunder kaiser   this is the part where i complain about how the gacha rates for kh are the worst thing ever right
pirate aw2  at least its one of the older/more populated classes this time maybe a permanent 1 target a la piercing shots or something
  oh fuck thats great news looking forward to their aw2 for my minerva
  congrats anon and hope you get leora soon too i know the feeling of the one girl you like best being out of your reach       both minerva and anelia are mainstays in my team this is great news too bad aigis will die next monday and there will be no pirate aw2
just started aigis what black unit should i take with my rank 10 black ticket should it be rinne afterall since shes apparently amongst the best
  did you roll yet
  rinne  moltena is the standard choice but you should save your pick tickets until youve rolled your free 10 pull ones and hopefully gotten someone good  if not make some alts  shouldve started a week ago rinne/lapis/shengpu gacha just ended
  i rolled but im not making multiple accounts because i play other games and forgot about jumping around    oh well cant do much about that at least ill have lightning prince since its going on
  thanks anon really hoping i get her shes too cute    just got 5 more sc scraped together so heres hoping
  if you save it for a couple hours it would count for next stamp card
  too late im a broken man  fucking marika blocked my leora for the 2nd time ive gone through most of the fucking imperial plat pool this is bullshit
50 evasion and 50 skill reuse time to everyone within 240 range permanently with instant start time  89 assassinate chance that activates constantly with her high attack speed  hits like a defense ignoring vampire hunter on her other activations  7 cost max    risley is pretty fucking good lads
  she is pretty much a powercreeped version of lepuru with wonder hearts offensive ability if she had an offensive saw so you could pick between it and normal skill she would be pretty much perfect
  while i underestimated jesters before gusion im still not too convinced about them
  this guy again got leora from imperial gacha and why is she not a black unit  guess ill just save my pity black for a unit i like
  jesters are pretty fun its good to see them finally get a black  they also have the nice minor side benefit of potentially being really good in 4 missions with 3x cost for anything higher rarity than gold
i miss 3day long maintenances
  no you dont
  you dont get it man  the thrill the chaos the owabi stones  keeping a tab on 2ch/wiki threads  conspiracies and doomposting everywhere
speaking of maintenances expect one for kanpani soon  theres some bug that freezes the game when viewing the collab page
  ho boy i didnt play that game for ages did any big changes happen
  its pretty much the same as it always has been
moritan disliker anon here yknow the guy who drew luxe a few months ago    last 10 pull ticket gave me her    why
  just sell her for plat roll ez
  at least shes an actual solid unit as much as our mentally disabled theorycrafters will tell you how bad she is
whens mage aw2 lads
look guys its totally not sarah        never ever
  i just care about the tits man  im sure shell dodge me like juubei did though      you guys realize minerva wont be getting aw2 art right shes to duo like grace is to sylseth or deine is to diina
  its totally not sarah  yeah she actually has good art
  luxe is a good unit though very quick redeployment with her lockdown skill allows for a lot of tacticool plays
  but minerva is better than duo
  look guys its totally not sarah  it says eve right there what you on about mate
its only me or dmm really slow today
  shes way older and looks like an old hag compared to sarah
  but duo is liked more
  is she i didnt see the jp polls but i seriously have to question jap taste if they like that ugly nigger more
    literally the same artist so sameface syndrome
   guys realize minerva wont be getting aw2 art right  probably for the best minervas aw art is an atrocity
  well what did you expect from a unit that was originally platinum
  i hate it so much her base art is great and then she gets aw art that bad  she needs aw2 art more than anyone
  020 duo 115  021 jerome 112  022 alicia 108  023 mephisto 107  024 dorothea 104  025 racua 098  026 minerva 094    they were both in group c hilariously enough
  oh alright thats not a huge difference thankfully enough minervas aw art definitely doesnt help her
    wait that was day 1 votes heres the final results    019 duo 76207 votes  020 aix 74093 votes  021 mephisto 69504 votes  022 jerome 65980 votes  023 dorothea 65644 votes  024 racua 62951 votes  025 alicia 59798 votes  026 minerva 55270 votes
minerva is an ancient unit and doesnt even have a third scene shes not getting aw2 art like someone pointed out already shes going to get the same treatment as grace  a newer unit thats more popular and has a different artist is going to get the aw2 art as the better class staple black unit
  eh whatever doesnt matter too much i guess can just keep using her base art  i maintain that shes far better than duo though
  that huge number of votes  you pulling my leg buddy
  arent those tickets
  still thats a huge number  and people were memeing about this game shuting down
  each person could get max 999 tickets per phase   heres the winners    001 lapis 2330373 votes  002 rinne 1910776 votes  003 jinguang shengpu 1775144 votes  004 sybilla 1222266 votes  005 nanaly 737734 votes  006 altair 682274 votes  007 moltena 631937 votes  008 silvia 621656 votes  009 shuxian 587373 votes  010 anna 584724 votes
should i focus on leveling up my new fresh units or polish the neglected ones first  bear in mind these are only shrine blacks here and basically every event/free black except for we and eterna are also neglected    obviously im not going to ignore lapis but i lack some orbs for her
  at least aw towa if you can her passive is insanely good for an endgame team after that maybe rion to pair with miyabi
      i might buy it
  imagine going from a premier game like aigis to some shitty budget hgame    i guess yamans career is dead
  honestly probably the other way around
    honestly probably the other way around  i think so too even small oneroute hgames pay a lot to their artists because of cg requirements and azarashi is apparently a subsidiary of nexton which is pretty damn big lots of industry connections to be had here yaman looks to have a good future     i dont know how competitive aigis is regarding this though how much do you think they pay for 3 portraits and 3 scenes
3 dupe plats and 1 dupe black from legend tickets  i miss getting new units
rolled all the way to pity on main banner for jester or new bowrider    3rd silvia dupe offrate  why
wheres the new thread
this story ended earlier than i expected
but why
monthly ticket  dupe julia  sell her for the 500rc ticket  julia  okay
give me one good reason why i shouldnt ticket this pair of tits
  there isnt agnes is hot
  necromancer right now is useless class
  cant shes sexy and bodysuits are top tier
  if julia drops doesnt stack with others that means i should sell monica cuterie and robert right
  they stack just fine
  according to the nips no it doesnt  アビリティの泥アップ効果は既存の他キャラのアビと重複し累積加算しないので注意
damn i should learn to read i thought the stamp card grade mentioned at the top is the one im getting not the one i will get after i spent the needed bunch of sc  i held back on buying the barracks upgrades because i thought i already am at legend
  fuck didnt actually know this so i used a plat ticket on her i mean shes still better but 2 more than the next best isnt exactly ticket worthy
  now thats just fucking stupid sasuga dev tea
roll for pity plat on leora spotlight  get the plat merchant from the other spotlight gacha  excuse me what the fuck literally giving me the memetier gold get unit  fuck this two plat dupes from tickets and now this aaaaaaaaagh
  and i just got ema when rolling for risley  december status fucked
  ah fuck adamas just reset my pity black
  hey welcome to the club while rolling for leora ive pulled wurm mephisto motley marika x2 ralph tanya x2 and a few other shitty plats
  the very next roll  a dupe frederica  just
imperial pug when
  ema is good tho
  but i wanted risley
  was there a sex scene on the r18 version i swear i read something about an event sex scene
  ema gives you a buttjob though which is more patrician than paizuri
  i wanted risley for clown paizuri understand
  you got clowned but the one that clowned you was aigis instead of risley
  care to elaborate
  looking at her tits got me thinking that aigis should have an affection meter for hscenes that fills up whenever you roll
  keep trying
  its a well known fact aigis is fucking useless
  isnt that the pity counter
  pity counter only brings despair i need to exact my revenge through a dominating paizuri after she scams me with offbanner dupes
  i dont think theyll allow you to fuck a goddess
    resets each month  when you get a scene its always some variation of aigis domming or humiliating prince
  what was that about clown sex
  its funny
is farne any good i just got her from the legend ticket
  she at least showed up for the 4th anniversary were she and adamas were crucial in actually killing keraunos shes done shit this year though    funnily enough this year had imperial premium on the anniversary as well
  new thread
  yes r18 version has got the hscene while allages version has some sort of afterstory instead
  cool thanks
so does marisa speak with a boyish/country accent or not  ive seen her talking translated at least three different ways
  she talks like jotaro
だぜ
  her speech is a little roughandtumble without being macho plus as a person shes big on hard work community personal liberty and gratuitous explosions so giving her a mild texan accent seems about right
  in pcb alice pretty much calls herself a citydweller and marisa a country bumpkin
since this is a relevant thread for it what would be the closest equivalent for futos accent some people translate it into olde english but i heard from some that her accent is more like the way a grandma would talk and that thats the idea she acts like an enthusiastic child but talks like a granny is this accurate
  how does a grandma talk with 70s slang
  shes got her own tongue of speaking and id say thats more like one with an accent to it  ze
  she refers to herself with ware never used in modern japanese except in incantations or to make a character sound centuries old and jibun detached/military less i walked over than one walks over she refers to others with onushi used by nobility and very old people and omae blunt/rude
well guys im a fucking idiot i missed my chance to preorder her because i was too stupid to realize she was an exclusive any chance of a reissue someday or am i sol
previous thread     this thread is for the discussion of untranslated japanese visual novels    what are you playing what are you looking forward to what have you finished you know the drill
      they have a crack here  
want to read an erotic game  people over at the house  terrible
  if its not a nukige 99 isnt even ero
  im in the middle of a sex scene that i want to fap to though
i was going to read saya no uta but the game acts as though im constantly scrolling up i have no idea whats causing this and the game has become totally unplayable this only seems to happen with certain untranslated vns and so far saya is the 4th one that does this before anyone says it ive tried unpluging mouse and keyboard pressing every button and right now im at a loss i downloaded an english version and it works fine but i dont want to read translated shit has anyone else encountered this problem
  i want her to step on me
  no probably a problem on your end try getting the nitro the best version of saya and see if it keeps happening
  ill do that if i have to but id really like to find the core if this issue if i can i googled the issue and other people have had this issue with nobody responding to them and considering theres about 3 other vns i wanted to read but cant with no other versions itd be preferable to figure out the core issue
so gekkou no carnival just wont work on anything other than xp   thats such a fucking drag
  i use my xp vm for anything thats old
  i tried it once but i couldnt get any vns to run full screen so i just gave up
good news is that gekkou works with the xp vm bad news is that the resolution fucks up when i try to go full screen any idea how to fix that
  i think you need to install the virtualbox guest additions thing so it can match the resolution of your actual computer i have no idea how to do this on a windows host though
i did all the nonkazuna routes in cartagra and theyre all pretty pointless at least in the koyukiseri end you learn something but the hatsune and takako ones are weird especially the takako one is just wtf i had a feeling things wont end well but i didnt expect such abrupt cut    now im finally in kazunas route
  there is a good chance it works on linux      i think that is the normal behavior as the vms screen has a low resolution if you go to fullscreen ingame under view you can set a scale factor though
will our guy morisaki ryouto deliver
  my guess would be you have a controller plugged in i know you said you tested all of that but there has to be some kind of input the game is reading controllers are usually not supported so it could be a reason to make things messy with only a few games
moege where a heroine is being really upfront and flirty with the protagonist constantly teasing him and you can tell she really wants the d  get to the actual romance parts and her personality immediately does a 180 she acts completely submissive and embarassed by everything  anyone know any moege where this doesnt happen
please stop posting on /vn/
  must be some djt eops that cant fully break off from the eop world
yes please
  arent we all
  luckily not please leave
  sorry no
150cm  imagine etc
  under 140cm is better
  
  play a bit itll crash
  oh wow fuck it does
  i think it crashes before the op plays probably a problem with video codecs
  quite a few olderish vns have issues with lav filters which i think is used quite a bit nowadays for example eushullys im zeros prerendered effects are basically not really playing and instead you get several seconds long blackscreen if i remember this right it happens with some other eushully games as well worth trying to blacklist the program for lav filters if thats used i think you still have to do this in the registry but maybe they changed that
how much ero does shugaten have relative to the length of the whole game/routes
  it detected youre an eop
  not too much but the whole game is super short
i know i am retarded but how do you get the ending scene with aoi in aokana  i finished the asuka route do i have to do another route to unlock it
anyone know any good nukige where yarisa feature prominitely besides  
  pretty sure its after all of them
  have you considered looking up some easily available walkthrough
  very late reply but thank you so so much i appreciate it
  stop being a degenerate and stop fapping then
  that actually did it for me thanks mate
  next time check mikocon or as threads cracks get linked in them or google game name nodvd化
anyone has a mediafire link for senrenbanka the file i downloaded seems to be giving me a compatibility error that compatibility mode cant seem to fix
  sorry we dont care about english releases here
  senrenbanka  english release  maybe in 2050 yeah
  oh i thought its eopd already     well i dont see why wouldnt the japanese version work for you probably something on your end it worked 100 fine for me
  the rar i downloaded was corrupted i forgot where i first got it since i downloaded it 24 years ago
  oh right then look for mega on eyny but be careful they often have preinstalled chinese versions
anyone here reads and dont mind spoiling me on what happens during himawari aqua after kinda lazy to read it since it doesnt have a voice like the original remake one
  terrible shit as in terrible fucked up shit you really dont see in eroge
  fuck off eop
  learn japanese for reals and then read it
    i can read it just fine i just hate vns with no voice on it      what is this terrible shit
does anyone knows how to unlock the rest of the after stories   i donwloaded a 100 save and yet i still dont have acces to some cgs wich i assume are in the after stories
  新作天結いラビリンスマイスター  woah woah what sequel fd either way im happy for more fia
  did she inadvertently leak it
  i think they revealed it during their 20th anniversary live doubt they would have her sing it there if they didnt want people to know
  i see i guess it was a preofficial reveal for people in attendance
  i can read it just fine i just hate vns with no voice on it  you probably hate them because you cant read
  the rest of the after stories were released as free dlc patches might be on holy seal still  one of the later lovely cation release had them all bundled in iirc if that doesnt work
  you mean this    
  its neither the same title nor is today april 1st so probably not
im thinking about reading monobeno should i read happy end or the original version
  would be funny if it really is an arpg
  he
  apparently the dlcs all are on their website wich isnt available for ips outside japan  could someone from japan or with a vpn dowload them and share a mega links of their content  i have a vpn with a dozen of country but none of those are japan  a link to their website    the name of the dlcs apparently is append life
      get the quality package rerelease it should include them
    by which i mean   lovelycationもうずっと初恋の日々エディション
  the spoonfeeding gets more intense thread by thread there are free japanese vpns you know
  like i tried three from google and none worked currently donwloading this      anyway
jesus why must the game torture me with this main girl yet nontrue route
  why torture the normal ending is fine i dont think i ever actually bothered with the true ending given how awful the couple of other endings were that i tried
  the shit nigger everything points to kazuna and mc not being together in the normal and being together in the true end obviously the true one is gonna be better
  shes still the main heroine my dude  id say more but you should read for yourself     the true ending is literally the best ending there is my nigga and its the one with propa closure
  i found the whole thing very fitting for the game
    nono is easily best wife in niizuma cation her being a shortstack is just a bonus i really dont think the pregnancy end suited her though shame they just copypasted it onto every heroine
  say ah    
  in the future please learn to use animesharing or mikocon for basic shit like appends patches or cracks i only spoonfed you because i like cation and felt bad for you
  yeah im not really digging the other girls might just do nonos route and leave it at that
  i wasnt even interested in nono when i started playing niizuma i was going to do yukis route since she looks just like kazusa but doing the common route convinced me nono was the one her seiyuu really nailed it compared to yuki and aikos seiyuu
    thanks finnally i used your link since it was way faster
i didnt like this homo at the beginning but i found myself liking him more as the story progressed  makes you wonder if hes green with envy at asahis perfect appearance since he knew about everything from the start
do you try to time when you cum to match with the characters or do you just let it go whenever
  hes got a moment at the end of yuushuurruuu fluuuruuu jeanmaruuuues route in which he pulls some incredibly ballsy shit in the mcs defense which went a long way towards improving my opinion of him
  obviously in time with the characters thats the point of selfinserting
  i dont have autism
  theres a aoi route in aokana  iirc and thats the name of sensei i might  pick that game up again  dropped it after finishing the asuka route
  there isnt an aoi route its just a little scene after the credits
  now that sucks still might pick it up again to read the route of misaki sometime in the future
are the credits of odeon supposed to be completely silent
in the mood for some medieval fantasy vns gameplay or not doesnt matter as long as it has a semblance of story a list would be great from the last lets say 89 years or so thats not a pure moege or a pure nukige and is not made by august eushully alicesoft ninetail/dual tail astronauts akabei soft3 softhousechara lune baseson/just in case lets see ive read prism arc and aselia/seinarukana as well of course and pretty much everything thats rather known i also know about ritterorden due to shilling of a certain individual but i havent read it yet theres also 剣聖機 アルファライド  but jesus almost every review is just shitting on it ill still get around to reading it eventually    would be great if there are more obscure titles out there which i mightve missed
  update im stupid and played the whole vn without music i cant figure out why but while the bgm info is on the disk and i can rip it as a cd it doesnt play in the game at all
  obligatory picture
  not really obscure but have you tried duel savior the story is not too bad and it has a progression like the baldr games where the more routes you finish the more you learn about the story also if youve played aselia and seinarukana have you tried supitan ive been meaning to get into it but the new combat really doesnt look as fun as the other two
  you need inmmdll
  if you dont mind gameplay its much better to go with some tales of or even better western rpgs western rpgs love to recycle the medieval fantasy setting in 90 of the games or so it feels i dont particularly like them though but jp stuff loves diverse settings so its not that easy there valkyrie profile is quite nice there as well though both
  that fixed it thanks anon
  duel savior  thanks anon but i have yes also  supitan  fun combat  from where should i begin this is one of those titles where they clearly should not have included gameplay hence why they even released a patch that lets you skip combat  as for the cast i would say they are in no way inferior to aselia if you did like that so its definitely worth checking out      yeah i get what youre saying i have played most of the tales series and im no stranger to western rpgs just that im specifically looking for eroge now and jap take on medieval settings jap medival europe is what i like to call it and a good balance of ero gameplay story/worldbuilding/characters would be perfect
  first read 銀色 完全版 then read 朱  朱 is medieval fantasy    its older than you want but its stupid to limit yourself
  will check it out anon thanks guess i was too greedy limiting myself because of the modern sprites being pleasing to the eye
  well theres shamana shamana
these posts asking for recommendations but with a bunch of weird specific restrictions are extremely cringe grow up and step out of your comfort zone sometimes
  also look at 蒼色輪廻 and 奴隷市場　renaissance
  you should try having autism its fun
best cg the artist may suck at fronts but he can do backs at least    episode 2 was definitely better than 1 crazy girls really do make anything better that said still much of the same issues especially the writing its extremely wordy which is usually not an issue but absolutely kills the pace in any scene thats supposed to be exciting very loopy narration makes the entire battle royale stuff bad though its not the only thing    i think to truly enjoy secret game you kinda have to be very much in favor for a killing game where all you ever get is characters running away and trying to talk things out in the most hilariously terrible situations possible a gun is pointing at me im sure we can all talk this out like good people of course it never works who wouldve thought sure the bad writing is not going to get fixed nor the extremely disappointing execution of the killing game but perhaps the latter is less disappointing if you like the idea you obviously wont have very fun or strategic battles when all you get is talking in vain and running away episode 2 kinda justifies this a little and adds the polar opposite to balance things a little but thats essentially just episode 2  given how ive played killer queen once i unfortunately knew all the twists as well and cant say the first two episodes were really that interesting id assume 3 is the same so i skipped it and tried episode 4 but with the return of the annoyance from episode 1 and the addition of another major annoyance i quit pretty fast its just not for me
  eushullys new game and hello ladys new route even if i dont really agree with it but im curious
  amazing grace hype eushully gets added to the backlog still need to do their other stuff first
  eushully  hello lady maybe grace
  wow that hinoue itaru thing got destroyed you know you fucked up when even micchi calls you out
is having itaru as your artist even a selling point
  new route  whose route i only know about new h scenes in this version midori is already have route in fandisc
  guess the only girl in the game who doesnt have a route yet
  i dont think the green guy plays anything at all hes just low effort writing for blog views
  nigger read the website it clearly says it has a new route
  technically its not new its the vita route new for pc though
  boring
  amazing grace looks interesting but im not too optimistic
  backlog month for me
  episode 3 is skippable but 4 changes it up a lot and it plays out way differently  its a lot more entertaining in my opinion    i never read killer queen so not sure what happens in it and if its the same though
  just so you dont complain about me not telling you again you might want to check out love coordination in  as well  trial looks good
  guy in green  zen i honestly dont even know why he reviews eroge at all his reviews have become an utter joke over the past year but they were always kinda shit even when he praises an eroge he almost always have some bullshit to complain about such as muh female objectification or sexualization
introducing best girl first  thanks for making the decision easy i guess
  but hes right almost all the time most eroge are garbage
  usually not for the reasons he writes
  go back and see what he says about titles that have received high scores or received a lot of praise he pretty much hates all eroge i doubt he even reads trials unlike the other reviewer
  her voice is instantly recognizable raiha maya the list is seemingly endless
  now this is autism
  theres lots of obscure things but theyre obscure for a reason    you could probably wring some enjoyment from debonosu/studio egos better games but dont expect too much or better yet go in with the attitude that theyre going to be ridiculous and terrible the more recent dragon loli ones are more moegeish but the older ones eg eternal kingdom are more trashy fantasy epic    shoujo to maou to tactics is also a very low end mediocre isekai that has a few moments     tentacle lord if you want a tentacle rape action fantasy thing but again kind of terrible     theres also one of my favorite ops of all time in leafs attempt to do final fantasy but the only thing it managed to replicate from ff was an incomprehensible utterly nonsensical plot its almost worth playing just to see how retarded it gets were talking a doomsday clock with a backup safety doomsday clock that controls the world and can only be killed by the reincarnated time looped incest twins of the protagonist assisted by his parallel universe female self who he also fucks and oh god i havent even mentioned his parents who tricked the doomsday clocks into thinking it had possessed them by being possessed in some timelines and not in others and fuck my head hurts awesome op though  
  sounds like a fun time  picked up next time i get some consecutive days off eg never ever
  nice
  no my friend its called the truth
  oh god its gorgeous i love favorite
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  who cares eop
when will kishige come back
  its translated kusoge now
  it was always kusoge though
  blaze of destiny iiii  heaven strada  maou to odore 12  shihen 69/ii  icon by bellybell warning has ntr  kaze to daichi no pageant    unfortunately all of them have gameplay that didnt age well
is nagomibako worth playing for cartagra extra content
  also damn this true route sure is something
does anyone have a mega for snow standard edition
new purple software game  cant wait for more makoto and maia clones  
  you mean moekishige
    its hard to find so i uploaded it the presentation is quite nice for an older game i hope you enjoy it a bit of a warning though the main heroine is a turbo autist
  main heroine is a turbo autist  even better
  thanks breh i might play it in the next decade
will 3rdeye deliver again    
  did they ever
  sorcery jokers
  nice tits
  is this version fully voiced
  yes
tone works hurry up and fucking announce the 4th project already and quit teasing us reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  i hope they go bankrupt and dont
somewhere in her lineage is a giraffe
  does anyone know how amakano ss is compared to the first one
  december 5th
  im glad its over
  about the same it all depends on the heroines and they were all really cute except honami fuck her
  could be worse
  i miss the times when i wasnt bothered by shitty art at all i wonder how many good games i missed because i lost that ability
  im mostly interested in the wheelchair girl and the younger sister of sayuki
  try playing something with abstract/surreal art like some railsoft stuff it might help you transition back
cute clothes though i have to say the character designs for the heroines are overall worse than their previous two main titles they got a lot more childish and generic looking
  these are the kid versions
  glow in the dark fuckers
so will sakura moyu be good or just a trainwreck with pretty pictures
  being grown wont exactly make you more distinct looking when there are so many 1820 heroines around  that said those arent their final forms
    they have the exact same faces as their grown forms the only thing that changes is slight breast growth and the hair styles  see for yourself  
    middle one gets some big tats
  thats a very rare just right one that doesnt crank everything to the max
  if it isnt good i will read all of favorites games and review them
  main girl looks great
anyone know if you can you change routes midway or do you have to pick the same girl in every choice to reach 100
  will you be able to fuck this peak qt
  except honami fuck her  fuck you
  i hope so but probably not
  kanade is super cute from the get go imouto gets better once you enter the route and she starts talking more
  my wife will obviously have a route right
    they need h scenes
what did she mean by this  
  astral air didnt do it either not even in the fd honestly that fd was so disappointing no not because the loli didnt have lewds that was fine but they couldve given best girl a route instead of whatever the hell it was they did to her itd have been awesome and if itd been just 4 hours of her chasing skirts i dont care then again characters like this one never have good routes if they have one seems to be a rule
  bets girl yuki did get a route though
i hope this majin cutie have h scenes best girl
  she clearly needs anal sex
  the tokuten from toranoana is an h tapestry of her if thats any indicator of the game contents
10 years since kamige i walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but my path always leads to /jp/ i stare at the screen for hours and try to summon the kamige i watch oelvn streams but it is no good i flame eops in /vg/ and try to resist the boredom but it is all meaningless the end is near i then usually watch some old ops and cry myself to sleep
  is the fd worth playing i havent felt like touching it ever since emitsun dropped out of it
  maybe getting banned would help you      emitsun  that slut
  i watch oelvn streams but it is no good i flame eops in /vg/  what a faggot just play and enjoy vns
    i knew i saw something similar before im still a fan though   if only those black markings were actual tattoos or magical runes or something instead of clothing
  in another few years youll realize how all of these kamige were not that great in the first place and youve been a moron all this time
does anyone know where i can get a crack for erewhon alpharom hacker isnt working it just keeps asking for a dmm account
  
  thank you anon
  why do you geniuses keep on trying to apply the alpharom tool to everything even though the game clearly uses a different protection
  i do like how sayukis  changes after a certain date ingame for a while i was starting to wonder why she was remaining at 20 despite having such a huge focus on helping her in the common route and even calling the mc shit like anatasama
  i think sayuki is supposed to be the main heroine which is why shes given so much focus early on
  iirc you have some time after getting the girls affection to 100 and if you keep stalling they will eventually confess rather than you initiating that
whats with japan and their obsession with aquaria
anyone play 最悪なる災厄人間に捧ぐ i was thinking of getting it on switch but wasnt sure if it was worth the 3000yen price sorry for the double post
  sorry for the double post  nigger this is 4channel not some random forum with dumb antidouble posting rules
  isnt erewhon one of those games with the meme protection where you just have to edit the file with a hex editor
  the 2dgf torrent works right out of the box
  is it just me or did this artists style get worse between makinglovers and sugarstyle
  looks a little more generic to me
  i like sugarstyle designs more
  i really like blonde girls look and the brunette looks like akari from ml white and pink dont interest me much but since both of them are voiced by huge seiyuu newbies maybe theyll be really good
  aquariums are pretty
is he right
  wrong picture
    top 10 anime cliches
big boobs  good
  pretty much same thing when a character who rarely if ever opens their eyes opens them
  however flat  justice
  that theyre both psycho and that is a very good thing
how similar is himegari imperial meister to the other eushully meister games i heard it was a web/browser game so i was wondering can you play it with a vpn
tomorrow is the day brehs ready to wait for uploads again
  you dont need a vpn if youre playing the r18 version but your local time needs to be set for gmt9 or the game would error    the gameplay is somewhat similar to madou koukaku rts battle system
  for what
  do i have to get it on mobile somehow im getting this even with the right time zone setting
  try this link  
  thanks i got the same error though
why the shit didnt you play the ソーサレスアライヴ trials
  that looks lame and gay
  stop these garbage ass shitposts and play the games yourself if you want to so desperately
  2edgy4me
  more like waiting for crack
  i trust the chinks atropos watchs dmm garbage drm got cracked on release day
eushully game released panbaiducom/s/1d5neahxzkktngwnrh7kf3g  pw hz2t
  i will be waiting for the girlcelly reupload thank you
  i tried downloading and it wants me to install some retarded totallynotmalware fucking chinkshit website
  does it include the tokuten
are visual novels too long it takes around 4060 hours to read one which is way too long they should be around 10 hours
  4060   not really those are the exceptions vast majority are 1520 hours and only if you do all routes if you do single route completion a lot of games go down to 510 hours
  ill be waiting for the inevitable nyaa upload
  this might shock you  but visual novels come in varying lengths
  yasss they are bloated on purpose to justify selling them for 10k yen
  that was quick if youre not in a huge hurry to play it you might as well wait another 34 months for some dlc especially if youre a fan of amayui
  i feel like whether or not that length classifies as too long depends a lot on the vn itself  if the text is bloated with purple prose repetitive descriptions of everyday activities and generally redundant exchanges with the characters then yes its too long  but if im actually enjoying the content im not going to feel like those 40 hours are too long rather id be left wanting if it was all over in 10    and every additional hour the vn goes on is an additional hour i can spend with my raison detre lunasama
  the other 3 zoomed by but now im bottlenecked by this one why is this allowed  still faster than usual baidu downloads though at least
  first time using baidu djt pal
  do you only play 50 hour vns or something
  i dont really care about the added story too much since when it comes to eushully very rarely do characters from different games interact with each other in any meaningful way though i guess you had an ikusa megami characters in madou towards the end like the miko but other than that theyre mostly joke/silly scenarios    other than that yea new costumes for the heroines skills maps undress mode higher level limit etc still not worth waiting 34 months though
anyone know where i can find できない私がくり返す all torrents are dead on the usual sites and perfect dark only downloads one part
  russia
  cheers anon  no hard mode  darn i thought the trial was a bit too easy but looks like theres no other choice
  you dont want to play eushully hard mode
  is this amayui 2
  im a masochist anon i play touhou for fun
  completely different kind of difficulty
havent played a eushully game since kamidori anything i should watch out for with this one or is it simple enough to get everything i need from the start    mostly im worried about missing optional characters since  is like 99 the reason im playing this
    
  shes the first major antagonist i would be astonished if she was missable in any way
  aight cool thats really all im worried about
売却20k  stuff like this breaks my immersion on a first playthrough you walk around catch a few rats pick up one of those stones happen to meet this merchant and youre instantly freed from your life of slavery   but the storys not the main focus of these games i suppose also im probably not going to sell this until i know i can find another looks useful depending on what i need to charge it
  i remember aroduc saying that from the trial the economy of the game looked really fucked up i dont know whether i should hope you just got really lucky or if theres just massive money powercreep in the game
please spoonfeed this is my first time trying untranslated games i got several things from mikocon and i dont see anything about playdrm or a crack in any comments but when i installed it it asks for a license key what am i missing
  what am i missing  a license key
good thing no fap november is almost over
is there a crack for grasesta
  no its the first game ever that wont have any crack
  killed some level 30 boss with a level 13ish crew and now im swimming in cash i think im going to lean towards fucked up but im still early i guess the difference between knowing how to use your units versus just winging it is night and day protip hire the fatass
        reupload to mega pls
  no thanks besides you need a crack anyway unless you have the chink general tool by the time the crack comes out therell be a nyaa link out for sure
    the difference between knowing how to use your units versus just winging it is night and day  while i just finished the prologue and am about to recruit more members even with the first boss you cant really just attack him straight on without destroying his parts first which locks him out from using special abilities i really like that  also im digging the story stuff like picking up rats and using them as potions for you first expedition the gameplay and story really correlate well
girlcelly and co are slacking off
  seriously though this shit better be up when i wake up tomorrow
  any minute now
i hope they show the reactions of the classmates/other girls to the official engagement but it feels like the h is gonna start soon
what is this magical magical chink drm breaking tool and how do i acquire it
  they have it on some forum you have to suck their cocks for it
  id rather suck anons here who have it
  noone wants to leak it cause if its easily available dmm might change how playdrm works
new anim game still not uploaded  this is killing me
  yeah its late this month i guess
  any other advice i still dont really get how it works and usually run out of hp after a few battles sometimes my skills dont hit unless i kill the ones in front first and stuff
jeez eushully game is a bit too brutal beat the chapter 1 boss but saveload with crit
    sometimes it can take a while for them to crack anim games but im enjoying it so far
grasesta up by velka gc sure soon to follow
i didnt know there was a fd for saimin app this month now this is good news
  sure   sometimes my skills dont hit unless i kill the ones in front first and stuff  melee attacks can only hit the row closest to you   run out of hp after a few battles  buy back the 治癒の封瓶 and always 封緘 your healing potions into it so its not taken away by the guild every time once you can immediately hire the elf and level her 森守人 skill to 2 and equip 地精の恵み in her actions bar which is a very strong heal for earlygame for normal battles try to spread your units out so that row/column aoe attacks dont hit too many at once for big bosses with full screen aoe though youll want to group your units up around the fatass and survive until you can use defend on him which prevents a shitload of aoe damage with his かばう and 防御の極み skills its also worth removing a few units from your 編成 so you dont take as much aoe damage on bosses  hiring them but not including them in your setup still boosts your total hp carrying amount and they still get xp for battles which is pretty cool
  thanks for the info anon ill write that down didnt know you could seal your stuff so that it doesnt get taken from you after dungeons i noticed the elf had a really good aoe and heal when playing the trial but i didnt hire the fat dude ill grab him too and see what he can do didnt know you could cheat the aoe system like that either good to know
should i play the pc version of baldr force exe or emulate the ps2 one
  you could always get the se version for pc
  are there any major differences other than the voice acting
  looks boring as fuck wheres my near future/fantasy themed pulltop
is zero infinity good
pretty sure thats not safe
  learn japanese
  not really
started akeiro kaikitan and have a single question  nanarin had one real route i played it first and after doing other routes found that indeed doing any of them before kotori would stink hard and spoil the kotori route    is ak the same way
  i looked at other people play it on youtube looked cute might check it out
grasesta  whelp time to go to bed and hope its up when i wake up
  no theyre all worthwhile and required to get the true end
i hope ensemble goes bankrupt
  are you guys hyped
i hope ryukishi07 goes banrkupt
  frankly put no     im still considering whether or not should i read higurashi should i
  sure get any of the enhanced versions if possible
by chance do any of you have steel by graviton  050211グラビトン steel スティール     it seems really obscure
its up lads
if the grasesta torrent doenst come out by today im going to end it
  its up lad mikocon won again
  wtf i love our chinese overlords
  cool but we need a crack    also superior entelecheia
  just use the chinese crack
  it doesnt need one
  im not a cocksucker like you      18禁ゲーム 181130 エウシュリー 封緘のグラセスタ パッケージ版 playdrm mdfmdsjpgrr3rar  playdrm
  the bottlenecking isnt nearly as bad today thank god
  dont call me a cocksucker dude
  but you sucked chinese cocks for their crack tool
    we dont take kindly to your types around here
  bbut the crack
  suck chinese cocks dude
  who do you think is making the cracks if not china at the end of the day youll be sucking their cocks whether you want to or not
  not actively buddy
  sure instead of being resourceful enough to dig a general tool out of them you have to wait until they throw you scraps every single time something comes with playdrm you sure showed us
  is this one cracked can someone post game exe
  it is not cracked wait a week or two
  dont worry itll be up for tomorrow
  ab
  there is an independent person posting cracks on animesharing tool is private for 2dkf people and mikocon/2djgame never share cracks until someone else does it so the chinks actually dont do shit for the general public
anim title up prob not cracked tho
  thank you anon
  upload the exe and all of the dat files somewhere for me and any of the gay crack dlls
  sorry dude my internet sucks balls im still dling the new eushully
elizasrain  melodieana    whatever eushully
i liked mizuki at first but all the forced sayuki stuff in the common route made me like her more i can see why some people would prefer her over the demure perfect housewife sometimes i wish sayuki would learn to banter
  wot is dis looks terrible compared to the old design
  this bitch is horrible art
  she just looks like a generic moeblob now compared to the old s design she had    are they both in the new game i know theres an angel heroine
  yeah i dont know what the fuck happened old eliza was an imperious bitch and thats why i loved her i havent actually played it yet just mucking around in the files but this one looks thoroughly defanged    
  the gold edition disk append1 that has the hetare dungeon and shit has a angel cameos from past games as recruitable party members looks like only two cgs the bath one above and this one which is just all their stand sprites put together
  old eliza was an imperious bitch and thats why i loved her  same here seeing this new moeblob design is kinda sad even if her personality is the same it just looks off
  you cant fuck them lame
someone post pictures of the combat in grasesta
  what its just the ikusa megami engine
  dozo
    have you figured out the ending paths yet
  i got to the bad end at the end of chapter 3 thats about it theres only been two major decisions so far that might lead to different outcomes so hell if i know  also theres only 1 ed movie it seems so maybe theres only one route
  can you upload the system4ini file the drm creates ill love you forever it would make extracting from the main game files a lot less annoying
  i dont see it in my game folder sorry
  huh i wonder if they changed format or have encrypted it then the trial used the old eushully format as do the append files
  maybe its because im using the chink general tool i never interacted with the drm at all
  actually i wonder if i could use the trials system4 need to redownload it from slow as fuck japan mirrors though irritating
  its possible im unfamiliar with how the chinese crack works eushully games going back as far as i know have had a systemini file that contains various metadata file information for the agf packages which both the eushully extraction tools i have take as input for extracting from the alf files i wouldnt be surprised in the slightest if the cracks to date have just been to extract out the system4 file from the drm while getting around the drm in a more general matter could just spoof what its looking for    the appends are handled a little differently each is paired ie append01aai is for all intents and purposes the system file but specifically for append01agf
  minor correction agf is the image format inside the alf files alf is the packaging format
oh its actually sys4inibin    got it confused with alicesofts format same difference really
    and the trial version doesnt work as i expected the correct metadatas needed to extract and name accurately
  where is this chink general tool and whose cock do i have to suck for it
  you just have to play a browser game for about 3 minutes a day for 2 months or so
  but i want to play it now
  the crack is going to be out within 12 hours cant wait that much
  im fine with that ill probably cry myself to sleep if the crack only gets released on monday and i wont have time to properly play it until the next weekend
if the patch doesnt come out by the end of today im ending it
  is that chink general tool a launcher or a generic cracker   if its a cracker cant you just upload the cracked exe
  and risk getting blacklisted no thanks
  with the way its set up i cant share it without sharing the tool itself its just an extra day of waiting you can handle it
  so similar to alpharomdie then
  how is it possible for them to even find out and pinpoint blacklist you do the cracked files come with a serial id that traces back to the tool owner or something
  i would assume its a spoofer for playdrm not technically a crack
where is amazing grace i need my moe fill
  something like that yeah you drag the exe in it spits out another exe you copy it with the tool itself to the game folder and it runs it for you cracks playdrm dmm softdenchi and some form of derivative of it and whatever palette uses for their games     im pretty sure there isnt any way for them to track you i just want to avoid pissing off the creator by leaking it and making it so that he gates updates to the thing behind an even higher wall i can only play so much of that text based browser game man
this thread is going to be hell for a bit isnt it
is grasestas drm/file setup the same as amayuis i skipped it because i didnt like the trial genuinely curious if its crack kept the sys4ini hidden
the new softhouse chara game doesnt have drm right  i think ill just download and play that while waiting for grasestas crack
actually i just realized i didnt play the trial because i usually dont play trials can you succeed save data from trials i could probably just kill time playing the trial and then transfer save when the crack comes out
  haha no
  i want to die
oh hi there    you could probably go through it just to get a feel of the combat you can also skip the parts you already read later
grasesta looks like one of those games that is difficult to play for those still learning japanese does anyone know if someone might make a translation patch just for the battle menu/battle terms    i remember that has happened with some of eukleias games in the past
  yeah i usually need ui shit for eushully games even when i can follow the dialogue just to make my life easier    i imagine someone will make a ui patch since most eushully games have them but i dont know how long it would take
  to answer my own question by finding my external hdd with things archived away amayui did indeed use playdrm in the same general format with the crack being just a package of three files an edited exe plus the standard arcgames the eushully engine dll and sys4ini files pulled out of the playdrm encryption so assuming they provide/create the crack in the same way all should be good to work with the existing eushully hacking tools
wake up and patch still not out
  sayuki is the model japanese housewife      she also has anal
  sayuki is too perfect to be real
  also her dad thinks some strange things but hes right
its up
  nah
new hadashi shoujo game is made for me  bless kazane and her voice
  why you lie
  
wheres superior entelecheia
  female domination is the main theme  well that sucks everything else looks great
erotic games
are
  femdom sucks  heh
i guess crack is most definitely not up yet for eushully gracesta barring the chinese upload that has some sort of drm fooler/bypasser
  light femdom is fine when it gets to chasity belt level ill pass
  there are like 100 posts here saying this yeah
yo crack me up d
  i suppose its better to just wait for the crack instead then because when i tried to download from baidu i dont think its allowing me to download and i forgot my baidu yun account
    the baidu upload doesnt come with a crack either thats a separate thing
  i hate that i have to drift into femdom territory and brave the soundings and the chastity belts just to find girls that enjoy and actively pursue sex outside of ntr or other unpleasant fetish bullshit
  sexy bondage elf  god damnit i want to play it for that but i know ill just hate the overall product because overly long boring eushully shit
do yall read the good or bad endings first or perhaps only read the good endings
if its not a spoiler how old is the shugaten mc supposed to be the way he talks makes him sound kind of old
  honestly i wish they had a nogameplay patch that just turns it into a standard eroge
  i only read bad endings
  i just try to go with whatever ending i happen to get first i look up the other endings later if i need to
    most of the game is pretty light  maybe 2/3rds of the scenes are basically vanilla with the rest being the usual harder femdom stuff which i cant stand either
  i cant remember the last time i played a game with honest to god bad ends that werent just a poor excuse for heroine rape scenes etc
  i dont read games that have bad endings
im tired of waiting bros
i just wanna play videogames _
anyone have any suggestions for perhaps lesser known good netorare/corruption games
  anons life
  i doubt youd be able to read much of the dialogue without parsing as well if you cant understand the simple battle menu while i know there will bunch of eops who will pick this up just for gameplay as far as ive seen from the trial the main catch for grasesta are the combination of gameplay and the story/character interactions since this is not a meister title and is way more rpgish
i guess we are all warmly waiting for the crack    though how did the other people here play already did they actually buy it
  the sekret chink patch
btw aokana perfect edition is up at as
  does it need a crack
  no
  not interested then
  whats different from the og version
  蒼の彼方のフォーリズムオリジナルのpc版にcs版追加シーンをプラスした最終バージョンです  ディスクレスプレイにも対応しています
  console scenes ported in
  i think well need to wait several days  normal uploader who usually buy might skip it because of it being a remaster
  tailon he did eventually do wa2 extended for example    hopefully someone will put it up even if its someone on baidu
  bump for this question
holy shit the economy system in the new eushully game is so retardedly bad because of one oversight the game wants you to manage resource/money but starting from chapter 3 you can earn shit ton of money unlimitedly using auto combat mode making the entire thing a fucking joke the exploit is also so easy to notice most people who actually pay a bit of attention probably dont even need to go online to find it  fight in solo arena using auto combat until you ran out of money and use all the bronze coin to buy talisman and sell them
its up    for real crack posted
  might be a virus  ill wait for people to try it first
  surely our guy always_smile wouldnt have malicious intentions
    tested it on virustotal it seems fine and works i just had to change some d3d settings
  where though
  as
  nice try always_smile
its virus
  59 engines btfo
  oh no no no no
also it seems 2djgame have their own crack but you need to register on the forums to see it and the registrations are closed now
1 billion vns on my backlog  still downloading new ones  yet i dont know what to read  i wish i wasnt retarded
  why do you do it
  who are you quoting
  now this is a blast from the past
  me
  the arena also lets you upgrade the skill use recovery item to max really easily so now you can heal up pop one skill restore and your whole party is fully refreshed and sleeping is now only used to trigger events the arena is just broken all around
    i think i will just ignore the arena if thats the case sounds really boring and broken
is aokana worth playing
from what i understand with vnr on gracesta started off plot sure developed interestingly at least in the sense of how you and your commander carried off a successful sabotage mission but the noble in charge is a spineless bastard classic soldiers tale i guess
  from what i understand with vnr    disgusting
  retard
  of course its one of the best games in the last few years
  for reals
  no sensei route  you tell me
  i hope you die in a car crash
  lack of sensei routes in eroge as a whole recently i feel
  epic
  recently  always with occasional exceptions
  absolutely doesnt come close to yuzusoft though
    also lack of anal sex scenes
        did i do something wrong
  you posted shitty bait
  waiting for the day anal h scenes become standard instead of just a 1 off given to a   single designated anal h heroine
2djg crack linked on nyaa
  one of the writers is one of the most highly regarded still in the industry watanabe he wrote the infamous harukuru among other great games and misaki route is arguably his best work
  theres some good gear from the arena that you should at least buy though the skill refresh thing also works without upgrading the efficacy its just even more broken if you do
for the japanese literate people how are you enjoying gracesta so far
  im glad they arent anal sucks
  faggot
  was this any good and that name sounds more like a company name than a game title does it have any significance
  why would you trust 2djs chink crack their shit triggers more malware scanners than 
  god gave you a hole designed just for fucking but you still want the poo chute like the raging homosexual you are
  chances are you used their cracks for various other games already
  thwarting gods plan is the appeal
  same applies to that other guys cracks you know
  title has no significance    i enjoyed it not as good as wagamama but i liked the protag more and the common route is really short which i like so you get into the routes quicker heroines are all enjoyable in their own way as well pretty decent moege
  bbut nyaa
im in
  update to 101 and install the append
  in other words faggotry is the appeal got it
  you don have 101
    im not in
  jesus you eops  
  thanks based eoposter
  now scram
is anyone else having problems with 緋奈沢智花の絶対女王政 im getting a this game is japan only error     no one said anything abt it yet so wondering if this game needs a crack
  thats a common thing most people already know how to bypass
  pic related is the error      really senpai do you know how can i solve this problem
  i know how but im not going to tell you because it can easily be solved by google
      or maybe alpharomdie
where the hell is amazing grace
play through gracesta  already two girls act predatory towards the mc    oh dear
  still 720p i bet they are going to wait until the english version comes out in fhd and then rerelease the game again
  thank you so much senpai you are a good human being have a nice day
  who cares wheres hello lady se
in the eushully game i find out that yes you can work your female teammates into prostitution    i am now reminded of madou koukaku now
  turns out that in grasesta you can make your female teammates prostitute themselves reminds me of madou koukaku
  do they have actual prostitution hscenes
  is it uh profitable doesnt sound like you have money problems    im gonna guess the players who do it arent doing it for the mechanical benefits though
  do you have to do it i want to keep the elf girl for myself
  well i am sure it was never about the money      i dont know but there were scenes in madou koukaku so i assume there is
  yes theres inevitable ntr for every heroine whether you like it or not
  im going to do this for the heroines i dont give a shit about
new thread    
  of course not its up to you the one running the prostitution house just says that if you ever have girls you want to sell to her house which is much safer and likely much more profitable than adventuring she adds shes open
  nice im going to sell all the girls

thread for the cute celestial
showing her true nature
on date with shy tenshi
stupid santa
awesome tenshi
cute and lewd
looks like i caught her          now shes mad and i cant post more cute pics but you can behind her back
my twitter is constantly bombarded with neropasos tweets about his tentacle tenshi daki for c95    not that i mind
  ew
  cant wait for tenshoku 3
what would she do if i stole a peach from her hat
  get all flustered and mad youve basically proposed to her
im eating corn dogs right now will that please the cute celestial
help im in love with this celestial
  so am i
  thats a cute butt
eating peaches on her hat
tenshi is cooler than you
  yes of course
  nobody says the opposite
  idk about you but she gave me her peach
  she become a woman
why is she so best is it her design the personality ive loved her ever since her debut in swr
  zun unexpectedly produced a competent character design
hah the stupid loli
  tenshi is very smart
  tenshi is not a loli
  mm they sure are tasty
  prove it    prove it
  damn she has legs for days
  i buy box of corndogs from store and they dont look half as tasty as tenchis corndogs      should i be putting them in the oven instead of microwaving it
  either way works as long as youre doing it for tenshi
  you should make your own at home
removable peaches
  only celestial beings can cook homemade corndogs
  i miss battas touhous
tenko  tenko  tenko  and tenko was her nameo
tenshi being assaulted by a smaller tenshi
  her name is chiko
what she listening to
  psytrance
  thick frequencies  powerful brap tones
  easy on the junk food tenshi
  tenshi is a respected food critic
  tenshis royal guard
  disappointed in myself for getting aroused at this      luxury of the spirit is not found in kindness or openheartedness its found in abandoning desire and being content with your circumstances  very wise tenshi /lit/ will be pleased to know that schopenhauer was right all along
denkoswan
is reisen cute or beautiful
sexy but in a cute way
reisen udonge inaba sucks  reisen however
too old to be cute too young to be beautiful
  dont be rude to her
  yes
i want reisen to stare into my eyes
is cuter
  more cute
  no
reisen is cute sexy and beautiful
  cute or beautiful  its same thing
  cute  reisenchan is cute    you can be beautiful but ugly  you can be cute but not beautiful and there would still be appeal to her
  okay what does ran smell like
  see this 
  other way around dude
  beautycute
sexy sexy
  is not you uncultured swine
this is now a reisen thread
sex with reisen udongein inaba
  good idea  me shooting at the incoming udonge posters
  human beauty concept based on cuteness probably due to own pedomorphic neoteny  origin many of human sexual practices just slightly modificated parenthood practices for example kiss is modificated techie of feeding
is it ok to fall in love with reisen
  yeah love is just another form of madness
  whats she doing
    god i wish i was in the middle of them
  reisen not ok   reisen udongein inaba ok
  you dont wanna make her angry she has all the same moon rabbit powers you know  like shooting lasers at the moon
pic related proves she is cute beautiful and sexy
  not into shota rabbit sorry
  reisen can give birth to many children with those hips
  rabbits in lingerie is awright
  more cute honestly in fact i tend to think of her as plain/nerdy/dorky she dresses so straightlaced and boring most of the time and the only particularly feminine thing about her ignoring the skirt thats part of a uniform is her long hair that she just lets out or hides when in certain outfits    you can call her pretty or beautiful but thats not what i think of her as at all considering her choices and personality for the most part but seriously a girl who dresses an awful lot like a man shouldnt be called beautiful
  
  thats my feeling too pretty much the only reason shes seen as beautiful was when people started increasing her sexuality as part of the newbie bait joke or because they couldnt fap to her asis which gained abother level of newbie bait when hisui a fat woman with the cutsiest voice on the planet because the va for udonge     so now many peoples first exposure to reisen is this dream bombshell sefure bunny when in all of her official depictions shes extremly plain
    plain or not  ill still love reisen udongein inaba  newbie bait or not
  hisui  dude dont just start talking about homo shit on a touhou thread   is she actually fat though
    you cannot look at that hair and not think shes beautiful and theres something to be said about plain appeal
  same    dont worry hisui as a person is as far from homoshit as possible and yes she is quite rotund    yeah her hair is simple but absolutely gorgeous maybe being a rabbit or lunarian makes having such long hair easier to take care of because id imagine in gensokyo theyre missing a lot of hair care stuff we take for granted today
  heart pupils means theyre in heat
  だめ
  i think shes both but the real question is what does reisen herself think
  an useless bunny only good for her sex appeal
why does she want reisen
  because why not
  if reisen were real id want her too to be honest
  
  id definitely hug her from behind
i find reisen cute
  cutiful
    nicetack is great
its my birthday /jp/  please post my cute drunk loli wife
  go away drunkard
  happy birthday op have an alcoholic day

  i would like her butt to be placed on my face for an extended period of time
so cute post more sakes
  secret oni torture methods
  i wanna cover her chocolate parts with my cream
why is it called broken moon
  suika was supposed to break the moon in iamp instead they settled on her breaking the ui she breaks the moon later in canon
  i wanna get shitfaced with this cute oni
  what is this bullying
oni naizuri

  u wot m8
  suika is happy shes never down and always tries her best to have a smile
  cause she has the body of a sexy little girl duh
  oni butt on my face
youre wife is my naizuri slave dude
  literal perfection
hey this thread is pretty good
  suika drinking herself in juice form how hot
  can you imagine how gross sake made with watermelon bits would be
cumming in suikas sake watching her drink it
  slut  delete this
  i would cum inside suika and happily drink it up from her
  what anon cant handle the truth
anyone who posts nsfw of a loli will be executed by a firing squad
gao
  you have to go back
i want to drink suikas cunny juice until i get drunk
  who doesnt
  i dont
        haha i just came by to say im not really attracted to this
  attracted to what females
  the you must clearly be a woman
  gay really gay
  cunny is not family friendly remove this post
  how can cunny not be family friendly if its what you use to make a family
  vagina / cunny
  you need to illustrate your point further
  are you implying that one cannot make a loli pregnant
happy little happy little happy little boozer
  i can get off using any part of suikas body so that is perfectly fine
  fuck yuugi
  how tight is this onis butt
  very tight
  just fucking headbutt her
  because she just honestly wants to have a good time with everyone and thats something i can get behind and shes cute
  this wasnt the kind of answer i was expecting but for some reason i can see the appeal of it
ive never tried sake is it good    do japs and their characters really like it that much or is it just a thing of muh honor muh tradition muh japanese drink
  its good warm but not that good cold
  i find this picture very appealing and lewd for some reason
  fug her from behind
    high tension japanese goblin
  its nothing out of this world
  stag beetle
i love this drunk girl
  getting pinched by suikas horns
  barging into your adult daughters room and introducing her to your boss who is over for dinner while your wife folds your daughters clothes in the background
  dang those horns are so sexual

  momoruns flat chest
i hate the girls take fortune telling seriousy
  most of them do it for the variety
  yes she should lose weight
  i wonder if i would still be into idols  i mainly use idols as a means to distract myself from my failure of a life  so i doubt that i would be here were i not a virgin
  they should all show midriff like uuka
  you would none of us here can look at white girls the same way anymore
since you azusabros arent afraid of thots i recommend following my korean lookalike 소풍왔니 after shes gone
  forgot to mention that im azusa btw
  more like nanahot
  isnt that ayumi
  idols bluepilled me on 3d girls so its the other way around for me i still hate white girls tho but for different reasons

  uemura azusa no konnatokoroninattanda
  hkt odekake or hkt hyakkaten
  this is the only correct answer
  anything with megu in it so recent nemousu or konya wa otomari/shikiritai
  hakuchuumu
erii likes a ton of yuzupos posts it makes me hopeful for a couple rares
  honestly looking for something new tired of the shows with the old gens

  美しい優しい先輩   thats our tom

  thanks for copying and pasting information that is available in the op hard and important work
why do you keep saying she was fired she quit to make fat stacks on youtube/twitch
  definitely watch this 
  no thanks im not that gay
  wrong thread
  theres nothing there
  so just become a nambafag and shut up
じゅなっこの水着が見たいです
so what is azusa going to do now av
  and she cant do that after graduating normally without the backlash shes getting now obviously something happened
  she doesnt want to waste anymore time in a dying group obviously
  you bet
  cameron i want a rise  no you are not getting one  then i quit  no you cant  i just did
  fucking finally been waiting since her debut
  nmb48 ashita sekai ga owaru nara nani o shiyou ka  i understand this reference
  said no one ever
  its a jo reference everything is a jo reference
  its a sayanee reference
i love mirus voice
can we still post azusa
no
  we call her azsa now
i was just starting to grow so fond of her too
  bad luck choose better next time
its amazing how such an unpopular member has so many fans here ive seen at least 20 here today
  im waiting for brown mion
  its even weirder because people hardly even talked about her until a few months ago
  show us some of your designs
  based revisionistkun is at it again
  contrarian is 4chans specialty
  she was trashy cute and funny  all that appeals to akbg
  besides the guy who called her trash and bad vibes every time she showed up in a group photo i mean she wasnt spoken of positively until recently
  what do you want to see
  juna
  few nambas are but the nmb spammer has been off his meds since fuuko and sayanee graduated
  nah theres always been lots of nmb posting here azusa just wasnt really a big feature of it
  too short
  ive been posting positively about her for like three years maybe you just didnt pay attention
  that is not true at all shes been posted about positively at least since those ramen webms on yattandei  and then all the time about her ears after she showed them on you gotta which was last year that webm was reposted a million times
tsumugin feels like ngts yunana to me
whos the best yuzu
    dont mind him he always does that when an idol popular in akbg graduates its probably his way of coping
  terrible dress
  maybe you just didnt pay attention  probably i do think its gotten more intense recently
  not really
nmb fires a cutie for bite/get bitten by another member      gayest management ever
  i do think its gotten more intense recently  well i agree with that
  that one ske yuzu isnt so bad either though
  probably someone got jelly
  no one lives forever
what is not to miss about this
funny how we were talking about fato being on graduation watch and then this news drops
  i think shes gonna try and get on the next korean idol show
its okay we still have a postpostyamada
  talking about fato  after her disappointing gravure
and the weak baiting resumes
  yuzu
oh nononononono
    this is going to help me grieve
  disgusting  i hope they dont let her back into japan
  nude yes
  stupid sexy temptress
  this is most likely something i dont want to open
  happy bday ana i love you so much
  which performance is this from
  its not her fault it just keeps happening
  nanahos forehead is too much for me
  how many bfs does this bitch have
  most easily recognized backside
  more like whokawa rio
has miru ever done anything with a photographer
  seitan i think i forgot
      cutest loli pair
  this guy looks legit gay from a mile away but she has a thing with the brown one for sure
did aoki ever meet the milky imposter
  not yet but he probably saw her girlspedia gravure so its just a matter of time
  shes in mexico so probably at least 12
im glad that haruppi is alive
  we have no proof of this
  miku posted her voice in a video on twitter
  she looks nothing like milky
  yukiyuki tummy
  i like this slut
  shes not a slut shes a good hard working and moderately busu girl
  nah shes a hot and sexy slut
  delicious/10
  thats a long ass neck
  tsumugi can take my energies whenever she wants ºº
do you think aks is planning ssk to be a world ssk every year now
  they will add pd48 and saka
  shut the fuck up about that idiot youre both unbearable just fuck already and get it over with
  whenever you reply he will always reply to himself with haha kek this nerve  hes been at it for a year just report off topic and move on
  hopefully no but iirc they confirmed in that emergency meeting tv special that from now on it will be 100 ranked members so maybe they will keep the world thing to justify the number alas bnk is having its own ssk now and jkt will never apply to akbs because muslims so theyll probably drop it since it wouldnt bring that many more votes
oochan dancing is cute looks like she concentrates hard
  you can just see how unhinged she is from looking at her left eye
  theyll probably do one in 2019 if only to see how well team sh and mnl can sell
  beauty
  disappointment
  sasuga jurina is quick to try to steal aachans role as team ss 1 molester
  i understand everything now
  she was a likable cuter rika after all
  sasuga no wonder shes our queen
  best queen after all
  this loli belongs in chatmonchy
  honestly anon if youre looking for a good show with current girls this is your best option
  aaawww    jurinas warm heart is the cutest 
did she spark kokoro out
eito show sponsored by cocacola  no other team can ever compete
  selfishly graduate  fuck whoever wrote that letter
stupid sexy shion
  probably masana
  a true heroine  best queen since golden age akbgroup
  i bet it was management who wrote that
  she might just be fed with sorting her laundry into darks/coloured/whites
  this triggers the fakenewsfag
  she was caught on with close relationship with a hostonline magazine model  which being posted on 5ch her username appeared on that guys ins live and so did that guy
i love jurina
  sararan can get it
  we all do
  then im glad shes gone
  the bitch was dating a dude that is rikas boyfriendtier she forgot to change her account and left some lovely emoticons to her boyfriend on instalive with her idol account after that was sudden graduation in record time  idk why slutty idols always date yakuza wannabe dudes to be honest
  that still wouldnt have gotten her fired jo got caught cheating on her boyfriend with some other dude and nothing happened she clearly has some issues and a himetanlike exposé will come out in a few years
  too much forehead
  no wonder rika was all left her azusa alone t_t  on sns
  i fucking told you she was bad vibes
why cant nmb just keep it in their pants
  she probably didnt want to break up with him jo dumped that loser for idol money
  looks too awkward
  sasuga ghetto of namba
no wonder sayaka left
  cheating  she shouldve been blacklisted
  even wearing her bfs clothes on social media while her fans would probably told her how good she looks on them withut knowing the source of that tshirt  just jav already      jo got caught cheating on her boyfriend with some other dude and nothing happened  perks of being managements favorite pillow
erii first row center  our girl is moving up
  no wonder the fake cry on her youtube video
  why bother with that korean loser when she can find a better sponsor in japan
  the guy is kinda ugly
  rika still being part of the aks senbatsu despite having left than half of her original fanbase and still living with her boyfriend was always weird now we know that she knows which members are dating and rika will spill the beans if fired
i think we can all agree    all women are whores
  not honono i just know
goes for the obvious slutty ones  aall women are evil  fag
  that should be moekas spot
  i love how she was all there is no scandal i just wanna quit idols and then jpnchan gathers all this in no time
  is she really moving up or is the quality of akb just going down
  wait what i thought it was just the boyfriend but theres another
  yes
never liked her she kissed my anchu
  her boyfriend only sold the scoop to bunshun because he got mad that she was spotted cuking him wwwww
feel bad for those guys earlier
  this  she has management by the balls
  time to check to whom my girl is giving likes on ig
  i swear this shit would only happen to jo
  most girls are smart enough to use their other hidden account
  if you find a dude remeber to check if your oshi wears any of his clothes
  she was dating a guy for a entire yesr and that ended before ssk  months later wotas found her walking down the street with a guy she told managemet it was her hairdresser it even though it was fishy wotas knew nothing about it until yukitsun at the same time her butthurt exboyfried sold the scoop to bunshun
   what about yukitsun sorry for sounding like a newfag i dont follow nmb
it will never happen to me my girl is pure  i wonder how many of her fans said this
  rara came back to us purer than before she left if thats even possible
  none since everyone knew she was a whore since day one anyone who denies it is lying
all groups have their resident whores but in namba it seems to be the common denominator
  
  after 5 scandals they knew
  she was wayyyy to sluty for not see it coming
  no surprise since she spent her hiatus studying
this is why i only oshi autistic girls like shion because i know theyre incapable of scandaling
  who is 8s
  yuiyui
i dreamed with komi last night    i can remember much dettails but she was in a bed chatting with mion i glanced while she bent over for a second she had a goddessly ass in hot pants i lied on the side of the bed turning the other way and trying not to bother them but komi started talking in my own language and approached me from the back poking my face with one of those cosmetic pens that draw little hearts i turned around to face her and instinctively kissed her forehead she smiled told me something and departed to do some duty i hoped to see her again but woke up before it happened
  the way shes showing off the goods i dunno
  or lying she needs to work on that
fuuu is really starting to piss me off how does she expect to rank in the top 3 if she doesnt stream more if she doesnt get at least 3rd im not even going to bother with sr events ever again
  this is why u dont oshi the slutty ones
  i wouldve spent my hiatus studying her
  is this really how japanese men kiss
  annin was lucky after all
  she knows shes about to snatch center from boring takino she doesnt need this and she doesnt mind letting another girl have some exposure
  there is a reason why there die more people than there are born
  well my hopes that she quit so she could do naked stuff and make bank have been slashed just another untrustworthy slut    its not the fact that shes dating that i hate its the fact she tried to hide it and use her fans while lying to their faces what a whore no skin off my back shes dropped
  if jav is informative at all then no   theyre much much worst at it
  this  i used to oshi hina iwata but all that munechira now i only send her energy from time to time the same for satone
this is why i oshi gay girls like naachan who will never have their sexuality accepted
  please study english harder
  welp guess this helps me to move on just another sluty chara that was sluty irl
  thats only wishful thinking ranking in for this event is a guaranteed thing i just wish she would take more initiative people cant just buy her in she needs to do it legit like the others
  is that girl on the right aramaki
  wrong mole placement
  id mention nao but being a rezu wont stop that whore from scandaling
honono and aachan can be trusted  not sgwr shes too desperate to make it
  how does she expect to rank in the top 3 if she doesnt stream more  too busy with her boyfriend
  aachan is the embodiment of evil
  many loli ske truly is a safe bet
imagine heating lolis with your body heat
  i have never seen a little girl with so much thirst for other little girls not even jurina
i hope one day macharin scandals with me
do you believe any of your idols are pure lmao if they are hot and above the age of 14 they are looking for bfs
  my lala thinks man is just another word from the english dictionary
  hot  ske truly is a safe bet
isshiki
naachans favorite pokemon movie is the latias and latios one  how is it possible for one girl to have such godtier tastes in everything
can i trust nagisa she sometimes acts slutty
  theres no proof that she still has a bf
  man its been years of this  let her go already
only rara can say its on me and have it sound pure or did she say its on me i guess that could have different meaning
  how is that the best movie
majime chara failed  eating disorder chara failed  rezu chara failed because the real rezu ones reject her  now she goes for the otaku chara    okada truly desperate
  akbg showed me imitating sex with donuts so no
  pokemon is normie garbage my chingu
  my lala    yikes i kinda want to ask who but i dont want to be interacting with you cause you seem like a creeper
  those are low quality lolis they dont count
  hes talking about goto rara
  nagisa nmb only loves big tited girls such as shu if you are okay with that then yes
  the only ones that can compete are the mewtwo and entei ones
  some 16th gen
  harima
i dont know about you guys but the nuggets have the best lolis right now
  harima is a top 10 loli
  it was harimachan
  the mewtwo one was the best one
  i even forgot they had a 2nd gen already lol  so uninteresting without the voter fraud
  ske lolis are too damn thirsty lolis should be pure
  this      pretty much she should get the graduated chara soon to be honest
  youre trying too hard newfag  all girls are pure until proven otherwise
  based where did she say this
  slut flags right here
  purest captain ever 3
  181203 fukuda akari showroom
  stop slandering sugawara she has done nothing wrong
  after all her ranking is only thanks to her wealthy parents i would be desperate too
  some treasures are worth chasing
  i really want to believe shes a good girl after seeing her documentary
  how can this creature be cute sometimes
  she said she hates doing gravure but does it for opportunities   now she wants to be akb center too  what else would she do for opportunities
  she hates doing gravure but does it for opportunities  thats literally 99 of the girls  only actual good girls like naachan and yunana like it
pure girl wholl never scandal
  this one is cute but shes giving me bad vibes
  bet she went and sucked her boyfriends dick after this vid
  stage still full denial mode  this is why i like you more guys
  nah  nothing beats the ske lolis
  that dress would look better with her natural hair colour
  sources say she was fired abnormally fast because she refused to bang a downtown and the agency was having none of it
  i think nanami and aochan are the winners in the bunch
  i liked the ransom video aesthetic in this one
  continued to lie in this quitting video    ugh im done with her
  nno scand oh   goes to jav
  gotta love scandal pics  extra points when an inside job
  took me too long to figure out she wasnt doing coke
im just gonna say that this azusa stuff is weeks old it was even posted in here and no one cared so if you think shes suddenly fired because of that youre retarded
ded
  its also funny because komi did the same thing last week commenting on some dudes instagram live
  kek they really are
  its just babbies first day on 5ch
  and dont forget erii
  ill snort my nose clams however i want
  wasnt that one a famous dude though
  this is what i like the most about scandals all the whinning and the tantrums thanks asuza for making your stage faggots go full meltdown mode _
  that was a well know comedian shes a fan of  i still got jelaous af of course
  is a famous mc is the same as comenting on stephen colbert stream   asuza fag is just fuming and trying to destroy everything with him   ignore and keep enjoying asuzas scandal
  stephen colbert  since komiyama already appeared on ellenshow it would be him commenting on her instalive   
  effortlessly bigger than izone    sasuga captain
  oh shit komis at rich evans level of fame
  hopefully she will never know that she is too good for akb now please dont leave us komichan
  good only one part of that video got to me
  komi at her peak on rk bingo
  superstar
  how about i tell her through instagram
  yappari there was no need for pd48 after all
is komi a leftist lunatic too
  you reign with such a terrible iron fist that even when someone finally leaves they must apologize for being selfish out of fear  yaaaas queeeen
  shes an lgbt offender ever since she messed with ivan
california mad again    lol
  is komi replacing rich evans on botw
  i expect she will and ill clap because i recognise komi
you know the postyamada nana stuff really felt like it was just a year ago i cant believe 4 years went by also i completely forgot about that girl until now i was just thinking about a month ago what ever happened to that girl and yet i never looked it up and ive seen her gravure a lot but completely forgot she was the same girl  lucky guy though i wonder if he came in her
  botw  i had to google a bit to get the right sense of that
does komi want that juicy shaq meat
  komi is first/second wave    like most intelligent people she knows that thirdwave and lgbt are just fags bored of having too much free time
i cant believe komi is the most popular and recognizable idol
  based komi couldnt care less about tumblr fads
  when did jurina dye her hair
  why not shes the best at being a girl people like girls
  when the fuck is she gonna upload something new
  how many beans has she taken
would kojiharu be considered a stacy
  yeah no    in all honesty it was like this komi lost the fashion battle against megu with ivan  co as judges komi a sore loser tried to defend herself by saying that she trusted better the judgement of a man the previous judge than a womans i figure she deemed herself progressive and empathetic by acknowledging ivan as a woman but the idea was so absurd ivan is obviously not a woman but an effeminate man that it came out as a sort of barely concealed mockery in ivans words are you trying to imply that ill never be as much a woman as you are komi apologized immediattely but the harm was done and she was ridiculed again    heres the episode jump to 2206  
  ignoring that the original judge was a massive gay  stay mad tumblrinkun 
yikes
  based komiharu triggering safespacers 24/7
  thats the point a gay man thus not a woman you just showcased the same naive confussion that buried komi    i have no bussiness in tumblr whatsoever
  komi as a proper 1st/2nd wave representative knows that just prefering a woman for being a woman is nothing but 3rdwaver entlitement komi is a meritocratic woman and if another fellow human doesnt prove  to be worthy the gender does not matters   check your tumblrmillennial tier narratives next time
  no wonder she is our very best captain
  komi is a rather dumb girl  with a long history of poorly defending herself against criticism hilarity ensued every time unlike you if youre serious at all im not pushing any specific gender agenda commitments on her but just trying to make sense of her oopsie    that said in your favour i once kinda shared a reading of idols as feminists of some sort insofar as working women but ive always thought it a moot point not that im personally invested on it i am no feminist myself at all
  post hit a nerve so hard that komihater has to use personal attacks  guess its all resolved now
i love komi
  mayuyu is the closest humanity has ever gotten to perfection
mini me you complete me
  and a dyke
  and a pedophile
    a true 11/10
  i kinda see it
  they said it themselves so it must be
    is there a correlation between how good a girl is and how much forehead she exposes
  no cameron being the best is a coincidence
damn fuu i swear she just gave up when she saw 6th place was more than a million points away i need more optimistic idols in my life but i dont like any of those kinds in stu hina isnt even going to try because shes so far behind now what a waste i want a refund

  takino  6 girls who wont win
tsugumin will never hurt me

  takino wont win its obvious to me now the girls that will win are dedicated to it there is no half assing allowed it just wont cut it if you want to win anything in life you must completely devote yourself to it even when the situation seems bleak you cant give in you must always continue at 100    no she will be streaming for the first time tonight she stands no chance
  id like to believe so as well
  if she lewd it like this or even more for the whole rest of the contest she might win
  just watched it  fucking foreigners that lady ivan was such a bitch the uematsu guy was actually still nice even when he was upset  thats the difference between real japanese and these dirty gaijin cunts
   viagrajgp    lol
  she should take of some clothes with every 10 towers
  just a slightly above average midget
  100 is only 10000 points maybe a little morejust let that sink in for a minute go find first place and look at her points

  how are you suppose to use this when shes giving you that kind of look
oimo this may just be me but i think she has a fair amount of sex appealalthough if i say that too often shell get carried away so id rather prefer not to  based oimo knows whats up
  dunno
so anchu is doing shitty mobages now i bet you fuckers started missing dq3 by now
i wanna shige to have her way with me
  same but meru
  same but yuiri
  you vastly underestimate how much i hate dq3
  have those two ever said they like doing gravure

  warning taiwanese accent
stu is always innovating and now venturing into lesbian nun fanservice
  such a cutie i love it when she bites her lip
  id give her something to bite
  id give her some lip
  naachan is too yabai
when will ngt get another variety show theyve only had two
fuck
  never ever
  she posts interesting creepshots though
  rikas show is the only one theyll ever get
  good rika deserves more she can get it all
  crop the face except the lips im not a bad person
the new yamanote station shouldve been named azusa station
    well fuck  she really was a fucking slut  you guys kept saying she was a bad vibe whore but i dont know why i just couldnt trust your judgement  i just wanted to believe otherwise but i guess you cant escape reality  i take back what i said she wont be missed  would be nice if this slut joined av only thing shed be good for after this  im also renaming my eevee again she is not worthy to be an eevee girl  to think i liked her whats wrong with me this hobby isnt healthy for me      this manipulative lying fucking bitch  the worse thing about this is that a fell for it
  best group
im glad my oshi isnt a whore i couldnt handle this shit i dont know how you namba fans stand watching your girls scandal constantly
  always trust anon he seems like a smart and trustworthy guy
  post how you feel on her new twitter
nmb48 renamed to kek48
is fuu a slut
  fuu is completely safe i know because i stalk her every day
  theres no proof rika was dating anyone it was just her and a guy in a picture as soon as i see a picture of them hugging or kissing ill regress but until then ill continue enjoying hime
imagine being that much of a cuck
  i feel like i cant watch fuu until this event is over maybe if she can reach 6th i might change my mind
  imagine bein you you nerd
  id rather be a nerd than a cuck
  good
  nigga she literally scandaled on her first day do some research next time
  didnt know her then but what did she do
  rtmp//210140227711935/liveedge/72050cc8a2498e5223d6666a6c4fa3cfb1e7d3356f603cf297256569a03ddf7a
  
  this 
  poor miu she lost all her japanese fans and shes stuck with a bunch of koreans
azusa is still better than bitches like jo tbqh
  koreans who throw 200 towers in a single stream
nmbs always scandal aint nothing new
  yeah but the girls get shit from towers they get a lot more from handshake sales which also decides senbatsu position and shit
  its a nice extra though if you get like 10 towers on a 20 minute stream its 80 bucks for 20 minutes of doing nothing
  scandal48
  aliens mom said they get 300 yen per tower where did you hear they get 800
  i thought thats what bibian said maybe i remember wrong
  might be different for different groups
korean towers are cheaper than japanese or american towers
  turkish towers    but what makes you think the purchase price makes a difference in what they get out of it
  considering how many nmbs there are its still not that many of them
  thats not how 勝手に is supposed to be translated but whatever
am i the only one who knew about azusas antics and didnt give a shit  you guys are acting like that wasnt baked in from the start
  nah same here theres no way the people making a fuss about it now actually follow the group
  following b2 after fuukos departure  following b2 afer the shuffle  not skipping azusas segment in every show
  i liked her precisely because she was a shameless scandal girl
  not skipping azusas segment in every show  i dont hate fun
how many marriages and boyfriends before you drop a group
  1
  i give them two chances sorry milky and jo
  im too addicted
  im an individualist i dont drop groups
  i bet you are having so much fun now
    do you think shes still a virgin

  what are they looking for
  they should do it for the banter
  yamada nanas voice
  girls who like to quit suddenly with a minimum of 5 scandals and resemblance to at least one popular pokemon
  no need theres a new cute bad vibes girl already
  under 150 is better 155165 is a pretty wide margin that includes 80 of all idols
  this girl is perfect  im ready for her scandal
  160165 is bestest
  nambas are like the heads of the hydra
  its actually 1557167

  but what does kate think about all of this
  now thats the truly unforgivable thing
  a lot of the 6d3 girls loved azunyan
post the best clingy rice loving goddess
how does miki feel about being inferior to chihaya in every possible way is miki just there so chihaya can step on her
  no chihaya is like a sister to miki
finally    why is my wife so unpopular
  good strategy stay close to chihaya and maybe leech some of that incidental popularity from chihayas great fanbase
  go away
  shes one of the most poplar though probably mostly among niwaka since shes basically made to appeal to plebes
  i know chartwise shes very popular but i never actually see people talk about her its always chihaya see above    my theory is shes more liked in japan because she looks like a white girl and chihaya is more liked in the west because she looks japanese
miki is a bad influence  wish i hadnt use filters for the shot
  wwhat is she teaching her
  handholding
miki is hibikis friend thank you miki for not discriminating on your friends based on smell
hes not looking at miki  nano
  the fuck how many tabs lsd you did haya dont look like no motherfucking japanese
  she looks more japanese than miki though its debatable if any anime character looks japanese  thats an entirely different discussion
  lazy jc slut
  do not be jealous
  shut up faggot hibiki smells like flowers
does anyone have a link to a recording of the xbox 360 ims commu where miki invites producer to a private photo shoot with him starring her bare chest

found this on futaba looks fun lets have a sufami thread and post results    
  cat look like janny lol
  why did you post an image of the janny
  the janitor shit
retro tenshi eating a corndog
  scary
chose this pic of jeesus and kanna by random but for some reason it became really comfy
okina
oohh i remember i used to use this all the time
  marisa is sad because it made her face yellow
i think this looks pretty solid
please forgive my autism but many of these pictures are inaccurate any image with more than 4 colors would usually have a noticeable tiling effect if rendered on an actual console  
  quality post
  this cat looks familiar
  usually but not always you can work around the limit if youre clever
i hate fun
  kmeans clustering but japanese whats so otaku about this
  only otaku are autistic enough to have fun with this
  god damn it
looks like she was rendered on a nintendo handheld
  rude
  noice
this is incredibly comfy
cool effect

  surprised it took so long
sumirekos a weirdo
thoughts on this dork
well for a start shes not a dork
  i find her very cute and her childish body very sexually attractive
  delet
  there are better dorks
  i want to lick and smell that seat after shes done sitting on it
  i think she alright
  i want to rape all of them specially if the middle one stays smug all the time
she doesnt deserve such a garbage thread
she would have a field day reading me like a open book
  like the vast majority of amoral 2hu characters she would look a lot better covered in pitchset alight and then hurled into a deep canyon
  caesar please
  pretty cute would date
  i think she should rape me
loli satori best satori
how ugly are you on the inside /jp/
  is she this cute on purpose
  im a huge lolicon so extremely ugly      i consider her third eye to be an integral part of her body  thats exactly how i feel i hate when shes drawn without her third eye and i love when its drawn as expressively as her two normal eyes
  the way shes about to remove her panties with one finger without even realizing it is the most erotic thing ive ever seen    i hate when shes drawn without her third eye and i love when its drawn as expressively as her two normal eyes  my man   is it that expressive in sa i forget remember a big teardrop but thats it
  this is important  i raff everytime
  ugly enough
  i dont think im a bad person but im terribly perverted   i think most people are but are afraid of being accused of it
  is it that expressive in sa  apparently not it only changes expression when she loses
  would satori appreciate a mental escort of sorts someone too follow her around with a mind full of happy kind caring thoughts and the mental discipline to maintain them so she can focus on that when the noise gets too much
  almost all mind reader enjoy having a person who thought are happy caring and sweet it help keep them from breaking down
  dang
sanae is ready for her date
  satoya
  go away harasaki
  i am a human very ugly
how would satori feel after reading anons thoughts specially those about fucking/raping her  would she be disgusted disappointed angry scared maybe she would feel pity
  ive jacked it to and fantasized about almost every imaginable fetish without keeping any as a mainstay in my mind  ive absorbed almost all /pol/ memes but deep down i actually dont hate anyone  i have intrusive thoughts all the time  it pains me seeing poor people and being unable to help them but ive never gone to do volunteer work  im a neet    im not that sure of how ugly that makes me
daydream all the time  sometimes its about me being a cool guy and giving interviews about my ideas  sometimes its about an animeesque story ive been going through for years  sometimes its another story  all different genres with their own character arcs and themes and such  satori will never stalk me to watch the stories unfold  who else /satorichannel/ here
  you better be keeping a notepad of ideas anon
  im trying but im way too disorganized
i wish satori sat on my face
nightmare
  how are you a neet and not poor
  i at least have a family to support me and i dont have to go out to beg for money so technically im not poor despite not having my own money
  satori a cute
  kute kot
  her arms are too short lol
is this a cute satori
  satori isnt cute
  rude
tiny ladies
  remi inspires none of the warm fluffy protective desires in me that satori does strictly inferior
  komeiji_satori  dork  anon  apply yourself to the pavement 300 times the rate of freefalling head first preferably
satori is the the sickness in everyones heart
  that guys rape doujins with the teacher made me so sad please someone help her
  canon satori is a miracle
  aaahhh so cute so cute  i want to tenderly rape her pregnant
  if you touch her anon ill beat your god damn face in
  kiiras satorin is a miracle of the universe  i want to get under her clothes and sniff her and lick her small body all over thinking on how good she smells and tasting all her naughty bits kissing and nibbling her oriental sacred places as she cries and hiccups trying to push me away     i love satorinrinrin
loli satori or zuns satori
  crappy bait but zuns satorin is a loli
  she confesses to me that she loved me but i rejected her should i be worried
  both
  should i be worried  depends are you aware that youre a huge homo and have you written your will
  satori is cute
lovingly taping satorin in her bed  making her sleep in the same bed she was raped  forcing her to have and raise a rapebaby
  when youre finished please share the tape on /jp/
  literally me
satori has exterior veins that she could easily trip over or get caught in things and that just wigs me out too much for me to enjoy her
  dont worry theyre quite durable
  anon probably means tape as in duct tape
  so did he
    how about the thing she trips and gets caught on is you and how as you struggle to get untangled from her external veins you accidentally undress her and yourself
yo shes no dork
  how durable
it really makes me sad that i will never get to slowly mating press rape satorin and impregnate her against her will
  against her will  stop it already
  good taste
  dont abuse the better sister do it to the vegetable
  the vegetable  which one
  what is it about guro artists that makes them instantly recognizable i have no idea if that even is a doujin and i can already tell it has guroshit in it
  please dont remind me of this doujin
  delet
  ha jokes on you this one doesnt have guro its by a guro artist and satorin almost dies but its technically not guro  what is it about guro artists that makes them instantly recognizable  artstyle there arent that many famous guro artists to its easy to identify them
  i actually liked this a lot she looks so happy
  confirmed
  fuck you
  slowly  satorin was made for rough hard and mindless jackhammering so much that the pain makes her unable to breath and when she finally regains her breath it makes her cry and scream as loud as a little girl possibly can  it would also be a nice bonus if she couldnt walk for a day or two because of how much her lower body aches afterwards
satori is a beautiful girl
  i love gloomy satori but at the same time want to fill her with so much joy and happiness that she wont look like that anymore its a conundrum
  i want to fill her with so much joy and happiness  are joy and hapiness codewords for semen
  if you fill her with semen shell be happy and joyful so it might as well be
  will do my part then
  a full womb is a happy womb
  nope
  one of the best characters in the series      thats literallys utsuhos work when she isnt at the power plant though
  really citation needed
  its gonna take a while to find but  well reading it again its not quite the same but its similar i do think there was somewhere else where she was more direct about it but it may have been some fanwork i saw long ago
  but it may have been some fanwork i saw long ago  im gonna put money on that happens all the time
satoris small cunny being stretched to the limit by rockhard adult cocks  her unsoiled womb being filled to the last inch of her fallopian tubes with semen of strangers
  thats not very nice anon satori would be very sad if she saw you saying those things about her
  consensual missionary intercourse like a loving couple more to satorins liking
  mixed feelings at that statement
satorin is too scared to sleep alone is it fine if she crashes in your bed for the night
  her mindreading ability is exactly why she would immediately retract her request after offering it shed just mindreading for 10 seconds and realize nope this is not safe im not going to be safe sleeping with this guy 
  i turn over in my sleep a little but shes welcome to if thats okay
  shit youre right    how hard would be to think nothing for as long as it takes her to go to sleep
  impossible shed be able to notice anything youd try to do to not think anything substantial wouldnt just thinking a flood of nothing be suspicious
  yeah it would dammit i just want to molest her fragile little body while she sleeps
  sure as long as she doesnt mind a creepy man having a constant stream of lewd thoughts about her  of course i wouldnt touch her while shes asleep probably
  my mind starts thinking about awful stuff when im trying to sleep like what if people in my family die and all that kind of stuff 
  same it wouldnt be pleasant for her so its better that she sleeps elsewhere
  im sorry im a hopeless nogood pervert satorin im sorry
im i really this bad satori
  diaperfags are disgusting desu
  shes shit the other day i went to have a drink with my date and since we couldnt think of any discussion topic my mind wandered to that dagon movie i saw and the particularily scarylooking scene of a guy being skinned alive in it then i began thinking of pulp fiction and that hot scene where a woman get raped in a basement and when i finally looked around she was sitting at a table staring at me while her cup of tea was leaking  reading thoughts should be a crime punishable by a spanking
  that is why you keep reading and playing on a computer until you can barely stand
  anon are you a schizophrenic did you actually see satori at the restaurant satori isnt going to be outside of gensokyo so it wouldnt make sense if you randomly saw her at a restaurant  also iirc the only scene involving rape in pulp fiction was where bruce willis character and the black dude were being raped by the gay pawn shop owners
  if it was a black dude ha shit i misunderstood that scene then i thought they were banging a chick but my cousin closed his laptop before i could see the whole thing
literally dont think anything dirty around miss satorin and you will be fine
  have you seen satori thatd be really difficult
  but im a horny pervert i automatically think about dirty things all the time specially around girls as cute and beautiful as satori
  this i cannot stop thinking about lewd stuff my mind would immediately focus on her small petite frame and how i would grope her slender body all over
  lewd thoughts about toehoes is literally the only think that keeps me sane though
  thing
last chapter        new chapters soon and last volume too   
  posting best girl
digital release soon
  why asama looks like shit but horizon got the best
  because asama is much more bigger than horizon with the transformation introduced by kawakamis influence she obtained a deformed body
god i fucking love bodysuits and big chests    anyone else share this view
  everyone but only when you get decent proportions
it took me until today to realize that the bdbox releases on a friday and will probably be held up in shipping for me until after christmas
  amazon probably will send it one day before the release date
  4 through 6 were the golden age
  there was a somewhat troublesome thing about the musashi vice president    shes really acclimated herself to musashis weirdness    masazumis character development is easily one of my favorite parts of horizon
hey bitches  look
  fold lines  fuck i hope not
soon yet so far  anyway just brute forced this from their covers so were getting some purchase bonuses as well  these are usually quite low resolution though too bad
what was the point of yoshitsune and qingtakeda as a whole they were pretty prominent in volume 3 but ive hardly seen them mentioned beyond that
  read volume 11
worth reading
so this is what the melonbooks box to contain all the horizon volumes looks like
  as much as i like the mega illustration from volume 4c paying that much extra considering importing for colored cardboard isnt really worth
  we all have our limits
why are the new touhou characters so bizarre weird and overly complicated to the point when it looks messy
why dont the old touhou characters wear shoes
  because socks are more comfortable
  why would they wear shoes if they can float everywhere
  theyre not youre just retarded name 1 bad modern touhou design you cant except for maybe hatate but otherwise you cant
  because youre a dumbass genwunner      except for maybe hatate  you fuck off too
because zun actually has creativity now
  cownpiss
  they all may look like circus workers but they are just female creatures looking for the male  be nice to them
  there is nothing wrong with clownpiece  her design is kind of brilliant actually  like most zun designs
  now
  delete this
  do tell me how the likes of tsukumo sisters raiko junko or okina are more complicated than alice yukari medicine or utsuho
    american loli clown  get owned
i want pictures of touhous eating sandwiches
  i have this
  ham gruyere  turkey brie  pastrami reuben  bacon egg cheddar  acceptable
  i want fairies eating jello

ringo on account of her exposed midriff
  the fatass
  seiran because of her blue hair translucent pants and because she makes me think of 精液淫乱   精乱
they are all really excellent but ringo appeals to me the most
  i like seirans design the most but ringos color scheme is great  reisen is easily the weakest of the 3 designwise for me
  she can teleport whats not to like
for me its ringo
  the gay one
reisen udongein inaba
  but all of them are gay
i want a kappy cunny fairy cunny and a moonbun cunny in my breeding pen

i like it when a rabbit is afraid
i like them all including earth ones
    earth rabbits are genetically inferior and only exist for bullying purposes
teeth made for chomping them hard veggies
    i like it when a rabbits concerns are ignored
feast
  
  rabbits scream when caught you know
    thats hot
  the rabbit scream when showering  
moon bunnies belong in rape gulags
  so are seiran and ringo technically earth rabbits now since they run a dango stand in gensokyo
  lets find out
  why is okina there
  okina is everywhere
  daikokuten is a saint among the rabbits

  the fact that i can teleport faster  nothin personal all skill  perfect for danmaku you can warp around like fantasy heaven without the spacial stuff
  this is the moon bunny thread
    
lunarians use moonbunnies as sex toys to educate their young
  lunarians have no need for sex and reproduction you fool and thus have no young its a cold sterile incredibly dull rock
  how do the lunarians recover their moon bunny slave populations without breeding factories/camps/ranches
  lunarians have no need for sex and reproduction you fool and thus have no young
  they literally cant
  send me to the moon and i will show you the opposite
  earthbunnies shouldnt be allowed to even look at moonbunnies let alone be associated with them  they need to be taught their place
  depends on the rabbit   
  
do you think lunarians would sell me some bunnies if i asked
  i dont think anyone would pay for those in the first place
    you feed them dango and they pound mochi    moonbun is good investment
  butte
  why would i want that when i could get cute earth rabbits from tewi
  id give her my carrot if you know what i mean  i dont get it
  おちんちんです
  i see
  how the fuck did you mispell 大きな大陸間弾道弾
  sexless marriage anon       moon rabbits are not lunarians
    this post never claimed they were it was talking about lunarians controlling the bunny slaves which they do
  sexless marriage anon  they literally had sex and their kid married the mothers sister

everyone likes reisen

kyaru is my wife
  my traitor wife is so cute
    there appears to be an issue here surely shes not the wife of both of you
but if everyone is yuuki and one anon is married to her doesnt that make every anon married to her
  yuuki isnt old enough to get married
  well she is a traitor after all she probably cheats on all her husbands every day
would have yuukis kids  christina  eriko  kokkoro  kuuka  yui    crush  anna  arisa  chika  djeeta  hatsune  maho  makoto  nanaka  nozomi  rino  saren  tsumugi    acquaintances  story only characters    friends  the rest
im ready for chika
  i spent more than that during legfest and got nothing so i wouldnt say youre ready at all
  same here 25k for christina and got shit on
its nearly christmas time and miyakos event is long over theres no more halloween pudding where should i get it from    seriously do they just not bother changing the notices until the next seasonal event not that i would mind having miyako in charge all year round but its still weird
  my unluckshitter phase has already passed in summer things have been looking up ever since halloween where i 10 rolled the two
  he thinks it has passed
not even sure if i wanna refill stamina for this event or not meh gacha and freebies hope the event tracks are at least nice
  so switch your profile character
the cb ends right when the event starts right
  no cb ends tomorrow at 000 jst or something
  wait its based on that never mind then
is there a site out there that has a archive of translated shironeko stuff with them constantly rereleasing old content i hate having to use google image translate constantly
my pecorine looks weird guys
  is this pecorine alter
  wasnt her rate lower than normal
  no her rate was normal
all these qol changes for 4p coop in shironeko  centuries later still no love for 2p coop  might as well remove it from the game completely
chikas triple summon ub looks kind of useless though its just going to feed tp to area attackers
  2p coop really feels like a forgotten game mode yeah
  isnt it like adding a maho as a 6th team member
  i want improvements particularly on the matching system for 2p helper coop   year 2018  still using primitive methods to find rooms or getting players for blessed weapon quests
  being able to find randoms for blessed would be a double edged sword though sure youd get matched up with other people but youd still get a ton of shitters and will have to rely on the primitive methods again to get actual carries that actually know how to run the stage
ayane alt  who the fuck wanted it
  me ive been asking for an ayane alt for months im skipping chika and waiting to roll for her because the idea of an ayane swinging a xmas tree would be perfect
does anyone like potion maker
  potion maker was always a staple of /mbgg/ since our first thread but theres not really a lot to talk about outside of how cute tio/pio are sadly
  well they are at least    recently i discovered that there are two potion maker wikis both of which dont look to be in the best condition and possibly abandoned for months now ive been considering trying to build one of them up myself i dont have a cheat engine or access to the games files or anything but i could provide descriptions of nearly anything in the game and ive acquired every costume there is so i figure there must be something i can contribute i just cant decide which wiki i should go with if i do try
  i dont really think potion maker is the sort of game that would need a wiki its a fun casual game but theres a lot to talk about and the strategy if i recall correctly was just about being efficient with your yellow/red potions    if you really want to make one then the best but biggest effort would be mediawiki the worse one but easier is wikia the main thing people would most likely want to see is pictures/animations of the outfits and whats the current outfit/how to get it so that should probably be your priority also make sure that youre the owner/admin of said wikia before heavily investing yourself in it if someone else is admin then itll be actual hell to manage it or keep it going
  i feel like theres not a lot to describe or explain so it doesnt really surprise me that both wikis have fallen by the wayside     though it does surprise me a bit that there were two wikis for it to begin with    im not going to say dont do it do whatever you want but i dont think there are going to be many people looking for that information even at the best of times
  youre a pleb anon real men want more of ayane
suzume ayane and possibly kurumi got an alt but not saren  i hate it
  ah alright thanks for the advice if i do go through with it ill try creating my own      im sure i just have a soft spot for potion maker and thought it could be a neat thing to do i already hang around /v/s mobage threads and am occasionally surprised at how many people ask questions about the game    potion maker fan art  bafflingly this is a thing ive never considered looking for now ive got something else to do tomorrow
been coming back to ss several times despite the fact that i never seem to have a snowballs chance in hell to beat anyone in any of the pvp modes whats wrong with me
  at least youre not the only one a few friends checked out soccer spirits again after epic7 release though i honestly dont like the game and cant imagine how anyone would continue to play it or buy their super expensive skins epic7 has been super addicting so far but that has its own general i guess
its time to forget about kyaru
  i kinda like the characters in ss but the game almost seems to punish you for using characters you like since everyone else just goes with the meta
goodbye my 20k jewels
fuck off nanaka dont trick me into thinking i got chika
so is she good
anyone here play megido72  i dont play mobage but the party building mechanic has me hooked
  id want her considerably more than a chika or kurumi alt    literally the only good thing about kurumi is that she calls you oniichan
finish a good chunk of making kianas guns in that new game mode  get them from gacha instead  guess i was kinda asking for that by rolling in this gacha
  man i desperately need those guns my moonlight feels so sad without them would roll but i spent all my crystals trying to gun for blue fuka
does this event have nonshit materials yet
  12k gems  didnt get nanaka ruka or christmas chika  yeah anon youre better off than me i didnt even get a single 3 or anything new
finally unlocked the final story  basically just miki cards talking about stupid things nothing else  why would someone made this stupid thing and require stupid amount of farming to unlock it  if i dont have 4 mari i wouldnt even try to attempt it
  sakamotops directive has been what awful things can we drag our sensei through for the past year or two  i lucked out with two reprints from very few gems but the stages were all awful to run ranking border pace was ridiculous after mari bait came out
nozomi free frags  this xmas event is really awful
cant believe i misspelled that  airis va changed its definitely a bit softer but i probably wouldnt have noticed if i didnt go through a bunch of her stories before the change
  they only did the change just now i thought it was announced eons ago
is pic related a good game i asked /vg/ but they are useless semen slurpers
  try   theres a whole general dedicated to digimon so you might have better luck in there than /vg/ cant help you myself sorry never tried that game
  yeah needed time for the new va to record everything i guess
tfw got perfect acce slots in 2 tries  ez game
  ive been busy doing other stuff and havent been able to farm these when does it end
  i dont think anyone does or they just never talk about it when it gets mentioned from time to time everyone just asks why are they crying
  dec 14
  oh i got a long while then thanks      yeah i think the game would have had a better time taking off if it didnt get memed to hell and back
merry xmas  its not even december yet and this event will end before xmas    its halloween all over again except that i dont have to nut my entire crystal stock this time
whats the one try boss party
tales of rays has finally rolled in that fancy graphics mode and we also get a judith event
sp30 start  class and character type restrictions  oh boy here we fucking go
  2 characters only
three sets of dupe runes what a generous collab
  1st 10 roll  my account is a luckshitter account now
  i only got a 4 project dupe so it isnt much better
  its getting ridiculous starting 31
  31f  that shit is still a warm up this is the part where you will hate kusopl
  i hate how they always find a way to make these hell challenges worse than the last ones
    i like priconnes setting and character stories but i absolutely hate the gameplay and cant bring myself to return to it not even because its an autobattler but because of the extreme amounts of farming required per character the fact that the event enemies scale to your account level doesnt help at all
  story event enemies stop at like level 5060 though the only thing that might give you trouble   once youre past that is the ex boss
  story event enemies stop at like level 5060 though  oh thats a relief i had that one time when i just hit the level 5060 enemies for the first time and my party could barely clear the first event stages back then since then ive leveled up and i dont have any problem clearing the events but i always thought that theyre probably going to get even stronger after hit level 80 or something
  extreme amounts of farming  log in once a day select a piece of equipment and see where it drops select that stage in that equipment menu run it as much as possible using the stamina you have using skip tickets  log out and dont play the game for another 24 hours  doing this will easily get you to level cap and will easily get up your characters in the process  are we playing the same game or is your definition of grinding completely scuffed  priconne is about as casual as they come and requires very little actual farming since you just skip ticket everything apart from first clears ive not actually played the game since release ive just skip ticketed endlessly and still have 4000 tickets to my name sitting at max level maxed out experience and have like 15ish fully geared r11 girls to my name while the rest are r10 most of them are 5    theres many games out there like granblue which near enough require you to become a neet to actually do things not being worthless during guild wars constant farming for abysmal drop rates lots of daily shit like arcarum and daily coop event farming etc priconne is the exact opposite of those where you barely need to play the game at all it may look like a lot on paper but abuse the skip function and you can be done with your daily grind in minutes
real life chika is a lot prettier than in game chika
  same with yori and shiori
  thats pretty common at least for me makoto is a good example who is wearing a very basic outfit and looks rather butch but then you see her in real life with her uniform on and shes suddenly super attractive
  one hit kill for almost all characters if they got attacked without barrier  the enemies themselves dont seem to have much hp at least the trolls and baphomets only need mana s2 twice to kill them  i wonder if i should find a random player to help the buff null metal vase is also cancerous
  shizuru yukari tomo and mitsuki also have better looking rl version for me
    tfw no pandora for me
nozomi fragments  why
  sounds like you still give a lot of weight to gameplay/progress speed/getting things easy and quick because the game can be definitely played for story alone sure the system doesnt allow you to binge everything in one go like a book but i never felt its something hindering you that significantly maybe im taking things way too easy but im content with the slow and steady progress the only problem i ever had was getting through my first event stages on time but then again thats expected for a newbie the true evil are the atrocious gacha rates that dont reach even the 3 that should be the standard
  tsumugi is slacking off at home
gacha ruined the whole industry
vh summons things  how the fuck do i kill it now
20 minutes to get top 500 its in the bag lads
so whats the plan for filling our 11 empty slots
  i want nozomin to be my mama
  how good of a mama would nozomin be she sounds too busy doing idol things to really spend time with her kids
  the first step is not having half of the clan leave like every other month
is there any way to fight vh boss efficiently if my magic characters arent raised except for kyouka
oops i forgot about daylight savings time and didnt use my 3 fights today
  do you have christina anon
  does she work
  yes shes r10 and 3
story events are now significantly shorter  but limited chara shards are the same and so is the whole lot of trash in every box  going full out for pudding was a good decision i dont think ill want to bother ever again
chika is 50 kg  pecorine is 46 kg  wtf how is chika so fat yet so flat compared to peco
  im somewhat anticipating three gatchas this month   since this one ends on the 12th ayanes might end just before the 25th and then    christmas fest gatcha from 25th till new years with x3 rates and free daily rolls 
    
chika saves the city from eternal silence in priconne  chika saves christmas from foggy in redive  is she the real heroine
  this one ends on the 19th anon
is nozomin nopan
for compass news the next season will run from the 6th 16th themed around 2nd anniversary celebrations the special event will follow on the 17th with news and goodies the reward card is just like last time a team heal so itll probably be 100 with a 999 second cooldown    rezero collab reprint will run from the 1st  9th and should be the same as last time that means a series of quests rewarding bm and player icons rem and emilia as characters and a series of costumes for the original geezers there will also be a double ur gacha until the 3rd with the special collab cards  there are a bunch of good cards on offer due to their elements such as the red 100 heal green shield break and red aoe piercing card
  man i should level up my tomo
  i just tried this and the middle three get obliterated right before yuis ub can fire the stars probably matter too much _
eriko is so short
  shes the youngest one there yet shes the second largest
not a single 3 pull in 6 months  kimuraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
romancing saga reuniverse comes out next week
engirls still getting merch and collab cafes  i cant even begin to imagine how badly the game itself had to be doing that no one could find an excuse to keep it alive
    more mega miracle force info
  as much as i liked the cast and the old version i cant really say i was surprised felt like they didnt adapt well at all to the current mobage market     i stuck around to the end because nostalgia but i imagine most players wouldnt have that to motivate them    but im glad to hear theyre still doing something with it
  a huge mistake they made was changing the brainless tapping through quests and beating requests that pop up randomly to now you have to pay attention and make effort to remember the right choices to get a request that gives high points i do remember comments how people would still bother with the former for story and the girls maybe it would last a bit longer then then there were those huge freezing problems that never got fixed until the end horrible times    but yeah its nice to see its not buried and completely forgotten although a chance for more songs probably is that one is a shame then again i guess i should be happy rock band club got one at all
so is christmas chika any good
  i got really lucky and found myself a carry the guy had the same team as mine but playstylewise he was leagues better than me _  i died on the main boss first phase but he just went through all three phases like its just walking in the park
  you can get carried in this hell thats pretty nice
  yes i think this is the first ever 2p helper coop where you can enable random matching oddly enough i brought this up yesterday too
  maybe colopl reads this thread and saw your plea
this vh boss is fucking miserable
  you need either skyaru or christina if you want to 1t merry xmas
  my kyaru is still 3 but i guess its time to stop being cheap
  hope you got them all maxed out
  ilya can work too
can i use an emulator to play these games and if so which emulator do you guys recommend and what games do you recommend either with cute girls or as least jewish as possible
  i used nox for ages its a pretty good emulator but ive heard some shady stuff about it  seems like almost all of them have some form of adware / data collecting/ cryptofarming bullshit so just pick your poison
  nox/ld player  nox is the most commonly used but ldplayer has been gaining steam lately    games do you reccomend  depends on genre  casual games would be azur lane or princess connect more of a grindfest but still a colle game would be girls frontline    for korean grindfests you have epic7 that plays like a tactical turn based game and is in english with the worst dub youve ever heard     if you want something with more action and sort of casual you could pick up shironeko project and if you want something thats full on action gameplay that requires your full attention then houkai impact and the list goes on depending on what you want      i personally hate using ilya myself she crits herself so much and can absolutely ruin runs which is super frustrating
    thank you guys
people itt hate rhythm games  back to /vg/ i go
  theres bluestacks too but a lot of games ban emulators or rooted devices i think those are the top 3 people always use
  this is the japanese only dead mobages general if youre starting out you probably want to start with the more popular ones that have their own generals at /vg/ girls frontline azur lane epic 7 all have generals or go over to whatever video game franchises general and they probably have a mobage as well    with the worst dub youve ever heard  i dont understand where this is coming from the dub is above average at the very least
  people itt hate rhythm games  huh
  saying this dumpster smells better than this other dumpster isnt saying much the dudes are probably okay but id rather play on mute than subject myself to the awful english female voices in this game
  only idol ones
  also pic unrelated
    google search  best guess for this picture cartoon    every time i dont know why i even bother
  well i do play mobile games not too much as i tend to get bored of them and always look for something new but i have an iphone so cant really get the japanese games so to the foreign games its new to me and im gunna need an emulator for that
  you can you just have to make a japanese apple store account theres a pastebin in the op about how to do it but its certainly easier to do it on an emulator or android yes
  i think thats a problem with you not the dub you want to hear what bad voice acting sounds like feast your ears on this  i dare you to last the whole minute
  he doesnt use the saucenao plugin
  not really its a problem with all english dubs in general the men are okay because the rough dudes sound like rough dudes but the issue starts when you have a lot of cute little/young girls that sound like office ladies with menopause and all voices are done by the same 5 guys that you can find in pretty much every dub ever
  yea i mean i dont really want to go through the trouble of making a jp account and having to switch around or something plus i have some games on mobile that are in na so thats good enough might as well try the foreign games on an emulator
  well there arent a lot of cute little young girls in e7 i it should be alright
  playing the game with males  might as well uninstall then
  make a little girls team  later find out theyre all boys  its not my fault bro
  youve really got all the marks for true /vg/ cancer
/mbgg/ now hates /vg/  whose fault is it to have general thats dead as fuck
  considering the general was awfully shit for the entire year of 2018 with most of the posts being shitposts or bumps to stay alive i think we have a lot of reasons to hate /vg/ its still that too except that it cant sustain itself anymore or reach bump limit because most of us moved here
  never really liked /vg/ culture to be honest sure shitposting is fun and all but sometimes youll want to discuss something with people but cant because everyone is too busy shitposting for fun spreading misinformation for laughs and just generally meming all over the place so you have to find somewhere else to actually discuss it and only go there if you feel like turning off your brain and shitposting for a while
oh god im so loooooonely
  kicks fotm out  thread dies because theres nothing to discuss about
  we get it you hate sluts and only want pure girls
  i heard she works well with a backline heavy team shes also super cute and thats good enough for me
whats with everyone in my clan suddenly requesting newer items did they just add that
  but shes everyones nozomin
  its true  what the fuck i should have just farmed purples instead of golds
  its not like anyone is going to give you the annoying to get shit
  cant hurt to try
  does anyone still have access to that guys account with his precious nozomi im pretty sure we all touched her at some point
  time to quit sky princess if they dont give me items
  i havent touched her
  idolmaster collab again on rays according to datamine the tales characters should be velvet cheria and kohaku maybe mileena and milla too going by the pv will roll for ranko and velvet
  akaivariantoooooooooooaaaaaaaaaa
  every werner is good  every sera is bad  it shouldnt be like this
  uwoooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  has full invincibility while doing so and hits super hard    i wish theyd give sera something like that
  i just want a version of her thats not limited to 2 copies    and then i want to run a coop with three other people playing that version
  broken sarah never  its not fair      a version of her thats not limited to 2 copies  never ever summoning more than one dupe would kill her but regardless imagine the lags and frame drops several clones would cause its for the best
    what if she gets a version of her where her clone repeats her actions/skill uses for double the damage
  how come only rekto/werner get love but never sera anyway male bias in this game
  kashima is cute
everyone is grinding the same stages  as a result everyone has the same shortage on specific items  the second these items become available to request from your clan people ask for them as if others magically have a stockpile of them
  kashima  huh
  priconne supply and demand or something like that    speaking of which can someone lend me 30 of that rank 10 bow i totally need 17 more copies of it
  meanwhile the homo version is getting a full 3d remake
  seems like almost all of them have some form of adware / data collecting/ cryptofarming bullshit so just pick your poison  id say nox and bluestacks are the lesser evil here at least ive never heard of any confirmed cases where somebody got their shit stolen/mined while using these the more popular and widely used the emulator is  its less likely to have something really intrusive built in  i only remember memu andyroid and some other less popular emulators having confirmed 3rd party miners coming with them
  release a game about cute schoolgirls doing cute things with a writer whos good at writing these kind of scenarios  the game is pay to win not fun and gets shutdown twice  release the same game but with boys  it becomes a top grossing app for years to come  this is fucking bizarre
  id say nox and bluestacks are the lesser evil here  kid bluestacks is one of the more notorious cases no they wont outright steal your cc info at least not in a plainly obvious way but they collect as much data on you as they can and send it to their servers in china
  but they collect as much data on you as they can and send it to their servers in china  im pretty sure nox does tha same why should i care about this microsoft google and other companies already do this and the only thing one can do to stop this is to not use the service/app/website
  they collect as much data on you as they can and send it to their servers in china  you mean send it to their servers in usa bluestacks is owned by an american company
    if big corp can fuck me in the ass then ill gladly let every other shady motherfucker that comes along do it as well because why the fuck not  be my guest
    finally a little spotlight in that one last period episode alongside other happyele games  merc storia barely had a part but anime soon so no big deal  engirls got a total of 2 two guest characters was over too soon they could easily fit in a bunch of background cameos at least but they opted for washedout lookalikes only  gay idol spinoff got more than two whole units worth of characters background cameos and a ton of screentime even when it has a whole anime to come out eventually  its not fair but i still genuinely wish it will stay alive and well i need it so my favourite keeps getting fanart through her brother
  is there any alternative to this then the market of android emulators is pretty tight you either use an emulator for free or spend money to buy a gaming phone
  dude you give way more data playing on a phone compared to a sandboxed emulator unless youre rich enough to buy a separate phone just for mobile games
  same hair colour very similar hair style same eye colour both sluts
    i just play mobile games on my singular phone which is not a gaming phone i thought this was the norm to me its crazy that youd be in front of a computer that can run better games and would choose to play mobile skinner boxes instead but you do you  dude you give way more data playing on a phone compared to a sandboxed emulator  youre still running android and still giving google info youre just adding more companies to the mix if youre not the customer youre the product and youre not giving them a penny so im sure theyre getting their moneys worth out of you elsewhere
  to me its crazy that youd be in front of a computer that can run better games and would choose to play mobile skinner boxes instead    dont care about this entire emulator discussion but most of those better games run you 60100 while a good with a lot of emphasis on the word good because theres a ton of trash out there game that you enjoy is often going to last you for years of enjoyment without costing you one cent and you can even choose to sell your account for a good amount of money in some of them  meanwhile those good triple ayy games last you from a weekend to a week and the really really long ones will get you a month tops for the price of a new release
  youre still running android and still giving google info youre just adding more companies to the mix  giving google what info you dont have any personal data on the emulator other than your installed game and you dont even need to sign into a google account so they have no account number to attach any data to  if youre not the customer youre the product  these days youre the customer and the product even if youre paying money
  have fun spending 1000 diamonds and not even getting a 5 weapon yeah im not dealing with that shit anymore
  male bias in this game  most broken characters in tier lists are female though
  f2p skinner boxes exist in pc too except they usually look and play better since theyre not restricted by hardware only aaa games cost you 60 and the only way youre paying more than that is if youre buying all the dlc they shit out you can get plenty of good games for less than that specially if youre willing to wait for one of the seasonal yearly sales where you can get great stuff for 5 a pop which is about what most people drop on each mobage for the monthly free daily gem pack or whatever and i know plenty of people here have dropped more than 60 on a mobage without batting an eye anyway    giving google what info  internet browsing history app usage history general phone usage history any telemetry data they might be able to get off the emulator your ip address possibly other stuff  you dont have any personal data on the emulator  they dont care about your real name and whatnot nearly as much as you think they do  they have no account number to attach any data to  the advertising id is generated and stored independently of your account data
  internet browsing history app usage history general phone usage history any telemetry data they might be able to get off the emulator your ip address possibly other stuff  so nothing important you dont browse internet from an emulator and the only thing you do on it is play one game ip address is not as important as you think especially with dynamic ips and shared ips    compare this with a real phone where you probably do browse the internet with and have a shitload of personal and private data
  f2p skinner boxes exist in pc too except they usually look and play better since theyre not restricted by hardware    not really f2p mmos are super dead or just plain godawful also require a ton of time investment a good pc and people to play it with so you dont quit in a month but youll quit in a month anyway because it got so stale with the lack of endgame and awful meta even some of your beloved triple ayy games are moving to mobile because mobile gaming is only getting more popular with the years so it seems like youre stuck in the past here    meanwhile i can just pick up a fun mobage or two that i can grind or actually play when i want to play something or auto easy content to still progress when im busy with my life or other thigs i can run it on the background of my pc or i can have my phone/tablet running it while i do other things on my pc for completely free    though if you hate mobile games cant see why mobile gaming keeps gaining popularity at a fast rase and see them as awful skinner boxes while wishing you could play real games instead then that begs the question of what even brought you to this thread
  google cares a lot less than you imagine about your real name or dick pics  ip address is not as important as you think  its one of the more important pieces of information since it can tell them where you are  especially with dynamic ips and shared ips  they dont use the ips themselves to id you the id is attached to the android os youre running    man i dont know who youre trying to fool with all this  even some of your beloved triple ayy games are moving to mobile because mobile gaming is only getting more popular with the years so it seems like youre stuck in the past here  cant see why mobile gaming keeps gaining popularity at a fast rase  i dont care about being trendy and i dont know what made you believe i love triple ayy games  what even brought you to this thread  i try the occasional jp mobage and just lurk for news on upcoming stuff
  google cares a lot less than you imagine about your real name or dick pics  but they do care a lot more about your phone number contacts geolocation from gps and wps phone activity etc and they dont get any of that from an emulator    ips are one of the more important pieces of information since it can tell them where you are  i dont believe they care about your ip but whatever phone or emulator they will have it either way and if you really worry about it both can hide it using vpn so there is no point arguing about this one    they dont use the ips themselves to id you the id is attached to the android os youre running  this is better on an emulator too because most of them recommend that you create a new instance for each game so if they attach ids to your android os they will just end up with multiple ids and none will have a whole picture of your data
ayane is 14   same age as kyaru tsumugi etc  older than tomo and the twins  closer to suzume than kurumi in age  why is she always paired with kurumi and grouped with the other lolis
looking at houkai videos  pvp mode      too bad the update guy died in the transition but this game is going to get pretty shitty if they make me fight level 80 whales in pvp for rewards i liked how its fully single player
it only takes me 5 attempts to kill the vh boss
  how the fuck do people kill it with less he just spams his burst and twoshots my party
  is it even worth it at that point
puricone is an anagram of pecorinu  wtf lads
  like gran and djeeta from granblue fantasy
  considering peco barely existed in the original i wonder if they planned this all along
  did she exist at all it wouldnt be hard to come up with a name based on the title of the game but if peco was already in the game before the game failed horribly and had to be rebooted than thats some 5d backgammon that kmr is playing
  she was in the end of the game before it closed down
is it true that chinese mobages are better than japanese ones
  no country of origin doesnt matter only the content matters china used to put out some pretty awful stuff but theres a lot of quality games coming from there now and korea has some fun games too my only bone to pick with koreans is their godawful habit of being the only people in the world that think dubbing their mobile games to english is okay
  
  youll find good games from any region so its not like it particularly matters for the most part honkai is pretty popular and its chinese as is girls frontline jp has big hitters like granblue and fgo korea while not as big has recently pushed out epic7 which is pretty popular just some random examples but youll find good/popular games regardless of their region
keep the discussion not related to priconne to a minimum thank you
  did the /vg/ thread die for you to come to shitpost here
  i wish there were any other games to discuss spoiler there arent
  my problem with korean mobages is the grind boy do they fucking love grindfests and that tendency to make events that are essentially dailies except you gotta go to a separate webpage to turn them in otherwise they tend to be among the better looking ones
    these are my problems with epic7 currently its a fun korean mobage but the rng grind makes granblue look like a little baby and the fact that they decided to dub the entire cast to english really doesnt help either but other than that then yeah id agree its pretty nice looking and fun
  i use the dumb squirrel seriously thats who i use she makes runs safe to say the least
  spend an hour of energy to fight golem once  it drops one ore  you need another 40 to make one piece of equipment  the equipment stats are completely random and in 95 of cases worthless  the equipment set is also random and in 66 of cases worthless  ive never seen a game that makes you feel like such a worthless sack of shit you can grind for the rest of your life and it means nothing when the game just gives you endless shitty equipment with horrible stats and/or set bonuses this on top of a fgo tier gacha really sucks my enjoyment out of the game which is a shame as its actually quite a fun one
is this a good time to get into princess connect if yes is there a particular character i should reroll for
  pretty much this progression is absolutely fucked and completely tied to hard rng because you need to grind and hope for a good set of gear that matches the set main stat and sub stats you need then hope it upgrades well or how the limit break system is hilariously grindy because its just feed fodder into fodder that feeds fodder for your fodder that you need to limit break one person this shit is going to take me weeks see pic  im really liking the game but im at a hard loss on how to progress on this shit without lucking out hardcore on gear crafts/drops      xmas chika might be nice if youre starting now for the sole reason of her being limited ayane if you start later and christina/whatever new crown they release during legfest later    if you start now then you could grab xmas kurumi even though its impossible and unrealistic for you to get her past 3 because shes the xmas freebie if you start later then you might be able to reroll for ayane or a crown if they put out princessfest again  the best course of action would be to reroll now and see how december plays out and if you want to reroll later in the month in a better gacha for units to aim for jun or makoto would make your life a lot easier because theyre both super core in absolutely everything maybe more makoto than jun now that pecorine can take the role of unkillable tank without juns added small def down
  peco goes from useless and never used to being unkillable  what the fuck is in that riceball of hers
  the new sword gives her an inferno shield similar to juns along with a lot of good stats so she can survive the chimera ex wipe with a smile now
did other characters benefit from their new equips or is it basically just peco
  kurumi kyaru and rei biggest winner was peco though
  my girl hiyori didnt get much
  rei  medium aoe  medium aoe with small def down  hiyori  single medium dmg  single large dmg with small aoe damage  yui  single medium dmg  single medium dmg with small patk down  peco  medium mdef up  medium mdef up  with barrier both  kokkoro  medium dmg  medium dmg with atk uptp gain self  kyaru  medium dmg  big dmg with small aoe dmg and small mdef down  nozomi  small dmg with stun  small dmg with stun with patk down  kurumi  def boost  def boost with small tp increase  saren  frontal aoe  frontal aoe with increased damage when low on hp
  shes a baby kaori
  her unique give cri stat though
vh boss uses burst  uses burst again 2 seconds later
  is there a way to reroll without redownloading everything nox is unable to run the game so im using the dmm client
  can you even reroll on dmm i rerolled on nox using an older version of nox with the date adjusting trick to get it to run theres a youtube video that tells you which files you have to delete for you to reroll without redownloading
    i dont think you can reroll on dmm but ive never tried it you could try one of the emulators that are used for games that ban root like fgo or ebin7 but i rerolled on phone myself
  just started the game  already ate her sword  what a glutton
so destiny child is releasing soon
  nexon will butcher it even worse than the korean devs did for the jp release
still no ranking rewards  rankings ending right before weekend shouldnt be allowed i just want my new urara already
shiorin
  enchant arrow
nozomi 私もいつかアイドルじゃなくなって普通の女の子に戻って結婚して子供をつくってママって呼ばれたりするのかなぁ  chika ふふ何でそんなことを言いながら  ユウキさんのほうを見るんですか  when can we marry and make babies with nozomi
  shes everyones idol anon so those babies wont be yours
  nozomi is everyones idol  tsumugi also loves rei  chika was always the best carmina anyway
  marriage feature that unlocks a unique extra story chapter for each specific girl would be all i could ever ask for but i doubt kmr would commit that much money     if it comes out itll probably be a small stat boost item with two lines of voiced dialogue
  considering you have 8 year old girls present in the game i dont think a marriage system is coming anytime soon you disgusting lolicon
  i think the bigger issue here is that you would also be marrying a llama
  kyaru will pass the law that removes the age of consent
  destiny child  nexon  you are thinking of sinoalice global version is handled by line for whatever reason
im never going back to vg ever again so much shitposting over there
  t christina     hags do not belong in pricunny
what is the verdict on the new christmas limiteds are they esports worthy i know that all halloween versions changed the arena meta in some point ie puddin and horroween terrooo even misaki is useful in all mages lineup because of her buffs but how about chika and kurumi chikas set doesnt look like it has synchronicity with any lineup but i might be wrong
whats destiny childs gameplay like the art looks very good
  autobattle with tap to activate skills   imagine priconne where most of the gameplay comes from teambuilding before the fight except you cant craft characters and need upto 6 dupes to max them out
  i find it hilarious how theyre not even trying to hide the fact that its so heavily loliconoriented now with all the jeers and remarks against old hags and stuff
  its people from here shitposting there
  thats some major bs considering how much actual conversation is taking place here
  shitposting is the main way for slow generals on /vg/ to stay up so dont give that bullshit its just people trying to keep it up by taking the easiest way possible board in general has always had a shitposting problem with every general on there having a high degree of shitposting plus other generals often drop by over there to shitpost if the general comes up while theyre talking about something
    that tap gameplay  but those tits flopping around everywhere  hmm
  little did those shitposters know that by keeping the /vg/ board alive they mitigate all the shitposting off this general whoever thought of moving the board to /jp/ is a genius
  just follow your dick
is there anyway to do the vh boss in less than 3 shots if i dont have skyaru or christina because im stuck running a fucked up team of akari misato kyaru kyouka and yui and it always goes like    round 1 do about 4049 damage no problems  round 2 hit 50 boss goes enraged wipes most of my team but hang on to do about 20 damage  round 3 kill boss
  my christina somehow does no damage to the vh boss what do i need
  makoto jun it seems
  i have no idea but according to the video linked by  jun makoto tomo and yui plus christina can supposedly take him down in 1 hit on full auto at those star/equipment ranks    higher equipment ranks might not work since while that gets you better stats i heard most ranks above 9 slow down how fast you can get out your ubs its a trade off depending on the character
  my 2t setup angry loli pole dancer dumb vampire cockkoro and drunkard
  thanks ill give that a shot summer kokkoro or vanilla flavored also does ilya have to be 5star
  vanillakoro im using 5 vampire so no idea drunkard might be able to keep her alive till pole dance and barrier kick in at lower stars
so ive recently got my hands on a new computer and was wondering if it was possible to copy my install of nox over to this computer without actually making backups using nox itself i could put my drive back in to my old computer and make a backup but itd save me a lot of effort if i could just move the files
  you could try it its not like youd lose something other than time though if you were replacing your pc you should have made backups of your instances and saved them somewhere in advance to save yourself the time never used emulators myself though
i hope i can get her im already feeling the hard burn of missing hshinobu and christina please save me from my suffering ayane
  christina isnt going anywhere she is monthly gacha
  i want ayane more than christina shes cuter than a hag
so whats the story behind puukichi is it a real soul like shinobus dad and miyako some magic power or just an npc that ayane happened to meet
  the genius part is that the guy who made it here is one of the people shitposting in the /vg/ general to get people to migrate here the not so genius part is that its lead to more discussion of games other than priconne
  you can set the audio to korean if you want and therell probably be a japanese dub once they release there
  yeah sure /vg/ is a quality board and everyone here is evil masterminds coordinating their efforts together to get you you happy now
whats the next big release
  why would i be happy theres no winning in either scenario either were sharing a general with a bunch of children that are purposefully ruining the containment thread for other games or were not and its only a matter of time before the vg general finally dies for good and they move over here to ruin this general instead
not playing the best mobage from japan
  i wish i was a sailor moon character and got put into tons of silly collabs for longrunning kusoge
  yeah sailor moon is pretty lame but that was last week
  does monstrike have lots of collabs
this is the image i can look at and reassure myself im still nowhere near this level of bad luck whenever ill get shitty bghs rolls this is how true hell looks like
  theres been 8 this year
  gave it a shot your setup works great for the first round doing about 70 damage and then got demolished for the second round because my 4star vampire and loli melt in seconds against the ragemode boss    i can probably 2t it if i start with your team then switch to my team thanks man

  unexpected and based a perfect choujin and his fight against warsman was tight
  its an attempt to flee from shitposting and keep a dead thread alive  while we can mitigate the damage from all the shitposts that have continuously rotted what little community we have its already far too late to escape it    what were experiencing is like a concentrated version of crossboard shitposting given the nature of /vg/ for example instead of people from /v/ or /pol/ shitposting on /a/ with their memes we have people from /fgog/ or /gbfg/ post english release shitposting on /mbgg/
  you dont have the old badluck image
  did a straight copy of my nox folder and it seems to have worked just fine surprisingly saves me the pain of having to plug my drive into my old pc plug everything into that again and backing up my nox instances
  make sure to bind your accounts and shit now in case you lose them
  its /padg/ shitposting  as soon as that thread died we started to have problems  games with smaller player bases started to get run out of the thread by rampant shitposting  any game that gained popularity was met with when will x get its own thread and then later just making new threads in order to fracture /mbgg/  whining about eop despite the fact that en and jp/kr/cn games had coexisted for years just fine  even the games that had moderate discussion and were keeping the thread alive with more than just bumps were met with shitposting  a few dedicated shitposters decided nobody could talk about any game they didnt like and they didnt like any game    as someone who has been here since /tbg/ it makes me sad to see the state its in now  50 posts of bro and gookshit/chinkshit/japshit/eop for every one post about a game from somebody who clearly isnt aware that theyre posting in a fecal corpse of a thread
  ive had everything bound or linked so i wasnt at risk in that regard itd be annoying having to redownload 50gb of games and their settings though so this is just a massive convenience for me
  im amused at how some posters said they didnt want to come here because they were afraid everyone would shit on nonjapanese games and now that thread is just shitting on nonjapanese games the shitposters probably read his posts and granted his wish
  always baffles me how stuff like monser strike manages to gross so high when i never hear or see that shit on twitter meanwhile fgo wont stop popping up on my trending list or feed with 50k retweets for mediocre fanart just because it features fateshit
  its /padg/  fuck off its you
  its really fucking popular in japan all ages and both genders are playing it meanwhile something like fgo is probably mainly men and most of them adults
  for me its romancing saga reuniverse on the 6th
  blade  soul in 200019
  its fun alright but the gacha there in particular makes me rage quit a lot and often
  you just gotta only pull on the 12 gachas at first to get a good number of useful characters they also added a monster rental system where you can borrow one monster from another player but you have to be physically near them to borrow it great if you have two accounts or a gambling addict near you
priconne is a top 5 finalist in the google play vote
  rip guarantees  every time im rolling for kokomi its always her 3star running in last

  only 5 rolls  pffft thats nothing at least post the nozomi birthday classic if you want old stuff i mean i see what youre getting at with those dupes but the point was rolling way more that than imagine spending a truckload of gems reaching the end of scampoints but still not getting that one card you wanted the most furthermore this happens not once but twice in a row
  it deserves to win for the production values alone
please make bread this time before kyaru gets another op
  what if i want a kyaru op
  isnt it too soon to be talking about new bread last time the old thread was still up for hours after the new one was made i think people are underestimating how slow its here    also kyaru a cute
  yeah just have to wait for page 10
how to teambuild in priconne  i luckshat most of the broken characters ilya skyaru christi jun makoto kyouka chika but i still feel like a weak casual
  pdps core is usually jun/makoto/kaori/christina then a healer like skokko if you need her or just another dps like tomo or stamaki    magic core is skyaru/kyouka/akari with other things depending on what you need but its usually skyaru/kyouka/akari/monica/tank
/vg/ thread died again
  were already in page 9 and considering this thread only got made when it was the last post on the board i felt it needed to be said ahead of time    strong characters are only strong because of debuff effects do not underestimate the power of magical/physical defence down on enemies it makes a huge improvement in your overall damage most generic setups are makoto/kaori/mitsuki/whatever/whatever you can throw christina in there along with jun for example and youd be getting at least 12m per fight in cbs extremely easily     similarly it functions the same for magic youd want skyaru/kyouka/akari/whatever/whatever where you can slot in ilya and shizuru for example since shizuru can tank and also heal ilya at the same time thus stopping her from critting herself to death similarly that can also bring you 12m per fight in cbs too just play around to the bosses mechanics and see what works the cb we just had for example had a boss that pretty much did zero damage so you could shift out shizuru for misato who provides sustain for ilya while also providing a magic damage buff
  waiting someone to make a new one
  just let it die
  this thread only got made when it was the last post on the board  was it i swear there were still some other threads to die off first anyway i dont think anything would be wrong even if new thread got made only after current one 404s its not like there are longwinded discussions that would get cut off or something seems like page 10 is irrationally scary for some but the thread can stay up for hours even on page 10    in any case if you dont want a particular girl as the op picture and wont be able to make the thread yourself you could always post a suggestion for someone else who ends up making it to copy
  do you thing dc global will be big enough to get its own thread
5/5 eye hearts from level 2  4/5 eye hearts from level 1  3/3 on ilya kyouka and arisa hm  its a hot period lads go spend your crystals
  shill it on the big english mobage threads and find out but the guys that desperately want the /vg/ thread to live will tell you to be the viagra the thread needs so they can get it up and keep it up
  that doesnt sound good
we hit page 10 so i made the new one here    
  destiny child has barely any advertising outside the shillers regardless i think dc will be able to survive for a couple of threads

  with the amount of falseflagging shitposting that happens here lately im not sure people would know what sarcasm looks like anymore  just thought to make it clear that im mocking the first poster of the reply chain

    holy fuck shes cute
  i would gladly take it as long as it belongs to grandma
  dont be greedy youd have to share it with fellow rinfam
to the guy who asked if id been keeping up with the cute ayys activity on line she had been participating in a contest on the platform ranked by donations she had an early lead in first and eventually fell back to second for most of it i think second still got the prize or a prize her more dedicated followers just propelled her to first with only half an hour to go by a huge margin and shes over the moon    dont know if shell keep using the platform much after the contest but shes been doing singing streams on it which i imagine are easier to get away with off youtube
    dont look right without the ears
  i see thanks for the background gotta watch all those lives later

  you ready for hinako to be last again    ironically she probably would be the best wife can cook sensitive but still down to てい てい
  that was fast
  i still love deat but i dont get his program thingy  i thought the one  thing that hindered vtubers to do 3d isnt the software but the money/creative bancruptcy/lack of interest
  anon i think you may have stumbled upon something there it would be amazing to see fanart of this
  that deer reminds me of lucky star
  tits not big enough no shot of the massive bulge in her pants expression too kind and lovely looking should be smug or mean get this amateur shit out of here
          shes stolen my heart and my dick
  dumb bear and ichika can also cook and dumb bear will get votes from that because she has been doing a lot of cooking streams lately im betting kuromu will gain more votes this time just because of the recent singing stream she did i think it will be just a repeat of the last time
  he actually uses an arcane complicated setup of six voicechangers two phasers and an old 50s spring reverb
  im excited to see ichika get 1 by a landslide in that one question you know the one
  why cant we be this pure
  were purer then 2ch because were not the ones whose going to be drawing porn of this since our only drawfags left months ago
  i wish they actually drew porn
  they do its generally just untagged or posted on certain threads
  that design is just perfect for her we are all the marginal otaku now
how do i become a chad like haruto tenkaiji baacharu and hajime
  i expect ichika and hinako to do a lot better because of the ng stream since its the biggest animare moment yet all of the other members except haneru too since theyre better known now
  step 1 be japanese

  sorry bro youre hetero now drink some tap water that might fix your problem
rins pubg password theme today was foods it was probably inevitable that someone finally managed to guess a password before she shared it    but still  what a shot in the dark
  he
  just watch out for her guillotine
  the software he created apparently has a more intuitive interface is less expensive and more affordable that explains why for eilene took it so much time to create videos despite having the models already done probably other professional software is too expensive and demand more powerful computers i suspect this is why nijisanji was able to took over the livers dont need a powerful machine to move their avatars
i need to tell my secret crush aoi that i love her
  the livers dont need a powerful machine to move their avatars  niijianji app barely moves at all and noerratic spastic movements dont count
  rin
mea had two pairs of large mens sweatpants on her amazon wishlist this morning but now theyre gone
  virtualcast is free though
  deats one is free too     
  niijianji app barely moves at all and noerratic spastic movements dont count  thats my point you dingus
  what is preventing you from doing it
  do you know the software equipment requirements for virtual cast
  a less expensive kind of free
  nope
  you know thats what i meantwith the main factors of not being 3d are money and other complacent stuff not the software  like everybody wants to upgrade stuff and if they dont have the money for a pc they dont have the money for a vive and if that doesnt stops them then they would do fine without those
  the main factors of not being 3d are money and other complacent stuff  again thats my point you dingus
  sorry but i love her more
  it might be the point but it doesnt quite stands knowing many vtubers that cut corners in regards of performance and do just fine you can even count nijisanjis if you want to
  how can two perfect things be in the same picture how can you do it
  what was it cant remember her talking about her favorite foods
  aoi is not flat delete this
  if more affordable and cheaper technology appears they wont have any excuse to be a limited 2d avatar
  no you ding us retard learn to reading comprehendsion
  why spend more if the cash keeps flowing in regardless
  why do you care you dont even know japanese
  yeah thats not even remotely true but youre free to be retarded anyways making a quality 2d avatar is leagues easier then making a quality 3d model kaijis not lacking in money or the means to get a good model but anyone with a functioning pair of eyes can tell you theres a noticable quality dip from 3d to 2d there will always be a gap there regardless of affordable or cheaper technology
hi /jp/ i have been away for several months is tokino sora still relevant
  i guess well see that they still need to learn how to make a model or well see more literal generics  or well start involving comissioning pro modelers and its the money issue all over again
  comprehendsion  whatever you dingus
  from 3d to 2d  from 2d to 3d rather but you get my point not like the dimensions of chuubas have mattered since the christmas miracle though not even sure what arguments being made    no but her cute kouhai roboco has a big heart and an even bigger ass
  are you going to popup every couple of months to ask this question
      the absolute state of mitofans even if there are affordable ways for the 2d to transition into 3d functional avatars its not good enough they must stay as a limited 2d avatar
  the password was just raisu    earlier passwords were also raw ingredients
  is tokino sora still relevant  now there are lewds of her like her being pounded in the ass and getting bukkake by several faceless men
  not suspicious at all
  mito is 3d though i dont understand whats the point of pretending to like vtubers when you cant even watch them
  you see mito literally has been using about three different 3d models and 2d is still enough  you sure roll that line as an insult but it really shows how little attention some people pays to 2ds potential to get things done
  im not against making chuubas 3d and a jump from 2d to 3d isnt always bad like how dotlives models are pretty good but trying to say 3d will become easier to make then 2d at some point is functionally retarded the extra dimension adds more complexity then most 4chan posters can comprehend it costs more it takes longer its going to have glitches theres a certain level of quality you cant reach without good pcs etc etc    3ds fine 2ds fine no idea why theres a tribal war being held nor am i even sure what the other anon was trying to argue since i just jumped into this discussion 5 minutes ago
  sauce
  is she cheating or its just another one playing 
  you have a good memory
  go to /h/
  yes
  isnt she still using her 2d model most of the time
  not a cheatercatfag but i dont see whats weird about the first three matches ones an afk match the other was probably a bad drop and the bottom most one was probably just a bad match course she still cheats but this is the wrong way to prove it
  why would she not use it sometimes you dont wanna jump around and see what you can do in 45 seconds pretty much every 3d chuuba who started 2d even excluding nijisans are like that with the exception of dotlive and anons ayylmao
  you called
  please do not disgrace my producer with these heretical imagerys delete this post haste desu wa
  nani
  how can something this cute even exist
  aoi looks pretty flat to me
ok i guess shes actually giving out riddlelike hints to the password two people guessed it this time  and people that guess it get to be on her team
  who would team with short hair rin  bring back long hair rin 
  this isnt how you get your new queen to lock you up in her dungeon
  mito is 3d though  imagine if nijisanji got the tools and resources to create an affordable 3d model of her since the beginning instead of shilling the 2d app    how little attention some people pays to 2ds potential to get things done  potential wasted on a limited 2d model    it costs more it takes longer its going to have glitches theres a certain level of quality you cant reach without good pcs  my point is those things are going away theres no excuse if you stay 2d is because youre doing it on purpose and its your main feature like dots gorgeous animations even mito peanutskun and ponpoko all of them become 3d
  intentionallymissingthepointpng
  as i said well see  for now making 3d more affordable just looks like making a product without audience
  my point is those things are going away  oh really didnt know you found a way to speed up the process of model creation to the point where now its easier to create a model then draw a picture youre retarded but im more retarded for replying to you in the first place shame on us both i guess
  have you considered transitioning into a functional human being
aichan should make a video demanding all vtuber fans to subscribe to pewdiepie
this is my pixelated daughter please say something nice about her
  didnt know you found a way to speed up the process of model creation to the point where now its easier to create a model then draw a picture   vroid or vkatsu are faster and easier than drawing
  youre saying those things are costly im saying there wont be in the near future why stay as a 2d even then    a product without audience  do you think    oh really didnt know you found a way to speed up the process of model creation to the point where now its easier to create a model then draw a picture  many of you were messing around already with a 3d character creator    have you considering stop being so anal any single time someone dares to criticize your beloved 2d vtubers
  no shit that wasnt my point retard dont call her 3d if shes still using her 2d model most of the time until they make a full transition like lives theyre not really 3d
  you should know that the quickest way to win an internet argument is to change your opponents words into ones that are more convenient for you to refute    yes you lost by replying to this fucking idiot
oh god theres two of these retards shitposting
  why dont you ask her to do that on her twitter or suggest that to pewdiepie
  i thought 3dfags where the ones shouting effortless every other word and now you tell me vkatsu is acceptable
  3dfags  of course theres 3dhater showing up
  yes you lost by replying to this fucking idiot  is this the new version of no u why the criticism of 2d vtubers is so controversial for you
  i love my sexy daughter dots videos
  vkatsu is acceptable  what is acceptable for you then
  do you think  yeah simply because you dont ever get a cheapskate wanting to use a toaster for vr stuff without having that cheapskate also unable to afford vr gear
  anon please im begging you its been months please dont lewd my innocent daughter
  id put my penis inside her
  no clue maybe blender and unity
  d cup at the very least
  you can be sexy and innocent
  you can unless your name is fujiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  aoi desu
  not sexy  in fact dot is the only pure pink haired girl in this fad
  blender  oh so nekomasu was the 2dhater all along then cant believe he quit being a chuuba just to longcon /jp/ into becoming blenderfags like him
  yeah simply because you dont ever get a cheapskate wanting to use a toaster for vr stuff without having that cheapskate also unable to afford vr gear  even if those things wont be required anymore or they become cheaper what its the incentive to stay 2d unless its deliberate
  im defending 2d though not attacking 3d either
  even if theres in the future a gnu intuitive version of those programs
  showing your midriff is not being pure
  not sexy  very  sexy
  you never loved a 2d girl anon  but seriously if it isnt required then its just the same as a 2d avatar if it becames cheaper its still limited to the individuals creativity  and so far ive not seen many 3d vtubers doing any different than 2d ones any idea of what can they only do on 3d
  dot was engineered to be as sexy as possible shes peek sex appeal
  this is 4channel delete this right fucking now
  this pic is not family friendly delete
  my daughter never took this picture delet
  interact in a 3d enviroment space like the concerts do meet and greets beyond phone calls interact with other 3d avatars in a more organic way
  not everybody is an idol you know
  they are still looking at a flat screen
  accept it 2d is the natural evolution of vys
  kanna _
  thats a different matter altogether anon _
      again this is the absolute state of mitofans thinking that everything they dont like is idolshit but mito and kaede are transitioning into that stop being so attached into the past
  kanna  
  but mito and kaede are transitioning into that  what are you talking about theyre about as idolshit as gorilla is
leaving these threads before shitposting hours and coming back to glance at it leads to a very confusing experience what the fuck is going on here
  then dont day dumb things like meet and greets are things only idols do
  the usual
  some 2d zealots are mad because motion tracking software for 3d models is getting more affordable and cheaper and now theres no excuses to stay 2d and they are mad to the idea as the stubborn hooligans they always are
  what the fuck is your point 3d is still hard and expensive therefore any criticism towards the 2d vtubers of the current scene because 3d is becoming less expensive and hard has no ground  why the fuck are you criticizing them because of a technology that isnt there yet
  makes sense i hope the shitposting ends soon and retards dont go back and forth for another 6 hours like the dayafterpoll thread or do less reading for me
  2d vs 3d memes effectively the free space in the middle of the vtuber thread bingo
  exactly saying anything negative about 2d is anathema
allowing moemi in these threads was a mistake
wait what weeeeebs plz translate
  please stop falseflagging as me
  its called strawmanning when anon invents a hypothetical fictional viewpoint and then attacks it    and thats what you just described
  why the fuck are you criticizing them because of a technology that isnt there yet  see  
  therefore any criticism towards the 2d vtubers of the current scene because 3d is becoming less expensive and hard has no ground  if the 2d is not corporate backed it has sense what you said because they lack the monetary resources but even ene and hebi are doing the effort to transition into 3d so its you defending the stinginess of incompetent executives and producers
  hail rin
  incompetent  more like greedy as fuck
  go away creep
  please dont include my husbands mother into your shitposts shes already abused by him and doesnt need a gaijin who knows nothing like you to hurt her thank you
  aoi is perfect example shes as pure and innocent as an angel but also hot as fuck
  i thought strawmanning is creating a nonsensical caricature of a viewpoint technology getting cheaper and easier to use is not hypothetical its happening right now
  and even in that horrible scenario shes doing everything to create a 3d model of herself
  he doesnt know heh
  greediness is a form of incompetence
  gamebu are idols because they did a meet and greet with their fans are the vtubers on the youtubar idols because they interacted with their fans
  you dont follow ene do you anon
  he keeps just keeps digging
rrin
  neither do you
    i wanna meet and greet my mommy shiros womb
    please dont use my daughter siro for your horrible shitposts thanks
  youre still straw manning and not saying what your point is even though the technology is improving its still not here what the fuck is this even  youre saying those things are costly im saying there wont be in the near future why stay as a 2d even then    youre literally angry at them because theyre not doing something that is expensive and hard now but will become easier and cheaper in the future do you honestly believe this thinking makes sense
  hes autistic please understand
hey theres a hinalove here  wait shes naked  sasuga    okay that was funny
  ksdd strikes again
  rin
can we just take a five minute break from all this shitposting to appreciate how beautiful my daughter aoi is also check out her latest cover video while youre at it         i think it turned out really well ive probably listened to it well over 50 times already
  is still not here  are you for real  deat released the software that make easy for eilene who is cheap and greedy as fuck to motion capture moe and yomemi theres brekel and ipi motion capture    youre literally angry at them  because saying they would transition into 3d in the future easier thanks to the advances on technology is being angry right    youre the one that seems angry and projecting very hard and if you read  which i suppose you dont you could understand my point but because for you talking shit of 2d is an unforgivable sin you need to own me    i understand you it seems you talk from your personal experience as being autistic
  best of comedy
  i agree aoibro aois are the best
  rin
  deat works for eilene
  you should stop anon nijisanjifags are literal cultists worse than the most annoying idolfags theyre never going to accept any criticism no matter how valid or constructive nor will they even consider having a honest and civil debate about this topic its a taboo to say anything remotely negative about 2d or nijisanjis here
  for free might i add
whos the most popular male vtuber amongst women i think its got to be kanaekou seems pretty popular too or at least he has lots of lewds
  what gave you idea that mocap is incredibly expensive and is the only thing preventing vtubers from using 3d models what makes you think deats soft is better than alternatives
  wrong he has to pay eilene to work for him
  ive probably listened to it well over 50 times already  mapledancer is one of my favorite chuuba songs of all time and even then ive barely gotten past a few dozen times in the half a year or so its been around this video came out a few days ago yikes
  ago by far
  he properly pays dont insult eilene
  people shitpost about nijisans all the time though not sure how you samefagging and bringing your retarded friends into a single thread is going to change whats been known for months my advice is if you want to rewrite history pick a chuuba no one talks about and idolfag about her worked well for me
  kizuna ai is genderfluid so he
  wow shes really active on twitter
  eating cheese pizza with cecil
  rin
    there wont be a day in this december when i wont be nutting to that outfit and everything it implies
  what gave you idea that mocap is incredibly expensive and is the only thing preventing vtubers from using 3d models  nothing thats my point precisely that is becoming cheaper but this is the excuse mitofans give to justify their attachment and reluctance to admit its becoming easier  what makes you think deats soft is better than alternatives  there will be cheap even free alternatives to deats software but eilenes excuse was albeit having the 3d models long ago he didnt know how to move them aka im too poor to buy commercial software
  cecil is now too busty
  no offense but are you unironically comparing kaede to aoi shes barely better than ai and even that is debatable and the song itself is boring or at least kaedes delivery of it is boring of course you would get tired of it after a few playbacks i could listen to aoi all day and not get enough of it in fact ive been listening to her album since it came every single day and im still not bored of it
  what do you mean im pretty sure people cared about mito before you started idolfagging for her
  mating press cecil on top of that pizza
  i joked about idolfagging for aoi for all of two posts after the midnight stream and some autist actually took me seriously didnt think hed still be doing it weeks later
i fucking love issikis art
  doesnt matter women dont watch vtubers especially not streamers
  todays irony is tomorrows sincerity
  ago and gaku are up there
  im a long time /jp/ poster anon im a simple man who likes trumpets and puns
  isnt nijisanji developing their app to support 3d though theyre greedy sure but whats the point in investing in third party technology if youre already developing your own theyre taking their time on it but theyre progressing towards the 3d you want to see
  youve been falseflagging as aoidolfag for weeks now
gamebu subs to views ratio is really good do the buy views or what
  are you for real  yes even you said   im saying there wont beexpensive in the near future    they are still expensive all the mocap shit is still expensive mainly and not everyone wants to use deats software some of them like nijisanji and live are developing their own software  and yes calling companies greedy and incompetent is being angry first of all you assume that being company backed having lots of money to throw around when we have seen companies that are poor
  nothing thats my point precisely that is becoming cheaper but this is the excuse mitofans give to justify their attachment and reluctance to admit its becoming easier  nothing what your point was that mocap was always cheap how does new software affects anything then do you even have any idea how mocap works  there will be cheap even free alternatives to deats software  its already free shit for brains
  do the buy views  yes from me
  i suppose so its really awkward to say the least    no only the first post or two anything after that has just been some sperg actually legitimately being like that now i know how aifags felt when that one autist joined their ranks
  factually wrong
  sauce
  that is becoming cheaper but this is the excuse mitofans give to justify their attachment and reluctance to admit its becoming easier    youre being retarded its becoming cheaper yes but its still not cheap and nobody is denying that youre being called retarded because youre criticizing them for not doing something that is still not cheap but will become cheaper in the future this is what you yourself are saying
  this post makes you look like a newfag theres been multiple shop polls that show that women watch them and those polls didnt even include the male ones
  if it makes him look like a newfag why are you explaining it to him
  lets hope youre right    so this is strawmanning i said its becoming cheaper becoming cheaper  its already free  no shit sherlock
  
kaiji is the best boy and nothing you said can change my mind
    you think vapid shallow creatures like women would spend hours watching some nerds play video games something that women have zero interest in when theyre not feigning interest in them for money and fame how adorably naive next youll tell me that female vtubers arent massive whores milking their dumb male audience for every single penny
  so youre telling me theres 10k homos watching male vtuber streams at the same time
  thanks anon
  this but unironically
  cheaper than what how expensive it was before what gave you idea that software is the main expense    there will be free alternatives to deats software  no shit sherlock  do you have brain problems
  becoming cheaper yes but its still not cheap  thats my point  youre criticizing them for not doing something that is still not cheap  im saying there wont be excuses in the future for not transitioning into 3d unless like dot you need to be 2d on purpose and again notcorporate vtubers like ponpoko are doing the effort so the problem is a problem of will if the suits say its because its too expensive and buying new equipment cuts my profits all of this could be averted but you defend their greediness and say that i am angry and criticize them
  i wish i was as fit and good at beat saber as ray
  what gave you idea that software is the main expense  theres software that requires motion tracking equipment    now theres motion tracking software that only needs a vr helmet or a kinect
  what do you think
  underrated post
  isnt pizza crazy expensive in japan
  expensive and shitty for the most part
  let me guess youre either italian or new yorker
  more like their views to growth is strange but why would anyone buy views  at least himehina buys ads to this day that adds views and helps growth
  hebi  sorry anon but wrong  shes making the model but shows no interest in hurrying up the process that coming from a vtuber that works in bursts when something gets her interest  shell probably finish it and use it twice and will return to 2d
  i mean ive visited nyc once or twice yeah but aside from that not really ive only had pizza in japan once my experience was pretty bland was like eating rubber
  now so youre trying to say that there was no mocap soft that worked with generic vr equipment before
  not him but new york pizza isnt pizza deep dish or go home
  shes making the model but shows no interest in hurrying up the process  i said shes doing the effort to create one not hurrying to make one
  why are you so worried to cherry pick anything i said to own me kurumi used kinect motion capture to make her videos but nijisanji cant it tells you very well the problem a problem of greediness laziness and lack of will something you want to defend
  i also said interest  call it a trial period that in the end didnt catch her and many other vtubers because 3d isnt either for everyone nor exactly better than 2d
is this the ideal relationship
  what do you mean cherry pick we were talking about deats gamechanging software how is nijisanji related why are you changing the topic
rin live again  
  waiting for hajime to become a virtual father in 9 months
  no but this is
  nobody is defending anyones greediness we know about niji3d for example so whats up with the nijisanji is greedy and mito fans dont want to accept 3d is becoming easy  from here   they should logically be removed from the criticism because they are making the effort so you are shitting in all 2d vtubers that cant make the effort and its not a matter of will like you said its a matter of money  also in case you dont know nijisanji will stay both 2d and 3d      the nijisanji mobile app that is used now will exist as it is and in addition it will have a 3d function  so they do have a legitimate excuse to keep using 2d models
  upvoted
  what is rin singing
      relevant
  concrete road
  we were talking about deats gamechanging software  you forgot to use quotes on  gamechanging software you think im shilling his software while in fact im saying more software like the one he created will be available and easier to use and not even nijisanji and people like you would say 3d is expensive
has the samefag really been going for the past 4 hours now i preferred it when he was flooding
  people sure has been saying 3d is expensive but not on the software end anon
  kurumi looked like crap though nijisanji is supposedly developing an app hey want people to use it has to look somewhat good
  stop evading questions how much does mocap soft costs how is his soft different from alternatives
  whats the software that makes hardware cheap i want that
 anon was talking about it earlier but didnt link it shaking my head desu
aois 1 year anniversary in 5 days how should i celebrate it with her
  donate all your salary to her
  balls deep like the rest of us
  i will always love you
  cum tribute
  nijisanjishill hes here practically all day
  so you are shitting in all 2d vtubers that cant make the effort  on the contrary they are excused because they dont have the resources and even without the lack of money some try to be 3d they are not deterred due to lack of money each situation is particular thats why i said but you understand it as do the effort to become 3d you damn filthy 2d you cannot say the same of corporates they dont have the will  the nijisanji mobile app that is used now will exist as it is and in addition it will have a 3d function  why they arent releasing this since the very beginning  so they do have a legitimate excuse to keep using 2d models  the people voicing the livers yes ichikara no
  theres no nijisanshill anon though youve managed to get some other retards to shitpost just as retardedly as you you shouldva focused on the long con instead
  but not on the software end anon  and the equipment either now that you can use a vrchat helmet and a pc camera to do the motion tracking
  shes currently collabing with some mobage along with aoi  that game will also collab with kizuna ai in the near future with a little luck they might make a video together like with peanuts
  i wish there was some way to donate the money directly to her account i would do it     you wish nerd
    
  delete this i would never acknowledge anons shitposting about a jav career that never happened
rin has a zoo at her house
  see    cheaper than a whole room and motion tracking suits
  those are just blessed rinfams worthy of being kept in her home
  wow thats expensive so kurumi used something like this for her streams
  nijisanji is supposedly developing an app hey want people to use it has to look somewhat good  why didnt they release the 3d version since the very beginning
  nigger thats not cheap
  kurumi only used a kinect and mmd for her motion capture
this is my husband
  so you dont need expensive software for mocap why is this spreg so obsessed with deats thing then
  nope it was a tracking program for kinect and like  until now they are free software that offer better quality and thats my whole point finally the technology is in the way of catching up with professional products something ichikara is not willing to do
  this is how everyone knows youre the nijisanjishill there are 100 posters in this thread but youre convinced that everyone who calls you out or disagrees with you is the same person
  its about the same price as every other vr i knew about though
  why is this spreg so obsessed with deats thing then  you are the obsessed one because you deliberately dont want to read the part where i said more alternatives like the one created by deat nice strawmanning though you spreg
  this but ironically
  i dont think you realize they wereor still are a small team that didnt expect to make it this big iwanaga said their goal was to hit 1k subs on some of their vtubers why would they invest hard from the beginning
  this but unironically
  this but triple the irony
  why would they invest hard from the beginning  activ8 did it hololive did it appland did it
  this but mercury
  nijisanjishill might as well become a tripfag at this point everyone can tell who he is from his posts and hes just as cancerous
why do you keep replying to the discord crew
  shitposting hours started pretty early today huh
  tripfag  speaking of tripfags does anyone have the link to that one tripfag who made a really confusing and retarded post a while ago i didnt save the warosu thread even though i think that post wasnt saved in it anyways
  thats wrong though hololive is still 2d arent they greedy fuckers according to you by appland you mean shiro or the idolbu shiro was just a side project for a company with a lot of money and the idolbu started as 2d some of them still are 2d what greedy fuckers  and i dont think you know what activ8 is
  when did you say this and once again how is his soft different from alternatives
  this but bulsara
  i honestly think they argue with themselves since its pretty much the same shit almost every thread that its pretty much ritualposting  its either waaaah aichan or waaaaah nijisanji  feels good not having my favorite being shitposted
  all hours are shitpost hours
  means probably sora she was supposed to shill some product and was definitely not a big project
itt anon insists on being retarded once again
  its kind of funny but also bizarre how hard he denies it is it the name he has an issue with or does he seriously believe people cant tell its him
  shiro was just a side project  thats even worse a side project is even more successful than ichikara stop defend that company demand them to improve
  look at the beginning of the thread and say that again
  she was supposed to shill their mocap stuff
  its not anon its deat or comdost
  makes it pretty obvious its the same group of people replying to themselves
  i dont know maybe on  when i wrote  there will be cheap even free alternatives to deats software
  improve your english
  probably the name hes obsessing with more than just nijisanjis from what i have picked up 2dhaterhater is a more accurate name for him
  improve your argumentation skills
  rin
  answer the fucking question
  we wouldnt have this issue if they stopped taking each others bait but i guess theyre addicting to shitposting and arguing
  rin
haha im going to get my buds on discord and were going to pretend to argue with each other to own these nerds
  why would you repost the same shitty fanart  
  sorry
    whats ichikara and what do they do anon      are you seriously comparing them to appland
  perfect fit
  while discordfags are here theyre always here dont assume that the only retards in these threads are from discord its really just a majority of them
  thats the wrong appland
  in terms of effort yes appland did as a side project what ichikara apparently is not able to do that tells you something
  if only certain spreg didnt made the topic of splitting taboo with his shitposting alas
the best way to drive discord fags away is to remind them that eilene is a chinese man and that they donate to him so they can translate his stuff
and we had such a nice thread during tokuban/pokemon tourney
  they dont want their own thread because it would just be the same 57 people posting screenshots and commenting on completely unremarkable things happening on the stream
  if only that work to drive ichikara shills away as well if only
  it was an alright thread but it was filled with shitposting just do what most of the actual posters here are doing which is coming back in a couple of hours or stay and watch a handful of retards falseflag i guess
reminder its always the discord that suggests to split the thread
  but they would be happy with no 2dhater shitting on mito and not making all of us miserable
  spreg didnt made the topic of splitting taboo with his shitposting alas  this is the most esl post i have seen in months
  give it a few hours
  
  that was the ideal thread  anons chatting and having fun with multiple big things at the same time the shitposting didnt happen until hours later
  so you grab your friends on discord to try to shitpost everyone away
  nah even those miserable saps wouldnt be able to bear such a pathetic thread it wouldnt last more than a week before they all would have crawled back here
is it image dumping time lets talk about my cute secret crush
  ill take any discussion over pointless image dumps so why do you have a crush on her and why wont you just tell her
  utako teaches us all about what it means to be a fujoshi you can learn all the lingo here like what an omegaverse is whats a seme and an uke mama will teach you
      wheres derons butt
  show me your best aoi art
  i think she should do less covers even though i love her voice but it can get kinda repetitive
aoi is so hungry after a days hard work that shes even salivating that silly girl
  if i told her it wouldt be a secret crush anymore
  i cant show it here because its too lewd
  its already functional kaedes streamed using it probably in a testing phase though since no one else seems to have it
  stop posting this shitty picture in every thread
  she said shes the only one with it
  figured as much i actually dont generally follow kaede unless she throws a new song on her channel or something but as far as i knew no one else had done anything with it thanks
  rin
  are you surprised that a cringy forced memes vtuber would have a cringy fanbase with forced memes
  very very incredible
  no we have to thank ichikara for not working hard enough
  rin
  you missed a few up there
  rin
  this is one of my favorite ones because i love her bedtime streams the most
i want to a aoi gf so much bros tell me we are going to make it
  i want aoi to sit on my face
  and do what anon
  oh my
  imagine
  me on top
  wrong meme
imagine going to the beach with aoi and watching the sunset with her it would have been pure bliss
  she is unstoppable
  lick her big juicy butt just like kikunojou does every night
  get in line
  i dont want to imagine something like that because itll only make me sad
  imagine holding aois head under the water
  sauce of this picture please

  yeah monomi hares cat surprised her by fucking her from behind suddenly and made her moan
  streaming on top of the washing machine neat
you guys joke but i do believe its possible nijisanji gets an anime one of those 5 mins shorts
  it was her cat
  a short web series could happen if iwanaga decided he wanted to stretch into the unprofitable anime market for no reason i guess
mmd remake of mirai akari has arrived  
  if things keep up gamebu too though i think their videos would be better than an anime
  dont forget to donate to this superchatless handjob maid captain
  1 view  you really should wait a week before posting it like this anon
rin has become a fascist
  gamebu already had an announcement a few months ago that theyre getting a tv anime  im not joking
  no thanks
  anon
  no youre thinking of hime hina
  i think i recall seeing that when they got picked up wfle right
  whats her paizuri like

  nice work but you should rerender the whole thing there are fucked up parts
  watercolor anon
    i remember when threads werent ashamed to make oc seems better than mindless 2d vs 3d arguing
  nothing to do with shame its just a bad idea to upload your video to 4chan when youre the only person whose seen it weve got people here who are weird and will probably stalk that guys accounts or something
  meh typesetting whos sometime isnt centered
reminder that if you didnt vote for charlotte you are personally responsible for making her cry  
  already 1 step ahead
  i like rin
  i didnt vote for anyone did i make everyone cry
  she explicitly said she wasnt crying but her eyes got a bit weird if im hearing it right especially after seeing everyones messages and decided theres no harm being upset over spilled milk    before immediately looking on the flipside and going holy shit the other girls got so high on the rankings what an angel
  this is probably why she wasnt invited to that honeystrap collab and was told the wrong time instead
  charlotte should quit already
  she explicitly said she wasnt crying but her eyes got a bit weird if im hearing it right    no she says tears and then corrects herself to say a mysterious liquid came out of her eyes
  its a bit off center and the font is a bit artifacted but otherwise pretty gud
  theres a difference between getting tearyeyed for a second and crying though either way she made it pretty clear she wasnt very upset by it and instead was elated for the rest of the girls
  ptobably tears of blood signal of an infinite rage
  shes always getting bullied i hope she doesnt quite youtube
  only after consulting nanashi and seeing hinas tweet
  looks like kotobuki yume is backed by yahoo japan
   either way she made it pretty clear she wasnt very upset by it  thats obviously a lie
  shes pretty comfortable with where shes at as a honeystrapfag shes not really bullied much either    well probably i cant read the minds of some foreign speaker who i only get to watch a couple hours of a week its probably frustrating but its probably not to a degree where its seriously going to be bothering her shes not a competitive type after all
  
  you really need to learn how to save full size images on twitter
  i know how to but if anyone wants to save them on his pc he can just go to the tweet  im clearing up the pics every so often
how can anyone bully this angel demon who would hurt this child
  psst anon look up twitter view original images on google automatically resizes images to fullsize
  does she even get bullied i thought that was mico or even patra
  she doesnt get bullied because she isnt even on the radar too unknown
  oh well thats nice i suppose the few streams ive caught of her were pretty comfy
    not him but why does it matter to you so much are you printing out every fanart
  she said someone submitted a marshmallow making fun of her for not getting ranked
  if hes going to be posting them here then they better be full sized
  because no one likes seeing a lower quality and compressed image keeps people from reposting the same image too or at least usually does saw a few times in the past few threads where the same image with different resizes gets posted it doesnt seriously bother me though
  what difference does it make its not like theyre downsized to ant level seems autistic to get anal about something so trivial
  why dont we just all be low quality garbage then
  go be a retard somewhere else
  i think its more autistic to not be that anon who posted a lower quality picture and defend him for several posts by calling everyone else autistic instead not like people were calling him a giant faggot anyways
feel like im seeing pandi more than i do mari
  well when youre so inferior to yuni its hard to show your face
  whats wrong with the more attractive character slowly becoming the star of the show
  nice try you think you can deflect on me after exposing yourself as autist who gets triggered because of slightly compressed images
  why are you so upset trying to improve the overall quality posted in the thread is somehow the most evil thing to you
  you should probably go to sleep now if you want to catch chuuba streams and still get a good 8 hours of sleep anon instead of shitposting
this is a pic of a chuuba thats dead inside
  her tweet feed is sad as fuck poor kanna
  holy shit how dare you not post a high quality version of this picture you fucking scum
talking of insides

  why arent they 3d i heard its cheaper now
imagine hugging aoi on a warm bed until both fell asleep
  why are you a retard i heard women dont get pregnant while drinking alcohol
  so kotobuki is japanese hoonie
  if you didnt vote  you mean the aichan vote
  hes retired as far i know after comdost used him to get the favor of eilene
why akari won an abema diploma  
  because ai was too busy to receive it
  i thought mito and nijisanji ruled abema
  vtubers won the 2018 internet trend words big prize and she accepted it on behalf of everyone she plans to distribute certificates to other vtubers    it looks like mitos これがバーチャルyoutuberなんだよなぁwas a big part of it
  oh i see
  shes distributing it to other vtubers as an image in that tweet
  thats underwhelming
  very
have you guys watched this vod its crazy how aichan is even cuter than normal when live  
  isnt the whole point of watching vy to watch cute anime girls these guys are ugly as fuck
  well its also a point that theyre cute anime girls you can interact with in this case i guess we are the ugly bastards
   support all the kagayaki stars
  speaking of any vods out of the nobangumi yet
  what about cute anime boys
  they are actually girls god bless
  i suppose youre right
  cute anime boys are fine
  dont call my cool son cute please
  the nobangumi yes the notokuban not that i can find yet

  zombi
  ジャイアン  i cant believe kanaes part of zombikos family now
aqua  
  why zombiko lost an eye
  humans always those fucking humans
  aqua surprised and upset that there isnt a ground pound to get the leaf in the first level
  how is she so terrible at mario
  
  im suprised at how these people are invested on giving her arc episodes
aqua is godawful at mario3 and she has 1k people watching her
  i want to make love to her breast pussy so bad
  this is difficult to watch
  a similar thing happened with kanae and him struggling through parts of windwaker but it wasnt this bad
akunetty  
why is youtube so shit at reporting when theres a live stream
  why is maimoto so cute
  i thought we agreed not to post unpure girls anymore
  i dont know any of them but the cow
  i want to do more than just hugging but only after we get married with her fathers permission of course until then i guess cuddling under a single blanket would be pretty cute and nice
  but that means not posting any single vtuber at all
  used goods
  thank you akunettyposter
  fuck off synchro
aqua has figured out quick saves so shell finally get passed 12
  aoi would be safe
  they only care for you to watch the nbc cnn and colbert unfunny jokes
  aoi would be safe  
  males are okay because only virgins would be a baacharu yuuchuuba
  that was rude and uncalled
  explain horsep then
  because only virgins would be a baacharu yuuchuuba  male vtubers are ikemen drowning on pussy

aqua is save scumming like crazy
  my expectations arent high so i wont be disappointed also fuck that shrimp
fairys no  
  he would be so much hotter if the avatar was a trap the pink hair is already halfways to discount astolfo all you would need to do is make it flat
aqua
  traps are gay anon
  it was her cat
  fairys yes
  traps  shit taste see pic   wheres the tomboy vtubers this scene seriously needs more of em but i guess i shouldnt expect much since japs have shit taste and hate anyone that isnt a fair maiden
  imagine being this gay
  rude but true
  shut up ferro
  not everybody is a fan of noracat like you homo
  is rin the only one interested in men its like everyone else in the scene is a lesbian
  
  hes good
  well the two onee and ene are craving hajimes dick and the lolis wanting her cherries to be popped by touya
  homosexuality sells
hoonies friend usamimi  
  she collabs with lots of people but dont gain subs but that fucking luck cat dont do shit and always get 1subs fucking unfair
  if youre going to push your unfunny crossout meme then im going to push mine
  it didnt work back then what it makes you think this forced meme of yours is going to work this time
  i dont understand this
sora wants masters cock  
  he tried to compare aifags with the /pol/ npc meme all of that because luna is not as active as she was
this shit is dead on arrival isnt  
  she wants his meat  
  shes a slut since the very beginning the only acting professional in the exchange is achan
  yep they arrived too late into the party now nijisanji owns the fad with its excess of supply
  i want to eat achans vegetable  
  achan can eat my eggplant
    whos the artist devoted to draw achans lewds
 mea
  hownewru
  is this kof
  i dont know who he is link me to his twitter or his pixiv please

yomemi  325146 人  611    hh  281009 人  1934    at this pace it will take more than a more for hina to dethrone yomemi  will they be able to  sustain the momentum

kouhai  
  i wish we had a uniqlo where i live
  /jp/ doesnt care about her though she still hasnt gotten her op
    カウントダウンアズリム 28 days left uniqlo sen pie i am always indebted to you ๑   ㅁ  hints   sen pie
  she lost my support the moment she put shoes on
mico had 0 viewers on her livestream
even though i bought the cats new clothes   wheres honeystraps new clothes  maybe one day mico
its always weird when a random vtuber follows you for no reason
  the kuzuha is very un4channelsafe delet
  is ene sharing lewd fanart of herself safe for 4channel
  thats safe but the diabetes isnt
3 hours remaining  the pressure is on will she brake down on stage after making a mistake
  its probably just a bot
reminder that girls peak in fertility at the age hibiki ao is currently at
  im not a fan of public executions
is mea depressing she seem like the type to mask her depression by trying to draw attention to herself
  shes fun to watch when shes actually being active doubly so fun to watch when shes collabing with people who bounce well off her hal kusomegane kuromu aqua to name a few but recently shes apparently been a bit depressing to watch havent watched her recently for no particular reason anyways
 neru
  its like an entirely different game when she plays it
  shes trying to make people feel sorry for her if it isnt already obvious enough
  did she just make her pikachu evolve  hahaha
  its something else alright
  it was a wild one for trade bait
why did kaiji ban the partner eevee and pikachu from the tournament i know that in the original yellow pikachu had the light ball that gave him higher special than a zapdos but he was still very frail and that used his item slot is he that much stronger in this and what about eevee
  because they have stronger stats and better moves or something
  post it anyway
  yellow  item slot  lets go  item slot
  partner eevee alone is one of the better mons in the game because of its unique moves that are attacking moves that also have a 100 burn/100 paralyze/sets up screens/leech seeds/heals your whole team of status effects and shit
  god theyre both adorable
yo  
  long hair makes everything better
  i cant wait to see long haired himas kneeling christmas outfit its a good time to be marginal otaku

    o ha ku zu
  おはチャーハン
  see for yourself    bonus video  
  チャーハンどこ
please help out a niwaka here  where are the vtuber lewds on futaba theres barely anything on the vtuber board
chahansan is so fucking cool much better then that kusodaifuku
150しぃしぃ  shiishiis chat is so fucking stupid but i cant stop laughing at this
  theyre just randomly posted aside from that board theres often a general in the may 二次元裏 board
harukasu needs to be raped by all gamebu members desu

rine  
enogu  
  now 
  this isnt accurate this pretends that shiina was actually remorseful when that happened but she was laughing the whole time even when apologizing
  thanks for the link found robocos side of it too poor robutto 
  how can rin afford to live in such nice house
  information high alone pays the rent
kanna 
 kiiiiiiiiiiiiitsune collab   oneechan   rantarou    mary
  shes gonna play switch with a goddess
pet on a plane  
  kiiiiiiiiiiiiitsune collab  was planning to watch it but i guess ill watch kanna for half an hour and then switch to mito since it has less chances than hololives collab to stay uncut in the archive
  also unless kanna/shishi/okome are really disconnected with their higherups i dont think thats theyll be graduating soon guess it really was idolish public stunt to try to get more viewers
    can this middle aged woman actually cook or is she just pretending to be housewife material
  what everything is pointing to them graduating and if this is a publicity stunt its a pretty stupid one nobody wants to watch someone forced to be an idol and do something totally different from what theyre known for
golshi    
i wonder how sora feels she came into this market getting the money from idolfags made a subgroup that was meant to make her even more money at the cost of her relevancy even achan is more relevant that sora now i guess if the pays good and you never cared that much for the job its not bad for her
  im basing this on her interation with matsuri and from the way it sounds their performance was considered to be successful
  shes pretending to be your mom
shion is a fucking pervert who wants to look at naked men
  i hope it wasnt considered successful enough for other people to pull this shit its stressful for the chuubas and puts them in a worse light
its time  
  did she reach the chinchin part in this
  she ignored them
  i think she passed it and didnt notice it
  i wish she was
  darn i want a rin mommy she would cook food for me and then take care of my other needs
neru and the nudist are going to be joining ahogao
  the tittybat isnt able to join or i missed her name but mea managed to get in
not thirsty at all
shibuya cafe  
my fat wife is live  
    new detroit video from ai havent seen it yet but were very close to the end
 vic   eli   comfy drake
jumpu    mito
  only 13k watching mito is fucking finished
  why crying girls are so boner inducing
  peace was never an option  well it was but aichan fucked up so it cant be helped now at least it makes things more interesting
  i havent watched any of this playthrough what was ais reaction to alice being a robot all along i remember that bothering the shit out of me when i played the game a while back
has saibopapa proved himself a true inabagumi after assassinating hanerus frienemies
anon finally has the power to influence the content of a chuuba and prove that he could do better than the suits the question is what would he do
  jav debut
  i dont watch her and ive seen enough cursed posts of her stream chat that i never will
      what kind of bullshit is that
  va reveal if shes cute
  27 pure skill
  you dont understand you have the power to ban anyone in the chat you can do literally anything until it boosts viewership
  just have to look who follow the facebook page for that
  she hit a 4th one on master too so it was more like 08
she even had the jump on him too thats another inabagumi kicked out
  have to be more specific
  had to be there when it was starting
  was that the first move she made in her battle against master because if so thats technically 4 in a row which is kind of brutally disgusting
  ditch eops replace va
  how about this one
  no but it was the first guillotine she tried against him and it hit even if it was wasted on a substitute
      the fuck is happening here
  seriously whats the point of this
  a onehit ko pincer attack  
  
  shes not the first chuuba to turn to the audience after running out of ideas
  they dont know what theyre doing
    i see
  chancho asmr
  this is the weirdest collab and i cannot wait  i want chancho to learn how to lovingly screech like mugisensei
  mito wants to be the meat in rins hamburger
mito talking about car gps sure is jk
 rion live didnt grab a screenshot but something about the fake pie of the triangle whatever the fuck that means
  nice work anon i hope higher quality scans will be available eventually
  oh its in the thumbnail nice but seriously what the fuck does it mean
  mito is the least convincing jk in the jk gumi with middle aged neet rin in there that quite the feat
  thanks for the work anon better then i couldva done
  nijisanju war fanfic thats happenning in fubuki city
  nice try rinfam
  wait yuzus in the same city as the other mythical nijisans never knew that
  i remember when people thought she was as old as rin before they found out she was the youngest her personality and tastes are just weird
rantarous team was the first eliminated and died in a brutal way
  actually after listining for some time it looks like her version pakuri of seihai sensou but theyre fighting for triangle chocopie
  people thought she was as old as rin maybe before people realized rin was in her late thirties i guess
  i mean thats a pretty worthy cause to die for
  berserrikiichiｗｗｗｗ
pure and blessed
some very embarrassing results
  its a good thing maids dont need to be able to do math huh
  also a repost
  so haato is the smartest huh
  repost    you shouldnt use words you dont understand
  thats aki not haato
  whatever i dont even know their names and they look kinda similar anyway
        when will you idiots learn your place
aozoraniki haneru_love saibopapa all pitted against eachother inabagumi shouldnt fight eachother
  fuck off iwanaga
  i think it was something along the lines of   eh eh ehhhh   aaaa aaaaaah
 wrench with seeds   tama arrested for indecent exposure   debiyuzu   seedsgod
  that was about a cinderella girls themed car gps  its like youve never heard of a animethemed car gps before
  did vic get a va for his stand user i dont remember her having a voice
  suits humiliating and punishing the va for their own mistakes typical japanese practice
winks paki is live  
  thats about as boring as i expected i suppose i wont blame her entirely for it im pretty sure the cages bullshit doesnt translate well to other languages so benefit of the doubt and all that
  getting help from expert on the subject
  what are you on
 meika   hinamanko   yuuko 20   patra mindbreak
  i dont know why you would think
  is there anyone else more into fate then ikasumi i dont watch her a lot but from the bits ive seen shes even deeper then moira stays awake for 5 hours to get daily rolls moimoi
  dunno but i guess rion was limited to seeds members anyway
  fubukis fairly addicted to fgo though she doesnt actually bring it up all that often
  why it was always pretty obvious shes young due to how childish and immature she is
  i wanna do haram things with her
  sorry i meant within nijisan though fubuki is probably twice as deep into it as anyone else really
rinfam show their dedication once again      over 100 hamburg steaks were made this evening in the name of rin several using the same toothpick saved from that one cafe event
  several using the same toothpick  yuck
  cringe
  disgusting
  did fubuki ever took part in one of these test  i feel like she might be the smartest hololive
  the only niku i want to see from rinfams are kinniku
  looks like this time i wont be spending christmas alone
camomi birthday  
patras screeches are giving me life
  ive heard that cat story a million times but i still dont know where its from
  how long before anons fat wife is forced into milf jav
  she just called up mary to support her through these trying times and the first thing mary did was groan like a zombie
  livestream her reverse mating press konkon and giving out handjos
  this would unironically save her channel
  those guys should get a nonvirtual girlfriend asap
  fuck off shinzo abe
  you dont wanna know
  from these threads
  how about you kill yourself asap
  why
  from 5ch
  i can only begin to imagine how much rin is going to make in superchat dosh on christmas from all the rinfam giving her a christmas gift
  maybe like three dollars after iwanagas cut
kazas new outfit  
  damn  i was going to spend christmas with my family
  now youll spend it with your rinfamily
  i can only imagine how much that envious shitposter is going to bitch about it
  cute as always
  makes her own cake    is it even edible
  best nijisanji loli
patra is cute and all but who in their right mind told her to play the evil within
  whats the problem
  its pretty cute    i believe she wanted to play a horror game to try and overcome a weakness of hers it was mentioned in some stream a while ago
  made for savage headpats
  i wanna cum on her forehead
  looking like a cheese for now
  that was an incredibly cute iyada what the fuck
  maimoto harem
    that outfits well put together
  how does this chad do it
i didnt realize how much art sakis mama draws of her must really love gyarus
  theres something adorable about a poor guy trying to manage a group of wild beasts
  sakis mama is saki
  my favorite series always entertaining
does patra not know she can level up in this game
    himehina minecraft
  i read that as himawari at first
oh my god patras crying
  how is that possible
patra legit sounds terrified of the game i cant watch anymore 
mary hopped into a discord call with patra without her knowing i think and started making creepy noises after she died freaking her out even further sasuga mary oneesama
  so even hh fell for basedcraft meme thats how you know theyve run out of ideas
  and then mary wonders why they pick on her
  the same way martys his own grandpa
  please they poke fun at everyone mostly patra thats what close friends do after all
  friends dont let friends make kanikama abominations
charlotte  
 sharukura
  its called acting how do people like you even remember to breathe
      imagelimit
  friends let friends make terrible mistakes so you can poke fun at them about it until the end of days    this but ironically
  why are you here
  wow this is the first time in god knows how long when weve had just one fucking new thread aside from that one thread where anon just made a thread to piss off jannies minutes after another thread i guess
  not him but that crying sounded fake as fuck  i seriously doubt the whole scene wasnt scripted
  well its early morning here in burgerland so most shitposters i presume are either at work or at class im about to leave for class myself im just lucky to catch the thread about to end
  basedcraft  whats that
  obviously she was playing it up near the end but the shock was definitely real unless youre some kind of autist who believes any outwards displays of any kind of emotions are faked i guess
  i didnt even notice we were so close to imagelimit looks like nijishill already had his op prepared and was furiously spamming f5 in wait of the imagelimit i guess ill let him have his op this once if that keeps him tranquillized and happy for a day
  patras not a nijisan 2dhater glad you didnt notice though
  what does patra have to do with the nijisanji op anyway you have finally have your op lets have a peaceful thread for once
  nope
  being an idolfag is not healthy
  wow this is the first time in god knows how long when weve had just one fucking new thread  the day before yesterday we had just one new thread as well
  that and the seeds stream are going to be great

  momoe  soyo  fucking 1v1 me irl
  yuzumi best hips in the game shintani
  true
look at how hot momoe is despite her jaw and teeth  look at how hot soyo is with her perfectly shaped body and pale skin  look at how hot tsugu is with her pale tight body  look at how hot kano is with her super muscular thicc body    when they graduate the photo book is going to sell best of all times they better include some very revealing shots to make it worth this is the best generation since hana moa and yui
  beautifully said anon
  whats wrong with momoes jaw and teeth
  whats wrong with momoes jaws  my dicks not in it
  she is missing a tooth so her remaining teeth filled the gap and are now uneven
  thats easily resolved with orthodontics treatment if they could fix suzukas teeth and yuis lower teeth and mikis teeth theres nothing they cant fix
  yuis lower teeth  never noticed any pics
    photo from either late 2014 or mid 2015 she had two lower premolars pulled in either late 2015 or early 2016 and the upper and lower teeth were all straightened by tokyo dome
      pulled teeth photo
    
    thanks
          some of her face puffiness can be explained by wisdom teeth removal and other dental and orthodontics work she received mid 2016 until her disappearance
tsugumi has got me hard again
  then shell better finish what shes started
  she teases me anon

  if you want good fakes do some research and find me on twitter
more soyo tik tok upskirt teasing please
  i dont remember this camera angle from freshis this like a super subscriber special only
sure is quiet in here
  hello yume
  why hello there little girl it seems you got lost on your way from school dont worry ill guide you home where do you live dear oh i know where that is get in my car ill drive you there then i can also show your my favorite scarf that has a really cute smell to it
  i hope that scarf is an sg scarf
  my favorite scarf that has a really cute smell to it  chloroform
  oh come the fuck on
  just when you thought bmsg couldnt get more creepy
  im not going with you you smell like piss
      a clear joke  settle down lads
  its kinda sad to realize this cutie will soon grow up and enjoy lewd things such a sex
  you fuckers hated the reddit fags for stalking yui but now you are coming up with abduction scenarios with a 11 year old girl that will likely end if this thread is anything to go by with rape     i know they are very different things but come on
  it was honestly one of the best posts of the day mate
  the man was joking theres a world of difference between thought and action big brother kun
  i know they are very different things  then why do you put them on the same level fuck off idiot its a dumb joke most of us wouldnt even dare interact with gakus
  projecting much i read a nice story of a man helping out a girl in need even allowing her to smell on his favorite piece of clothing to calm her down we all know how kids like to hold plushies or blankets and smell them as its soothing to them the bad things only happen in your head
  well if you put it like that
  watch your language or ill have to give you a timeout bucko
  im sorry dad please forgive me dont get the belt
girl smell
  yumes gun is loaded with darts containing elephant doses of chemical castration compounds dont lewd the babies guys or lose your ability to lewd at all   she protec
  yume is a natural born gaku
    yume is gonna be such a good talk chairperson
  momoe makes me imagine very bad things and i feel so ashamed
  tell us more anon
  wtf aiko is getting uglier
  aiko is growing each and every day and she has prime place in my list of gakus to jerk over
  shes cute but that hair cut doesnt suit her and i like short hair girls
  i liked it more longer but aiko is still aiko and i love aiko
in a perfect world koba would free moa from bm48 and its epic buttrock so that she could instead go full idol but still under the babymetal brand and image like what it used to be just cute girls dressed cute and dancing cute but also a bit metal/goth and not too much like what pikarin does
  in a perfect world she will be in my bed and you will never see her again until i make a sex tape and sell it to horny old japanese men who may or may not leak it
  good talk chairman
  she is good with her mouth for sure
why is he so transparent
gap
  gay and proud
fucking degenerates why dont you stick to lewding actual women i hate you pedofats
  easily the two most attractive stillactive gakus
  its sad to see that iidas post usually get no more than 300likes on twitter but when she post something about a gaku her likes up to 1000
  300 likes is still a solid number
    solid for a failed actress
    it really sucks because shes an amazing singer even better than hinata imo
  failed    a little early to be calling that
  beautiful women theyd never come close to me and i love them
  blame the fag who deleted my post about having hana in all sex positions
  shed be a lot more popular if shed just drop that japanese mom haircut she insists on wearing she should go back to the style she has in that momoko picture and not hide her beauty behind a bowl cut
  damn even hana looks mediocre besides goddess moa
  how they look like when they about to jump you and taking turns to milk you for the night
  what is wrong with you
  hanaclaw     same for gakuinsai picture
  they genuinely enjoy flat mediocres dont even question it we live in a world where people have foot fetishes
  also the only cute gaku since ooga and kano
  i dont get it people are saying stop lewding underage gakus but this  anon says otherwise   either go back to plebbit if you dont like it here or get with the times
  its fine to lewd their adult versions that photo is when they were 1314
  theres nothing wrong with what he said atleast these girls are of age
im liking the hd posting of moa itt
  made me chuckle
  what does the shirt mean
  post feet
  no shit moa is indisputable perfection yui could not even keep up with moas gifted genetics
  looks like it says bit by love
  oooohhh aaaahhhh    mmmm yeeeaaahhh
  lmao if you wouldnt enjoy getting milked by eager 1415 moa and hana taking turns then youre just gay
  not everybody is as sick as you
  this is fact and should set as an example of a quality post
  you dont need to be pedo to recognize when girls develop healthy physical traits that are meant to appeal to normal heterosexual men look at those legs fuck
  nobody said that you went fullon pornographic with your imagination and attraction if amuse wanted to whore out its girls it could very well do that but they dont
  
  actually im another guy jumping in and stirring the pot
uh oh we got a moa thread going again
  this nigga  called moa perfection gotta back up the bro
everything about her is perfection
  indeed she had to have been made in a lab or something pretty face body so on point anime girl personality unreal
  the fact that she herself is a total weeb is just bonus     she definitely has some nonjapanese mix in her dna that brown hair and proper teeth and perfect physique is a rarity in japan
yeah there might some other mix in her all i know is its a perfect blend
  was to 
  message received shes the perfect blend
shes also part penguin d
imagine having to go to high school with someone that drop dead gorgeous wouldnt be able to focus always on your mind she would literally own you
  people were in school with prime yui and people are still in school with megu soyo  i dont know how they survive  you go to class and the prettiest creatures ever are just there
  that was because of that slippery as fuck walkway that su slipped on
moafags are odd creatures
  cant stop loving her always giving 110 overheating and going to hospitals her spirit is too strong
is the moa storm over yet mommy
  they are the absolute silent majority moa is consistently the highest ranked ichiban gaku/graduate across all the different fandom communities in japan and elsewhere
  youll cave too anon resist while you can
  thats because bestmetal is bestmetal
    if there was any pic that showed moas body well enough then id be more into her
miss both their smiling faces 
  the fact that shes this attractive without whoring out her body is one of her redeeming qualities you can already see how good her body is even covered up
  i just want some hana tier moa pics nothing extreme
  youre telling me you cant surmise how hot her body is from photos like this and the knowledge that koba wants them as unsexualized and covered as possible
  you get enough to know how on point her body is
  her gf from jdeez nuts is more interesting to me because we get to see her body
moa will probably be out of babymetal in her early 20s if not sooner by then she will be where ayaka is now it will be so stupid glorious
  the bikinis hot pants and miniskirts are coming as i said in     as for now the perfection we get to enjoy is well enough
  also if you want lewds there have been plenty of those posted here if youve been lurking long enough
  lewds  swimsuit moa is like 8 her hawaii pics are vanilla more than lewd
  you wanted her body not her naked geez
its cambodian orphans remembrance time  everyone please pray for the emblem child moa
  id like more normal non autistic idol like pics from her is all
  thats nice good ass for me to eat
  here a zoophilic guy
  starring at dat ass
  dont you dare call moa racially impure
  tis a good thing in this case
even sexier than her sister
  yeah but yume is fun she belongs to sg her sister belongs to gravure
  not long and yuna will belong to sg too
shiratori    kumamoto kara kita nakami wa kirakira mujaki na tennen musume she is a girl from kumamoto innocent and unworldly    sana shirankoto naiken i know everything in kumamoto dialect    tannin no hanashi wo karei ni suruu shichaimasu she beautifully ignores the words of her homeroom teacher    morisensei shiratori dou shiratori how do you think about it    sana e naniga desuka huh about what         nonaka     ashi wa hayai ga undou shinkei ayashiizo she is a fast runner but its questionable whether she is really an athlete    kokona eh     enryo shinagara okashina jiko shoukai she modestly gives her strange selfintroduction    kokona ware no na wa kokonassu my name is kokonassu in archaic form japanese            nozaki     chicchai karadade hakihaki shabette shikicchau with her tiny body she speaks crisply and controls the situation    yume ah nozaki yume desu im nozaki yume     kossori minna no yakugara kimete asonderu she covertly decides each girls role and have fun     marinchan wa okaasan desho soyochan wa otousan de yuzumin wa petto marinchan is my mom and soyochan is my dad yuzumin is my pet    yuzu petto kai am i a pet

  yumeyunatrainingforfanmeetingsjpg
  thx sempai
  not him but a diamond hiding underneath a pile of dog shit is still mostly dog shit    moa is that diamond but boy did koba really go out of his way to make her as unappealing as possible with the layers of clown outfits and makeup and everything
  mom walks by
  he failed though
based
  savage
  yoyoyouyoo
  topkek
  moas ugliest sakuoutfit or normalclothes pictures is still a million times more appealing than her hottest pic where shes wearing 15 lbs of halloween decorations on stage
  this is some bmsg meme artistry
  is this the next airi
    what needs cropping is sporty mcshoutfuck and his ever growing entourage from oha
  koba deserves a slow death for what he did to these beautiful girls i cannot lewd any of them they mean too much to me i just want to see them happy and successful and out of the sad parody that bm has become i say this as a former bm fanatic
  how tall are mom and dad     maybe a mini model
milliondollar idea babymetal but as a sort of idol group that also mixes pop music and fun  cute aesthetics into its metal    wouldnt that be original and enjoyable
  lame
  already exists its called bonametal
  see babymetal 20102014
         its not so bad
  
      pls stop    koba made her look like the singer from cradle of filth su also looks like a nightmare
    
    its really not so bad  and its probably temporary and given the backlash the
       given the backlash they wont try again
has yui done anything since abandoning babymetal
  they could wear colorful dresses and have fun on stage maybe even appear in their own videos
  no hasnt been seen in public
  theyll make it even worse
      its really not so bad  and its probably temporary    you know its bad and you know koba does whatever he feels is best for babymetal and this isnt going away anytime soon  i see metal but no kawaii      haha thats crazy get out of town you
  yikes that cant be good
they should have stayed like this forever  rip
  thanks yui
yui is fucking sick guys stfu
  black leggings and black skirt    that was the beginning of the end  red skirto and halfclear leggings was peak fun
  peak    post peak    shes fucking dead
run yui run  youre free
  think you meant fucking retired
  what went wrong
  babymetal
  puberty with realization that most of your fan base are questionable creeps
  a single solitary encounter on an airplane with a used toilet paper enthusiast

  i was more confused by the toilet paper thing
sara is cool and v nice and perfect

  i wonder what imposterjpg is up to these days still puts a smile on me face  
  she just cant keep her hands from her kitty naughty girl
you know what i thought hard about it but out of the 80 anime ive already watched i couldnt pick a single person id deem to be waifu i just cant see it picture it or imagine any good candidates for waifu i just cant help shipping them to other characters in shows its like a can see a fine line between me and the anime the line that separates reality from fiction and from this i cant picture anyone wholl fit the bill maybe i havent though hard enough or am thinking way too into it
although the one whod come closest would probably be chiaki from danganronpa 2 although technically that game hasnt been adapted into an anime shes in the danganronpa 3 anime though so get this danganronpa 1 has an anime but they just skipped 2 and made the third which continues the games story and the second game was my favourite of the two 
teens go to

  what was that dream about
smuk baku

baku the faku    i wonder what doremi thinks of her new fanbase  surely she finds the original anons who liked her initially to be more welcomed in her domain
  that title belongs to the fairies
the baku loves the gu

  does it matter its cute
doremy feet

i am grateful for the elevens and their obsession with garments that facilitate paizuri
  i am grateful for the elevens and their obsession with garments that facilitate paizuri  pioneers or not   3d is pd  contacting the police for your rehabilitation for faggotry removal
  a picture in your screen is 2d though
  of a 3dpd whore
  sorry this better
  hai
virgin killer sweater  horizontal paizuri  cat keyhole bra  perpendicular paizuri  open chest sweater  vanilla paizuri    whats next
  open chest sweater  whats this example please
  /jp/ is not /a/ you dumb crossie
  oh nevermind i already knew about it    drats for a moment i was hopeful
  its 2d but that chest is unacceptable
  there needs to be a version of this sweater that covers the middle but shows the cleavage and underboob
  crossie  /a/  do you know where you are
  wait that doesnt exist yet  i couldve sworn i saw something like that before  you mean like center closing in a v shape pointing downard i dont think topside only will work
  how about one with two cutouts one for the bellybutton and one for underboob
  do you know where you are
  yeah /jp/ home to the western fanbase of touhou relative to the location of japan which also happens to be the last and only decent board on this site pre and post split even though it has been plagued by a virus called the accursed 3dpd that sucks its life away even if it serves as a filter that catches most of the fags that arent native to this board if you see it that way to fend them off and away from touhou if the native /jp/s dont bully them off of the board    what else did you expect me to say
  that you are a dumb nerd and /jp/ doesnt care about 2d vs 3d nonsense
  cutout at the cunny for easy access
  but that is where youre wrong fucko  theres a distate for the generals for a reason you delusional echochamber back to your shitty generals and back off into where you came
  mate even as an idol wota immigrant i can tell you that 3d generally isnt appreciated here
not 2hu lol reported
  a 4th dimensional implementation probably
  now they need to improve their girls in order to fill that cleavage
  or they could focus on improving sexbots and vr for the true paizuri experience
  you cant have a true paizure experience if jap girls lacks in tittty meatage
  what about naizuri
  absolutely
  you do realise that garment originated from a chinese website
  naizuri is fine but then again the kind of clothes op posted needs boobage
  it should be bigger i know
    big enough
  shut up virgin
  bigger
  yes
im praying for rain im praying for tidal waves i want to see the ground give way oh please flush it all away
  drowning isnt fun anon  try helium

some day i will clear her stage  i can feel it in my bones every attempt i get closer
nice family
  never give up
you wouldnt splatter the breasts of a goddess with your filthy stinky neet semen right
  i know i wouldnt
cum on her weird tshirt
she speaks in a cutesy way canonically i like that
  why
  nice blog
excuse me who the heck is this
  balls
planet slut has 2 threads
  hecatia is cool cute and passion
  backs shouldnt be this sexual
  your mother is a slut
  hecatia is my mother
  thats not sanae
  how did heca end up in hell in the first place
hecc may have small boobie but she will prank you while grabbing your barely chubby belly
  and thats just back what about the front
  looks more like a sweater than a shirt
i bet heca bullies clownpiece when shes bored
  his mother is sanny thats why hes slandering hecate just carrying out his mothers evil wishes
  celestial avatars are always cute
  celestial slut
backstory
  hecatia is based off the greek cthonic goddess hecate who is also a greek titan who is known for her connections to witchcraft crossroads death and birth in touhou she assisted junko in her attempt at getting revenge on change for her husband houyi shooting out the suns that lit the world and thus made the shadows of the dark which hell draws its power from as a virgin goddess she is notable for being the nurse of the olympians and for having renown for being a goddess who answers prayers and watching over hearth home and children in touhou she is one of the chief gods who is in charge of the administration of hell placing her above even shiki
  wow thanks
  wow i want to take hecas virginity now  also which 2hus are canonically virgin as well
  aunn and the recentlyborn tsukumogamis are obviously virgins unless some drunk person somehow raped them when they were still inanimate objects
tfw no marinka gf
previous 
first for taneda
  thanks anon
  i hate whenever they make her sing she cant sing for shit
  rude
  same i hate that for most seiyuu that cant sing
  shut up fag
anon from the previous thread if you are okay with my shitty photo skills then i will take more
tfw im not her bf
  wheres the spicy bikini pics
  no such thing
  what a disappointment
  thanks anon appreciate it may marinka bless you as well
tfw will never produce music/audio thing with seiyuu   even if it was just idol stuff at least it would be idol stuff suited to my tastes      wheres the feet
  
  im having a pretty hard time getting more than a paragraph into an article using st onge as an example of an industry trend when she was just totally unequipped to work in the japanese music industry    i have some issues with that statistic anyways even long before 2007 there was plenty of people who were obviously using voice acting as a way to help get into singing  nana is the poster child of seiyuu music but shes really a singer that picked up voice acting on the way  we have a bunch of them now that just sort of surf between idol franchises and theme song singer side roles
where can i find pictures of cutie seiyuu is there like a danbooru equivalent for this shit
  no i wish there was too but nip/chink have ramdom sites for seiyuu images but theyre not like danboorus at least some of them have twitter and blogs
  damn thanks though
    there is koebooru which has a good collection of older scans/photos its not actively maintained and is pretty much dead best bet is just looking for blogs or searching on weibo for them
  thanks homie
  youre a saint
  felt like i should have bought some pbs while i was in japan i saw a bunch and just kept walking
okamoto is next to expose his armpit and nipples for uncle leslie kee
  im about to buy like 5 and hope they arrive by christians

  first for marina
  most painful thread in a long time
  yeah i hate it when my mail is delivered by pagans
  whos this hottie is he a good seiyuu

i love asumi kana but hate that drugged up voice shes using for fubuki in senran kagura

congratulations you got a date with a seiyuu for christmas the catch is it has to be a seiyuu the same age as you who is it
  yukarin
  furuya toru
  dont know if i should go for seriko or yuichan
  thats what i wanted to start with
  thats a really hard choice for me as well
heres emiri katous interview at anirevo  
  isobe karins contract with office enjin has ended
    furukawa makoto is now under toys factory
  masuda and him must have gotten a double deal to have both of them leave space craft and join another agency together
  speaking of emirin she and asanee are having some kind of event together  
   pick between yaoi or touyama nao  hard i could also go for the oonishi route
  minami got chubbier
  motomiya kana left just pro and is now under production baobab
  rieri mocho ueshama and hegochin are some choices  would probably go rie would want to see how much of dork she actually is       good   a lot of seiyuu are too sticc
do agencies really matter
  sure if youre a rookie in a well connected one you can get minor roles in stuff your senpais are in
serizawa yus 2nd photobook will be release on april 26 2019
  the catch is it has to be a seiyuu the same age as you  fuck you i want to date marinka
i want to massage rieris shoulders if you know what i mean
  she must be tight considering all the work she does
  whos the cutie on the far left
  yoshino nanjo
i hope mai kadowaki is doing okay
  shes sleeping with her kids
what did she mean by this 
  nice engrish
  she meant she must have used google translate
  naobou
  shimono hiro
  yuu kobayashi
  i dont really follow seiyuu or real idols at all but shes very attractive
tfw youll never get sloshed with asanee
  is she still fucking that jav actress
  rei mizuna yeah they still post about going on dates and kissing on each other yuu posts herself doing that with a lot of other girls though so i dont know what to make of it
  tfw asanee will never be my wingwoman
was there an event in singapore
  afa  
  amagamid yaoi  ye
  their pirate outfits are really cute
i love watching ogura yuis live performances shes so cute and talented
  need more ari ozawa
  ive been freaking loving her voice ever since rolling girls every characters she voices are automatic best girls to me she does need more roles
    write letters to im then
congratulations aoi is engaged and will retire at the end of 2018
  god i wish that were me
    granny

  will he start to enjoy cosplay like his husbando
  aoi is about to be culturally enriched
    you know shes pretty cute with her old lady glasses you know
    honestly shes pretty cute when she dress her age
decide to take the plunge and watch shera on netflix  decide to watch the japanese dub cause hey why not  its another mai nakahara is horribly miscast and is using her worst voice episode but times that by 13  azur lane and magireco please hurry up and come so i can tell people shes actually a good va
  one more month till 2019
  im concerned shes got 0 roles for winter and i dont expect any for spring
  at least theres two roles for 2019
  yeah but i cant wait 6 months i just need her in winter to last me to summer since i expect shell get nothing for spring due to being in the us
  theres some cute boys in this pic
azumi waki
  what about her
  how old is she
  i like her
anyone here planning to buy rhodanthes singlephotoobook
  probably not but theres a decent chance it gets uploaded
  depends how much of naos boopable nose does it have
  hopefully not much
  shes the cutest member of the bunch so hopefully theres a lot of her loveable potato nose
having a fetish for seiyuu noses
touyama nao is kinda ugly to be honest
  he doesnt have a fetish for seiyuu noses
  ayanerus nose
i love chiaking so much i wish more seiyuu had her level of brazen sex appeal
  43 years old    damn maybe she is a succubus
kanae itou  not voiced by kanae itou  has there ever been a character voiced by a seiyuu with the exact same name that isnt the seiyuu voicing themselves
  thats a super rare case are there any other characters with the name name as a va
i love watching seiyuu eat
  anyone have a mega folder/torrent for that show i remember laughing at how bad her cooking was roughly this time last year
  wataru takagi played a character in conan named after him
everyone gets a melofla guest appearance
  i wonder what inorins hair/ear smells like probably heaven
  she probably smells like pounds of makeup
  and pounds of plastic too
  while that would have been cool kanae in amagami only had one line or maybe just a cheer of celebration i forgot as well kanae itou was busy with 3 main character roles in asobi no ikuyo battle spirit brave and ookamisan during that time would have been cool but its not an injustice
  minase iori  close enough
fucking jew
  kawasumi is really small
did ai kakuma get cuter or is it just me
  in japan there is a ranking system for seiyuu the ranks are from a to f with a being the highest    each rank has its own set pay  for example a rank seiyuu are paid 45000 yen about 443 for one 30minute anime episode    above a rank are no rank seiyuu who can set their own price    who are the a ranks and above besides nozawa and some of the veterans are current popular vas like inorin or ayaneru considered a even when they really popular they havent been in the va scene for that long maybe they are b and hanakana could be a i guess
    why she could actually pull a good look while showing her foreheads good for her kinda reminds me of this jav actress by the name yuri
  rising in rank depends on experience and popularity  do seiyuu get paid more for voicing main characters  no    so rookies are so cheap that why certain productions keep using them for mains     i wonder what it means for matsuoka its obvious that he has his popularity but he isnt like say kaji or miyano with fangirl appeal sakurai sugita etc those male vas will tons of roles are definitely a and above i remember older seiyuu threads on /a/ with some going saying sugita isnt as popular as before because he doesnt get main roles but overlook that hes has shit tons of supporting roles and probably get roles because of popularity and doesnt have to go through the audition process    are current popular vas like inorin or ayaneru considered a even when they really popular they havent been in the va scene for that long maybe they are b and hanakana could be a i guess    female vas like nana sawashiro hikasa and kayanon are definitely a i also wonder how vas that voice super popular characters in long running show like takeuchi junko are ranked is she a for voicing naruto even if she doesnt get that much other roles she probably earns a nice sum from voicing him in all the media stuff hes in

    hmmmthis is interesting
  the common pattern for getting roles is failing the audition for the mc / other important characters but getting a minor role thats more suitable for them for example sugita auditioned for sugimoto in golden kamuy but was casted as nikaidou another such example from him is auditioning for renshou/miketsukami but being casted as kagerou in inu x boku ss      sugita also auditioned for terra formars and even though only few major characters were prepared for it he wanted to audition for hiruma ichirou because he liked him in the manga the audio director was confused since no one had done that before and in the end sugita was the only person who ever auditioned for that character and ended up getting it   he also said it was the first time he has ever had a role where if he gets asked in an interview do you have anything in common with your character he could answer appearance
  i dont think he failed failed in that sense for sugimoto its more like they want someone who is free to do promotional work and also cheaper considering they had a bunch of veterans in the supporting cast who cost more than the two mains
    yuuichiro umehara i dont like the word fan i dont mean that i hate fans but i dont like the term i wave and blow kisses at events because the staff tells me to i dont feel anything for it when i see others performing fanservice i wonder how much longer they can keep doing that    our lad is getting sick of being the ikemen seiyuu
  sheesh dont rock the boat buddy he wont get shit anyway since its not like he directly shat on fans but still its a good thing he is popular now but he hasnt reached that level of establishment yet he should want people will take him seriously from his work instead
  i wave and blow kisses at events because the staff tells me to i dont feel anything for it        but he enjoys the other stuff right
  amemiya sick of being an idol seiyuu umehara sick of being the ikemen seiyuu is this a potential uprising can we finally go back to the good old days
  he pretty much just wants to do only voice actor works without doing shit that doesnt make sense to be connected to that sort of work  the problem is his words is not just his own discomfort in that sort of stuff but also put implications on his peers on them being phony and only doing it because they ordered to do so by staff like him in that sort of industry which being fake is the main sell and even the fans he doesnt like doing those things for are the main buyers of what items the office puts out of him its fatal statement that can end his career     especially since his words can be used as him looking down on senior voice actors who are doing the stuff he denies as a means of surviving  and being successful in the business as long as they have honesty in the entertainment business in general is the quickest way to get you dried out of work in the business he was too honest for his own good which in my opinion is not a bad thing but he should of known that the industry he entered is distorted and doesnt follow the common sense of ordinary people
  oh right he said it on his radio show with nishiyama koutarou and that guy is a fanservice whore i wonder what his face looked like after that but hes probably is used to umeharas ways
  umehara always came across as really cold and self centered to me to start with i wonder if saying that sort of thing doesnt fit his appeal with fujos anyways
  in other words is he gay
  marinka or azumi waki
  kusunoki tomori
nice breast
  me in the boat
  so thats why hes been openly talking about porn and masturbation also said shit like he doesnt consider any of his colleagues friends he doesnt have to ruin his image that way perhaps his management lets him off since he was ill and some fans likebad boy style no one can really force him to engage in fanservice if he doesnt want to he could just do the hosoya and limit it to smiling and waving now he has spoken up people might doubt him even when hes genuine
          
why do some of you hate rie
  because shes popular
  whos the next takarie
  she seems fake
  the japanese like her so i have to hate her
  how many times are you gonna ask the same question just read/lurk the threads

this thread i mean
       since momoko often says that shes a senior in the industry and that the producer should just follow her orders it has lead some fans to call her senpai or momokosenpai      a sudden no context meme called metal momoko had begun to surface among the fans at twitter and pixiv an artist had tweeted a drawing of momoko colored in metallic without context when asked whats the drawing about the artist only answered メタル桃子だけど its just metal momoko          said artist twitter account has been deactivated and as such seeing the original tweet is no longer possible          the hashtag メタル桃子 had become a top 10 trending topic in the japanese twitter at 28th29th of july 2018 with more content on metal momoko and derivatives of it such as momoko as a rockman boss or metallica momoko
  metallica momoko  i want to see that

  id assume shes worth a lot of exp but flees as soon as she gets the chance
children of the earth rejoice    each new day we have a choice so    touch a metal momoko    climb a metal momoko    feel a metal momoko

denpa song english guide        music downloads        denpa song bot new songs every day      blogs          denpunk bot      japanese guy who makes denpa and moe songs mixes  
  last odenpa studio cd to be released at m3 end of an era
  rip    new mameko   new choko 
koko daisuki
does any of you guys know where this song is from    thanks friends
  new choko  any tips on where to buy this besides melonbooks where i cant read the moon runes well enough to make an order  also looking for the new twinkle pic related
  
why does this thread have to die
  why does odenpa have to die
  isnt booth digital only though
  yeah if melonbooks ships worldwide you shouldnt have any problems ordering it there just translate the page if you cant read it well enough and make sure they accept your payment method also get the rikaichan addon that translates text you hover over it helps so much navigating japanese sites
  denpa threads are dead this is the first one in weeks and theres no activity
more choko  
gib picolony nauts
  it was already posted somewhere public im pretty sure
  its on the c94 spreadsheets check the archive
    ive been checking almost daily since comike and couldve sworn it hadnt been posted yet dont how i managed to miss that  thanks lads
  couldt find it in any archived threads and neither the spreadsheet or ds i found it on vk/9tenjew however
  the spreadsheet actually links to vk/9t so its the same thing
  please enjoy it then    personally i found it less enjoyable than the previous ones in the series its kind of weak
speaking of comiket releases did the toromi cd surface anywhere
oh wow a denpa thread  better post before someone bumps it off the board with a hay guys i found this picture threads    mosaicwav are going to release a new full album miracleluminalσakiba pop at the end of the year they have now been going for 15 years    
several months ago one poser here shared tohko morinagas compilation album はにーえんぜるなごべすと ive been listening to it for long and finally ive been able to acquire it in full to my surprise it included an additional dvd within it the dvd has other lower quality recordings of tohko morinagas various songsfrom 1997 onwards  the compilation album is from 2007 and even has video clips of her friends of the doujin scene talking about their time together a live performance of her first song likely done around 2000 was also visible for a portion of the video clips all in all i think its of particular importance to the early doujin music sceneprem3 and early m3 and also to the development of the moedenpa genre
moe manifesto has interviews with vocalists momoi haruko and toromi and it served me well so far along with the notes tohko morinaga left there are also the htmlbased journals of doujin creators left in late 1990s and early 2000s cdsnamely hypermirrorve and hyperberoove but they arent nearly enough as is the description given by     as such id like anyone who knows of the history of early doujin music and history of denpa throughout the ages to tell what they can and if they know of any source of information in english or japanese  please reply to this post
upcoming confetto at m3  
  nanahira and nayuta  this sounds great  gonna try and grab a copy
new twinkle this time they are little fairies    
ぱるちゅのおやchu and 百萌夜行 きゅん2カーニバル are still my favorites after all this time  anything with a similar vibe among newer releases
  by newer i mean 2015 and later i havent been following the releases since then and want to try getting back into this again  thanks
new momobako  
additionally new mosaicwav  moonstar halloween    
and more nanahira    
  no one knows
  that discord notification at 0038
  cant find the exact song but the artist is shirasawa rie 白沢理恵
  already they just released the one where they are little detectives
  what can i say hiroty works really hard and the girls are talented
whats the deal with twinkle i can only ever hear choko in all their songs never can hear the other little bopper for this reason i prefer their solo stuff rather than when theyre working together as twinkle its probably just me
finally a new denpa thread not seen one of these in a while  so what is your favorite denpa album lads  for me its either this or avenew project  a la mode 2
sugar bunnyまめこぽっぴんどりーみん    mameko is love      
  love that cover art and the preview sounds good too
  speaking of avenew  
  im kind of in love with that artists work you should check out their pixiv    
  mameko is the cutest denpa underrated i dont even think her last album got uploaded
new rissyuu  
  which one im pretty sure most of them get uploaded
  oh god theres even a video  
the denpa is strong in うぐ vs odasis          
it has begun
  mmbks new stuff sold out super fast  very popular
  waiting warmly for new uploads
how about nonmoe denpa  like 筋肉少女
  do you mean kinniku shoujotai 筋肉少女帯  they have had a long and glorious career and ohtsuki kenjis outbursts of popculture insanity is an obvious influence on the modern denpa song phenomenon i have tried elaborating on the links between the denpa and the japanese new wave scene of the 80s nagom/captain records etc before in these threads but never gotten much response    kinniku shoujotai are pretty guitarbased which i guess will put some modern denpa fans off    
sorry for being a retard but is there a definitive difference between denpa and moesong like denpa generally focuses more on nonsense and speed where moesong is more melodic
  followed their pixiv thanks so much          does this count it has the typical squeaky moe voice but the overall feel is not moe at all to me at least
how did i completely miss this release    
  dont link to that shitty site
  i really love avenew this one in particular from their new album is amazing  
maybe can anyone find a lyrics for there songs    nao  overload destiny  sasaki sayaka  clearest sky    it was release in solfa chronicle supersonic album but there is no scans on the net and album costs really high for me oh
  doesnt it sound exactly the same as all their other normal あべにゅうぷろじぇくと songs instrumentation singing filters harmony song structure lyrics etc
  well the singer is different but youre right theyre songs are pretty similar i can tell them apart because ive been listening to them forever i am a simple man who likes simple things
  the gimmicks are the same and the songs sound more or less the same too for an untrained ear but there isnt that much of it so more is always welcome im a huge fan and i have yet to get tired of listening to them
    i was just curious how  could pick out that particular song as being standout and what in particular was amazing about it i enjoy some avenew project songs more than others but i couldnt tell you which song that was if you played me a snippet of it    what are your favourite avenew songs i find myself returning to  lv99しゅーくりーむhero  生意気いちごミルクdayo  絶好調de最高潮きゅんハイたいふん
sorry to bother but anyone know if theres a way to buy shirts like these without attending m3
  proxy service that goes to the event or buys it from auctions websites after the event ended
  生意気いちごミルクdayo is a given but im also a fan of  チョコっとレイトな告白タイム  ご機嫌ロマンスラズベリィみさいる    funny thing listening to チョコっとレイトな告白タイム years ago was what got me into denpa
  the melody was catchy to me also the lyrics are extremely silly and kind of lewd the latter of which is somewhat unusual for avenew listen to it a few times
  ave new is nice so sad that they dont like foreigners they releasing opening song for amazing grace i am just in love sakura saoris voice is a bit squeaky for me but okay    cant wait cd release with that song    i also love iosound duca casandra ceui kotoko and other singers
millirobobeta is eternal denpa
where is nanairo ribbon
  merrily night  nanairo ribbon
twinkle is celebrating halloween what are you listening to denpa thread
  
  cute
  i kind of go between finding their stuff intriguing and jarring not something i can listen to often really
  in the mail  if there is really literally nobody who shares it by the time i get it unlikely ill post it  but could be couple weeks before it gets through customs
  my favorites are  ダブルshootingぱるちゅ お菓子deロックオンmix  ふわっfuワッホーメイプルまじっく  続生意気いちごミルクdayo ツン成分63増量chu  i hate the original ダブルshootingぱるちゅ but the remix quickly grows on me      i like ミリロボラボラトリ but i dont like the other songs that much  i admit i havent listened to any of their onlineonly tracks tho any good recommendations
  i actually agree sometimes i just dont feel it  but when i am receptive to it it is the finest denpa       onlineonly tracks  what are those ive only listened to their two albums could never find any thing else
i have been out of the denpa game for 2 years any must have albums released recently
  ive been kind of out of it and need recommendations myself but toromi is still going strong pommettos apprism was good too
  pommetto  isnt this just shaking pink with a different name might as well be
  same singers but the sound of the music is pretty different
  what are those  their vocaloid stuff thats the only thing i could remember being posted in niconico but never released as an album
      when in shaking pink they are in character as the invading space aliens koko nana and momo so it is a bit of a difference when it comes to lyric themes character personalities settings and scenes in the drama tracks and so on    koko and nanahira also do a lot of various releases together but in the lovelicot releases they are in character as licorice/rikorisu and kotono
  jesus how did i miss this this is going to be amazing
  i personally dont like correlating kingshows take on denpa to the otaku music take on denpa but instead of being negative about it id just like to have a few examples and explanations regarding how kingshows work reflects in otaku musics denpa    if i had to create a link id place it on the alternation between proper singing and speechsinging and the blurry line between them     the backing for kingshows wacky songs was likely related to the 1981 fukugawa murder case through simple mental disorder defense the term denpa was forged however it was not associated with otaku until several years later in 1988  with the 1988 miyazaki tsutomu murder case at the time there was a growing discomfort among the japanese regarding otaku and the japanese media likely focused these aspects of the murderers collection of video tapes in order to alienate him and push for swift persecution for another decade after that the entirety of otaku in japan suffered under terrible stigma that they are broken in the head and might break out and murder people on the street you couldnt use that term to refer to otaku music in the 90s only in the 2000s otaku were given some slack and by 2005s densha otoko many of the barriers surrounding otaku have been dissolved  kingshow probably took most of the murder and mentally disordered attributes and less otaku  they did not intend to make music for a shunned subculture certainly not any cute music    on a different note i havent often heard of references to very old songs ill name one that i found out about recently  mosaicwavs kimi ga uso o tsuittatwitter is a play on an 80s song called kimi ga uso o tsuita from you told a lie to you tweeted a lie very clever        up to the artists to include their preferred degrees of moe qualities and denpa qualities   neither is necessarily speedier or more melodic   moe aspects direct the singing to be more cutesy and the wording to be more lovely and innocent denpa aspects emphasize breaking into speech over traditional singing including senseless lyrics or otherwise basing the songs on geeky topics        this is the best example i have for denpa music of the otaku community for the otaku community that doesnt include a lick of moe a flavor it has retained even in its transformation to flash format two years later  
  id also like to add that to the best of my knowledge moe music preceded denpa music the former was a derivative of galge themesand shaped accordingly both of them are rooted in doujin i have no evidence for the use of moe in general earlier than the mid90s and even in the late 90s it wasnt used to refer for things we today can consider moe music the two moe song and denpa song must have been termed only in the early 2000s
  thats just molp millirobobeta is a duo but i dont know the singers name some songs are just covers of molps voclaoid stuff  any good recommendations  whatever you can find they are all amazing here is a playlist but there are probably more  
  denpa aspects emphasize breaking into speech over traditional singing including senseless lyrics  additionally theres also intentionally offkey/offtune or outofsync singing the ending of i want you  焼酎 情熱の熱燗とランデヴー is fantastic for this
  coincidentally i own petit rhythm kyun so i know of the example you sent i tried looking up more instances and didnt manage to find any have you got more examples
  pandasan youchien
  thanks its a great example like the whole song was sung by a child both this and the subsequent neko nabe portray this sort offkey/offsync speech singing well very denpa    are there any others you can think of      apparently these were made under hyper beroove rebirth and here i thought mirawis work within hyper beroove and hyper mirrorve came to a stop in the early 2000s then hyper beroove rebirth is the third continuation and side protea is the fourth continuation under which mirawi and bermei continued producing music  this comes as a surprise to me because their early works were mostly instrumental and their vocal arrangements were not denpa arrangements but very candid moe arrangements slow smooth and straight  fortunately a single piece for their earlier works is available on youtube this is by the same tohko morinaga i mentioned previously in the thread  
  ah i stand corrected also thanks for the playlist      what about 
confetto ななひら  merrily night flac  
  wow nice nice
confetto ななひらnayuta  nanairo ribbon flac

  my two favorite utaites thanks anon
  molp    im still searching for his second album
anyone else listened to momochan continue    im really liking it feels like a nice change of pace for mmbk and it suits her voice a lot better than i would have expected
  yeah i really liked it looking forward to momochanandroid i wish there was a chance wed get some new ちぃむdmp
      i think both momochan cds we just got are a really good change of direction and fresh air nothing against the old miko x mmbk but i like to see momo pushing into new areas of the genre now
  yeah looking at the credits and seeing she produced the music for some of the best songs on continue its an interesting way for her to go forward and im loving that shes making the music she wants to i hadnt listened to the xfd and definitely wasnt expecting yakushimaru etsuko reminiscent tracks      me too im definitely waiting keenly for that after continue ちぃむdmp had that track on harunabas release which was nothing like what i expected do kinda miss the voices but im hoping this is a sign of more in the future
    are we talking about miku wave because i think i have that cd in a box somewhere
     ave new is nice so sad that they dont like foreigners    gonna need more details on this
  didnt saori send the raw data of an album to an anon here      look up side protea
  any chance you have a link to the harunaba cd cant seem to find it anywhere
  its on vk/doujinmusic post /wall60027733_23960
  yeah miku wave is what im looking for i didnt expect anyone would have it dug around for it but there wasnt much information or places to buy it if you could upload it id appreciate it a lot      got the vk link from the c94 spreadsheet if that makes it easier    
/jp/ has become so fast
  fuck does someone have a download for tpazolites  songs for x girlz i guess ill just buy it
  is it not in the jcore torrent
  all those vtuber threads do they still make them
does anyone how to use the search on vk trying to see if they have new ちょこ and twinkle but nothing happens when i use the search bar page doesnt move or do anything but maybe just my browser
  
  i couldnt find it      ahh amazing thanks
  have you tried making an account ive never bothered but perhaps that might let you actually search
  its also on spotify
    found it anything else youre looking for        i have ミニロボベータ and 大人のミリロボベータ but i guess you have these already    how about beatlogic i have     eleksonicrusherrrrrr   シュミックトリガ new wave of apop   シュミックトリガ2 psychocrush apop
  yes that worked thanks
  i didnt think id get to listen to this anytime soon thanks a ton    yeah i have the millirobo releases im trying to remember something i was looking for a while back a set of fairly old denpa compilation cds but i cant remember the name off the top of my head    i have シュミックトリガ2 psychocrush apop but eleksonicrusherrrrrr and シュミックトリガ new wave of apop would be great thanks    seems like you have an impressive collection i guess youve been picking them up for quite a while now either way ts great to hear from someone wellversed
  ive been listening to this crime berry album and was trying to find some more info on it because i am not sure if crime berry is the artist of a record label or both couldnt really find any good info  any moonspeakers out there that have more knowledge  its really good though would recommend
everyone likes koko here right
  not as much as choko
  yes    this
  a little bit too screechy for my taste solo but she works well when paired with someone else
any more cool jazz like this
    im just gonna zip all three beatlogic / cello albums in case someone else wants the full collection        yeah i spent way too much on denpa releases i dont regret it but im glad i stopped purchasing from every m3 / comiket for like 5 years straight all these odenpa singles got expensive
miracle luminal pop fucking where
   it comes out december 29th
does anyone have track 1 from なゆきんぐだむ
  not jazz but check out the touhou basso nova stuff if you want some chill instrumental with some vocals in a few songs
  thanks for this
  anon do you have the link to the first molp album
anyone able to reupload this mediafire fucks with it on my laptop even with scripts allowed  
  xion  eyes
  thanks again    yeah i could see that i definitely have to be picky about which ones i choose to buy considering shipping and the frequency of releases its nice to have though yeah i couldnt see myself regretting that either          from mikudb      yeah i can download that and reupload to mega just give me five
  i managed to reupload it to mega from my tablet here it is for anyone else that might need it  
    oh i just finished the upload i fixed the tags too so this just in case    
    many thanks
  thanks for the tip good stuff
i have a question about this album i dont understand when is says song by yunomi then saying the featured artist is toriena who is the person that is doing the vocals  oedo controller song by yunomi  artist yunomi  featured artist toriena
  toriena is the vocalist she also has solo work too however      anyone have tags for ぷねうまレコードですら 何がしたいのかよくわからないcd2 ive had no luck so far and i need it for myself  to share in general so
  is toriena is the vocalist what is yunomi supposed to be
  yunomi is the producer of the song so the musician behind the instrumental you hear toriena sing to since its yunomis release its his artist credit and toriena is featured as a vocalist to the instrumental
soon
  dream magic is still not available for purchase while everything else is
  i think it will be tomorrow

since はじめてのべすとあるばむ is a bestof album i tried recreating it     it should be accurate based on the original album tumblr page but i cant guarantee anything
i got this on c94 apparently theres already a download link on the spreadsheet vk/t9 but since its only mp3 i ripped mine to lossless        unfortunately no log/cue available it was my first time ever using eac but i did everything right according to the doujinstyle setup/ripping tutorial the only problems i had were absolutely nothing happening when i clicked generate log and the tracks on the cue being like wav due to the japanese titles which i couldnt find a way to solve online  i honestly cant understand why i couldnt generate the log file though    im going to rip とろ美s album ねぎとろ美 next i cant find the album art on her website and dont have a scanner to scan it for you guys so until someone find it ill need to upload without the album art  i also got and am going to rip momochan continue to flac
  glad that とろ美 wasnt forgotten about i was getting worried itd never be ripped  flac of picolony nauts is nice too thanks a lot
  i just noticed i typoed the date so it says year 205 instead of 2015
  ill go ahead and upload sweets parade in flac now for new toromi but cant find tags for that punema records release so unsure what to do hehe
  
  i only just remembered to listen to this now but fucking hell tracks 2 and 3 are good risshus track sounds incredibly recycled though thanks for the flac
did anyone ever get this
  chokos live right now
  could you scan/take picture of the jacket so somebody here could transcribe the info  there is always the option of finding the characters yourself    but that can be quite an arduous task
nanairo ribbon  this is good for once
  easier than i thought since only one kanji only in the first track but i still might need someone to transcribe it since i cant figure out how to add a japanese keyboard to my laptop
  i think the last character in the first track might be the one for dream 夢 which i can usually recognize
  it is ill try to string together the rest tomorrow
  i missed it what a sad thing      its great      not even available on boothpm hope someone got it
  crime berry is the label the singer is らずべりー
  01 ペーネミュンデの夢  02 1940 zero  03 ペーネミュンデの夢 いんすとるめんと  04 1940 zero いんすとるめんと    ぷねうまレコード  puneuma record
  何がしたいのかよくわからないcd1 was quite expensive around 3600 yen when it sold a year ago i wonder how long youve had your cd and did you buy it on the date of its release
  i got it in the suruguya near the station in akihabara on my trip around 3 weeks ago  it only cost about 1300 yen i believe i did buy the single where shes dressed as an orange as well and that cost me 2000 originally 2100 however  the price is really funny considering both punema albums on the site right now are 5000 and over though
  yours is the only one left that we havent heard i think  that is so great you found it instore i had been hoping for a long time that it would pop up on their site
/jp/ is too fast these days were barely staying on the board
is there a song structure common to denpa or moe music i wonder if theres any pattern to the composition and lyrics
  more like these threads have gotten slower  the last m3 event threads just straight up died 3 times
  it feels like theres been a lot less uploads from recent events too denpa is reclining
  notable denpa releases still sell out at big events so i think there is plenty of interest just maybe not from outside japan
    pretty much most people outside japan have moved on or are probably discussing in japanese and dont need these threads its hard to attract new people too when people only have crunchyroll and a reddit account      thanks sounds to me like it does the job just fine
  except i typod the date tag so it says 205 instead of 2015 and also forgot to remove the embedded album covers
  small details easily fixed you still did most of the work and i appreciate it
  toromiseyasan web shop doesnt carry the latest cd yet it might be a long time coming before a used copy shows up anywhere so please stay alive anon in due time i might see what i can do maybe write to her and ask if she could ship it to me
denpa is cool
  everyone i show denpa to seems to think otherwise however
  very nice anon thank you for finding and uploading this rarity toromi was the very first i heard of this denpa music and i go crazy by the sound of her voice so raw and even jarring in this one great denpa vibe i say just wish i understood the lyrics
  denpa is reclining  thats quite a shame  bump
  so sad that they dont like foreigners  source on this claim im interested
anybody managed to find a rip of momochandroid its out on spotify but i cant find an actual rip anywhere
does anyone remember the name of the track about all the different hiras ichihira nihira sanhira all the way up to nanahira
  i know the one you are thinking of pretty sure its from one of the nanahira x camellia albums gonna go through them now and try to find it
  found it its 物凄い討論するななひらが物凄いうた on wonder trick track 9
  thank you
  yoroshiku onegaishimasu

  mamekosan ga daisukidesu
  i was actually hoping for this since it was first posted at the start of this thread thanks
  mameko is always appreciated
  fucking mameko out of nowhere  thanks a bunch anon
denpadenpadenpadenpadenpa
dodonpa
  dempa
    post holiday denpa
  donutmpa      anyone have any more mameko solo albums i only have this and the one posted in this thread
  which ones specifically i think i have a few saved somewhere
  thats my favorite christmas denpa    a nice one from mikobako  
  any is fine    also is this album also not ripped
here you go guys  
  also log and cue this time unfortunately no scans
  i dont think ive seen 12 around just 17
  it looks like the only one i ripped and uploaded for people here was ふわらぶあにまる     i also seem to have alice in wonderforest melody and heroinee so im sure links to those are around somewhere
  thanks
  oh should i have made a cue file and included a log too    im the anon that ripped         im not very knowledgeable about this stuff so i just included the flac tracks i used foobar2000 with a verified drive offset and secure read turned on so the rips should be good but it doesnt output log/cue files    i did some reading just now and for my next cds ill use eac i think    i remember there used to be a really long guide from what cd on how to rip something and package it to their quality standards if some anon has an archive of that or a newer guide let me know id like to give you guys the best stuff i can
    for what are cue files needed i usually delete them because they look like clutter im guessing when you burn the music to a cd
  i think it is if you want to burn an exact copy of the original cd as it has information about the gap on the disc between tracks etc someone else can correct me if im wrong
  i only use them if the flac isnt split often i find theyre broken if the track are already separate so i dont bother anymore but basically its like a playlist of all the tracks
  oh should i have made a cue file and included a log too  log usually yes but here not everyone is that concerned about it if you upload it in any other place where people arent able to talk to you and figure out you really own the album they cant be sure if its a real rip or a transcode when they transform mp3 tracks into flac    i personally dont know why keep the cue file i also delete them myself but everytime i see a flac rip the person includes the log and the cue so im sure its useful for some people maybe because of what  said    eac setup tutorial     eac ripping tutorial 
        you guys are the best denpa threads sure can be great      i feel like cue and log are extras and you dont really need them the log is just nice to see that its a good rip but personally i dont think its important the cue is really helpful when the tracks arent split but its not too important when they are     eac is the gold standard just for the control and options it gives you but what youre using right now still puts out solid rips anyway so its not a huge deal i use dbpoweramp with offset and secure read unless eac is needed anyway
  i love space
i admit i dont know much about this song and it appears to be a cover i think  regardless does anyone happen to have higherquality download for it where its from i cant tell but i love her cover of it    
  you should have been able to figure it out by the title and the video description literally tells you everything    the song is os宇宙人 the op of the anime電波女と青春男 covered by 桃箱momobako     as the video description tells you its a reupload from nnd     and no i wouldnt expect anyone to have a download of it its just an anime op cover
  it is indeed a cover of the opening song of denpa onna to seishun otoko from here       i dont think theres a higher quality version than the nico one i also downloaded it from there with nicosound which was basically youtubetomp3 but it got shut down years ago maybe it got released on a utaite covers album in better quality    if you like here you can download the original    it lacks the muffled singing which is really cute and fitting for erio the girl wrapped in the futon but its still great the second song is also pretty good
anybody have this and the first volume  
so why was okuu super edgy in her first appearance why was she trying to find a final solution to the human question
edgy she was just a dumb bird who wasnt responsible with her power there was nothing grimdark about it if the heroine somehow failed kanako herself would have stopped utsuho
  anon turning the world surface into molten slag and rendering human extinct is edgy
the geyser is merely its byproduct but whats wrong with it  i want you to stop it cause its dangerous  the geyser shouldnt be that dangerous at most you can only get burnt by it    truly edgy as fuck
  she wasnt evil she was just a bored dumb bird when you give stupid people power they misuse it
  anon shes very few actively malicious characters in the series with the power and the desire to bring about the extinction of mankind    she also eats humans     see your bodys getting burned up pretty nicely now i want to eat you up right now but its not good to rush you have to let it fry just the right amount for it to taste the best
  that explains usa presidents
  i keep forgetting thats shes really op and not a waifu bait created by some drunkard
  oh my body is getting burned up alright okuusama
  op waifu bait created by drunkard  shes both  and that describes almost every major 2hu character
  name ten
    what was her problem
  zun toned down the powerlevels postsa before that every stage six/extra boss had hilariously op chuuni powers like yuyuko being able to kill anyone at will or whatever the fuck yukaris illexplained powers are after sa zun stopped placing so much emphasis on powers
  so who is the strongest before he toned down powers
  eiki
  that green haired whore
  trying to find a final solution to the human question
  why did he stop
  in this case its literal okku shifted from being able to shoot things with the force of an icbm from just her cannon to being unable to kill a fairy with it when its implied that was her active intent come soku
  but why
yatagarasu was a dick who along with his brothers tried to scorch the earth because he was tired of following a routine until they got arrows shoved up their asses for being dicks i think he might still be mad about that
  hecatia  what    then again shes at least currently a stop arguing character
  people like to ignore the fact that she and orin eat humans because they dont like what they perceive as edgy
  what
  doesnt she also eat crow eggs as well doesnt that make her a cannibal
dumb bird
        okuu is not a cutter      youkai dont eat people 2hus are not cannibals killers or any other horrible thing that is propaganda spread by neerdowells to try and instigate tension between youkai and the human village the worst that youkai will do is scare you off gensokyo is aside from temporary incidents peaceful its inhabitants kind for the most part
  orin doesnt eat or otherwise harm humans  shes one of the most humanfriendly youkai around      its hard to tell how much of that was just the usual prebattle banter  okuu did talk about incinerating the surface but she wasnt exactly on a warpath when confronted by the protagonists
  orin a cute  okuu a baka
  okuu a cute baka
  raped by yuuka  lol no
  no  that would be sanae  she is a slut not a whore there is quite a significant difference between the two
  sanae is a pure girl
  im pretty sure youkai do eat people
  pure slut
  lies and slander
  no its true
cannibalism is my fetish  nothing quite gets me out of bed in the mornings like the thought of human flesh
  me too
  zounose makes good stories
  im pretty sure orin and okuu do eat humans
  source
  they werent serious
  but they were
  take that back
  
  slander
  youkai hater propaganda
  youkai hater propaganda
  its not propaganda
      youkai hater propaganda  2hus do not kill  danmaku is non lethal  youkai do not eat people  at worse they just scare them off  shitty people in the human village spread these lies to worsen human x youkai relations gensokyo is relatively peaceful its inhabitants mostly kind
who the fuck gives a shit    post okuus
  thank you youkai internet defense force
  boobie burd
mmmmm charred corpses
  what the fuck dude you saved a sample  master1200anon stop this
  whats a master1200 anyways
  dont play coy son  go and download the fullsized images you posted right now
  i dont get it
  tricking okuu into sex
  not kaguya
  lewd
  hot nuclear birb doujinshi
  well she does eat them
  whats orin doing
  eating reimu and marisa
  but she should eat their pussies not eat them literally
  wouldnt that hurt her tongue must be rough
  nice
  theyre masochist
  oh my
        im thirsty for some milk
  orin doesnt eat people but calling her harmless is a lie considering what she does to the corpses she steals
  imagine being this fucking delusional  do you actually like touhou or do you just like the idea of what you turned touhou into with your blatant denial of canon
  what does she do the corpse
  they are used as fuel for the fires of the old hell their souls remaining behind as tormented evil spirits for all eternity
  christ how terrible
  until it gets ejected from a geyser by accident and the released from the cycle of reincarnation by none other than your totallyhuman hermit kasen    orinrins completely harmless as long as youre still alive though
  who are you quoting
  does having headcanon cancel out liking touhou now grimsokyo a shit
  that is possible but very unlikely     yes its even mentioned that she dislikes killing people herself
  it does if that headcanon requires completely ignoring established lore and themes so you can pretend people like yukari or mystia arent complete scumbags
  hey now i wont stand to listen to this drivel youre spouting about mischi i want her to eat me someday
  mystia is one of my favorite characters actually but thats precisely because shes a massive twat with a ego the size of the moon shes a shit person but a great character     still if you have a vore fetish i guess i can understand why you wouldnt view her as evil
  maybe he likes villainous vore vixens i dunno
this is a mischi thread now post bird
  okay
  but kasen killed humans for fun
  could be i guess       im pretty sure thats not canon even if she probably did do some very shady shit during her youkai sage years
  thats some bullshit anon
  its the truth
  karen was once part of a trio of oni trying to find a final solution to the human question suika and yuugi as well they were stopped by humans
  im aware but like i said she managed to find redemption and is a pretty good person nowadays
  her redemption wont bring back those she killed
  edgy
  your a shit
  touhou is a dark setting anon denying it is just delusional
  clearly touhou is on par with other dark settings like berserk or w40 right or not i dont know why are you guys still forcing only one correct view on things when tea drinking and grim stuff are both valid at the same time guess you cant have multiple interpretations on things for some reason
  i would say its more on par with shin megami tensei or the total war version of warhammer fantasy its very bad but not hopelessly so
  i dont know if im getting bamboozled here or not dark settings are usually full of wars tortures famine ocasional rape and incest none of this happends in touhou
  you have a somewhat simplistic view of what exactly constitutes dark people being systematically murdered and oppressed by malicious supernatural entities as the basis of your setting is something that i would call pretty dark
  i mean out of all things you compared touhou to fucking warhammer using   word like simplistic is definitely the most amuzing here when you have stuff like pic related gensokyo being wieved from many looks is how zun intended his setting
  i mean out of all things you compared touhou to fucking warhammer  the total war version of warhammer you know the one where you can take one of the good factions defeat your greatest enemy stop the end times from happening and then create a lasting peach alongside the other good factions    because that is more or less how i view touhou for all of its lighthearted elements gensokyo is a shit place one where the descendants of noble heroes are oppressed while malicious sociopathic supernatural entities are free to torment and kill innocent people yet there is still hope hope that youkai will one day find redemption and become more than simple monsters hope that the human villagers will one day be free to rejoin the outside world hope that the youkai sages get what they deserve and burn in hell for all eternity its this hope of which there is a abducance that stops gensokyo from being a true grimdark setting
oh great its another autistic touhou youkai/human politics grimderp thread fuck off
  
  aya has always been crazy
  whats her problem
  momiji aint sharin her cake rolls
  that dog should learn her place
  is it made of human flesh
  i want to say yes but no
  no its just that powers were vague and thematic but people took them very literally and pushed them to stupid extremes by twisting their meaning she has the power of changing colors that means that technically she can alter the frequency of the radiation emitted by everything being able to produce ridiculous amounts of highfrequency energy and destroy the whole universe in a supernova op not to talk about how people reduced characters to just their powers    now some abilities sound stupid because theyre purely cosmetic can open doors can pass through walls can have three bodies but powerlevelwise there are some truly powerful characters just look at hecatia okina or junko
  i thought junko can purify things
  not canon
  youkai dont eat people  youkai feed by doing whatever the stories about them say they do  kokasa feeds by spooking people rumia feeds by nomming them
  its from a official manga you dope
gensokyo is a shit place to live in the same way china brazil or indonesia is a shit place to live if youre part of the upper or middle class then its actually pretty nice if youre part of the lower class aka humans that are not reimu or her friends you live in squalid miserable conditions while being oppressed and exploited     the key difference however is that at least in the outside world you can become a member of the middle or even upper class without receiving the death penalty and most governments with a few key exceptions obviously dont systematically abduct and murder outsiders for fun
  headucanonnu even if that is the one and only truth though sounds like a lot better place than murica id take those conditions over this place any day take me home gensokyo roads
  official manga  official doesnt nesesarily mean canon
  i remember byakuren kicking rin out of myoren precisely because her view of humans seemed very warped so shes probably not that friendly
  dude yukari has literally kidnapped children byakuren go back to the temple
  i wouldnt mind more pics like this
  byakuren kicked her out because orins only goal was to get easier access to the cemetery and mausoleum she had no actual interest in the temples teachings
  im not going to pretend that america doesnt have its problems but compared to pre modern living conditions it might as well be fucking eden even if youre part of the lower class which i somewhat doubt then its still infinitely preferable to gensokyo and not just because of the social mobility       unless zun explicitly described fs as a non canon work its fucking canon stop being delusional because you cant handle the idea that being a human in gensokyo sucks
  again grimdark canon gensokyo is still preferable to being a middle class ameritrashcan at least itd look like it feels dying of dysentery in india sounds better than this place anywhere really   stop being delusional because you cant handle the idea that being a human in gensokyo sucks  not being able to handle the idea of evil murdercannibal youkai and not being able to handle the reality of the shitty feudaljap peasant life of the human village are very different the human village wouldnt make much sense if it were a picturesque 1st world suburb with feudal jap dlc camo would it  explicitly described fs  zun cant force anyone to share his own headcanon with him
  denial
  she also eats humans   whats edgy about this shes a youkai many of them eat humans   thats like complaining about a bloosucking vampire its in their nature   whats next are you going to call meat eating humans edgy
  please dont use the word canon if you dont share the colloquial meaning of the word  this whole string is just based of your misuse of the word granted i agree that you have the right to your opinion regarding how you would like to perceive your version of the world that zun created but when you begin trying to force your version as the canonical version   canonical here meaning the one intended by the original author of the works theres a problem    either stick to the usage of headcanon or dont mention canon at all
    alternatively if the reason youd said that official need not necessarily be canon is because you think zun doesnt write those he absolutely does  i remember in one of the ending panels for one of the manga chapters that the artist noted that they are awaiting the story as much as the readers since theyre only told as much as they need to know to depict the story as zun intended
  again grimdark canon gensokyo is still preferable to being a middle class ameritrashcan  middle class americans are some of the richest most privileged and decadent people on the planet assuming you are one i can say without any doubt in my mind that you would be miserable working as a farmer     anywhere really   so you wouldnt mind living in syria north korea somalia     not being able to handle the idea of evil murdercannibal youkai and not being able to handle the reality of the shitty feudaljap peasant life of the human village are very different  theyre basically both sides of the same coin of shit people refuse to accept about canon gensokyo     the human village wouldnt make much sense if it were a picturesque 1st world suburb with feudal jap dlc camo would it  obviously that still doesnt change the fact that its a bad place to live    zun cant force anyone to share his own headcanon with him  so what youre resorting to death of the author
  youkai eating people is edgy because its not something they have to do its like being a cannibal expect they dont get arrested right away
touhou while not a edgy series is however a dark series
  youkai eating people is edgy because its not something they have to do   humans also dont have to eat meat      its like being a cannibal   no it isnt cannibalism is the act of eating someone who belongs to the same species you do
  humans also dont have to eat meat  true and some humans actually dont eat meat but almost universally we view it as wrong to eat the flesh of other sapient creatures     cannibalism is the act of eating someone who belongs to the same species you do  its like being a cannibal insofar that its not something you have to do to survive its something you do because you are fundamentally twisted
  im fairly sure that youkai do have to consume some modicum of human in order to continue existing  more concisely as they exist as the pure manifestation of common belief in them if the common belief dictates that they consume human they must oblige or risk oblivion that is not to say that they might not actively seek out humans for that express reason however since theyre grown out of that fear they should have a tendency towards those actions regardless
  im fairly sure that youkai do have to consume some modicum of human in order to continue existing  and im completely sure that has never been mentioned anywhere in canon and in fact youkai eating people has been consistently portrayed as a want rather than a need    more concisely as they exist as the pure manifestation of common belief in them if the common belief dictates that they consume human they must oblige or risk oblivion  even thats not true the youkai in gensokyo have a lot more freedom than youkai used to have in the outside world symposium says that pretty explicitly the only thing they need is fear and belief both of which are already provided in abundance by the human villagers eating outsiders is something they pretty much just do because they can it is literally them just being edgy
  i concede that the consumption of humans has not necessarily been portrayed as a need has not been explicitly established as far as i can recall from the material  i still hold what ive stated as true as consequences of the continued existence of these youkai but i digress
  being miserable as a farmer or living somewhere lik best korea chemicalweaponyria or somalia would be paradise compared to being a privledged and decadent middle class ameritrashcan at least itd look like it feels  youre resorting to death of the author  whered you get that nothing like that just that zun cant force anyone to accept his own headcanon as the one and only headcanon besides himself  basically both side of the same coin  feudal jap peasant is easy to swallow and doesnt hurt an escapist/wishfulfillment headcanon of gensokyo at all hell it even makes it even better in those aspects youkai being evil cannibal killers does completely fuck up any redeeming qualities that 2hu has over other expansive headcanon settings and works might as well migrate to 40k at least itd be a more honest representation of grimsokyo
  being miserable as a farmer or living somewhere lik best korea chemicalweaponyria or somalia would be paradise compared to being a privledged and decadent middle class ameritrashcan  you know im not american myself and ive never been to the country but can i just ask why what exactly is so utterly terrible about america that you would rather live in a literal war torn ruin     nothing like that just that zun cant force anyone to accept his own headcanon as the one and only headcanon besides himself  thats pretty much what death of the author is    feudal jap peasant is easy to swallow and doesnt hurt an escapist/wishfulfillment headcanon of gensokyo at all  it does actually like it affects it a lot in fact living as a feudal japanese peasants is a miserable short toil filled life that by modern standards makes most countries seem like paradise     youkai being evil cannibal killers does completely fuck up any redeeming qualities that 2hu has over other expansive headcanon settings and works  well then i hate to say this but touhou has youkai that are cannibal killers
   but almost universally we view it as wrong to eat the flesh of other sapient creatures  humans havent met another sapient species but considering our treatment of intelligent animals i doubt that we would treat a lesser sapient species kindly   cephalopods cetaceans and pigs are among the most intelligent animals on our planet and they are all hunted/farmed for their meat  intelligence of their meal isnt something thats considered relevant by most humans     its something you do because you are fundamentally twisted  judging non humans with human standards is a terrible habit of humans   youkai eat humans because its part of their nature or something they enjoy theres nothing wrong or edgy about that   humans are just another animal youkais are magical entities judging them with human standards is moronic
  it doesnt matter that we havent met another sapient creature considering how good people are at drawing arbitrary dividing lines between them and us to the point of viewing entire groups of their fellow humans as essentially being a different species or at least inferior it is still very significant that cannibalism is a line that even the most racist imperalist and badshit insane people almost never cross    also now thats were actually starting to realize how intelligent certain animals are some countries are actually starting to implement laws viewing them as such     judging non humans with human standards is a terrible habit of humans   why like im not judging a mindless non sentient tiger for eating a guy that walked into a territory im judging a sapient intelligent creature for making the active choice to eat humans when it doesnt have to and not judging youkai by human standards also means refusing to give them any empathy or kindness viewing them as little more than a problem to be exterminated and i dont think thats fair considering there are plenty of non harmful youkai
    to the point of viewing entire groups of their fellow humans as essentially being a different species or at least inferior it is still very significant that cannibalism is a line that even the most racist imperalist and badshit insane people almost never cross  like i already said cannibalism  eating another sapient species many animals are biologically wired to dislike cannibalism still some humans do engage in murder genocide and exploitation of their own species and this is in a modern society which punishes these acts     also let me apologize i worded something in  badly   judging non humans with human standards is a terrible habit of humans   applying human standards/ethics/morals to the actions of non humans is what i meant     why like im not judging a mindless non sentient tiger for eating a guy that walked into a territory im judging a sapient intelligent creature for making the active choice to eat humans when it doesnt have to  many yōkai are immortal can use magic and perceive things that humans cant see should a human life hold any value for a milenia old yōkai
  like i already said cannibalism  eating another sapient species   i know that my point isnt that youkai are cannibals my point is the underlying reasons why they eat people are the same as cannibals which is to say because they are insane and twisted sociopaths    applying human standards/ethics/morals to the actions of non humans is what i meant  you seem to think applying human standards is a one way street that is only used to cast negative judgement on a creature but thats nonsense its just as important in forming positive judgements of something if you dont apply human standards of ethics and morals to a creature then youre essentially placing them on the same level as plants or bacteria     should a human life hold any value for a milenia old yōkai  yes otherwise they are nothing more than evil sociopaths the equivalent of a kid torturing small animals and children that torture animals usually end up doing far worse things in the long run
  you are stupid stop posting
  no
humans master race
  should a human life hold any value for a milenia old yōkai  heres the big spoiler youkai cant survive without humans humans can do very well without youkai    make your own conclusion
  neat
    reminder that humans are superior
  humanity fuck yeah is a illness
  youre wrong but youre entitled to be wrong
  misanthropy is the true illness
  the fact that you are capable of being a childish misanthrope already makes you superior to all other life forms including youkai
  the madman
  what makes a person thin like this
  sanity and maybe some xenophilia
  insanity and a lot of xenophilia
  same thing
  no
  why would you want to genocide and/or enslave all nonhumans anon
  im not sure why you think sanity and insanity are the same thing but alright
  does keine eat humans on a full moon
  obviously
  hot damn
  whats going on
  edgy
  squishy toes
  what
  source
  because hes insane
  no
  power rush    also we dont know the circumstances of yatagarasus death and that may have done something
  debateable theres still the watasukis    also we have a character who 100 outranks eiki in hecatia now who zun has outright said is the strongest character and absolutely noone in the series would stand a chance if she were to fight seriously
  shes a humaneating con artist whos got one of the bigger egos in touhou    not quite remilevel ego but she is very overconfident
  well open doors is just a rebranding of yukaris gaps    and powers havent been the sole measure of strength forever eikis ability is to see in black and white yet she for a long time was top 3 in terms of the power scale yuukas ability to manipulate plants is outright stated to be useless in combat yet shes incanon regarded as a terrifying youkai    on the opposite end of the scale is yuugi whos ability sounds really broken but her actual greatest power is her raw physical strength that even suika says surpasses hers bear in mind suika can control density which obviously amplifies her physical strength and punching power
  not quite remilevel ego  she said ill show you the true terror of darkness before fighting remilia shes probably up there with remilia maybe even a rival
  cannibalism is my fetish  nothing quite gets me out of bed in the mornings like the thought of human flesh  how did she lose her arm
why is she called okuu tho secondary shit she is utsuho
  sorry buddy i dont make the rules
  thats her nickname
  okina is special
  to het closes friend
  humans fucked her up
  lies
  its the truth

  you just figured that out these threads are nothing more than agufag samefagging for 70 of the thread
if i dont like it its samefagging  if i like it its wholesome discussion

ded
new thread   only 2 posts an   did literally everyone give up now
giveup
poor akuas
getting fed by frrn      most who dont like to play autist on an anonymous image board stopped browsing and come back only when something is happening
  more like  dislike fun  goes to show how weak the love for their girls is
  peoples definition of fun differs wildly
  the only thing destroyed here is your sensibility
  i thought the guy who started posting bang dream ops destroyed this general
love    gu
  not him but i kinda question whether its actual love or ebin meymey spam
  literally nobody meme proves that you dont actually care about the girl herself
  people here are arrogant this is nothing new
  i dont follow
  at least he claims to buy them and its kinda normal that people for an opinion based on the retard that keeps shouting in there face while not being called out for it by other fans of niji     cant see the issue with flowerfag he hardly ever posts anyway
  havent you heard of a wonderful concept called ignore and report
  thats the reason im still around unlike many others not seeing the reports having any effect
  is digging out obscure stuff seiyuus pasts and buying magazines an autistic act now
  yes is there anything wrong with being autistic
this aqourfag and neopdpfag are both annoying and should fuck off with their meta shit already      apparently looking for the girls pasts and reviving lost work is considered a sin here bunch of people got mad at the fact that agutard went on his way to find aguri pics prior to her twitter account
tbh if you are at 4channel you have to be at least some level of autistic
  that was my point but people take issue with being called autistic fucks sake we have gacha generals on this site and we are on a general for girls that will never ever notice us yet we love them everyone is autistic enough already
poor akuafags
  autism is a status symbol
  speak for yourself ill move to japan and marry furirin one day
  you complain everyday that x is autistic but you get upset at people being rightfully offended by that i dont understand this contradiction of yours
  you complain  show me where i complained about agufag
  i think its time to go back to /a/  what is an anime faggot doing here and why is he stiring up shit
  whats the difference between that anchan autist and the guys who is autistic enough to dig up stuff
  oh lord yeah as if i didnt know the shit that anfag pulled back in /vg/ or in /a/ question are you new or what
  koudaze  tadatada shuka ga kawaii  minasan 2 person www  konohen w  sww mic gone w  sayonara www  not even 3 mins and so many stuff happened
  what are you even talking about now
man sure is meta in here again       thats nice anon especially considering i wouldnt touch the cancer that is /vg/ with a 10 feet pole and havent been on /a/ for about one and half year since i dont watch annie may anymore
and by the way town radio update slated for tomorrow will likely be a video featuring the goods for her christmas live
some people just have fun posting their favourite girls other people just love being miserable
  what did he do
king ages like fine wine
what is aqours lock
  king has no tits they say
  she doesnt have much but that slender figure fits her well and i say that as an avid tit lover
  pudding i need her alone in a room with a case of pudding
  she is  thats just her bra
  aesthetic figure  everything else
  happy tapioca
  that belly is as perfect as it gets
  belly button cleavage vertical belly button cleavage i cant believe this is a thing and it belongs to the king this is what sends me over the edge nngggguaugh
  imagine tracing that with your tongue
kuboslut finally adresses her senpais well only  sora is she a hagfag    
frrn has a nice chest
  shes probably the second biggest after anchan
  doesnt matter what she did i stand with emtn
bushimo trio had a sleepover at akarins place
  based agutard btfo
this kills zeroguri
  chuns fingers smells like both of them
a kings order is absolute right my boss should understand   
  come at me bruh my pants are off
christmas will come early     
is this the long awaited king pb announcement
  if you buy it youre an autistic memelord
  as long as theres feet you can call me whatever you want
  its gonna be something like she managed to master winking king is a master troll
  dont forget about her sweaty armpits
  is that a beer what about that green bottle is that soju
  i was the photographer btw
i wish kings fingers smelled like me thats the wish of everyone in her harem
  drunk kaor1n_n playing truth or dare with chunrun and then kissing her and fondling her breasts
  cute long haired cutie lovers and oh yeah also akarin
  i dont want her fingers to smell like you anon
kekd  
praising akarin food  kaor1n_n has become a slut     they have gotten really gay lately am i right 
  twitter
  how are you
  the last stream had just too damn many gay antics
literally future and you cant do nothing about it haha
  chunrun just couldnt be stopped she was fondling tanaka too
    goddesses
  of love live
  she also rammed miyu from behind
  of everything those unintentionally lewd qts i love them so much
  same future for them is bright
  they will be big mark my words
still no announcement i want it to be a king jav
  amazing how they managed to create new group that is more superior than the old ones
  when compared to aquors they are indeed a superior force
sad sad baiting
  aqours are yesterdays news they will announce retirement next year
cant post their pics  our discussion is nothing but spam  our actual discussion is baiting  being pdpfag is suffering bros _
  ignore them
  its just funny how they hate ours qts this much they didnt deserve this just look at this face and tell me did she deserve all this hate
  please wait warmly
chunrun the alpha chad
  warmly  how im nekkid
  super chad chunrunner o
  literally lovers
rkk   please bathe properly   king   please wait naked
  aaaaaaa nachy why
  nachy spookasa when

  no footage of the live performance yet i saw a couple of screencaps
  available only to chosen ones _
rkk is for bullying

literally big thing
  same will go well with some of my other fits lets hope its not one time i fucking love kings fashion taste
  if you can find a restream of kbs kyoto it will be there  december 9th 2330 jst
  why dont they make 146chan a doujin already bros  
  i thought she wanted to get away from the king nickname but here she is fully embracing it its better than kinchan anyway imo
  they were in new orleans
  i dont think she ever wanted to get away from it kinchan was kinda created by the fans in games her name is usually king then there is the outfit for last tspook and a couple other occurrences
kaaaaaaaang
  as far as ll franchise goes she wanted to be called kinchan thats how she introduces herself in the namas in live though the few close ones in aqours still call her king
  she did introduce herself as king up until saitama leg of hpt iirc even there she said king then the other girls called her kinchan then at the end she said kinchan too
useless ugly nicknames    just fucking call her kanako
  she looks korean
  get selected to the biggest show to perform in  cries
  what happened here what are they pointing at
she looks like a female qt asiatic version of both my cousin and my favourite singer from all the way back to elementary school    mah demon __
  does the price include the model changing into it in front of me
  only if youre anchan
  sww live  every god damn time

im about to make some hagfags happy by shitting on aqours for a bit i finally had time to sit down and watch the 4th live holy shit  the stage was even more bland than the 3rd live one  no subunits  christmas songs in november  only the most generic idoly songs  no miracle wave thrilling oneway or daydream warrior  rikyako piano bait  orchestra for no reason  still doing kimi no kokoro wa kagayaiteiru kai despite the fact that ainya cant do the jump anymore  my mai tonight was good  i mean the 1st live was great the 2nd live was godlike and the 3rd one had its moments this one actually bored me
  capital letter goddess
  i voiced similar opinions back then and some people got mad at me i also was mostly disapointed by stts but i liked the piano bait the orchestra and furi pits
who cares lol
eww chink artist
still caring about aqours  even after 2016
chunrunner goes kimochii
agigi goes hidooi
full video of this when

physique doesnt allow it she hag 
chimichanga the hag who dances around like a cute 15 years old autistic girl 3
  hnng i was expecting it to be the full song  why do they do this to us 
  dont know if its the same problem she had a while ago but i noticed she doesnt do the jumpover anymore she just hops a bit on the side  also she is short gay a good singer and she plays the tall blond foreign 3rd year shes bound to have leg problems

aizuwakamatsu train station camera rest in peace    camera list  guides     湯野上温泉駅 yunokamionsen station    rtmp//114160745/livepkgr/livecam003    previous threads    
finally a good thread any new cams around
  check list
    those fall leaves are amazing
  non train goes down occasionally but this is pretty comfy youtube ghmrq9g8mwc
  right i remember this one people used it to monitor the storm and the sort
foggy morning
  cute
  yes its interesting though how even when it is very foggy in the background it is never quite as bad at the station  only seen it fog up completely once could barely make out shape of the station building
    fog is an illusion
made the last tight transfer 1355 jst
  enjoy the ride anon
some folks showing up
  nice hat
  punk kid
  got ya 
  enjoy anon
    thanks on to aizuwakamatsu next
          shit i forgot about this you cant tell from the pictures it is a gaijin though maybe the recording anon has recording him or thats you anyway
  fucking animal what specimen is this
  if theres a video id be willing to bet you could tell by my bearing but yes camera guy is me i explored around yos for about two hours weather was perfect aizuwakamatsu though was surreal seeing the real platform the signs and recognizing the uniforms the girls were wearing i was incredibly impressed by the feel of the town too not often that something like that lives up to the imagination hopefully the pictures turn out well not many from aw since it was dark by then though
  come on anon not going during a school day so you can watch a normal morning in person
  go to 611 and set it to 25      anon comes into pictureall black with grey undershirt and then leaves frame would you be so kind to share what it looks like from the platform looking up at the camera
  youll hopefully get something better when i get the film in the video you can see me fiddle around with it since it wouldnt cycle for some reason thanks so much for the video
  ah so that is why you sit down and fiddle with it i thought you took two different pictures the more you know i guess
  forgot the picture heres from across the track by the footbath
  and your home
        this is surreal to look at
  i need to go there one day get some decent photos    winter trip maybe
        thanks for those
  cant wait until its done  are you going to post it here or in the photo thread
  1 frame a second
  seems to be about right best i have seen from that camera is 23 fps but that may have been after buffering  its an older panasonic ip camera so i guess shouldnt expect too much
sometime in 2019 this thread should become the yunokamionsen thread i think weve mourned the death of the aizuwakamatsu stream enough theres little point in using its corpse as a mascot
i love my station
  true but we should also keep the aizuwakamatsu train station camera rest in peace
  yeah anon will you at least post here when you post in the photo thread
  agreed remember to keep aizu in memory by posting from your collection every so often   ive gathered quite a bit over the years
looks like work is being done on the crossing
  watcher since 2010 here  this will always be my station but the city and the station aizuwakamatsu live on still no need to drop the name   uphold the pledge to make the pilgrimage there one day
  that is one beautiful train
  if i remember right none of the aizu liners are running any more  heres a shot of my good old friend big red
  no need to drop the name  this rebuttal was a lot more dismissive than i meant it to be  i agree with taking it out of the title i just dont want to see the history of the community die just a tradition to uphold as a side note in the op post like  at least until nobody is around any more to remember or care
waiting for my train
  where about is this
  i think its the same one but without the aizu paint job
    what are these from love that psx style
  those in special are from densha de go professional its got lines from all over japan
  its susenji station im going to tenjin to get some drinks
  fukuoka huh ive gotta go south next time im here
  i come here every year since 2006  looove fukuoka
i have a bunch of videos from the aizuwakamatsu station cam from around a year ago                             should have somewhere around 30 hours worth of video the video clips are all of the same days but there were interruptions which broke them up
  missed one  
dunno where this is just showed up in my timeline god damn though
  well i found it its the hakubi line out of okayama city
    thank you for these i had just started watching it when it got taken down so i never had any recordings from aizu  i just wish i had found it much earlier i have been watching japanese streams and ip cameras for so long and now afterward i can not understand how i managed to miss it      beautiful shot
  sorry to be that guy but what camera is this
  ive never been in /jp/ before let alone these thread can someone explain why this webm gave me an intense feeling of calm and then made me tear up   wtf is this
  you feel it  the traces of that /jp/ dream
  i think its something alright  i actually traveled to japan two years ago and i think its a mix of nostalgia and longing   after two weeks there it was my favourite place in the world
im just back from japan we usually go once a year however weve now got a period of 5 years of not going im time for me to hit the webcams hard i was saddened to hear that a lot of the ones i used to watch have lost their sound or gone offline sound is one of the best things
  im going in a month i want to take some local 1 car lines that few people use and are probably going to get shut down and turned into buses
  ahh theyre so cosy i recommend much of the north aomori  hachinohe is my favourite line
  not going to link it directly every camera that gets linked here gets nuked pretty quickly  you can find it on insecam think far north and lots of snow  but not across the gap north  see filename for mjpg stream path        there is just something about rural japan like you say its probably some sort of nostalgia  i have never been to japan but i feel it too i think it has something to do with in some places it looks like time has stood still since the 70s or 80s even longer in some places      i was saddened to hear that a lot of the ones i used to watch have lost their sound or gone offline sound is one of the best things  yeah i wish i had recorded more of the ones with audio while there was i was going to cut together a relaxing summer night background noise loop  never got around to it before the audio streams were cut
rare sign of life outside of the windows
  oh anon  we are kindred spirits
  not going to link it directly every camera that gets linked here gets nuked pretty quickly  and camera stream is now unresponsive  sorry guys not going to share any more unless its youtube streams or other externally hosted stuff  knocking ip cameras offline is just too easy most of the common cheap ones arent made to handle more then 35 viewers anyway  if only there was an easy way to rehost camera streams without exposing the cameras directly        trains in snow are the best
  any chance you have a higher res version of this anon its sweet as fuck
  neat but denmark
  damn hadnt even taken the time yet to look it up / understandable though
  looks like the camera is from sukayu onsen and is showing the view across a courtyard to one of their smaller bathhouses  so basically i have been peeping into the window of a bathhouse for a year  1 creepiness points for me i guess but then again i am not the one that put a camera there    
anyone have any esaka
  ive actually been playing with that idea you create rooms with a stream and then the viewers just watch a rebroadcast though i feel i as the owner of the site could get in some shit i know what you people dowell at least the ones that allow us to not have nice things     i mean you could also restream it to another platform like youtubesuper easy in ffmpeg for example    have a good day or night anons
  thank you anon
  ive actually been playing with that idea you create rooms with a stream and then the viewers just watch a rebroadcast though i feel i as the owner of the site could get in some shit  same here  there used to be a prank call group on tinychat that would call locations they found on livestreams and cameras once they started to draw attention to themselves they got into some shit this would ofc be a lot different but i feel like whoever is hosting it would still be taking some risks otherwise i would have already done it  its sometimes hard to tell if a camera is online intentionally or just because the guy installing it was an idiot and didnt set up access security and the owner might not like having it rebroadcast elsewhere even if it is intentional    i know what you people dowell at least the ones that allow us to not have nice things   i used to be one of those people to some degree so i think i know what you mean    i mean you could also restream it to another platform like youtubesuper easy in ffmpeg for example  that was my first thought too but its a pain to setup that in anyway that isnt super easy to have traced back to you these days when google requires phone activation for everything  also i dont have any hardware i could run 24/7 for it at the moment
  i used to be one of those people to some degree so i think i know what you mean  growing up and just desiring comfy cams is quite odd isnt it anon
    heres another 33 hours of video not all of the same day though                
looks like the camera is up again but it cuts out every once in a while  might actually be the snowfall that is fucking with it in my experience most internet service in rural mountain areas in japan seem to be some sort of wireless links or cellphone service    i found the camera is linked on their website so they obviously expect people to watch it  guess there isnt really any point trying to keep it secret      awesome thank you      yeah being comfy sure beats feeling like you are at war with the whole rest of the internet all the time  these days all i really want is a good cup of coffee and some nice camera streams to look through    and i still get to look up cameras and play osint detective in locating them on google maps and streetview which is what i really liked to begin with  just without the paranoia of having to keep up security 24/7 or risk getting doxed by one of your online coworkers over some petty shit or getting vanned for finding the wrong camera or other weird internet connected shit in places that shouldnt be connected to the internet in the first place
  goddamned thats just right 3
  poor lads must be freezing
early morning
since 4chans moved to a new domain today it got me thinking what lead you to this thread anons i found it randomly right before aizuwakamatsu went down its become a permanent tab for me its peaceful to come here and look at comfy trains when ive had a bad day coming here is a way to decompress
32  2017/09/10 053805    no451957369      たまにjpの東方スレみたり会津若松駅スレみたりしてる  which one of you is this guy
  one of three reasons i come to this board  been around for years but my renewed focus two years back into moving to japan got me interested  and keeping the dream alive with this thread has kept me here  well that and a desire to start a jp cooking thread  we gotta add something other than hu
found this in my archives today i miss the dojo cam even if it was more or less at a slideshow fps rate      what lead you to this thread anons  i found it right around when the aizu station cam went down i tried to find info on it or a new url and thats how i found this thread
      yunokami onsen      aizuwakamatsu      feel free to ask any questions about the areas
  im not saying that was me but im not saying it wasnt me
  nice
  thank you anon i was following your pics in that thread and didnt know you were here too nice pictures i hope one day i can go there too
tfw having to go back to being awake at proper hours and not being able to live on jp time      good stuff thanks for linking it here
  this one appends the live chat onto the screen
  what a beautiful beautiful day it must have been  i would like to spend a week at that place
    found this channel earlier has a lot of live cams pretty cool stuff    sorry if this is common or has been posted before
  looks like my hometown minus the sakura trees
  cant say ive seen it that foot bath is my new favorite 3  thanks anon
  glad to hear you enjoy it 
  i miss that camera
  we all do
  i know its just that once in a while that thought comes with a bit more sadness than i expect it to
  truly a loss humankind will never be able to recover
  cute
  very comfy thanks for sharing
going to be riding some of these in three weeks
  with dubs like those youd best be planning on taking plenty of nice photos for us all anon
  in spite of your inconsiderate dubsposting i will try my best
  if you stop by the station ill be watching anon
  trainators
wild speculation over character designs and numbers ahoy    wtc5 ciconia trailer      umineko saku trailer  
hey the hands on the trailer when the title appears are pretty good
  his thighs look pretty good
muslim loli with smug and pleased face
  cant wait to see which one of them will make the most distored faces
in the umineko saku trailer the character rō 弄 is shown when flauros and bluegirlwithcrown appear this character apparently means fight i dont know if combining this character with the ones shown before makes a sentence    i am led to believe bluegirlwithcrown will be a demon summoned for killing instead of a relevant character
whats your favourite higurashi video on niconico douga
i can safely say after watching that trailer for the new wtc i am more confused over what it could be about than before
  /pol/
  it is just a reference to the lyrics at that moment  the song goes like 生と死を弄んで so toying with life and death
  i thought it would be a mystery set in 17th century europe given cravats cravat  instead whiteys got btfo and we fortnite now  i am hyped as fuck
  who cares if hes a boy ill find porn of him and jack off to it anyway
which shavit would you yalda
    if big compilation videos dont count then this one  
  your mom
  too bad i wish there was anything to infer from the trailer i really want to know more about saku
when will they make their appearance
  the first one
so is saku just some more games and puzzles its not a real sequel and at best would only have a little fan service right
  marika and triginta quattuor
 official team ranking     1 we wuz lambda  2 remove kebab loli  3 my slavs cant be this smug  4 ((()))  5 poos in the loos / chinkateam  6 egyptian 56 and retards  7 shitty bern selfinsert
  i thought the miyao girl/boy/entity was supposed to be from finland retcon to glorious nipponese
will ryukishi ever give us a tiny book thats just a collection of murder mysteries hes made with little characterization just as an activity for us to solve
  props to baibao for being the only ones that look like where they claim to be from
  berns game in ep8 was just that
  i just realised theres no actual white teams in ciconia
  true but i want more
  arent russians considered white
  they live in a beautiful diverse future where all the wypypo got killed
  he said that there will likely be a finnish character he never said it would be the mc
  i really liked all the /int/ernational culture in umineko and kentakun in higurashi
  i guess those tweets just blended into my memory as a new finnish main character ty
  nah that character will be the mc but then later on we see the true protagonist of the vn like rika and ange
borger
  borges
  the hair colors are not the real ones so the smug erikanina hybrid is probably a red herring    i bet shirley temple is the real erika expy
the music in the trailers sound hype as fuck are you sure zts isnt involved    maybe hell be free to work on this after the first chapter
  it seems like theres some sort of connection between each group    two of them are asian two are middle eastern two are african and two are slavs
  if warcats is japanese then three are asian india china japan
i think ryuukishi is very passionate about /pol/ stuff you can tell he had a lot of fun writing rgd and he also fixed most of the weaknesses in his writing so im really excited about wtc5    higanbana was kind of a throwback to higurashi in terms of tone and japanese folklore but i feel like he has taken a liking to foreign names and cultures starting with umineko    this looks like a full scale rgd with insane fantasy/scifi elements and a bit more room for ridiculous uminekotier situations and characters which sounds pretty awesome
where the fuck can i download trianthology and why is nobody talking about it i know ryuukishi only wrote a third of it but it still sounds very interesting    and what about the hotarubi manga i believe it was fully translated a while ago so why is no one talking about it    higanbana and rgd get some discussion once in a blue moon but they barely expand on the lore of wtc meanwhile trianthology seems to feature a cute voyager witch based on alice in wonderland and hotarubi deals with an alternate world takano and a game between bern and lambda postumineko    why doesnt anyone talk about them
  because noone here actually knows how to read japanese
if umineko isnt being translated before wtc5 its safe to assume they wont be connected in any major way then correct
  grind a few vns with a dictionary and youll improve dramatically i guarantee it
the party at the golden land was my favorite part
  if higurashi hou is any indication it will probably be just the 8 episodes of umineko  a bonus chapter supposedly taking place in the huge metagap between battler and beatos wedding and ep8    hou had a lot of new content though kamikanshihen which people thought would tie hanyuu to the aliens in wtc5 the outbreak alternate universe and the fantastic hinamizawa bus stop which already existed as a play before higurashi but not in vn format    it would be weird for saku to have so little new content so maybe ryuukishi will surprise us with more extra stuff
  where the fuck can i download trianthology      and  why is nobody talking about it  its short and honestly not that good there isnt really much to talk about
  it would be nice if our confession was made into a vn extra chapter featuring flauros it was a pretty nice setup for an actual episode and it would be sad if it remained stuck as a random booklet
is erika with a pirate hat the most powerful character
  thanks i assumed it wouldnt be that good but ill still enjoy it regardless just seeing new character art from ryukishi and possibly expanding the witch lore a little bit would make it enjoyable    what happened to forgery of the purple logic or whatever it was called was it ever scanned i figured people would eat it up since erika is such a fan favorite
  art finally gets 10/10 amazing  no nudity since satoko  why live
if erika isnt confirmed to be alive in the the new umineko chapter i will be very something
  ryukishi finally discovers how to draw each finger individually  still melds together fingers to create mitten hands
  battler beato flauros and kongou are confirmed if the trailer is to be trusted    i dont know if i want erika though she cant possibly top her chiru craziness and i kind of miss the times when she wasnt a main character because it allowed the minor furniture to be actually threatening i want to see batora hanging out with ronove and lucifer they need more screentime
  the new content in hou was honestly mindblowing to me i had the main story and the rei chapters burned into my memory so getting to see the characters again after so long in new stories was fucking amazing and they had a lot of variety too an early prototype of higurashi that condenses the whole plot into a 4 hour long play a more or less direct sequel to saikoroshihen and a pretty depressing alternate universe story about a virus outbreak    its easy to forget how much of a big deal this is because the console ports have been adding a shitton of new arcs over the years but i never had an interest in those and considered them little more than fanfiction since they werent written by ryuukishi and you cant even play them with the original art    the only noncanon story i actually enjoy and consider canon is the natsumi one which was originally from the manga she is cute the story is fucked up and the character is playable in daybreak
  ive been wondering where exactly are you getting all these download links    thank you
  he probably just kept track of them since the last time they were posted as for the links themselves ive uploaded made a bunch of them for stuff like this the damedame anime various sprites and assets artbook scans trianthology etc
  i usually think ryukishis art is just charming in the sense of oh hes trying so hard but that looks really cute
  i want to fuck this god
witch cum
ne battlersan i may be the type that looks slender when clothed but this clears things up right my breasts are not small understand
  i want to paizuri shion with her sweater on
i cant believe ryukishi finally learned how to draw
  he gave up his hair to be able to draw competently this qualifies as competent now right
we need a doujin of shannon and kanon alone in a room together  shannon starts to toy with kanon sexually but in her mind its all in jest but kanon starts to reciprocate only for him its serious theyre doing tons of lewd things with each other but suddenly battler walks in the room only to find yasu furiously fingering her ass on a bed with cum dribbling from the small hole left from her surgery battler at first taken aback stands there silently  yasu is motionless her fingers still in her ass starts nervously stuttering not even knowing what to say she notices a bulge forming in his pants and after a minute a staring at it while neither of them spoke or moved rolled over stuck her ass out and spread her ass cheeks battler slowly inches forward he pulls out his erect dick  he begins to lean forward towards her ass  he takes each of her hands that were still spreading her cheeks apart and locks his fingers with hers intertwined he continues to lean forward his face inching ever closer to her puffy sphincter he begins to bury his face in her ass and tongue her anus  yasu immediately begins to moan after a couple minutes he leans up and pulls yasus hands causing her to lean up as well he puts his hand on her cheek and angles her face toward his a deep long kiss ensues with tongue here and there saliva dripping down her lips to her chin as theyre kissing battler suddenly thrusts forward his engorged cock plunges deep inside her ass yasu instantly cums a loud moan escapes her mouth she falls forward and tries to hide her moans by burying her face in a pillow battler is still thrusting fiercely his dick scraping her insides and pressing up against her prostate george wondering where battler was went to go find him  george opens to the door to see battler fucking his shannon the cuck falls to his knees as tears pour out of his eyes
  hot
  could have made a hot green text  instead wrote it in autismo mode  come on anon do it properly
  what is autismo mode but the natural evolution of green text
damn
  well if the likes of fucking kumasawas son can be higher than rudolf kyrie kinzo featherine etc then theres something wrong    
  who would unironically vote for that guy
  how the hell did kanon and jessica get that high
  women same reason will and lion got the exact same spot 9
ikuko/featherines always seemingly ahead of everyone elses reasoning and is calm all the time  the moment she thinks someone said that she looks like an 18 year old girl she loses her cool and starts stuttering  cute
  i dont think ill ever understand japanese tastes when it comes to popularity polls
  rgd is also some major fujoshi clusterfuck
can someone post that comic of what really happened on rokkenjima 
  i got you senpai
  thanks man i somewhat like the ending where battler is husband of sayo
  how things should have gone
why is she so perfect
bump
are she and hanyuu the same person
remember back before the game came out when we thought this character was fake good times
  why is she so perfect    because she was created to be
  hanyuus name is spelled as 羽入 in kanji you can translate 羽 as feather and 入 as in  featherin  featherine
  but theres an extra e i call bullshit
only a few more hours until the big reveal  no proper 07th thread   what the hell
her main problem is that she hurt lambda
  she  featherine is actually trans just look at her arms
  right transdimensional
  i dont mind electronic configuration
i want her to read me stories in her cosy house
  high transdimensional creatures like her fart too
which 2hu is dis
  gay witch
  yes
disgusting
fake and gay
youmu is a boy
  the color values are actually historically opposite
boihus are good civilization
why is /jp/ full of faggots
  good question  so many cute girls in touhou and they prefer cock instead
gross
genderswapped touhous are okay fagotized touhous are not
  would bring him home and groom him
  i want to suck his feet
hahahah fucking fags
good thread godly thread          you can safely come out of the closet anon nobody will punish you for expressing your desires here
  its only natural we have some faggotry
  boihus  you walked into the wrong territory fag  this is blatant faggotry
  there was just bumplimited thread over guys crossplaying as 2hus and another one over yuri but suddenly a thread for genderswapped art is more gay
boymilk
gay shit dude
i havent been on /jp/ since 2012    2011 was all about cock lust what the hell happened here
i kind of feel uncomfortable because theyre so short  but i want to believe it is because the original girls are also short rright    i like the tall ones like sakuya though but not too manly and huge like a yuugi
i like this thread because im gay
fuck off to your tumblr shit hole all of you
  straightfags stay mad
poor boihu
boihus is not my forte i would rather have gentle man who would princess carry me all day
gay
i just fapped have mercy
brohus  boihus  im scared to think whats next
  its over  nothing to come next  this is the end
this is the hottest thread out of the entire board  3
  manhus
  what the other anon said  but i bet my ochinchin that it will be a mix of 2d and 3d and somehow it will be a peaceful thread full of anons that want to suck a huge meaty cock
  the flags are the funniest part of this pic
this thread needs to die
  what kind of boy goes around with twintails
  imagine how cute it would be in your hands
i want to fuck a /jp/
hmm
  the flags are the funniest part of this pic  now i dont want to live in this country after all this
  same
        how gay i am if im attracted to these pics
  if its the penis youre attracted to youre a huge faggot if its the feminine appearance youre just a faggot
  im attracted to both the cute penises and feminine boyish look give me my diagnosis doc
  that would make you a huge faggot²
  not gay but id fuck them
where do you people get dis artwork i only have the ones on danbooru because i made the mistake of not downloading anything from their pixiv
  those are some pointy dicks  but those legs look very nice to lick and tease with a feather
  a cute one
i want to kiss a boyhu
    see its actually perfect when theyre like that because you can very easily grab and jerk them off with and into their own panties like that
  not him but whats a huge faggot cubed then
  there is good gallery in panda  also some people claim that he does art with diffrent name nowdays dunno if true or not
  but thats just regular female yuugi
where is dis parsee doujin scans
  i think youre talking about nunupon0514 they both have a similar artstyle draw the same characters and if danbooru comments are correct also appeared a few months after dis accounts were wiped hasnt drawed any genderswap under his new name though
if you do it to a boy does it still count as a mating press
when shinki pull pranks
  probably depends on your intent even if they cant get pregnant you can try as hard as you possibly can
  im pretty sure boihus could get you pregnant via mating press if they try hard enough
  its a gay mating press then
how do i convince a boihu to mate press me
  yes  get trucked faganon  die die uneasy
  depends are you a boy or a girl
  you know that everybody in jaypee is a girl
  /a/  delusional fag
  mirin
why are some anons acting like newfags have the missed the 2chu rule63 threads over the years    i miss the room threads and tea threads and the occasional plush fumo doesnt count and fig threads
  jany deleted them
  ohshit i love that artist
  thats how is it
  nicutokas art can be hit or miss but his remilia is nice
  why does he look disgusted and why does his foot look so delicious
  how can it be when every drawing even the girls has the same face
i want aya to mating press me
boihus are the cuteeeeest
thread theme  
  fitting theme
look at these cuties
  youmus a boy
how did homos even got into touhou in the first place
  theyre not into touhou theyre into taking the touhou girls putting them in pants and giving them a weenus they wish they could suck and theres nothing wrong with that
  its a requirement to be some form of gay in order to enjoy touhou
  because it automaticly makes you gay when you make or post picture of touhou with switched gender
  all female touhou fans are dykes fags and dykes get along well
  i sold my heterosexuality to this
more please
  the games are fun
rumiakun  
  beautiful
  this is gay
glad we finally have a fag containment thread
  /jp/ is the fag containment board  stay seething though
  you have to go back
what a nice boy i want to take him to my house
  you have to kill yourself out of /jp/ faggot
  what for
its my time to shine
id still ravage most of these given the chance
  when did he make a parsee doujin
  not exactly parsee doujin but still wanted to see it also most likely nonh
i want to fill a boyhus tummy up with my semen
  if i post lewd cover will i get global ban collagen and that youmu artist comes to mind
i want to suck suwakos tadpole
  probably a global ban just on 4channel
  that heart  hnnng
  god i cant take it anymore i need to take him home and give him a good punding
  to give him a bath then have sex with him of course
    /jp/ please stop being so gay for little boys
  i cant i want to lick em all over
what are they gonna do to my boy
  im sorry but thats cookie
  this is the only one i would fug
  youre the gayest person in this thread
  nipples  see you in three days anon
  i want to kiss his nipples
is wanting to get mating pressed by a boyhu wrong
  who are you quoting
性転換男の娘ショタ aka cded rule 63 belong here  everything else 
  my bad 
okina is a boy
  not at all its completely natural
  expressing the desire of getting pregnant by cute boihus is the most natural of things
  faggots cant get pregnant
  sniff
  its called being boipregnant dude
  all of the homos moved to what
  fang
  getting pregnant by cute boihus  not getting cute boihus pregnant
every boihu is great

  fine taste
  tamura mayu for me
fellas i must say i really love renochan what a cutie she is so lovely
  fuck you because of you shes growing on me job well done
  its the opposite for me so it all evens out in the end
  there is no way this is mei  no way she was this pretty
  yes  its the 14 yo  shes beautiful
  you must be white
  risa is such a tight beauty
  she also has a fat butt
  shes still one of the lowest tier 3rd gens
  couldnt save this because of the shit quality how did you do it anon
  cant argue with that
  i started with a right click
be techi  dying inside
  but all idols are dying inside that is what makes them great
  false
what are her plans for the future
  more pbs her pb is close to hitting 75k less than 1k to go
maiyan touching asukas ass in a cm    
/3
  kawaii
who cares about techi
  me
    1 hour until bunshun clears the name of our girl the truth always comes out in the end haters on suicide watch
  she either did do it or she decided to run with slut girl angle to help her stand out either way it did work out on her end
  what happened
  they are revealing the truth behind the finger incident
  explain that finger incident
  anon she knows and is fine with it let the legend be true for her sake
  there is a predebut picture of her with a finger in her mouth
  so teenage girls acting like teenage girls is a scandal nowadays
  nice is that in shanghai
is techi looking better these days
  i already did months ago
  good evening indoanon
kubochan on tv seems to have been taken during her shrine visit    
waiting for ebin scandal
  fucking kawaii
  so how is it
  i miss goblinchan _
  nice look a bit like fumika baba
    shes such a cutie
  where do you think we are right now
so whats up with zukki
does the sole new hiragana count as the 3rd gen on her own that sounds pretty legendary either way thats what im gonna think of her as
  just like neru was a legendary hiragana
zukki who
  who is that next to nao
    
  kek i thought you were saying im gonna think of her ass
  i read the same
so 1 hiragana is worth 9 kanjis  that seems about right to me
now you remember marikorin  those new gen 4 busutachi made me forget my new oshimen
  cheers
  fucking busu
  that girl deserved the pb more than anyone
  she would keep that outfit on including heels while it happens
  so what happened to 25
  love you kyonko      love you naako    pic related  love you neru
        isnt it late at night in indonesia
  920 in the morning here
  ah i see what are you larping as this time
  hes australian
  if only she was photogenic
  firebro is the australian
  just living life here in the good old united states of america if youd like i can take a picture of the sunny sky just like last time someone pushed this issue
  based techichad
  he is indo because australia is a different timezone
  can you be any less subtle
  fuck yes
  didnt he get exposed yesterday i bet  is him
  yes he did
pretending to know everyone
  is she from hokkaido
  well thats also true
  that pic  this used to be me those were good times i wish i could go back to those times sorry for the offtopic post
  theres no worse feeling than going back to it and not knowing if you will make it back out
so whos the scandal girl
  the worst part about being unemployed for a few or more years is thinking about your future its always there in the back of your mind
whats going on with zukki
  the finger was that of a bf
  same i wish i had more free time but the lingering dread of no prospects hanging over you is not fun
  gasp
did kubogre get her teeth done which caused her hiatus her teeth looks better now
which one should i get
  right is lewder so that one
  if left is full bikini then left
  きょんこ大好きだ
  happy birthday
she looks like a honoka matsumoto doppelgänger
management needs to put some kind of heavyweight belt on mukai she/s too powerful
  thats why she looks familiar
  literally asking for it
  jesus christ
  made for rape debate me
  cant rape the willing
  shes prettier than her
keyaki performing at inazuma rock fes back in september        warning ded techi i think even rika outperformed her here
what do yo guys think of nogizakas slogan i hate it its making them look like a team of slavegirls keyakizakas slogan kindness humility the ties between us is so much better and humane not to mention its more accurate too
  we already saw it when you reposted this stage48 comment yesterday
  ruffling that otters hair
  shes an underrated cutie i hope she makes senbatsu someday
  i agree shes the 3rd best 3rd gen
  she wont under center is even a pipedream
waiting patiently for bemiho butt pics
wud u
    her fucking face after she accidentally says her name
  hard
  i dont own a car
  it was better with sawabe
  everybody love kazumin 
  lewd nibu when
they better not be saving that nervous girl until the last day i want to see her
  you will never protect her from kasgua
has anyone claimed hiragana oshi yet
  apparently an interview yone did revealed that she told the girls she was graduating before they did this performance so that may play a part in why things seem so down
  its always possible you never know what mngmt is planning and with the possibility of another graduation wave next year theres no telling what the group will look like
did the first keyabingo prank traumatise them
  was she stoned on this one too
konoka a cute
i want nijika to meet my puppy
  but todays the last day
  what sort of dog is it
  is this all of 4th gen if so the quality is lower than i expected
    my heart
  youve done it wrong here
  zukki clearly wants to do lewd things with kyonko
  10/10 upper lip her best feature by far
cant unsee  
havent watch this serie  worth it
  i thought it was shit
  3 more in a couple hours  im more curious about all the other girls allegedly staying on as trainees if they havent quit already
  no fun  no plot  no lewds
    ok thanks
  the last three had better be something special then if this new gen doesnt deliver then nogizaka is in trouble
  did the entirety of 3rd gen get fired while i went to the toilet
  3rd gen has a few good girls to be sure but overall it isnt that strong its certainly not enough to make up for the loss of important 1st gen members
  soon
  3rd gens are strong hard to make up for maiyan and other top 1st gen level but theyre doing pretty well all things considering especially compared to 2nd gen if anything i have a bad feeling that 4th gen will repeat the hardships that 2nd gen hadi dont see any of the popular 3rd gens being kick out in senbatsu in the favor of the new girls umezawa yamashita yoda and ōzono heck now that kubo has gotten her weight problems in check management will put her in senbatsu considering shes on the same level as those popular 3rd gens ito riria seems to have taken off too in popularity not much room for 4th gens their only hope is a big rush of grads next year or two but even then most of the spots will be taken by 3rd gens
  whoops meant to comment on the other poster
  not much room for 4th gens  i dont think thats going to be a problem theres going to be a lot more girls wanting to graduate than have made announcements so far if anything management has been holding them back
  i also think this is the case 2019 is going to be a sad year  i hope to god kazumin and sayunyan dont graduate
  this is my new oshi
  i actually think kazumin might stay she seems to have been putting a lot of effort into her career lately    i hope so at least
  kawaii      busu
  same with ikuta but i feel that they might be trying to get connections and get noticed for other jobs so that they can leave
    cute with high potential
  1 for her
well nervouschan turned out to be a dud
so wheres this black lass
akb will never  
  ikuta is perfect after all
  who
  
  kanagawa saya says shes confident she can do anything to the point of being reckless about it
  lotta talk let her do the bungee jump
  when was this  any higher quality version
  micute
do any of the new girls have previous history as idols
  i fall in love
    yeah im still betting that therell be 4 or 5 graduation announcements next year and shiraishi and matsumura will be among them ive often wondered if mngmt talked shiraishi into holding off her graduation plans that way they could get the 3rd gens trained up with plays music videos and a solo concert getting the fanbase familiar enough with them before she left i mean if thats the case it worked on me im a 3rd gen fan
  lovely ears
  what heart thing homie
  isnt hiragana having their single new girl introduced at the very end
  mtv unplugged ikuta erika look for it in ao
    yeah bananaman is gonna love her
  losslessly flipped  youre welcome
i still havent acknowledged the new gens i cant pick an oshimen yet
  ao  lol nope  
  wait neru was officially gen zero
  thanks  that ao fag is really annoying
show lewds already god fucking dammit
   ive often wondered if mngmt talked shiraishi into holding off her graduation plans  they definitely have management is probably putting down a lot of money for shiraishi to stay  even next year seems to be too soon for her to graduate though maybe she announces in 2019 and then graduates in 2020 something like that    matsumura  too crazy/desperate to leave
  super arigatou
  and to think she didnt even have the best voice in the group
  she has said before that she doesnt want to graduate until she gets to be center but i suppose that doesnt amount to much seeing that nishino centered this one because she was graduating
  maiyan recently said she is having the time of her life and doesnt want her time as an idol to end sayuringo is getting a decent amount of work so i dont see how shes any more desperate than any other senbatsu member
  just trying to help man
  why isnt she more popular shes so cute and damn would i want to destroy her every hole
  because elevens have shit taste
  nobody cares about back up dancers
  miho is good at teasing just look at her smile
  that started out as a lovely comment anon
we walked into the night   am i to bid you farewell
i love her
why nogi gets all the good girls as a hiraganafag i cant accept this
  im a nogifag and i wish we got this girl that youre getting desu
  are you a lesbian she looks kinda rough and lesbians tend to like them like that
  did any of her group mates come out in support of her they say bonds and shit in their mantra but they all seem to have gone radio silent about her scandal compare that to how the nogi members came out and supported matsumura and her situation was far worse
  the duty to her fans  the duty to her teammates    shida betrayed her fans and the girls know their priorities they did exactly what they should
  this
  busu    busu
  matsumura  too crazy/desperate to leave    fucked and selfsabotaged her own career so bad she probably wont leave so soon 199192 akb members will be her motivation to stay
  literally asking for it
  there she is
ohayou /saka/   its been a while since i last posted/followed anything sakamichi related did my girl make it
  she did unless shes one of the ones who dropped after but i doubt she did because at this point shes a keyaki and she seemed to like keyaki from what i recall
  great news i was hoping she would get into keyaki i might start following them again  and 35 chan her and 44 are the only ones i really cared about
first new kanjis will be shown tomorrow some people are going to lose their shit its gonna be hilarious cant wait
  she made it but rumor has it shes out but that may have been attached to one of the ones that have been disproven i dont remember which rumor that came with a few got the number for each group very wrong
  interesting thank you i guess we will find out soon enough 
  ill get my popcorn ready and ill be monitoring 4channel and 5ch also stage
  they already did   
  based manaka
  i like to think that momochan is another reason maiyan is sticking around a bit longer
  who is this qt
  poor himetan still one of my favorite webm though
  matsumura  crazy
  kitagawa yuri  
when you pull out of a job interview but land an even better one 6 months later  did someone on the inside give her the heads up  
    glad she joined nogi becase shed be out of place in kanji
  dont worry im sure kanji will get some shit as well
  discount yokochan bottom right
  you have discount eyes
  it isnt that strong  theres 4 of them that sell out every hs event already girls on the edge of senbatsu or unders in third gen are really popular too umezawa tamami riria etc theyre very strong and have been a big success ive only ever heard people downplay them here
      eroii
  high end escort like nanamin
  doesnt momoko do very well at hs events is she one of the 4
  is she one of the 4  could be but didnt this general laughed at momoko for being worse than kubo and not selling out her slots fast enough if not all of it hence being thrown out to the back row
  when do they show up on the shows
  this general
  sick and suppin a killer combo
  her eyes dont look level with each other
variety time
why dont they do these games with kanji is it because they think they will just huddle in a corner and cry instead of doing them properly
  cutest right there  image how cute our kids will look like
remember when the kanjis said they will form a band  guess who did it first
who can replace ikuta as nogis variety queen
  where is she going
  kekkon to me
  01 01 30/30 00 kubo shiori 2nd round sold out  01 01 30/30 00 yamashita mizuki 2nd round sold out  01 01 30/30 00 yoda yuki 2nd round sold out  17 16 25/25 00 umezawa minami 2nd round sold out  04 04 30/30 00 ozono momoko 3rd round sold out  08 08 30/30 00 ito riria 4th round sold out  08 08 30/30 00 sato kaede 4th round sold out  11 11 30/30 00 iwamoto renka 5th round sold out  15 15 30/30 00 sakaguchi tamami 7th round sold out    22 22 22/30 02 mukai hazuki  23 24 12/25 03 nakamura reno  25 25 06/30 02 yoshida ayano christie    she does sell well but mizuki umezawa yoda and kubo are a level above her in selling out faster 3rd gens overall are doing really well
  because no one would want to participate let alone give good reactions
  just wait for the new kanjis
sugai is so lovely
  yes
  me on the left
  i love reikas cute goofy face
naako is tiny
  remember when she used to be one of the cutest girls in the group why did she cut it
why is marikorin such a perfection lads
  she is still the cutest
  how did you rip them
images fromagestock 2018    
  use noscript
  post from 5ch
  they stopped being encrypted months ago
this is too good
i never loved an idol more than i love hiyotan
  so ready for new blood kanji needs it the most
  im ready for both gens to work towards a brighter future where multiple girls get their chance in spotlight and nobody is forced to single handedly carry a heavy burden until she breaks
im nervous for 2nd gen wota are autistic as fuck and kanji wota can take that even further i just hope they at least give the new girls a chance
  
imagine the senbatsu include kanji 2nd gen so this means that some 1st gen are left out  who do you think it is  and why is nijika
  that would be strange because although she is the worst hs seller she is one of the better dancers
  hnnnnnnnnngggggg
so subs never
  some dude will might come along no biggie would rather no subs than baby an emotionally fragile subber
  good points now im motivated to learn japanese thanks
unlike twitter and stagefaggots im openly welcoming the new gen fuck the hivemind cultists i just want the group to be interesting and relevant again not just we have bond and shieet and that makes us unique the group is clearly sinking and falling apart and some new members need to fix it my biggest fear is the old gen are being xenophobic again and hide in bathroom like a bunch of pathetic robot
i843jh9avmwphrv
  i wish there were more photos of her wearing each pair of those heels
  literally in the fucking literality literally who is this literalwho whore
  pic very related
  educate yourself on yoshi46 kouhai
  my new oshi her name is kotera mari
  yoshi46  who    kotera mari  literally who
  what episode is this i dont think i skipped any keyabingo but i dont remember seeing that seems like a great way to wreck your teeth
next week snack mao christmas edition  cant wait for real comfy times
  only if you bite the lead which is not what shes doing i think
  well im glad to see the 3rd gens doing well im a little worried for renochan though thanks for the info
  snack mao could be another hirgana show all on its own
for my kyonkobros
  cute thanks
kanji used to have their formations announced memberbymember in the studio during keyakake but eventually they switched to just dumping that information at the end of the episode  now that kanji will be having a real senbatsu will we get to see that on keyakake as it unfolds though i guess major spoilers would be posted here as soon as its broadcast
  though i guess major spoilers would be posted here as soon as its broadcast    i miss the old days when we watched keyakake in excitement to see the new single formation during their early days after somewhere in 2017 it just went downhill and people stop caring and posting bait like which show is better
  this general never recovered from the sea keyakizaka vs the world flame wars
    sakamichi general has changed  
  why wouldnt someone that is interested in the senbatsu watch it live or avoid the thread if they cant watch what do you mean major spoilers
  this place goes through 12 hour periods of being a kanji keyaki hate chamber
  damn son   reikas thighs
  cute and sexy at the same time
  what a cute mexican
    thai isnt it
for me its nen
so are tsuchida x sawabe the better mc than audrey
  based
  they do the best they can considering what they have to work with    
  hiraoshi showed that they care about the girls more not sure if that makes them better mcs
  its hard to tell tsuchida has more experience then all of them if that counts for anything and he seems more relaxed around people i wonder how excited tsuchida  sawabe are for the new member to appear on kakanei
goin all in on fuu
  just imagine the two mcs swapping althought i like audrey keya might not be watchable
  audrey are much better
  the thing is that hiragana and audrey are a really good match since most members like acting and audrey does too  i do think kanjis would have work much better with another mcs though
  since tsuchichan and sawabe have to handle with dumbidiotsbaka members i think tsuchisawabe are better
  sasshi once confronted tsuchida about how he treats keyakis compared to how he treated akbs when he worked with them  tsuchida straight up said he could not have treated them the same otherwise they would have withdrawn even further than they did he pretty much straight said they are an incredibly sensitive lot of girls  hes a smart dude with a lot of experience
  hes still not very funny
tfw its only a matter of time before our girl is out of senbatsu and fades into obscurity
  more like she will have more time for side projects  also neru permacenter would be great
i never did pick a kanji oshi these next few days may be interesting
  thats what you get for picking up a busu as an oshimen
do you remember her anon
  always
memi is 17 years ord
  おめおめ  shell forever be a 16 years old in my eyes
  god i love her so much
  mme
  yes
in a few more hours the new kanjis  hype
  i would pay good money to have katoshi punch me
ohayou
  gday mate
  seems the same as ever to me
  people stopped caring when they realized the center wasnt going to change
time to watch keyakitte raw
  why
  did a new sub group announce they were picking the show up if not might as well start learning nip now
  it was never dropped
  o_o
    instant body reaction
  i swear if they dont kiss during wakatsukis graduation event im gonna be mad
hope you guys can contain the sperging to a reasonable level in 3 hours
  no
  we dont need your permission to sperg about what we damn please
  that picture is perfect
whens the new hiragana
  in 3 days
  gone too soon
  i can fap to this
  cutie
joyful love was great
im a big fan of hiragana bt i really dont like saito kyoko
  shes a bit too much of an attention whore for my liking
  her attitude on the cooking episode ruined the whole thing for me
  seething because kyonko outshines his obsecure waifu  not her fault ya simp
  i bet mao smells bad and thats why everyone is giving her plenty of space
  in this moment memi realised just how much power she has over men
    i had the same thoughts until i saw how much she likes mao in her ramen show
  kawaii techi
  ushio  kanemura  kousaka  kumi    best girls
where are the new nogizaka46 members of today its past 12 now
  its kanjis turn
  there are none they are done  kanji keyaki is supposed to be today
    fuck ive been staying up for nothing then  well where are the new kanji i wanna laugh before heading to bed
who is the most underrated hiragana and why is it my oshi kawata hina chan
  its been cancelled go to bed
  i like her good taste anon
  the state of the keyakifags kek
i guess she is safe for another week
  lets just say that bunshuns family will get better christmas present now
the presentation of the new generation was canceled   because chocoman threatened to commit suicide    pic related 
  serarin
i want my new kanjichans
  24chans probably gonna be my first kanji oshi
  i still want 29 21 and 41
  71  78  harada aoi  to make the brown unit
  she wastes no time
all nine new kanji members to go to hiragana instead after a majority of the kanji members protested and begged management not to add the new members apparently sugai nen and neru were the only members open to adding the new members
tpathological liar
  funny enough a few weeks back she met maimai when she was interviewing actors in some award ceremony    
when were you when kanji dies  i was sat at home drinking ocha when akip ring  kanji is kill  no
          made for the savage yet passionate kisses of white men
wake up  still no 2nd gen    where is my new kanji aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  if you ever feel disappointed towards us believe me we also have the same feelings towards some people out there were doing all of this because of our love towards the idol yet some of you seems cant understand that so whats the point of doing all of that
they should mix half the girls from nogichuu and keyakitte/oshi for a couple of special episodes and have them compete or fight to the death or something
  in bikini
  i think shitarasan suggested a battle royale once
  that would just put kanji on blast for being so bad at variety they already cant compete with hiragana without losing every time
  each of the mcs could pick a handful of girls from any group  of course the losers would be forced to graduate
  
  yfw maiyan loses on purpose
alien vs predator vol 3  mana pls
  looks like they tried to clone oda but fucked it up
i just woke up whats the verdict on the new kanji members
  all of them are hot and ready for mizugi gravure
  they all declined
miho offshot now
threadly reminder that depressing subs still have 2 out of 4 translators and the rest of the staff is intact
  looks like yoda 3
  actually wanting more of that horrible translation with poor english  id rather watch it raw than being held hostage by some selfentitled southeast asian pieces of shit full of selfimportance and bluster
28 more days until that bitch nanase fucks off forever
this mad because no one cares about his tantrum    lol
  she is becoming too stunning to ignore my new oshi reminds me of nanamin too
is kakenai interesting to watch again from the screenshots and webms it looks fun
  gameshow episodes yes  talkshow episodes no  location epsiodes depends on the girls they sent there
  reminder that they stopped subbing 46hour live because their fans complained in the comments that it was boring
if i unsubscribe to a girls mobame can i still view older messages  i cant keep up anymore
  save them first
  good other subbing team with different fans should have picked it up then
  harry is a lucky guy
what are people saying from the 4th gen hs reports
  subscribe from      is there an easy way taking screenshots and record screen and audio would literally take me forever im already 226 messages behind on kyonko
  unsubscribe  sorry not sleeping well these days
  is there an easy way  nope
seriously where the fuck are the new kanji girls kanji management please do your job and stop being lazy loser if you want to be relevant and compete with nogi and hiragana
kanji management is a shitshow   it reflects onto kanji keyakizka     really activates the almonds
  blame techi she doesnt want any new members to take her spotlight
  was there a hs event already
  nani
  wow ok
  yuri  whats going on
management withhold the new kanji members announcement because some extreme fans were reportedly threatening them that they would slit their wrists and kill themselves if management accepted new members theres a rumor going around that the mastermind behind this outrageous wave of protests is the eternal kanji center hirate yurina
news in 8 minutes
  why news at 9pm jst
is happening
  slim nijika
disappointed of the 3 girls  no oshi material 
  this girl is very good looking
      our saviours are cute _
      cute
    aaaaahhhh who is this angel
wtf why does nogi always get better girls  this is unfair
  17    20    16
depressing quitter salty because thread liked the girls    looool
  karin
  traditional japanese beauty      standard saka idol      female oriented
  first is inoue rina and second is seki yumiko

  setou kaichou bijin    ojousama bijin    futsu ni busu
  a bit plain but totally in my strike zone would date     totally my type would madly fall in love   not my type but she seems shed make a cute imouto     the new members are strong finally i can drop  some old kanji members
i take back my words am gonna start subbing again
  she is sleeping next to me wanna leave a message
yumiko was a model  
  rude but true
  cutie
      brings more beauty to the group and killed a half assed subber   i love this girls so fucking much
third girl reminds me of hkt aoi
but how many of them are not virgin
  is there a possibility that she could be in hiragana or we already know who will be in hiragana
  she was a bit chubby but now shes perfect cant wait to see her in front of camera
  this girl looks too plastic
  busu
  agree
  it has to be 24
we didnt get this meta posting cringey brand wars when nogis 4th gen were revealed why when the new keyakis finally are here we get those
  my feelings on the 2nd gen sorry maybe ill come back and delete this later surely many people disagree yet i cant stop this bitter feeling
  subbers are the worst
how do you choose your new oshi/secondary oshi i usually based on their personalities and especially their favorite senpai for example manamo and paripi are my oshi in hiragana 2nd gen because both of them are nenoshi well that aside im glad i picked them because they turned to be interesting individuals probably ill do the same with new kanji ill wait to see which girl is the most close with my main oshi
  its a feeling they choose you i dont pick like you and force myself to like someone
  cutefunny oshi1  cutelewdoshi 2  just cutethe bench oshis
new thread    
  cutie
its her turn
  not this picture again
  its her bum
mio on the front page
  what do you mean
me as mio
  for what
heyi remember this thread
  from where
  for womb petting
  how do you do that
  are you asking for real
  yes
  theres two ways shove your fist in her vagina and caress her cervix or shove it un her ass and pat her womb from her colon
  mios navel
  what about it
  yes
  i dont get it
  that sounds painful
  if i were mio id love to have it teased  and jizzed
  you want to be a slut
  everyone wants to be loved
  everyone can see her panties
  is she wearing any
  not true the person who took this picture clearly cannot
  why wouldnt she
does she shave her cunt
  no but she shaves rins
  some idols rarely do
  such as
  haruka mirai fred tomoka
  she is a big girl
  for me
  tomoka
  yep im nibbling these toes
  yes
a cute
  what do we do with her
  give her headpats and belly rubs
mio and the boys
  which one of the boys am i
  my thoughts exactly how do you hope she reacts
  why is everyone so sweaty
  embarrassed
  because of mio and they are going to make her take responsibility
  what do you mean
  with her body
  i still dont understand
  do you want me to show you after class
i want to gangbang mio with /jp/
  please do
  i do not agree
  we didnt ask you mio       minx
  why not
anal sex with mio
  didnt we have this thread already
  is it a good butt
kissing mios cervix with my penis
shell fall in love
i would rape mio without remorse
  isnt that sex
  besides being poetry sometimes
  whom would you rape with remorse
  how could you
  sometimes  how can it be sometimes
  but she poops from there
would you
best passion idol
  you know i would
  are you sure
  i want to into that ass
mio is a slut
  a kind of girl who likes men to sink their fingers in her soft tits
  fake miki
  whats happening here
  drunk mio wanting hard breast massages
  shes getting fucked
  shes getting wwwhat
i bet hard breast massages feel real nice
  benis in vagoo
  how do you know
  i assume girls sure seem to love em
does mio wear black underwear
  girls sure seem to love em  is that true
  one way to find out preferably in a crowded public transport    but yes generally speaking they do
  the more you know
  the more you grope
  sachi is not for rape sachi is for ignoring till she cries
mio is sweet
  and i love her grin there shes getting confident    what would you do with your sweet mio
  i think we all know what we would do with mio
  i like the way you think
  is this cropped
  nope  
  damn i was hoping for more
  clownfeet
  are these ladies pure
  four mios
  i didnt know you snapped a picture of me
  mio
  does mio secretly post on /jp/
  what would she think of the posts in this thread
  shlick all flustered with masochistic fantasies    extra so for all the loveydovey posts
  just mio
  those hags arent virgins
  nope
  party
if i were mio everyone would get a go    but if i were mios classmate id make her only mine
  rin and uzuki get to share the changing room with mio every day
  what about it
   they get to inhale each others postworkout girl sweat     they get to talk about boys while feeling confidential and frisky     they might even practice kissing and/or groping just for case some handsome boy confesses to them    i wish to be one of them
  sweet jesus
  mio ah see ya wink at me
  which one in particular
  what would be your choice
  _rin_ so i could cop a feel
  imagine the delicious smell
  ill be mio then  if you cop a feel after the first shock i might surprisekiss you mio loves her friend shiburin
  thats mio not jesus
    why is sweat so appealing i absolutely love it
  you cant prove that      so many things it implies physical activity maybe even sex     its different from the ideal and sanctioned image   people want to project so its also intimate    and it smells and tastes and feels so fucking good
  だらしない
  this is so damn sexy and very nice in so many ways
  isnt mio always sexy and nice
  the most when shes in my hug  or on her knees    all dolled up like in that picture
  why would she be on her knees
  to display proper deference
  all these nice images of mio really make me wanna be her for a week or so
  damn she actually look fine as ol
  only a week
  i love this picture the sexual tension is palpable
  that dress      maybe two
  what about it
  its wonderful the whole outfit is stockings that necklace elegant earrings and those vulnerable shoulders and cleavage    they turn our mio that genki brat into a beautiful and classy young lady for dirty fucking
  cute
  consensual
  most of the time
  which answer would you prefer
  _consensual__
  i love that artist
  why
  who is that on the left
  purple underwear huh
  you or me or whomever mio loves a lot      good choice of idols nice fashion styles a good level of eroticness
  thats a big hand
mio and mioanons    i love you all
  for mio
  want them to press their breasts together
  what do you mean
  probably for everyone
63 days  jesus  i dont particularly dislike mio but her rape doujins are awesome theres something nice about short curly haired spunky girl getting rammed against her will
  not everyone is mio though
  i read that as against the wall
  you sound like a bad man
  just say no to fake mikis
  mio doesnt have the ahoge
  mios gonna geddit
  i like your train of thought
  mio doesnt have stds
  throw in some nonconsensual deep kissing too
  nonconsensual  no
  nonconsensual kisses are among the most romantic tho
  mio is only for rough vanilla
  how rough and how vanilla
happy birthday
happy birthday miochan

  tumblr file name  some slut that isnt a touhou  bullying you to death
  someone post the kappas
  i love these nameless gals
there is also the suzunaan kappas post them now
who are these me not read the manga
  another brand of onaholes
  simmer down
  generic tanuki and kappa
    frecklestopknotblondepigtails
  how were these generic tanuki introduced what did they do
  begone trash rats
  tanuki arent raccoons but okay secondarykun
  this image is a concise description of their role in the story
danuki dddd
  tame the tanukis with cheek squishing
  someone post the fairy maid trio
i hate tanukis so much
  behead those who bully the hermit
  i love tanukis so much
    tanuki is already plural you dumb dumbs
  were speaking english here not japspeak
  and tanuki is a japanese word do you also say sushis no
  oh youre not supposed to say sushis
how much xp does killing one give
which one do you like
  the cutest
  i love the short dark hair one
  are these tanuki stronger than any stage 1/stage 2 2hu would mamizou be able to turn them into shikigami and if so how much stronger would they be
  they cant even speak properly they probably cant form danmaku  mamizou just gave them a template to pretend theyre her daughters
  too cute
  i think the only 2hu related game that has random tanuki friends of mamizou as enemies is genso wanderer and there they give 117 exp because they are special shop related npcs
friendly reminder mamizou is the best 2hu
  i thought they were kons at first glance
my nameless onaholes
  you are a tertiary like all english language fans fucking idiot
  tanuki stink and are therefore not worthy of the title of onahole
  my nameless meat toilets
  thats better yes
  the cutest meat toilets
  stay mad secondary eop retard
  ah but theres no need to pretend theyre her daughters when i can just make tons of babies with her
  thats my wife youre talking about dude
  surely were talking about different persons
  correct
  im not so sure  gotta need more visual evidence
  you can tell how much perfect a girl is by how much her smile shines
  source on the full pic
  
being sexually preyed on by momizou
  accidentally calling her momizou and getting teased even more
imagine the smell
  i wanna sniff mamizous sweaty tail
  i want to rub her cute feet
  i want mamizou to make fun of my shitty nihongo
ill never stop hating this hag and what she did to poor kosuzu
  die
  what did the hag do to poor kosuzu
  this  
  fuck off aya youre no different
  but kosuzu loves mamizou just like us
  vtuber are leaking now fuck this shit
  youd think 5 threads a day would be enough for them
  i want to smooch those qt feet
  you arent even kidding they had 4 threads this morning
  i wanna lick those slim legs of her
  tertiary faggots like you dont get to complain about other tertiary faggots
  fairy maid trio  bonus points to the one who can produce the manga image they were sourced from
i mean the three fairies have just found a dog
  that was surprisingly cute
  that too id worship her from head to toe
  at least this time its not a fearsome wolf
  i dont care about the shenanigans of other notatall maid fairies
  whatever do you mean
  kiss it anon
  
  would rape
  smooch
  i wonder if she kept the character designs no matter how i look at it its just the glasses girl that remained
  would kiss her cute feet and belly
  insulting tanuki by calling them raccoons is a really simple joke anon
  well i think having a hobby like that is okay  i do

brosthe thread on /vg/ is gone
is it worth it to invest in the regular traitor cat if i already have kyouka and illya
  more mages is always welcome so absolutely yes
  okay man im glad that her fragments are so easy to get
  dont forget her new unique equipment that makes her pretty nice
yuuki is taking care of twin babies in christmas chikas first story  what kind of parents puts vr headsets onto infants
  im absolutely sure the redive world must be a different world and the real world was actually remade/destroyed it makes no sense other way
someone tell me about the game with the cutest girls
  7/9 of the current posts are about it
ok so can irl shinobu actually see ghosts or is she just batshit insane
  great and whats the name of the game then
  she can she was able to see miyako irl while shes invisible
  hes talking about princess connect redive but theres a lot of other games with super cute girls like alternative girls shironeko project houkai impact among others
  thanks i guess for now ill check out princess connect
  imagine fucking shinobu while she mentions that all of her and your family members are watching
i went to the link in the op and followed that to download the apk for princess connect and for some reason it opens but stays on the cygames screen and then closes any tips
  phone or emu
  using nox
  they killed emulators for priconne so its not going to run try one of the emulators that hide their root or are used for games that have strong antiroot measures instead
  what a sad day recommend me your favorite game then that works on emulators
  princess connect has a pc client through dmm that runs a million times smoother than any emuilator you just wont be able to reroll in the dmm client    but for other games try the other ones i mentioned here  if you want
  you dont need an emulator for priconne go to the priconne website and click the dmm button itll download the dmm client for your pc and you can play it straight up on your pc without an emulator
  hot
zerida a cute
predictions for xmas and ny characters hoping for some tsukimi love
  im pretty torn about it on one hand id love to see alts for characters i love but on the other id rather the chance to save up jewels to roll on whatever powercreep mechanic they put out after xmas/ny
  almost guaranteed to happen asaip usually tries to obsolete everyone around the end of january every single christmas or ny character was pretty much put out of commission shortly after they were released for 2 years now    this time i wonder how theyre going to top cc
  hoping for new mireiile  expecting almost definitely not that
  pretty much being xmas/ny is suffering because theyre the very definition of bait
  go remake your /vg/ thread
  bro dont be like that
you guys told me kyaru was safe from granblue shenanigans    why would you guys lie to me
  rip gran going to get backstabbed by this traitor cat
battle of the silent characters intensifies
  no words are spoken  please tell me all of the episodes for this guy are like that
used to enjoy game  powercreep balancing just makes you angry when playing it  nothing pleasant ever lasts
  if you mean these cutscenes yeah in the end he shows off how much of a bad ass he is by taking out some monsters
  kyaru looks extra cute in gbf
kyaru  cute  
  shes kind of cute too bad her heart is rotten
  rotten girls are the best
christmas kurumi looks like gbf yugu
this will be the first western mobage that is a big success in japan prove me wrong
  does pogo count as western
reindeer rima when
  no
yuuki is voiced by touma  lives with a loli like touma  amnesiac just like touma  knows lots of girls that want to fuck him like touma  nice and supportive guy like touma  anti 7 crowns just like imagine breaker
  knows lots of girls that want to fuck him
  yes but is he an advocate of equality
  he doesnt hesitate to beat up girls like muimi or christina and doesnt mind going on dates with boys like yuki
  hoping for a broken sarah which will never happen more lumie would be good too but at least christmas seems unlikely since she got a card in shironeko tcg and these things barely ever overlap i really hope nagi gets something she should have a solid chance to come back its been long enough since her debut was useful enough for a while is cute enough and still stuck at her first version only but then again she got her own dragon attached to her and it would make a lot of sense to make her dragon rider next so maybe theyll save that for a separate story and not these seasonal gatherings so who knows    ny eagerly waiting for warmly dressed sheryl    but well probably get a christmas ciela or something although id take that too
the real protectors of kishikun
  leave kishikun to me
  still 10 days until next gacha  last collab coop tomorrow and new weekend boss this friday  i wonder what filler event which they are going to do from next monday until next thursday
is xmas kurumi good gotta know if i should farm her shards or just leave her at 3
which princesses would be good mothers
the cutest sexiest and most beautiful umbrella in history
i want to cuddle up with her and warm our bodies together
i want to walk in the snow with her
post the 3d glasses one
the ultimate spook
yes she is
trash should be properly discarded
  i wouldnt put kogasa in the recycling bin because only useful trash goes in there
the scariest
  and also because kogasa isnt trash
  exactly shes garbage
imagine kogasa trying to give paizuri wouldnt that be funny her desperately trying pushing what little breast she has together to the extent that it is hurting her she looks up at you with weak hopeful eyes looking for any sign that shes providing satisfaction clinging onto the delusion that kogasa can do anything if she tries but alas her pathetic attempt gave no such pleasure    boredom sets in and you grow soft noticing this she speeds up uttering under her breath her sad mantra    she stops with her head bent down starts sniffling how lame    kogasa is truly useless
  but shes got the big titties
boing
why does everyone want to bully kogasa
kogasa tripped on two packets of ketchup which made her fall down and get ketchup on her knees and feet she was very upset but a few seconds later a kind anon came by and took her home out of the rain he dried her off and gave her numerous headpats which calmed her down later when she was feeling better she jumped and and yelled boo to scare her new friend he went ahgrhgrhgrghrghrhg you scared me she was very pleased kogasa went on to lead a very happy life devoid of any pain or suffering    the end
  she has the loser gene like marty mcfly
  id let kogasas belly button eat my head
  kogasa is built for lasting love and affection    and impregnation
   she is really good with kids
kogasa is the cutest even as a boy
umbrella paizuri
umbrella ballzuri
  heterochromia is cute cute
imagine kogasa scaring someone so bad that the person have a heartattack cause of her imagine how kogasa would feel about that
say goodbye to your spirit
  i want to spend the rest of my life with her
why does this umbrella have such a fat ass
  so she can sit comfortably
  but shes an umbrella surely shes very light
  maybe its so you could hold her upside down and use her butt as an umbrella
  its a surprisingly big butt huh
all i want for christmas is loveydovey marital impregnation sex
test
it getting colder remember to stay warm
  isnt even that big
kogasa have two thread she doing great i am glad she is getting so much loved  
  you bet
spooky
kogasas honkin honkers milky melons
ii want to see an umbrellas panties
shes good with kids
  i want to /ss/ with kogasa
    i want you to fuck off forever and take your shit fetishes with you
  you got the dube lole
i want to fondle an umbrellas breasts
stop sexually harassing the umbrella
the greatest honor any one man could have
  imagine unironically drawing this

  i never said she wasnt pure she could very well have no idea what masturbation is and just innocently be doing it because it feels good
  have you been letting lillith inside your head again you stooge
  you want scorching hot coffee being served straight your mouth
  pure pure
so nanoka
  taking innocent little rumia into a dark corner where no one can see us
  i think rumia is the one taking that innocent man into a dark corner
  all girls her age love a good chin chin evey now and themore like all the time
  i want to let rumia play with my chin chin as much as she wants
  uhhh nanowhat
  just dont let her get peckish and bite off your package
  yes but it has been filtered
  koko
  manko
why so much mankoposting  just say cunny you all go on about rumia being the honorary fairy most times
  my stance on feeding you all to rumia still stands
  as long as i get to ram her little cunny im fine with that
  little girls in pantyhoses might be my biggest weakness
  in another world despite being the hero the enemy monsters have firmly grasped my weakness
  i wish rumia would firmly grasp my weakness with her thighs
  deal i want to become nutrients in her bloodstream and be absorbed into her loli tissues
i want to lose to rumia in a danmaku battle and sustain her existence via faith as facilitated by the spellcard rules without losing my life and over time provide more value to her than a meal would
  sustain her existence via faith  you cant do that dude rumia is a youkai
  poor mystia she just got cannibalized
  lucky mystia
  please dont make a joke of mystia being eaten alive
  then fear then again faith is just a kind of fear
  i wish i were mystia
  id settle for being rumia and eating anons
  i know
  id fondle your sexy little girl body if you tried to eat me
  that would be the next best thing      this anon knows whats good
  if this is a trade sure
  good doujin
one two three time to fall in the dark
  it only just now occurred to me that shes supposed to look like an albino
  actually meant for 
  guuuhhh that is so cute
    i wish that was me
  i wish i was rumia too
  i wish i was rumias prey
  i wonder what the reason behind the rumia upskirt meme is besides lolicon disease i mean
  lolicon is not a disease its perfectly normal to be aroused by lolis
    stuff like this i mean     パンツ      wanting to bury your face into rumias panties and die is a disorder
  i cant quite tell what daichan is thinking here
  she seems to be aroused
where can i find the mmd models for rumia
  thats a very good question she is rarely seen in mmds japanese or western she is featured in the cirnos perfect math class mmd version which is incredibly well made  the uploader probably linked it at the end of the video/ description box i would link but my ps3  wont let me hope this helps
    i use this one for lewd time with rumia in vr
  that doesnt mean she doesnt have at least a couple models
  also 
  filename  well shes wrong
poor rumia no one ever talks about anything other than how much they want to have sex with her or some sort of edgy fantasy about her being a sealed up superboss
  some sort of edgy fantasy about her being a sealed up superboss  or people really liked the idea of rumia oneechan shes insanely cute regardless and shes somehow managed to be in the middle of the top 50 most popular 2hus for more than a decade now
  not like theres fucking anything else to talk about shes an irrelevant stage 1 boss only popular because she appeared in eosd
  osana reimu was pretty good  why does reireimu have to exist fuck
  reireimu was alright  and pic related made me start crying like a bitch even though its been years since i last saw it
  theres also the occasional freak who fantasizes about being eaten by her

what is the appeal of touhou  ive never understood it
  cute girls
you seriously asking that question here on jay
    dont manga have form and substance though while this is just form dont you guys get tired of the same girls over the years waifus aside i mean with manga or vn you get a new batch of relevant girls with every title why fixate on these random ones
  genuinely curious of course not flameb8ing
flan
cute girls    interesting and fun setting
  fun games lots of characters with unique designs and entertaining personalities great music and interesting lore
  i mean with manga or vn you get a new batch of relevant girls with every title  the fuck is that sentence touhou get new games ost lore and girls every 2 years
more fan content than you could ever consume in a single lifetime
it is good
it can be anything some people are just in it for the characters some prefer the music over all else and some actually do enjoy the gameplay a lot and what do you know some like a combination of elements or even just everything about touhou and its an evolving franchise so theres always something new in one of those areas so the same reasons anyone likes any series really what answer were you expecting
  why would you get tired of the same girls its hard to emotively connect with characters if youre never going to see them again outside of their introductory work they wont have much fanart either theres so much fanart for 2hu that you can get high off the moe almost indefinitely and theres plenty of porn for them all too they arent random at all unless youre new to 2hu
  is this a jam project reference
  why fixate on these random ones  a lot of the fandom is basically the equivalent of a genwunner from pokemon  theyve already imprinted on the group of characters that existed when they first got into touhou/when it was the most popular in the west 20042008 so embodiment of scarlet devil through subterranean animism and barring a few exceptions think the touhou equivalent of lucario garchomp sylveon etc everything after sa is largely irrelevant to the western fandom so that is why when you browse 4chan/nel you mostly see the girls from that era of games
  part of charactercentric fictions is to make up for feelings of loneliness and isolation something that isnt unique to either neets or productive people inb4 if you feel like theres either very few or no people you can completely trust and count on in real life and very few or even none in real life that you feel like understand you then in fiction you can seek out characters who you wish you could know in real life characters who understand what youre going through and have similar experiences characters you can relate to surrogate personal contact which is lost if you jump from one set of characters to another pump and dump entertainment like the people who see characters as little more than a storys puppets do
cute little girls and the erodoujins that follows    my favorite aspect is the fanmade music though i love me some eastnewsounds or spacelectro remixes
  明日を取り戻すんだ  ｇｏｎｇ鳴らせ  gensou shoujo taisen ending at ufo was fucking painful to me miko is my favorite touhou character ever and i really wanted to see gsts take on her
  /thread they also have good designs
  damn that girl is cute what touhou game is she from
op here sorry fell asleep hte massreplying but it would be too impractical to do otherwise at this point    ah didnt know this since people almost always spam the same girls    it seems like a lot of people are into the characters more than the game itself which i found odd due to the supposed lack of a canonical storyline should have specified this my bad    i guess what i meant by random was that theyre a collection of decent but arguably typical moe designs so it was hard for me to see why someone would prefer them over more nuanced character designs that cater to the more esoteric aspects of ones tastes or how they see touhou girls as different from the runofthemill    this explains a lot thanks    this makes sense too so instead of waifus famuris
i like the porn
  a lot of touhous have this weird unique charm to them that stands out from other anime girls theyre all designed and drawn by one dude who also does the music level design and programming of each game the characters in touhou arent really designed to appeal to otakus they have this weird doll vibe to their art its different from runofthemill because you simply cant find character designs like touhou anywhere else maybe its different because zun isnt really an artist    theyre definitely cute but you cant find something like pic related like anything else pic related is reimu from the 11th touhou game
the amazing spectacle of one very drunk man who somehow manages to get even worse at drawing the more he does it
  which i found odd due to the supposed lack of a canonical storyline  not everyone is invested in touhou lore but there are certainly some who care enought about it ex    people like touhou for different reasons
  it seems like a lot of people are into the characters more than the game itself  as id wager most people get exposed to touhou through means other than the games they will usually try one of them and usually just give up since theyre not exactly the easiest games out there     personally i found touhou through music and i do play the games sometimes got a few 1ccs on normal so nothing that impressive      someone needs to buy him a scanner
  ah the idiosyncrasies doesnt often seem to make it into the fanart that is interesting sort of reminds me of the original higurashi
  東方金儲記  amusement of miniature
  the characters in touhou arent really designed to appeal to otakus  thats like saying zun isnt an otaku and doesnt design them to appeal to himself he obviously had a thing for feet and lolita doll/styles as well as young girls     i also dont think zuns art is that special but then i spend way way more time playing doujin games than most of /jp/ or touhou fans so i see all kinds of cute/shitty art from doujin groups its way better than a lot of vn art though
  the best word to describe touhou would be inspiring  it inspires scores of doujins to be written remixes to be produced and fangames to be programmed  the games themselves are just roots the community surrounding touhou is what produces the real fruit
  i meant most touhou characters arent designed like usual anime girls most of them dont show much skin cleavage etc its not like kantai or anything dumb bullshit like that zun def likes dolls and shit but its probably just his aesthetic
  some fanart tries to imitate the style with varying degrees of success  but yeah the bulk of it is off model
  like usual anime girls   show much skin cleavage etc  you watch too much trash not enough magical girl
    also kancer girls dont really show that much skin you act like touhou girls are muslims or something
the huge number of fanworks
  stop using reaction images on the jay thank you
  the most offmodel thing artfags do is draw huge tits on flat characters
wahh is kinda funny but other than that i only like aocf
  shionfag detected consider suicide
  actually a reimufag
  touhou reaction images arent approved on the jay
  reaction images arent really a thing here
  you must be new here
  reimuware touched
  im not sure why the fuck you look for those kind of connections in something in touhou considering how most of the characters are flawed anti heroes at best literal sociopathic supernatural monsters at worst with everything in between being pretty terrible people as well i cant think of any touhou character i would want to meet in real life
  its also hard to emotionally connect with characters if they never change unless a actual story is being told and characters change as a result then the only thing you actually like is essentially a archetype
  came here to say this good job
  its also hard to emotionally connect with characters if they never change  why do you say that most humans dont actually experience major change but that doesnt prevent emotional connection people fall in love with the touhou characters based on their designs backstories music interactions in canon and/or depictions in doujin works
  i dont really know for sure i really liked the prehm fighters a lot but due to circumstance dont get to play with others a lot danmaku bores me honestly its not the games    i guess for me its the literature and the doujin scene that keeps me coming back i learned japanese just so i could read more of them and am now translating the ones i like so that other anons can enjoy what ive enjoyed too
  music story characters and surprisingly none of the standards of most anime type shit no fanservice no yuri each thing about it has a generally very strange premise the main characters are bad people etc
  observe the occasional or more frequent sort threads to see how many people like many different characters    reposts are just the way of 4chan
  fun cute soft
  in a similar vein as pokemon 2hu appeals to the autistic desire to collect and categorize information/process data that exists within all of us we dont call ourselves /jp/sies for nothing  t didnt start speaking until age four used to make castles out of vhs tapes before my parents bought me legos and studying computer engineering
  humans change constantly beside child raising and sex one of the biggest appeals of marriage is growing old with somebody characters start to feel unreal and stop being for lack of a better description human when they dont change and always remain the same
  again youre trying to place story as supreme and tying the ability to connect with characters to it but i dont see it at all people fall in love with unreachable ideals and concepts all the time no humanity required nevermind that this entire argument rests upon a false premise that touhou doesnt have any story to it and is merely an ensemble of characters
  i cant think of any touhou character i would want to meet in real life  fucked up people tend to end up with fucked up people fucked up people find fucked up people plenty relatable why do you think evas cast is so loved  you a pure lore baka it seems
  this is the true     characters start to feel unreal  sounds like a lack of imagination desu ne whos to say they dont develop fuck as somebody who spends the majority of time coming up with fiction bullshit the idea of the characters not growing and developing alongside you is a solid sign that your characters would be a shit if you went up the fiction route interaction with the 2hus via imagination and reading/viewing/playing works that depict different interpretations of them and trying to figure out what is true what is not what is debatable about their character and self is essentially surrogate hanging out or living together its like spending time around someone else you cant not learn about them even if youre just together five minutes
  you mean cute and funny toehoes
  touhou has a story but that story is little more than a method to introduce more characters and while its true that people fall in love with ideals and concepts all the time characters are neither      im a fucked up person and i want to get away from other fucked up people like there are touhou characters i do genuinely like but i wouldnt want to actually interact with any of them
  im not going to excuse weaknesses in the writing with fanwork touhou is a story and im here to be entertained i dont want to establish some kind of weird surrogate friend relationship with a cast made up mostly of sociopaths and assholes this has nothing to do with a lack of imagination either if i wanted to use my imagination there are thousands of other far more productive things i could be doing with my time than reading/watching/playing touhou fan content
  the gameplay is the main appeal to me controlling a flying girl instead of a spaceship in a bullet hell with a priority on esthetic patterns and the fanservice is almost inexistant which is a good thing for me
  there are thousands of other far more productive things i could be doing with my time than reading/watching/playing touhou fan content  nobody force you bye
  i dont want to establish some kind of weird surrogate relationship with characters  this is the point of about 90 of otaku media
  touhou is a story  uhhh no touhou is a videogame series first
  different strokes for different folks do you prefer to turn your brain off when consuming entertainment not bait genuine question
  that still doesnt change my criticism of touhou as a story      thats why i dont like most otaku media i also dont view touhou as otaku media because i  dont actually think thats what its trying to accomplish      i would say its a excuse for making music even before its a video games series nonetheless as a story i want to be entertained      i do not but i also dont watch/read stories to imagine character development if i wanted to use my imagination i would just use my imagination preferably in a way that i could actually sell
  its a excuse for making music even before its a video games series  it is still if you want to be mainly entertained play the games
  is it really that weird that i expect to be entertained when i read canon touhou works
  the games have enough of what could be called a passible coherent story to give enough for the fanbase to do fuck all withthere are a lot of lose events that occur that are strung together which the fanbase can and does fill in all the time for that reason it is easy for anyone to pick up imagine something and plot it down without wow u retard thats not cannon fuckwad so long as you write something half decent    also cute girls challenging yet fun games and a ton of good music
  those works are mainly world building and character interaction again play the games
  sure i myself like the gameplay world building and music that zun does but i personally find its themes in japanese folklore and religion interesting because i did not know a lot about them before touhou sure there are lots of other media to learn about them but touhou is the best one with cute girls this next thing is actually pretty weird but touhou actually made me learn more about my own countrys folklore since i became more interested in it after seeing zuns interpretation of his cultures folklore so nowadays touhou holds a bit of a special place in my heart although i have become less interested in the series
  to add on    touhou works because unlike some other series zun struck gold and did what not many do and took a hands off approach by doing this you allow the fanbase to go fuck all with it while all you need to do is write a minimal story backbone for whoever or what ever to fill in had zun clamped down on his works touhou would probably stopped after the first few games easily there are a few similar fanbases out there were the creator just lets the fans run with it and they tend to live on long and hard inbetween actual creator content
  im not really sure i get your criticism what exactly is it that the story is thin/the characters dont develop    largely touhou is episodic to the games slice of life or mystery to the manga all but mystery are pretty cut and dry you like it or you dont that said the storylines of recent games have been pretty compelling but even if earlier ones were often straightforward that doesnt make them bad in any way a story doesnt need to be more than simple in order to be good    as for character theres nothing wrong with static ones lets ignore the youkai in the series for the most part as youkai being consistently youkai is what makes them youkai look at reimu and marisa then marisa actually does go through changes and although shes rather silly shows herself to be the more mature/responsible of the two over time as for reimu unironically what makes her interesting is that shes static ill never really get why character development always good is a common opinion reimus character being firm unyieldingly her is both the source of her strength and the source of her appeal shes an uncompromising person based on her own values and judgments well largely uncompromising its amusing and compelling because its weird reimu is incredibly weird when you look at the fact that her worldview is keep the world as it is even though that definitely means keep humanity oppressed/youkai satisfied at least to a degree the real idea is the push and pull balance of their world maybe she just wants to keep fantasy alive but at any rate she does as she feels she must above all else    that said no character development isnt much of a thing in touhou and i dont see why it ought to be to prove quality or to prove it as interesting or something a shitload of characters are incredibly interesting at least one legitimately shows significant and subtle development over real time years turning from a standoffish cunt to a heroic figure willing to defy her master not out of cowardice as before but out of a sense of moral obligation to her new home reisen    if you want to examine even one character even from early in the series who is extremely complex but hasnt changed since her appearance look at ibuki suika essentially once upon a time one of gensokyos four queens led an exodus out of the land because her people were being slaughtered by humans crafting an excuse that oni were simply bored with gensokyo although narration confirms the issue was with humanitys lying but after spending an age forgotten she returns to the aboveground despite having left allegedly tragically because she wants to bring her people back to gensokyo and her outlook is incredibly positive but perhaps rather naive ill throw a huge party and hopefully the other oni will come back to the surface with me all of this is conveyed in a single game even though on the surface shes just drunk oni loli    this isnt even getting into why characters are just amusing or entertaining without complication such as the massive dork that everyone makes fun of youmu or the unapologetic brat tenshi its a shit ton of personalities you dont see often executed amusingly regularly thought about more than you wouldve assumed for a drunkard to have done and yeah    touhou is neat
  character interactions should lead to some kind of development its not too much to ask at least i think so
  i wish other smaller boards discouraged greentext even a little
  touhou manga are not shounen or whatever you want them to be they are supplementary material for the videogame series play the games
  you can get high off the moe  please dont off moe you will get it banned and regulated for us moderate responsible users too imagine how embarrassing it is going to be to get a moe prescription
  touhou manga and the like is simply just really well crafted fanfiction for all purposes some though are more accepted than others by the community as being close to cannon
  character interactions should lead to some kind of development   no    why what makes you say that why cant they simply be amusing or pleasant
  silly anon its a metaphorical high
  this the absolute state of /his/ nowadays is that many people dont even care to construct a coherent argument and just mindlessly greentext others sentences while posting brainletwojaks
  /bant/ is probably the largest board that has some kind of antimemetext ethos albeit eclectically
  character interactions should lead to some kind of development    there is already some kind of development when some characters interact for example when reimu beat a yokai their relationship can evolve and she defeated so many yokais now her shrine is often visited by those she vanquished inthe past  relationship between some characters also evolve in the mangas  not him but you should really play the game or read the manga you cant criticize accurately if you dont know what is touhou    but ultimately i dont think character development is required anyways even more so when most characters are deities and crazy spirits
  character development is the glue that ties together the disparate elements of story and character without it the entire plot is little more than stuff happening and while i agree that the main storyline is getting more interesting and there is some character development from time to time touhou does fall into just being stuff happening pretty often     i do agree that there is nothing wrong with a character being static but even that should cause some kind of effect on other people like fine weve established that reimu is both a terrible person and completely uncompromising in being terrible now actually have that affect the people around her have the few decent people that she befriended abandon her have the human villagers slowly turn against her have the people that remain friendly grow more and more sinister in nature if reimu is going to remain completely static at least have that static nature affect everybody around her otherwise were just watching a unlikeable bitch being an unlikeable bitch even that could theoretically work if it was played for black comedy but thats pretty obviously not the intention    and yes characters can be complex even without any development but without having that complexity affect either themselves of the people around it it doesnt really matter its all just window dressing for a story that is little more than stuff happening
  i do sometimes and i get that the touhou manga are just supplementary material but i do still expect to be entertained when reading them      its not just really well crafted fanfiction unless you seriously think even the authors work is just really well crafted fanfiction       because without development the story is little more than stuff happening and the characters are little more than unreal eternal walking archetypes and feel free to disagree me with on this that just doesnt make for a very appealing story especially one that does actually take itself somewhat serious at times       there is some development i wont pretend to claim otherwise but its not much and never for the characters that could use it the most
  a story that is little more than stuff happening  this is the only requirement of any story not every story has to say something or be some character study or anything really this just seems like finding fault in what you personally dont enjoy whereas it can be argued almost the entire conceit of touhou is an air of aimlessness within a queer and deadly world theres a difference between saying its not for me and saying that just doesnt make for a very appealing story statement objective    i wouldnt say touhou is beyond criticism of course but i dont see how this is criticism instead of raw opinion i guess you could argue no criticism is objective and its always opinion but i dunno i have problems with some touhou things like how fs ends for instanceits a weak execution of a promise of the consistent themes the manga discussed/explored/etc but i feel like what id critique of it isnt really based on my personal taste the ending of fs feels like its executed poorly and you can draw on earlier chapters and the words from narration/characters to argue that that kind of thing is what i would call critical
  have that affect the people around her have the few decent people that she befriended abandon her have the human villagers slowly turn against her have the people that remain friendly grow more and more sinister in nature  theres no reason for that part of touhous appeal is that its simultaneously goofy as fuck while being set in a literal murder grinder for humans    also the point of her being eternal and the hakurei maiden being eternal serves to the idea of gensokyo being a paradise just not a paradise for man however the only true reason its a paradise for youkai is due to machinations of man in the endtheir belief their fear and reimus enforcing of that world order
  thats a very shallow view of touhou there is quite a bit there and it is pretty obviously trying to say something accordingly i dont think its raw opinion to criticize the story for lacking in development when i do think its trying to accomplish something more than just being stuff happening      thats one of the reasons why i think the earlier games are far more successful narratively they arent trying to be anything more than stuff happening and accordingly gensokyo is a much happier place meanwhile the pc98 games are just a straight up bizarro wonderland and do a excellent job at being that the newer games try to have a more complex world and story but they just dont really deliver because of a lack of development tying the disparate elements of plot and character together     also i do kind of agree with the notion that all criticism is subjective but ill also acknowledge that some criticism is better than others obviously i think my own criticism is better than most but well feel free to disagree with me on that      i dont think 99 of the fanbase views that as part of touhous appeal especially considering how many just flat out deny it i personally view it as part of the appeal but i do still think characters being terrible people should have some kind of a effect on others reimu is a selfish horrible bitch and the few good people in gensokyo should treat her accordingly yukari is a sociopathic child murdering monster of a woman and most good people in gensokyo do actually treat her accordingly its not hard you see    and yes i get thats the idea behind the hakurei shrine maidens that still doesnt change the fact that all of them probably including reimu are horrible selfish monsters that are willing to let thousands of people die to maintain their own privileged position they are humanities evil incarnate in the same way yukari is youkais evil incarnate accordingly i want them all to die horribly and have their name become synonymous with evil itself because thats the kind of development that turns a boring story about stuff happening into something actually memorable and good
so if op is there people are interested because there are many canonical mediums of touhou like the mangas or the novels or the shmups or fighters in addition to this there is development in the various different characters we see such as while reimu is fairly static there are actual consequences to these actions such as the fact of her laziness involving of literally everything else but her job leaves her constantly destitute and nearly dies multiple times for the dumbest reasons also her shrine almost never gets humans because she doesnt bother to punt youkai off her lawn and humans rightly do not go anywhere near that place on fear of various things such as getting eaten by something  theres development slowly going on but touhou is the type of series where its not blatantly telling you and you simply have to notice what is said and done
  thats a very shallow view of touhou  not really if were only talking about the storylines most of them are as simple as strong monsters causing trouble and someone who doesnt give a fuck beats them with fireworks    which is also the point because a lot of the time even as early as in there are intricate reasons behind why the final bosses are doing whatever theyre doing but the protagonists merely want to keep the status quo and dont care about anything else their dialogue is usually very to the point essentially fuck off stop and then they fight which is indeed what im saying an air of aimlessness within a queer and deadly world the protagonists are largely considered with dinner relaxing and tea although their world is violent and dangerous    i think you also give reimu too much shit unrelated to whether or not i think your critique is good i rather dont no offense for what its worth the humans who do live in gensokyo are almost universally satisfied with how it works and there were agreements among humans and youkai to ultimately make gensokyo the way it is today it wasnt reimus call and she consistently refers to what she does as a job first and foremosta duty shes bound to what she has to do and if anything has provided means for the world to be a lot more decent since she took the reins at the shrine the spell card rules she looks the other way when outsiders come in and die and dont make it to her in time to escape but to her thats nature and she has no reason to change it she has no higher motivations and isnt really heroic but she doesnt have to be and shouldnt really be criticized for it gensokyo keeps the last remnants of fantasy alive in basically the world and theres worth in that even if its continued existence requires some terrorizing of humans and a bit of eating flesh
  considered with  concerned with
you nerds seriously needs to accept that touhou aint changing yes touhou is mainly videogames and music series no zun will never change gensokyo into generic western fantasy shite yes reimu will continue to be number 1 in popularity pools the sooner you accept that the better for you
touhou doesnt need character development put yourself in zuns shoes its about balancing sarcastic genocidal shrine maidens/ ordinary magicians  with meaningful displays of music and danmaku touhou is literally a tech demo of zuns creativity in each specific year critical commentary is unavailable  but if op is reading this i suggest just go play the game and dont assume stanley kubrick directed it play perfect cherry blossom or eosd and just enjoy the stupidly beautiful and genius humor between reimu and youkai   come back and tell us your favorite part and favorite song ill be there to listen and never judge or be mean /jp/ is peak human interaction  and our vehicle to use interaction is the idea of a teenage shrine maiden indiscriminately beating up lolis and phantom gardeners welcome to touhou  welcome to peak performance
not only at op but to all you kids     if youve not read the official literature please go do that     theres a lot of characterization youll never see otherwise
  thats also a very shallow view of touhou its like saying the lord of the rings is only about two midgets carrying a ring that citizen kane is only about a guy looking for a sled theres a lot more under the hood than you seem to think    the reasons why the villains do what they do tends to change pretty dramatically depending on the game neither mof td and ufo even had the villains trying to do anything quite a few times they dont so much defend the status quo as much as just blunder onto somebody whose arrival has already changed it    the idea that humans are universally satisfied with how it works is based on nothing multiple human villagers have been shown as being dissatisfied enough with the way gensokyo works to risk their life and no villager has ever been shown preferring life in gensokyo over the outside world to the contrary even theyve been portrayed as consistently being interested in the outside world and it was reimu or at least one of the hakurei shrine maidens call to make gensokyo what it is today it was only because of her permission or at least will full compliance that yukari was able to implement the spellcard system which hasnt really done anything to improve life for the average villager expect make sure that youkai can cause trouble without any serious consequences to themselves     reimu has both the power and means to make a positive difference in gensokyo and save countless lives but chooses not to do anything because it would affect her perfect little life of privilege and power shes the gensokyo equivalent of a white southern girl looking at a plantage of slaves and instead of viewing it as the injustice it is decides she might as well beat one of the slaves half to death for fun shes the gensokyo equivalent of a nazi collaborator happily hunting down jews if it means the occupying germans are kinder towards her unless shes just too stupid to realise how evil the nature of her job actually is which is actually possible then she is scum of the highest order and like the two examples i mentioned above terrible things should happen to her     also youkai dont need to eat human flesh or even terrorise people its only because of scumbags like yukari and reimu that they still resort to such methods instead of just accepting that times have changed and changing their behaviour like countless youkai have
  touhou has changed all the time zun is about as retcon happy as your average comic book publisher and even less subtle about it give it a few years and i doubt gensokyo still resembles the place it was shown to be in fs and wahh
  dont assume stanley kubrick directed it  what would 2hu as directed by stanley kubrick look like
  if you think sakuyas time stop was retconned you really need to reevaluate your context reading skills
  no i dont think sakuyas time stop was a retcon and even if it was its far from the worst offender
  i see all kinds of cute/shitty art from doujin groups  if its from the mid00s or later its probably influenced by zun
  i cant think of any touhou character i would want to meet in real life  there are safety reasons why you wouldnt want to meet the youkai but why would you not meet the humans if you could
  i dont want to establish some kind of weird surrogate friend relationship with a cast made up mostly of sociopaths and assholes  what are you doing on 4channel
  finding a place to talk about touhou and other stupid shit i like
  thats also a very shallow view of touhou its like saying the lord of the rings is only about two midgets carrying a ring that citizen kane is only about a guy looking for a sled theres a lot more under the hood than you seem to think  jesus christ its just giving the basic premise you dunce im not getting into zuns views on philosophy or his obsession with mythology or his interest in developing storyline through gameplay or anything im giving the basics of the basics
  multiple human villagers have been shown as being dissatisfied enough with the way gensokyo works to risk their life  no not at all go ahead and prove me wrong because the only people who have thought about changing how gensokyo works were mocked by other villagers for being ridiculous    re your shit about reimu one reimu is not invincible and part of the reason spell card rules were developed were because youkai could not defeat her without killing her and ruining everything if reimu wanted to change how the world worked fundamentally youkai could easily kill her even despite her most bullshit of powers and install a more inline person to keep order further she is one girl and could never save literally everyone who needs saving this is like believing because you have a gun a license to carry and a license to kill you should go around saving  everyone you can because you have the power to stop all violence as long as you can make it in time and risk your life for total strangers only because you have power    youre completely insane if you think she has an obligation to rescue everyone even letting people die is no worse or better than what most people do because we cant be there for everyone all the time outsiders enter outsiders die she helps if they can find her but she cant be zipping and zooping to every dark corner of the world to rescue people maybe and again if she wanted to completely ruin youkais hold on mankind in gensokyo she could simply be dealt with and in the context of gensokyo as we know it this would basically be a meaningless resistance with hardly any support from the humans she would intend to save this is a matter brought up by keine and the entirety of symposium the order established now the relatively safe life reimu enforces for natives is the order most want    your view is not gensokyos view its the view of a handful of mocked dissenters within the setting and again i would just love to see you attempt to become a superhero and change the entirety of gensokyo with yourself in reimus position and with reimus power because there are several enemies you would have to face who would destroy you instantaneously and replace you easily
    oh no no no not this fucking argument again
  theres a lot more under the hood than you seem to think    a lot of the time even as early as in there are intricate reasons behind why the final bosses are doing whatever theyre doing    
  the girls are cute the music is so good it spawned a subculture zuns writing is funny and theres new material to follow
are humans okay with the state of gensokyo    ctrlf  my first impression of gensokyo besides the fact that there are youkai who cause harm to mankind is that the minds of humans are capricious and easily swayed      its deplorable that some humans have forgotten their fear of youkai and are trying to drive them out of gensokyo currently there is a state of balance between the humans and the youkai here    tldr yeah pretty much
  go ahead and prove me wrong because the only people who have thought about changing how gensokyo works were mocked by other villagers for being ridiculous  i dont remember that happening if anything the human villagers have been pretty welcome to any changes     one reimu is not invincible  she pretty much is her ability is overpowered to a extent that nobody in gensokyo would be able to stand a chance against her the only possible exception being the sages who probably have some kind of a kill switch anyway at the very least her privileged position and massive network of friends and allies would allow her to make a lot of positive changes if she tried she could go to yukari and tell her to stop abducting people and spying on the human villagers failing that she could use her influence to save as many people as possible    she might not be all powerful and she would lose if she kickstarted a rebellion without a lot of support but she is very powerful and very influential akyuu even flat out says the hakurei shrine maidens pretty much have gensokyo under their thumb i dont expect her to change gensokyo but i do expect it to make it a better place using the tools she has available to her that she refuses to do this and actually enforces the awful status quo is the reason why she and the other hakurei shrine maidens are evil incarnate     the order established now the relatively safe life reimu enforces for natives is the order most want  its the order most youkai want what the human villagers want is for every youkai to die the barrier to fall and for all of them to return to the outside world that most villagers are too terrified and powerless to actually try to implement this and are instead just trying to live out their miserable lives to the best of their ability is understandable if unfortunate     i would just love to see you attempt to become a superhero and change the entirety of gensokyo with yourself in reimus position and with reimus power because there are several enemies you would have to face who would destroy you instantaneously and replace you easily  if i was reimu what i would do is try to change gensokyo to the best of my ability using the tools available to me play the game of politics and all that if i could accumulate enough power allies and influence to kick start a rebellion i would if i thought that simply changing the system wasnt sufficient otherwise i would make sure the next hakurei shrine maiden continues where i leave off       im talking about under the hood symbolism and themes not simply touhou has a complex backstory
  im not sure why the first quote even in its entirety is proof that humans are happy in gensokyo if anything it shows that they are basically without hope or believe that the future might get better and are just trying to get by without falling to despair    meanwhile the state of humans and youkai hasnt been balanced for almost a decade the human villagers used to be pretty capable at the very least having a large amount of youkai exterminators living but thats been completely retconned in favour of them being utterly powerless and oppressed as shown by fs and symposium
  oppressed  how
  cute girls nice music comfy setting and freedom to make secondary/tertiary fanworks  man zun is really a saint to tolerate all that cookie shit
  but thats been completely retconned in favour of them being utterly powerless and oppressed as shown by fs and symposium    in the official mangas the humans are everything but oppressed
  they literally arent even allowed to have a leader or make major decisions for themselves thats oppression in its most purest form
  yes like that time aya made it absolutely clear that multiple groups of youkai are trying to seize control of the human village to make sure they could never have a ruler or that time yukari revealed she was spying on the human villagers to make sure they dont do anything bad or the fact that the human villagers are all essentially trapped in gensokyo with no way to leave     totally no oppression going on
      human are manipulated not oppressed
  by that logic being here makes you oppressed too because you need fill that sweet google captcha
  they arent being manipulated into not having a leader or manipulated in being spied upon      im not oppressed upon because 1 i have a leader that represents me to some degree 2 i can go where i want to go 3 while i am being spied upon thats not because im human
  dont you guys get tired of the same girls over the years waifus aside i mean with manga or vn you get a new batch of relevant girls with every title why fixate on these random ones  why should i take you seriously  why would you want another flavor of the month bunch every fucking release
  im not sure why the first quote even in its entirety is proof that humans are happy in gensokyo  those who live there all live in prosperity and peace and this is because there is a culture that humans and the longliving youkai have constructed
  theyre allowed to they dont want one
   while i am being spied upon thats not because im human  dont know why did you formule that sentence like that i dont think google or anyone else cares anyway    you can see humans and youkai being together and coexisting with no problems    you can join whatever faction you want and noone will prohibits you anything  youre basically allowed to do anything as long as you dont break common laws although if you beat and rape the shit out of fairies i dont think anyone would care  also gensokyo have enough loops if youre smart or dedicated you can easily exploit them mind you if youre smart unlike a certain bumbass   before you start dropping names like akyuu  and pmiss i would like to remind you that akyuute spice up those texts to max and pulling facts from her ass making aya looking like a journalism saint in comparsion     just curious where are you from because as someone who lives in eastern europe your image of oppression is hillarious as hell
leave and dont come back yes im talking to you
  those who live there all live in prosperity and peace and this is because there is a culture that humans and the longliving youkai have constructed  where is that quote from pmiss      they arent allowed to read forbidden scrollery aya makes that pretty explicit       you can see humans and youkai being together and coexisting with no problems   some humans and some youkai can coexist certainly not all of them    you can join whatever faction you want and noone will prohibits you anything  thats because those factions are the only ones allowed to exist any actual dangerous group would be crushed outright     youre basically allowed to do anything as long as you dont break common laws   there are no laws only mob justice thats what tends to happen when you dont have a leader the closest thing gensokyo has to laws are the once established by the youkai sages and youll be murdered if you break any of those    your image of oppression is hillarious as hell  if you dont view not having a leader constant surveillance and being executed without trial as oppression then whatever country you live in must really really suck
  if you dont view not having a leader as oppression then whatever country you live in must really really suck  
  they arent allowed to read forbidden scrollery aya makes that pretty explicit  aya has never said anything about forbidding a human leader and to my knowledge the subject was only brought up in symposium where it was decided no leader would be preferred but not disallowed    youll need pages i read fs and dont remember anything about aya saying what was and wasnt allowed in the human village only that youkai were vying for control over it
whats the name of that doujin with the condoms
  where is that quote from pmiss  
      oh boy its humanity fuck yeah again
  humanity fuck yeah is a mental disease  who is better lameos who cant do jack shit other than crafting sharp sticks and charging to one other or mythical creatures with swish swoosh bullets and weird hair colors
  but you see it was humanity that created those mythical creatures
  who is better  i mean the issue isnt about that at all but ok
  also even in synopsium it was pointed out that the humans are essentially ruled by youkai that try to make sure no leader would ever stand up       cute although not to advocate for monarchies but even a leader decided by watery tarts lying in ponds is better than what the human villagers have       that message was written years ago when gensokyo was still genuinely a paradise because most human villagers were pretty badass as well things have changed considerably since then and not for the better       the people that have conquered the world and can blow it up with a single press of a button
anyone who doesnt say the music is a dumb secondary
  that message was written years ago when gensokyo was still genuinely a paradise because most human villagers were pretty badass as well  contemporary gensokyo was never full of badass villagers  the human village has consistently for the last sixteen years featured a passable standard of living combined with a lack of political autonomy
  fun games  fun plot  fun girls
  nonsense both pcb and pmiss make it clear that the human villagers had plenty of capable members that could equal almost any youkai and any lack of political autonomy only started around ufo and hm     also what the fuck do you mean with passable standards of living by the standards of 1890 japan perhaps but by most modern standards its about on the same level as north korea
  nonsense both pcb and pmiss make it clear that the human villagers had plenty of capable members that could equal almost any youkai  they did not    also what the fuck do you mean with passable standards of living  i mean by the standards of a japanese person living in the year 2003 when zun wrote that the people in the village lived in peace and prosperity
  nonsense both pcb and pmiss make it clear that the human villagers had plenty of capable members that could equal almost any youkai    but a brave warrior would occasionally rise to defeat them some of those brave humans settled in gensokyo to keep close watch on the youkai  if you read the pcb prologue this happens before gensokyo is sealed also it never says the village is full of badasses just that some warriors settled down im gensokyo and create civilization  by the way theres nothing stopping a human from learning magic and beating up youkai and i wouldnt be surprised if most humans can beat low tier youkai
  it does actually pretty explicitly say that the people that founded the human village were all pretty big baddasses more importantly however from the same prologue   so why is gensokyo a paradise for humans if they have to live with youkai well thats because when everyone has enough power to defeat youkai in combat and thats anything but boring    by the way theres nothing stopping a human from learning magic and beating up youkai and i wouldnt be surprised if most humans can beat low tier youkai  again that did actually seem to be the case in pmiss but its pretty obviously not true anymore in the human village as portrayed in fs wahh and symposium
  your image just proves that its not forbidden or disallowed if anything the image proves that they expect humans to get a leader and only wish to stop them before it inevitably happens
      i wonder how it came to be that /jp/ is the only 4chan board that is still vehemently against greentexting while all the other boards have succumbed to it
  because touhou is a beautiful vision of a purer world while much of anime is tainted by the expectations and desires of modern society this is also why much of /jp/ despises idol threads
  old culture and copying from japanese counterparts
  north korea  stop being retarded  the villagers are definitely not malnourished and starving  their children arent conscripted into military service and they dont get sent to gulags for wrongthink  a more apt comparison would be to the amish mostly late 1800s tech level with some sprinkling of modern surrounded by modern society / youkai but able to live most of their lives in peace and even have some dealings with outsiders
anyone else living like this here this hit me right where it hurts i dont know what to do anymore _
  judging your worth based on how much of a slave to businesses and banks you are is foolish
  at least you have someone
  i have a mental illness so i dont blame myself anymore

  how do i install tsukihime
playing fsn vn for first time  get to the part where saber and gil clash with enuma elish and excalibur  my game crashes  tfw gils affection transcends space time and he crashes my game because he doesnt want me to fuck his waifu after our perfect date  impressive really
  gilgamesh does not have waifus gilgamesh has women correct yourself
  he has women but also a waifu
  2018  using forums
  cute
arc and ciel are so adorable in this scenario 
  thats actually true if everything you care for comes to an end before you then you wont regret missing out on anything as you die
i heard somebody on the na team said they decided on changing how emiya alter is handled    hopefully they photoshop him into any other skin colour
  thatd be hilarious theyll probably just change some dialogue though
  i think their just changing his backstory becuse muh racism or something stupid
  i dont have him pulled so i havent read his profile but im pretty sure his backstory doesnt even explain why he looks like he does the ccc event sure didnt    i guess having him have even darker skin that normal emiya kinda makes sense but his fuckin hairstyle man and then one of the writers thinks it would be funny to call him detroit emiya and actually puts it in the fucking game    i bet that was nasu too
i wish berserker got better fights in the vn i like the idea of heracles coming back to life after being defeated because it meshes well with how they portray him but he never actually comes back to life like that he gets killed a bunch of times offscreen by archer in fate and finished off by muh caliburn then he gets turned into a needle cushion by gil and then he gets swallowed up i wish they got rid of that whole strong weapons can kill him multiple time thing and have a battle where multiple servants have to fight him and defeat him 12 times
im thinking back to watching fate/zero for the first time and fuck it makes me miss fun solid tm stories i want more of that stuff wish we had another seasonal ufotable show too though at this rate it would adapt some fgo shit instead guess i should be hopeful for case files
  honestly all the shit they added lately heavily reduces my enjoyment of basic tm stories    i try to get a immersed and then a voice in my head just goes hey remember sefar remember lovecraft
  kawasumi ayako playing gray i suspect
i finished the first route and i dont know if i can go on the ending is too bitter sweet
  first route is the worst one
  keep going man unlimited blade works is probably the most fun of all the routes
is it just me or did all this parellel world faffery just ruin typemoon it was fine when there were like 2 or 3 parallel worlds being dealt with because then you could have meaningful worldbuilding but the recent trend of putting every unique thing into its own parallel world seriously irritates me and makes me not want to get invested in new shit
  yeah it did it was a fine thing to have as a concept like the kaleidoscope but then he nasu started putting fucking everything he writes into a new paralell world just look up how many fucking paralell worlds the extra series consists of its ridiculous then he made up the fucking pruning rules that are honestly just retarded any timeline that doesnt lead to some fucking arbitrary point gets the middle finger    only two years after extella and the entire plot of fgo part 2 is about pruning its like he wrote it with fgo in mind    dont even make me start talking about the implications this garbage has for free will within the nasuverse  if i decide to kill my neighbour and that somehow leads to humanity not turning into a galactic masterrace my entire fucking timeline goes into the trash
  any timeline that doesnt lead to some fucking arbitrary point gets the middle finger  just like a visual novel amirite
  this is entirely the reason he did it its all like some meta joke to him and i honestly find it kind of insulting for being so low effort
  i disagree it gets weighed down by exposition dumps and has less impact than the latter routes but its still fantastic definitely better than ubw and maybe even better than heavens feel also seibah is the best out of the three heroines
  everyone agrees someone posts this at least a few times a thread
  sorry im a secondary whos just recently leveled up to primary status im new around here
  imageboards irc and small niche forums are the only decent places left on the internet
      whats wrong with fate/extra and fgo
  extras cool    fgos story despite having some neat lore and concepts is boring as dirt
  extra is whatever really  the reasons for go haven been discussed to death  id start by reading 
  please respond
  you shouldnt need to install it every distribution of it ive found online just has an executable you run that with the right locale enabled and it just werks
  even the one that is linked in the op windows defender keeps blocking the exe file and the readme talks about buying a legal copy of the game that isnt even sold anymore so im very confused
  youre using windows 10 right do this  open windows defender security center  open app and browser control  set check files and apps to off
  do i have to install some japanese language stuff too i didnt have to do anything like that when i downloaded stay night
  yes you need to switch to japanese locale
fgo now has the crypter true ancestor summonable    what a great fucking game
  受肉した精霊でありエナジードレインで糧を得る吸血種  魔獣幻獣の類いではなく地球の内海から発生した表層管理のための端末精霊である  魔術世界では真祖と呼ばれるカテゴリに近いが発生の過程が類似しているものの生命としての目的が違う別種の吸血種である    古代中国の伝承に語られるところの仙女真人であり理性や自意識も後々に獲得したものなので自らがどのような出自であるのか彼女自身にも分からない      
  whats the lore excuse for this shit
  she wanted to be 
  not even with how shed be summoned but why would she ever ever help you in destroying other crypters worlds  gacha is such cancer
  shes not a true ancestor shes something completely new they made up for fgo basically the same origin/species/creation with a different purpose    and qin can improve the design showing humanity  gaia
  she doesnt give a shit and mentions she hates guda she only wants to use chaldea to be with her husband
  wow thats fucking lame  sasuga fgo
  she never cared about the crypters and just wanted to get her husband back through lostbelt fuckery      i just read that profile entry too makes the lb3 story make more sense but still a giant asspull why did gaia even make her nearly identicals to tas if she isnt meant to fuck humanity up bravo nasu
  its consort yu you expect her to give a shit about anything else    like look up a bit more
  its not about that its about how fgo will bring anyone back via gacha if its convenient fuck the entire servant system and the way they exploit it for this shit
  shes basically a gaia terminal made to maintain the worlds texture her origin and the origin of all mystery in china is the fusang tree emperor qin simply made his body based on hers the fusang and other shit like lelouch from code geass eliminating the dumb bloodplacebo cripple shit maybe someone should hire this dude to replace gaia and alaya in exchange of smartphones     i think they didnt want her to be a ta because itll make her less special since arc has to be the most speshful  ta you know they have a snowflake fetish
  if they didnt want her to be a ta maybe they shouldnt have everyone except the emperor call her a ta
  the emperor literally corrected you all just eops eoping
  nigger even the japs are memeing about this on twitter
  thanks i think i managed to get it to work now

  and therell be active threads once season two begins
  there wont be another season
god i think tanaka is convincing me to have gamby as another wife
  do it
  marry all the burgers  make uncle sam proud
  it looks as though shes holding the sign that has her name on it
  but shes so fucking useless
  kai ni will fix her
  her big burger tits have a hundred of uses each
  good for you
  fuck marrying the ugly potato
this is the base santa this year
  stop being ghey and marry the big boobs potato carrier
  can i touch her cleavage with my dong
  its just not as popular in english speaking communities anymore which is okay because most people in them are retards or cancer just look at this thread
  ill mart her after she gets rid of the toilet seat around her neck and learns how to properly pronounce admiral
what the fuck
  you are being mean both to her outfit and to her cute way of saying admiral
  a shit
they should have given sam to akira so we could have promo art of her and gamby together
  more inconsistent akira drawing  no thanks
  shes perfect
  they should have given sam to me so i could fulfill my purpose in life by acting as her panties
  ywn be sams training bra
  i want to lick that
sam  not a hobbit
  hats ducky  no hat
  sam  not draw by shibafu  boil her mash her stick her in a stew
  congo  not black
  kongo  not an amputee
hamwind  actually a cow
tone  not a tiger promoting her grrrrrrrreat frosted flakes
sex with sammy
cant wait for christmas
  i opened my present a bit too early
oyashio  not the shios mom
  dumb eggshio
  me too anon
  erotofu  actually the least ero of the tofus
  no thanks keep my daughter away from gambyshit
  cows are nice and useful animals though
kamikaze  doesnt just kill herself
oh wait i get it its a pubic hair chart right
  cute bird
  i think jervis is biologically older than kunashiri
  jaabis and luigi have blond pubes though so they probably look lighter
  shit time to fap again
  i havent seen the fairy in question so i dont know what type of ship were talking about if its a dd she could be anywhere between kisa and naganami long hair but a large breast size difference  if its a capital ship shes probably gonna be pretty big
someone stop her
  yeah gambys face is definitely off
  not sure what the bigger question is why her sisters are interested or why theyre letting ttk join them
  fletcherfairy
  but she wants it
  ho ho holy shit i hope so
  i fucking hope so
melon kai ni when
    going by the sam example that hair ribbon might be the ribbon to a navy cross or medal of honor by the color
    i like her already and yet i cant shake the idea that shes gonna look like a cross between amatsukaze and murasame not that thats a bad thing
  ooh scary scary
destroyers are the best
  her face cracks me up
  dont    this
  iowa is cute  sam looks like somebody from hokuto no ken
  i want to grope that butt
  i want to do pic related put with shima
  this too
  thats some nice chocolate
remember to be nice to your takanami today ttk
  dont worry shes doing expeditions like no tomorrow
  i want to lick her thong while shes still wearing iy and press the wet part into a hole    ill fuck her sideways later just for you
  whats up with boats and getting decapitated by torpedoes is it the naval equivalent of a headshot or something
  the bow is a pretty weak part of the ship a hit that would tear a massive hole in the side of the ship can easily rip the bow off
  they were daijoubu
  f
this is nice too
  まったく海防艦も最高だぜ
  theyre not even headless the bridge is a ships head
  i want to bully her erect nipples
  i want to lick her thong while shes still wearing iy and press the wet part into a hole  based admiral
  totemo ok desu
  its the ship equivalent of a very badly stubbed toe
  whats the bow then
  i want to deflower her and listen to her squeals
  solar plexus
  the penis
  the clit congrats you found it
  i want her used panties
  gamby should have had abucutemas voice
  she should keep the voice and copy paste abus cup size on her
  according to google senseis interpretation of comments the leading theory seems to be  top/bottom is has/hasnt had her first period  left to right scale is depth of sexual knowledge
  while that too would be nice i personally think gambys chest size is perfect
  tsushima though
  maybe shes faking like iowa
  maybe top/bottom period value plus arrow signifies bushiness
  bushy pyon  my mind says no but my dick says yes
  id say she has a nontrimmed/thin landing strip its a landing strip because thats how it grew in
  thirsty like stranded in sahara desert
chu
  what is harusame doing
rabbit season
  something like kirishima but using the entire box instead
  duck season
  i want to fuck the pooches    i want to breed the bunnies    i want to fuck them until my dick falls off like a real duck
  who is the hottest duki
why do only some animals get to become boats  why is there no turtle ship
  nameship
i wonder when the commander will arrive for our date
  she has no sex appeal hatsuzuki or teruzuki overshadows her
  wise words
  suzu or teru
  the autistic one
  i want to inseminate this boatlittle girl
pamper this pup
  spoil the rod and deflower the pupper
  pamper  plunder
  i want to play wancolle
  pour your seeds into the bottle
  teru
  just have your litter with you all the time
oh no she spilled milk all over herself
  its ok thatll wash off once i send her out to sea
  please dont cum in the bottle
  fuck off shitgure
  i want to fill this bottle up and make her carry my child
  i would get all the dogshipgirls preggers starting with shiggy
  man of culture      shit taste
  if you fill it up she would have to swallow a whole lot just to be able to breath
  is that not hotter to think about
  i want to rape shigure
  please dont think that way about akatsuki
  but i only want to fill kamikazes bottle
71 very loe risk  44 moderate  34 high risk high reward  65 too much consumption
  a shit
  is she trying out for evanescence
  thats a dude
  looks like one to me but i dunno
what was the fleet for these 2 dd 55 quests
  nelson touch  full supports
  55 boss is easy just pray that re in preboss will not destroy you
  standard 4bbcv2xx
  i dont see if nelson touch would work well in there if it even happened  youd have to go with one muling carrier and rest of the fight would be scratches
  nelson  cv  musashi/isekai ni  cv  dd  dd    any problem
  yes the lack of 3rd proper attack makes worse than going line ahead
  are you using some shitty planes  just put extra radar on your dd if you want to meet the los requirement
yukikaze gets 1 aa from searchlights  is this some historical reference
  it think he tried to make gamaby somewhat embarrased but the execution and perspective make it look just fucked up
  looks fine to me
  solomons participation trophy
fubuki is cute    god bless you

meat cruisers best cruisers
  i think that he was the admiral in the boatsluts on icething at i recall seeing a similar sounding name being mentioned here in that context
  google sensei got it wrong here he is our selfinsert protag
  what kind of panties do maya and chokai wear so you dont see them through the side cut out
  perfection
  dumb meat poster
  hes so handsome   literally me
  who knows maybe they go commando

  god i love mayasama so much
dinner with the ducks
  who is the ugliest duck
  hatsuzuki by far
  there are no ugly ducks  there are plenty ugly gumos though
  none theyre all swans
  special vocal  damn i prefer instrumental but whatever
maizuru vol19 sample
  teru
  cute jari girl
what shipgirl has given you nightmares
  graf i felt like dying after grinding for her
  more like kusogaki
  what is a jari girl
  i genuinely cannot tell whether this is official art or not logic dictates its not but the art style is so fucking yoshinori it hurts
  right i failed her premiere event because i was convinced that it was more important to get her and eugen than to finish i didnt get either and failed the event  i used to have nightmares every event about sinking my entire fleet  thankfully i dont get them very often any more they used to make it so i couldnt sleep during the event on nights i had to work
  its just the head from her damaged sprite shopped onto something else
  its some random image with her head shopped on
  thats one royal gaze alright urge to punch rises
  takao  rest of the meat class
    no wonder the boatsluts cant stop thinking about our collective dick
  iowa is such a pervert in these
  takao is a big fat cheat
  commando maya can assault my face with her cunt any time
  translation please
maya is fucking great
  iowa is dumb and gay hahaha
mayasama doesnt appreciate the lewd posts about her respectable sisters
  imagine the level of lust she must be hiding behind her cool casual gal personality
the last few unimplemented ijn cas when
shit i just realized the month already ended
maya is the coolest boat in this
  forgot as well  why does daylight savings have to exist
mayasama thread
  too big
  embarrassmentpowered mayasama
  totemo kawaii
nonco is alright
tittysama
  other gumos are better
  perfect young wife
  awful
cosplay sex with mayasama
  for you
  why are destroyers considered illegal again those girls are fucking ripe
  literally cheap ashigara
  is there anything on earth mayasama isnt excellent at
  because theyre underage
  day shelling closing torp and yasen
  dynamite body  isnt good at yasen  cute
  dynamite body  i thought you were talking about maya
  but she does
  are you implying mayas body isnt the bomb
  getting shagged
  luckmod maya can hit yasen cap just fine
  coming on top when compared to foreign aacruisers
  here is minitatsuta for you picky taste
  but tatsuta is sadistic this one is just a thot
  how about miniatago
  they look nothing alike
  not excellent at coming on top
maya is pure sex
  shes pretty shit outside of fanart
  i think atago is far more confident with her playfulness while at the same time being more indirect about it      you are retarded her k2 is incredible
  that also applies to atagotakao desu
  tell me about all the ones we have ingame gotland
this is my japanese wife kagasan  say something nice about her
  at least she isnt tenryuu
  man that could be said about a lot of characters in this
  only if her voice is muted
  tsuclass notdidos/atlantas
  her younger sister was pretty cute
  fuck off abyssal scum
  yeah better save her for someone with better taste
  tenryuu is cute too she will make you a good futanari wife
  blame tanaka for not making proper aacruisers enemy exclusive
  go play chinkshit then
  nowhere near to the same extent as maya though maya needs fanart to survive
  nice shitposting because its the other way around art quality wise
  maya k2 looks infinitely better than takao/atago and their lazy copypaste damage sprites
  ship that has new art is better than ships that use old art  imagine my shock
  so you agree maya is better
  takao/atago get a lot more art than maya does maybe their design is more popular with artists
  gotland    can you really call adding 4 twin 40mm bofors aaguns an aacruiser refit by that standard basically all bong kraut and yanks cruisers would had become aacruisers during the war
  their character and designs are more interesting thus more appealing for fanwork in game maya and chokeeye at k2 have far better art quality wise
  nobody cares about her shitty base art because everyone should have her remodel which looks great
  kaga must be the best art in the game then
  simple design blue and white perfection etc
  according to japs
make sure to treat max properly
  pump her to the point she has a small bulge then hug tightly
  minitatsuta    noone can replace tatsuta at being tatsuta
  fuck off tumblrshitter
  tatusta  キモイ
  the entire meat class is sex
  how about minikaga then
  stop
better akebono
  minikaga  but thats not taiyou
  vastly superior to actual kaga
  taiyou looks nothing like kaga you fucking moron
how many minishipgirls names here are there
  and doesnt act much like her
  i thought she and her sister were miniharunas
  daughters  2 of them  that poor poor ttk
  for kaga  mini kaga  not kaga  evil/abyssal kaga  ddh kaga
  neither does nui
  but she acts like her
minikashima
  im not the one who said nui looked like kaga    naganami kai ni looks like ashigara because she nearly identical minus the brown hair
  they have same personality
  taiyou  nuinui  kaga
  looks more like miniaoba
yamashio maru when it would be interesting to see what an army potato would look like
    very rude  my son nuikun has personality and feelings which she sometimes shows but kaga is simply a brain dead fish and only good as a background character
  cringe
  you should stop fucking your son
  d only good as a background character  thats akagi
  anatomically impossible desu
  ill tell you something that your parents never told to you    no
  akagi has too much personality and hunger to stay in the background
  he married the best girl though
  fuck off
  no
  why nui likes it
tenryuu and tatsuta fag is tumblr dweller  how fitting
  you are retarded if you think only tumblr has their art and doesnt have art of other characters
  fuck off
  cringe
lurking at tumblr for shit arts of shit ships  truly the lowest of the low
implying one cant look at multiple sources of art    mucho retardo
  or you just google search and save images that pop up
  no
  google search  jesus just use a booru like everyone else search by tags get in higher quality and links straight to the original source
you greening faggots should all kill yourself
  google search  even better
  why not uses every means of search boorus sometimes doesnt have everything of an artist
  google search
/jp/ is dead
  the anal autists behind booru filter out too much stuff
  booru once didnt approve an image of adorably pregnant saratoga booru is overrated like autism  genius logic on 4chan
  hunger  sounds boring and shallow
  magnitudes more than kaga
  infinite possibilities vs limited personality
  making up shit doesnt add to the actual empty character you could always fill her up with semen but thats about it
  you could always fill her up with semen    one would need a herd of elephants for that
  or 1 sbd
   o u c h
do you nelson touch p or boss in 55
  and many many more to come and dont forget even more daughters with daughterwives
  nnot fair
  boss
i want to kiss those legs and ignore her feet completely
  dont ask me i wanna nom nagas namis as much as you do along with many other but not all dds    noms nagas namis
  nice try more like mini haruna but horny as hell
  mini haruna  she has more personality than just daijoubu  id say shes more like mutsu with the ara ara
  taiyou is mini akagi  naganami is ashigara  umikaze is unryuu  teruzuki is mutsu  and theres others
  its more about personality
  teru doesnt act like mutsu at all noone is on her level
  dont forget to praise big akatsuki
level these ships
  taiyou is mini akagi    i dont ever recall kasuga being a glutton
  teruzuki is mutsu    the only thing they have in common is that teru has a great body too
remember to brush your dogs teeth regularly
  mutsuki would make more sense to be mutsu because similar hairstyles
how big those two must be if hoppou can sit in there
  the should be around 225m tall no more the pic is exagerated to around 45
  theyre quite fat
  the should be around 225m tall  imagine
  to around 45    imagine
hoppou isnt that small
  i believe this is relative fuckup perspective because she holds a hugefairysizedzero
do our girls fight bloody titans or something
  yeah it feels that way
  this looks gross
  shit artist etc
  interesting
  carriers are unlikely to be needed
  cute
  be in the anime  have some three seconds screentime  all you get to do is burning and calling help    poor shouhou
  be in the anime  poor shouhou
  just like in the war
  better than what happens to other characters
  you are talking about this
  they never even bothered clarifying if she lived or died
  you die a hero or get remembered as some kind of meme
  i would
  the man voice was the worst part specially since it became canon
  the only character who didnt get butchered was maybe shimakaze  she actually talked few nonautistic lines to bucky
  new deep voice  drastic personality changes  siscon mutsu  they hired the wrong people to do the anime
  to be  fair i dont find her japanese voice that bad
  mutsuki was super cute and got a k2 out of it
  probably survived heavily damaged/injured i think they would have mentioned her death to make the situation look more serious
  and kisaragi died but wasnt removed from the game or got an abyssal remodel for some reason
  poor kisaragi
  well kisaragi got an oni version for setsubun
  a lot of the changes brought by the anime were reflected in the game so chances are even part of the development team was fine with said changes
  that equation lacks just one thing  lack of real men in navel base  nagatos new deep voice  siscon mutsu  i guess dry humping and rough masturbation could with the withdrawal symptoms but its simply dangerous to keep such succubus around without steady flow of seamen
  have fun finding enough seamen to satisfy her needs
  you need abyssals for that
  please dont remind me of that doujin
doing 15  shimushu yells its winter  do 35  hayasui yells its fall  how do i resolve this
  find tanaka and kill him
  why upset itll never get a true sequel
  rape shimu
  wife  bbhime was clearly the husband
  too cute
  a lot  hardly any nagatos voice got deeper but her attitude in the game is completely different from her seriousness in the anime new lines with that voice were also added before the anime its likely they were already planning to distinguish her from mutsu since their voices were extremely similar at the start the only characters i can think of who changed to match the anime are akagi becoming a glutton and fubuki getting lines idolizing akagi
prettiest ddtitted pornstar
  ship girls/abyssals determine dominance via boob size the dominate ones become the husband
  you are forgetting about ooi also her new lines were added just before the anime aired in other words the ideas were already planned to be there in the anime
  i wanna start a three sided marriage with them
  my lvl 159 wife is my pornstar only fiend
  i want one with these two
  akagi became a glutton in 2013 already
  brōther what is the name ōf this dōujin
  gross
  my pornstar only  oh you poor thing
  i wouldnt mind the macron if it was grammatically correct but it isnt in 2/3 of those
  are you ok with seeing battleship himes cute embarassed face when she realises her mammoth abyssal dong has stretched mutsu out so much its impossible for her to feel your puny human cock
  keep your /d/egenerate fantasies about my wife for yourself
  being a yurifag  lel
  rip snail
  sounds like hell have to sit back and watch
whats with all the beautiful cows in this jeez
  i dont like futa but this is cute
  you just have to fuck that stupid face off from her and all is fine  you can also try to fix mutsu with buckets
i love this
too sexy
fucking who
  read the filename

  its not hard to try something and see if it induces a reaction in the admiral
  she was already seeing another gumo
ooyodo in a bunny outfit must be the sexiest thing ever

  messi
ive always heard conflicting accounts about this but specifically in tokyo does the culture there allow teenagers to have quite a lot of freedom and independence that it would be normal for a 13 year old to frequently leave their house alone and go anywhere within tokyo to meet friends of the same age
  if youve got the money for transport then yes its piss easy to get around even as a kid    theres a ton of other factors though
  of course
    is it more normal there for a 13 year old to do this than say in new york or another large american city where they wouldnt need a car to get around    i always imagined that all the scenes of anime characters meeting up with their friends on their own terms so frequently was a fantasy
  i think you need to go out more anon
  i grew up in los angeles and still live here so im not used to city with strong public transportation if you didnt have a car here which is everyone pretty much until 16 you didnt have that kind of freedom and independence
  is this normal for 13 year olds
      yeah in tokyo and other big cities it is completely normal given how modern and effective their public transport is and how cycling is incredibly common as well the density of tokyo  other cities where theres always something to do on each street corner    if you live in la or other typical north american cities where public transport was scrapped or casually implemented as an afterthought because they designed everything based on cars around the turn of the last century then the concept of just going out around the city as a kid is surely inconceivable  you do need a car to go anywhere unfortunately  i live in some candian suburbs of a major city and i still have to ride the bus like an asshole to get anywhere  theres also the sociocultural issue of how youre not going to get shot and/or robbed because you walked down the wrong street while wearing the wrong kind of colored shirt or whatever    its also that parents tend to work hard and long hours so kids learn from an early age to take the train home by themselves and even often go grocery shopping on their own after school and they ride the train and metro like its nothing when theyre still extremely young kids
  thats what i thought but this anon    made it seem like i had an abnormal outlook on growing up in america
    is it not normal where you live for at least kids to walk to school and back on their own im not sure if op is a shut in or people are so scared for kids nowadays im not too old but i remember a complaint being that i didnt go outside enough at 14 at least i could go wherever i felt like thats basically 13
  some kids sure but not a lot a lot of kids will get rides with their parents    im not sure if op is a shut in or people are so scared for kids nowadays    it could be both im not too sure if i go out as much as other people
  its all relative and america is also almost an entire continent so its a big place with loads of different living conditions    la has like 90 something metro stations while new york has 400 so its much easier to get around in nyc  nyc is also an older city so its built around density rather than the sprawling suburbs of la where everything was built around the automobile    tokyo is also like that obviously an old city but as it was built after the war it wasnt build like american cities  postwar in america the ideea was to move people out of the cities and build suburbs so that people can drive their cars all over the place  postwar tokyo was based on bringing more people from the countryside to work in the cities    anyways didnt mean to write a blog but theres a whole bunch of factors that make it why kids in tokyo are just basically like little tiny adults that ride the subway or their bikes by themselves all day long  by the time they become teens its not like their parents are suddenly like no tomiko i forbid you to leave the house i do not want you having sexual intercourse with akira whose parents are drug addicts
  walk to school    not op but most kids i know from back in the day had to take a 40 minute bus ride each way to and from school    personally i was fortunate enough to live near my grade school and was actually allowed to walk there and back by myself as far back as i can remember but only it was a 5 minute walk  no way my mom would have let me done that shit if i had to take the train and whatever else to go across town  high school and shit i had to take the school bus and by the time i got home so did my parents  in tokyo its just like okay have a nice day mom and dad im riding the subway to school between two salarymen    also i live in the suburbs so unless i wanted to hang out at walmart there was really nothing to do and nowhere to go     what i love the most about tokyo is how everything is accessible by foot  the city i live in prides itself so hard on the fact that theres an underground city which is just like hallways connecting shopping malls to some metro stations and some financial/commercial buildings  but that shit is extremely common in tokyo its basically the norm     
  exactly  jp society is build around parents working  so that  dont have to pick up kids and waste worktime this is also regarding crime and safety
  that and also really the physical structure of the city  there is no picking up kids from school cause the parents arent driving around the city theyre riding the train and metro and walking around like their kids and everyone else    same reason why video game arcades are still going strong in japan and in the west theyre practically all gone
why didnt they just steal a gun from the present and shoot naraku
  theyre gone in the west because it started costing like 2 to play a game when you could just play it at home after buying a console or download games on computers and play online japan had good ideas like cards you could charge money too and a lack of a pc gaming culture so consoles still stay as home versions of arcades that and having a higher degree of gaming culture than america to begin with if just lack of people walking was a problem theyd build arcades next to schools and parents would latchkey their kids there       because it would just turn out to be another fake naraku and the bees would come out and sting them again
  i walked to and from school at grade fucking 2 in toronto
literal/physical freedom yes effective freedom no    you are looking at the autonomy of japanese youth from a western perspective of am i allowed to do x and y while being completely oblivious to the everpresent curtain of social expectations and propriety that more reliably controls the behavior of your average person in japan so even though they are given a huge amount of autonomy and agency they are not expected or really allowed to do anything particularly exciting or worth mentioning other than commuting to school or lessons and maybe a bit cheap shopping occasionally meeting with friends that arent already your peers from school or work or possibly your neighborhood is not something that is done for the most part and japanese parents would are incredibly domineering of unaccounted time outside of the usual
  no not the bees
  you mean the mangas where a lot of jap delinquents own motorbikes and skipping classes are false
   so even though they are given a huge amount of autonomy and agency they are not expected or really allowed to do anything particularly exciting or worth mentioning other than commuting to school or lessons and maybe a bit cheap shopping occasionally    im not sure i understand this would be more or less be what a teenager in america would want they would just spend time outside doing whatever because they want their parents out of their lives and what they are going to do with their time besides what is expected is just shopping or hanging out with friends it does sound ideal
i wish usa had good public transportation
    dude you live in la get on a skateboard like everyone else and with those stupid new electric scooters everywhere youve really got no excuse
itt extremely slick details in touhou that you didnt notice until way later
i always found that to be strange    like what was the point
  zun likes dumb jokes plus the reimuyukari border gimmick goes with red and violet being the borders of visible colors alice is supposed to have the ultimate magic so having all the colors would make her the strongest   it bothered me why patchouli had a 7 thing association too being days of the week instead it makes marisa weird with her only being black and white interestingly byakuren also has a kinda rainbow gradient color hair and scroll thing      zun also likes colors and patterns for whatever reason i wonder if his old site logo is how he sees the world when drunk he seems to like the colors red and blue a lot
  zun also likes colors and patterns for whatever reason  its understandable colors and patterns are pretty
  i remember seeing an interview something along the lines of when asked about lewd doujin work he joked about how he saw danmaku patterns as erotic but i think he was serious
  did we really need two touhou lore threads      use the catalogue next time also posting your reaction to touhou wiki shit doesnt belong on /jp/ anyone can read the wiki no one particularly cares about your reaction to the fucking wiki
  no one cares about your overanalysis of moe danmaku generators either
  he joked about how he saw danmaku patterns as erotic  he says this all the time its a zun staple
  not the guy who made the thread or the posts just annoyed that some faggot made a duplicate thread but this time instead of his own insights he just reads shit off the wiki listen here newfriend /jp/ isnt your personal blog no one cares about your reaction to the wiki
  moe   if you want to successfully shitpost at least try to hide it so that the opposing side actually takes the bait seriously
  im not the op and i care go back to /v/ or /vg/ and spout your irrational hatred and namecalling there
  go to one of the many idol generals if you wanna whine about duplicate threads
    if you want to samefag then go back to /v/ or /vg/ no one cares about your reaction to touhou wiki /jp/ isnt your blog
  those two replies are 14 seconds apart get out of /jp/
  exactly youre a mobile poster which explains your newfaggotry and use of the touhou wikia again no one cares abou your reaction to the touhou wikia /jp/ is not your blog
  stop creating autistic stories in your mind about me and go back to your own board
  you have to go back even if you arent op defending someone who posts about their reaction to the fucking touhou wikia is reprehensible
  which do you prefer hmm waifu imag/e/dump thread 94572 or a thread that could actually turn out interesting much like this one please scum like you are the reason why /jp/ is so bad nowadays again leave this board and never come back
  theres already a lore thread its better than this pile of normalfaggotry   interesting   reading off of touhou wikia is not interesting fuck off back to your normalfag board no one cares about your reaction to touhou wikia /jp/ isnt you blog
  stop creating these autistic stories about me in your head already you schizo im not op get out of /jp/ already
  you should get out of /jp/ for defending normalfag shit like blogging about your reaction to the touhou wikia go back

  wow goddess
    i knew it my qt baby hasnt forgotten who she is  wheres her brother  where __
she is ded to me 
  tfw you realise that there arent any images of akarins armpits  i can provide feet though
  goddess
  when i wrote 4chan i meant it the poal was posted on every single llrelated thread on 4chan and 4channel including imaged ups on /c/ the base is much larger than this general
  an insane orctaku tries to start shit and once again a hero must rise to save the day    know this scum there are those still loyal to her because she is our leader and always will be we have not forgotten that she helped build love live    the movie is coming out soon i must fight harder bolder and stronger than ever for innocent maidens my life for the cause
  its still proxy overrun mess even hagfags agree bokura is one of the weakest singles from that era its also generally accepted aqours music is higher quality so the only reason that song won is because of insecurity of the hagfags
  the movie is coming out  she isnt in that movie stop flooding
i want to discipline aiai
    shitty noisy kuso balloon
  i will never stop fighting you and your scummy ilk i made a vow to defend her to fight against you to defend the innocent    this is the proof of loyalty and very soon you will learn the meaning of loyalty
fight for emitsun  stand with emitsun  die for emitsun    my honour is loyalty
  you will learn the meaning of loyalty   elaborate or are you saying stop disliking  things i like
emitsun our leader   our only leader   our goddess and fair maiden     fight and fight and fight for her sake
explain to me why you arent fapping to kitousan    explain it you twards
  the meaning of loyalty is this i never abandoned her after that day of the so called scandal i double down and fought for her defended her hours upon hours and i keep fighting for her to this day     i will continue fighting because i am loyal to the end fighting bolder and stronger defending her like the few defending the skies of the british isles    that is the meaning of loyalty
  she remind me of suwawa without autism
  you know what please continue anyone who makes moosefags look bad is alright in my book
she reminds of oh jesus just fap
  why be loyal if she isnt loyal /  damn you sexy skelly _
she is also depressed 
  on the contrary falseflagging orctaku scum i think this reflects well on them and indeed all because it shows not everyone is willing to abandon their girl at the drop of a hat    and know this i dont just fight for emitsun i fight for all innocent maidens who need my help that is my war my crusade    if anyone from aqours needed it i would raise my sword in vicious defense of them should the orctakus attack any of them as they did emitsun i will be there    and make no doubt they and the purityfags scum are also aligned against them the scum who tried to ruin the shanghai concert was the orctakus the villains of shanghai    that is why my fight is important and why i will continue to fight    you think this makes anyone look bad not quite it shows that there is still good as there is still good people in gotham city      my loyalty is unconditional i defend all innocent maidens under attack and right now one of them is being attacked in this hive the orctakus lurk out of their cave
the guu
  because i lost the picture with her in garter belts
  because 6 is my limit until it starts shriveling so so much that it goes back into my body
  liar
explain to me why you arent fapping to oonizisan    explain it you twards
  i stand with her
explain to me why you arent fapping to tmrroneesan    explain it you twards
  because my body is not designed to react sexually to retards unable to breed
explain to me why you arent fapping to cute chuuni     explain it you twards
  you cant handle the truth
  99 retard not able do breed i stand with her until bitter end in gotham city
  i just want to marry her and make a large family with her
  u dont defend rkk u liar and tmrr onee san and purple
explain to me why you arent fapping to very cute rkk    explain it you twards
  they do not need my assistance at least not yet at the first whiff of scandal i will be there shield sword clad in armour like a winged hussar ready to mete divine judgement upon the hordes at viennas gate    can you say the same and this goes for everyone pdp and aqours
  liar
  desu i cant tell the difference between white knightkun and jan sobieski
  that is the truth i am more loyal i am a true fan of love live the scum attack emitsun i defend the villains of shanghai try to attack aqours also orctakus i defend and fight back    scum try to attack hisako kanemoto i was there with the blade that metes justice    i am an ally of justice
  liar liar
  they are both great heroes who rise in a time of need when vienna is outnumbered 15 to 1 jan sobieski rides down from kahlenberg when innocent maidens are under attack the crusader king rides down to turn the tide    in december like september the enemy will bleed
  tell me which one was attacked in shanghai and how
  truth truth and truth again
  can you do arthur harrys speech but nazi is replaced with orctaku and rotterdam and london is replaced with emnt and hirano
  do you remember the faggot who tried to hijack the concert with fireworks and the scum who sent dirty presents to the girls    those were the villains of shanghai they were a chinese breed of orctaku they have bred and fester like rats
  thank you for your service ll needs more heroes like you
  which girl
  i remember vienna was also in napoleon
explain to me why you arent fapping to namisan    explain it you twards
explain to me why you arent fapping to qb    explain it you twards
  so uh why didnt aqours fans proxy as hard it was posted on at least 5 boards you ought to have seen it
  might be hiding fucked up mileena teeth with that mask i need more information
lewd af
  because we dont need to prove anything with a crappy online poll
is aqours doing anything on the release date of the movie
  yes
  what
  had kimi no kokoro won i can already see the huge circlejerk it would have created
aikyan anchan why arent you looking at me
holy mama king
lovely anchan saying waaahhh like chika
  nice projection
  im just calling you out no need to resort to meme answers
  butai aisatsu
they sure are busy
  yeah but what they gonna do there
  tired of them hope they die this year
  cute butthurt but lube up because youre in for a long ride       i mean its butai aisatsu they go there and talk a bit before the movie and thats it and since most cinemas dont have too much space at the front the first few rows will get to see them super close as they do with fanmis the very first row will probably get blocked off
  cute butthurt but lube up because youre in for a long ride  why do you behave like an asshole its because of this fanbase i ended up getting tired of their shit
  hope they die this year  why do you behave like an asshole  pottery
  just report flowerfag
  its just my opinion goddammit
    its no use anon dont bother with them they are exactly what people call fanboys
  which you are entitled to but presented in the most asshole way possible then proceeded to complain about getting a response in similar fashion
  no i did not it is you who get defensive at every bad comment about your precious girls psycho  my question meant why do you always have to be like this
  because its 4channel and you usually dont sugarcoat your opinion and my humble opinion is that anyone who wishes something bad to befall others not just aqours can go fuck themselves     lets end this nice meta here
  this is what kaorin sees before getting mindbroken
  my humble opinion is that you should get cancer and die annoying faggot you are everything that is wrong with this fanbase and i am not the only one saying this
what is going on
  some insecure and jelly anon throwing a tantrum
  stop turning kinchan into a shitpost idol please
  its the usual time no point of coming here when that cuny is awake
  kanako and anchan forever ruined
  its like thats his sole goal
king has gone from pudding belly to sexy as hell please dont use her to start shit and trigger people
  she was sexy as fuck with pudding belly too
  imagine living to achieve that
  eating pudding out of her belly button is still on my bucket list
  what taste would go the best with a faint kinchan aroma
  butterscotch or french vanilla to go with her earthy aromas
  cold or body temp   putting it on cold could get nice reactions from her but i think itd help the taste to consume warm  or just start cold then wait for it to warm to king temperature
akua a shit
  u right

where the fuck did the no they are not ever getting an anime there was an announcement rumour even come from     theres people claiming that sunrise has ended contract even though you can clearly see sunrise name at the end of the skits is it delusional aqours fans angry at nijigasaki i dont really get it why would people actively spread that shit when did theres no anime announcement at this point become no theyre never getting an anime theyre game only
wew lad
jesus calm down
sorry it just really bothers me how this shit has been spreading all over the relevant social networks i thought that once we got the concert announcement and the solos that kind of haters would die down but it seems it only has increased
  moñitos tried to lewdify my baby  and she achieved it    dang you little sneaky horny demon
  i will try to be a neutral here but i dont quite like the way the group is being handled i feel like their future direction is still a mystery i would have preferred a clear straightforward direction like aqours who had their 1st single as animated pv and got an anime announcement on the day of their first public live performance    i dont really have a problem with the nijigasaki cast now that i have followed some of the stuff they are doing but i would have preferred a cast with literal nobodies with no prior experiences like aqours my opinion is that the franchise should have been more unambiguous about what they are trying to do with the group and maybe could have introduced them towards the end of aqours run
  my opinion is that the franchise should have been more unambiguous  this hits the nail on the head im not confident the know what they want to do so theyre just driving stakes into the ground to see what works
  well to be fair the nijigasaki marketing has been pretty confusing so far they used to start their streams saying that theyre not an idol group like µs and aqours and that they were gameexclusive it was obvious the producers were scared shitless of riling up the fanbase by coming up with a replacement for aqours so soon but now they keep teasing new projects and activities so its no wonder theres some confusion and some people being bitter
  see i dont have a problem with people expressing this i agree to some level anyway the handling has been mediocre probably because they didnt want  nj to butt into aqours turf and  provoke another sales drop     what i dislike is people actively lying theyre game only akarin/setsuna said they would never get an anime sunrise is not involved in anything etc   are some of the shit i have seen spread     with how damn easy it is to follow the nj seiyuus activities and announcements there should be no way for this kind of rumours to spread but it seems like theres a group of people that just stick their fingers in their ears and go lalalalalalala at anything official that contradicts their headcanon     so i guess its just people being bitter and entering their own echo chamber where nothing comes for love live after aqours

psychedelica has changed its steam release date again
  charlie never
this isnt visual novel related but i figured id ask here anyways for mo dao zu shi how is it possible for something like this to exist because i had remembered someone here even talking about how bl is illegal in china is it because its a novel so nobody gives a damn is gay shit simply not allowed in visual type media    also to keep this comment slightly ontopic i started playing hadaka and its actually pretty great
readyyy mvs for rayglanz and just 4u are out      
  chinese censorship is quite selective in general in 2014 they arrested some fujos for writing gay fics while shaming them on national tv but at the moment chinese bl novels still get written although theyre much less explicit post 2016 they also keep getting adapted into different mediums if were talking about mdzs its radio drama and manhua not completely sure kept the romantic scenes and touchyfeely moments between the main characters while theyre completely missing from the anime and of course theyre going to be just friends in the live action  everything about mo dao zhu shi or any other novels by this author goes against their censorship guidelines but i guess as long as something prints money and doesnt get reported to the authorities its okay    has anyone played the sweet pool demo how is the translation
squares latest failure is out now    
  i give it 4 months
  idol fantasy probably kicking the bucket soon
  i think the manhua has no touchy feely parts i believe the translator said that on their website in comparison to the novel which apparently does im not very far in the novel myself so cant comment on that and ive finished watching the anime there was no gay shit either but yet it made sense to me as the two main characters havent had much interaction with each other so i assumed it was a slow type of development seems odd to me though as some have had said that mdzs is extremely popular in china so its odd the authorities wouldnt know about it especially because i assume its making a lot of money more money  more attention  more likelihood of getting reported/found out    speaking of sweet pool does anyone know what the next nitrochiral game theyll be translating will be i hope its lamento
well then
he sees broccolis release schedule
if any eops care psychedelica stream release has been delayed again and now the date is unknown
dramatic create winter sale    
  nice
been playing tmgs3 on emulator english patched and theres a weird bug whenever casual spring shitaras model has to show up freezing the game dont know if its the iso the patch or my computer i couldnt find any mention of this bug online
delaying release every 3 days  removing release date and releasing the game out of nowhere  the game is an empty folder  yikes at least psychedelica can be downloaded now
i lived long enough to see uncut and mosaic free bl titles on steam what a time to be alive

girl game has minigame segment  have to say that its easy to be considered a selling point
  shit taste
tokimeki idol is closing down  is it time for girls side to take over
  finally put out of its misery    f maybe that dancing game wont be as big a fuckup
with nothing new being released how big is your backlog these days
i wonder if psychedelica pc version will ever work
i wish yumecast would at least unlock all love stories before they end service
  i only saw that its closing down now a shame even if i stopped playing months ago i hope theyll at least release the songs     this makes me wonder why other games that have a boring gameplay and shit story are selling so well mainly enstars and i7 since i played those and couldnt bear to play them for more than 6 months    are you guys still playing any of them
  the success of these games seem to mostly be on the characters timing and some luck and maybe female players really do hate actual gameplay like some developers seem to believe you can see the bubble starting to burst since so many mobage have shut down recently    i used to play enstars for a couple of years quit a year ago and never looked back i7 couldnt hold my attention long with its event structure didnt even want to touch a3 etc the only game i really liked was banyaro and that died so
what happened to the psychedelic bl game
  what
    this
      its a bl game actually titled psychedelic production seems to have paused for now though    
boards been going faster lately
  nope this   and too bad i hope pause does not mean never for them
loverevo is so shit why do i love it
  because you hate yourself and have bad taste
did dmm buy out rejet    
  i think their just giving them money to make new properties for dmm but i dont know japanese legalese  出資 investment financing

  live action  nope feels so awkward and weird seeing people act like anime characters in real life
    the single day ive been most dreading since my heart and soul witnessed the sweetest spaghetti to exist has come i had only hoped to see the challenge on the music difficulty raised aside from that i love yumecast dearly     i was shocked when banyaro announced its termination the music they produced was unreal while there were still elements of pop the variety was high we had ballads legit and awesome rock fun and the vocals were 11/10 and if that wasnt enough the game play was like watching a bolt of lightening i find yume similar in the strength of the music and the well created and captured character image we got to hear in the singles so why wasnt it enough i do think that sometimes it is just luck alone that allows some stars a higher place to shine    i feel like im in fucking mourning this next month is going to suck so bad what do you do when your love dies /blog/ _
the utapris are active on twitter
  i completely feel you im still very sad over banyaro ending it really did have amazing music both it and yumecast got a lot of traction on twitter for their endofservice announcements too so yeah if youre attached you kind of get into a mourning phase things like hypmic were lucky enough to suddenly pick up even though that lacks content and most of the music is pretty mediocre    on that note the final cds for banyaro should have shipped out so maybe well get rips of the full exr songs etc soon
anyone here making an otome/bl vn
  what do you do when your love dies  move to another dead game

  speaking of sweet pool does anyone know what the next nitrochiral game theyll be translating will be i hope its lamento  translating  arent they simply using the fan translations can somebody enlighten me
    parades no thank you is now available on steam you can pick it up during launch week for 30 off  please note that the version of no thank you on steam is identical to the version available currently available on our website  i dont get it steam allows eroge now
  sweet pool is getting a new translation at least
  whos translating
  verdelish i believe
  talks about being sad over a game not having enough funds to continue and getting illegal downloads from its cds in the same post    thats probably how most of the players felt
  thanks
a week later psychedelica pc version is still not working  nice pc port
  i love him
  i actually did order 3 cds from this set though and i bought an album during each printing obviously not everyone does but it is what it is   so yeah i am sad about the games closure
  i found one that has above average art for a western vn dont know if it belongs here though
  it fits /vg/s oelvn threads better but why not whats its name
    you can lez out with girls too im not complaining though they are qts
  looks like shit are you here just to shill
    desu it is a step above average western art but thats not saying much because being slightly better than utter garbage doesnt mean its good
  yes this happened a few weeks ago there was a huge stink raised over porn games like huniepop getting removed while games like the witcher and gta 5 had tons of nudity and sex in it so then they started allowing nsfw games but now you have to enable a hard to find setting in your settings to even be allowed to see such games
  why is doujin illegal but not novels i dont get it      mention some other oelvns bl or otome as long as the story is nice i dont really care all that much about art running out of english shit to play and i dont have time to learn jap
    read the article just now it was a writer too not a doujinshi creator but damn 10 years    another was a man who was sentenced to 6½ years in jail for beating his wife to death in beijing in 2009  official in yunnan province who was sentenced to five years in prison for abducting and raping a fouryearold girl  writing gay sex scenes in a novel  10 years    why is china like this but now this makes my original point even more confusing it looks like you only get jail time if your novel sells a certain amount the woman who was arrested only sold 7k    selling more than 5000 copies of pornographic books or making more than 10000 yuan us1400 from their sale is regarded as an especially serious circumstance which carries a sentence of imprisonment for not less than 10 years or life    mo dao zu shi is one of the most popular danmei out there and even got an anime im sure its sold well over 7k copies so why hasnt the author for mdzs been arrested
  oh wow so now you will be able to buy eroge on steam without any censorship feels so weird
  mo dao zu shi is one of the most popular danmei out there and even got an anime im sure its sold well over 7k copies so why hasnt the author for mdzs been arrested  it really beats me  did the printed version contain the sex chapters too anyway in china law is only a vague idea similarly to other countries in the region for example did you know that prostitution is illegal in thailand people do illegal activities there all the time but as long as they bribe off the police and/or keep out of spotlight they get away with it   it seems there is a crackdown on erotic content at the moment and this is just scary
is it awful
  as long as the story is nice i dont really care all that much about art  anon if youre just looking for a nice story why not just read a romance novel western vns are incapable of truly giving both so would you really be fine with a vn that has a nice storyline but with art as fucking hideous as this
  600000 yuan  86455 usd  god im glad the chinese government is spending their money on catching the real criminals
  why do western evn devs try so hard to make their artwork not anime and unique they must know it makes it look like garbage correct pic very fucking related
  hide your bl and r18 games bros
  probably something about muh representation all isms will be persecuted among the communities who actually bother to make them also jesus christ everything about that screenshot looks terrible theres nothing remotely appealing about it
  do you know what absolutely fucking pisses me off about the pic i posted that game has two artists and the other ones art looks like this  like why in the fuck would you even keep the other person on
  but you can have characters that are for representation and still look good in an anime style though pic related is the biggest sjwbait ive ever seen and shes still a qt  im pretty sure most western artists just want to emulate cutesy generic cal arts style but are too shit to do so
  communism was a mistake
  theres more than just minority representation like trying to give characters realistic facial features or body types that deviate from the idealized anime face/proportions/whatever    then again i dont really understand why they do it in the first place and whether its just bad taste or some sort of sjw agenda
  what kind of representation is this supposed to be something uglier than bad looking real humans i thought otome was partially about escapism    i agree therere plenty of ways to have representation in your game without going out of your way to make the characters as unappealing as possible
    im honestly starting to believe they just want the characters ugly as fuck on purpose you can have a character with a big nose and still have them be attractive you can have a character with freckles and not have them look like they were shot with an exploding paint gun bullet that was filled with feces is there a single otome/bl evn out there thats even a single ounce comparable to the jvn scene
situation cds when
please dont post more of that disgusting art already
free shipping on 15k yen orders at animate international  barren game section because they still wont update their store listings unless you literally ask them to    good time to preorder kenka bancho otome 2s animate set and an extra cd i guess
  like in terms of art i know of one episodic game that comes pretty close the only problem is that sometimes the art is inconsistent and some cgs look different to others and at times the characters look kind of ugly in them too the most recent episode actually had perfect cgs across the board though so i hope it stays like that  if youre looking for a good game in general though cant recommend it has a kind of boring plot its episodic with a shitty way to advance the plot so youd have to continually invest money and time for an ideal playthrough the fanbase is absolutely shit tier and almost as bad as the voltron fanbase also only has like 2 lewd artists and theres only one character who is actually worth going for since the others are the aforementioned sjwbait pajeet a stalker gook that your in game friends keep trying to force you together which he of course loves an arab/turk teacher who falls in love with you at first sight and a generic bad boy singer best bois route is better enjoyed when you play the first game though which is absolute ass so you lose out a bit there so still cant fully recommend even though i am desperate to talk about this game with other people as despite what i said above the second game has improved massively in terms of writing over these past 7 years and im so happy but everyone else is assmad cause some shitty routes were removed in place of better characters but theyre too attached to their dumb husbandos and constantly shit on game in bias and arent open to real conversation
    whoever drew this hates themselves
hello 4channel
  whats the name of the game
  you could just use reverse image search
    id rather you just reverse search it the title is my life me tier i hate even thinking it so i just tell people the original french game pls no bully i know this game looks like shit to people who only play nip otome ill still give you the run down on it if you want though
    my candy love i reversed it earlier and was thinking that couldnt be it the artwork on the website didnt resemble the posted image at all also give me the rundown friend
  thank you for giving me this oppurtunity fren im on break at work so if i dont continue right away its cause of that
  kenka bancho otome  not just kenka bancho
  yeah but theres no point in discussing it here since /blog/ wont even acknowledge its existence here anyway                excluding obvious ugly tumblr or deviantart garbage what exactly is objectively inferior about evns compared to japanese vns both art and writingwise are you sure its not just a subjective opinion of yours based on your preference of japanese art theres nothing wrong with preferring it i do too but that doesnt mean western style is bad
  westernshit has produced literally nothing of substance
  theres a lack of market for it here and theres little to no resources teams can use outside of their own pocket money to fund it as a hobby or whatever meager money they can scrounge up from kickstarters which is of course going to be inferior to a team composed of professionals with an actual salary and market in japan   outside of that i find evns to be inferior writing wise because the people that tend to even care about visual novels as a medium are usually weebs in the first place and dont do anything original that set it apart from japanese vns besides having a more progressive viewpoint on topics such as gender roles almost every single western created vn ive seen has only tried to emulate an anime style or just impose their western values on some sort of japanese setting as wish fulfillment    so overall japanese vns have the advantage of  1 being composed by a team of professionals  2 having an established market   3 having decades of experience to get the formula down     in general i have a problem with art in visual novels western or not since a lot of it tends to be cookie cutter especially in galge some of them can be aesthetically pleasing and nice but they still look the same most of the time only exception ive seen to this is fata morgana which doesnt belong here
  theres two reason i dont like evns   tries too hard to be pc  tries too hard to be japanese    in regards to the first reason  i literally just got done playing one bl the synopsis/game page said nothing about the main character actually being a tranny as in a ftm why call it a r18 bl game when the main character has a vagina the forced pc is just all around obnoxious too the inclusiveness in the writing of evns is the most heavy handed shit in existence subtlety is lost on evn creators completely i dont want to start up a game and then have the main character in a bl game get misgendered within the first five minutes of the game and his male friend comforts him about how awful it is to be called a girl i dont play visual novels to get lectured at by some author self insert mouth piece its annoying    another example   black character is introduced  black character immediately gets hassled by the police  black character whines about how hard life is being a poc  its like the people writing this shit has never actually interacted with a black person before they think black people just walk around and get harassed and cry about how hard life is thats the entirety of every nonwhite character in an evn    and some bl and otome evns in general just have terrible art work and terrible writing because the games themselves are made by complete amateurs or they try too hard to make it japanese but yet all the characters have names like colton and josh but yet they all say ehhh and other japanese sayings/remarks    theyre just all around fucking terrible and honestly i wish it wasnt this way if a single person could point me in the direction of a finished and decent bl or otome evn that would be great     also what this guy said  
  thank you for giving me a good answer i agree completely actually most of these vns that are discussed in /blog/ were made by professionals and only a few of them are doujin so western weebs unoriginality political correctness  indie lower quality budget naturally ends up being bad i see i usually only pay attention to the best or most interesting evns out there so i didnt know the scene was that bad i also believe one of the issues with western works is that they aim too high and miss  i also get sick of cookie cutter art in jvns too the otome side is almost as bad as the galge side lately its like all those boys are trying too hard to look unique but somehow they look the same especially if theyre idols at least some of the plots make up for it  almost every single western created vn  what are some exceptions to that in your opinion      i feel races and gender identities are to evns what high school character archetypes are to jvns just with the purpose of pushing an agenda  anyway thank you for answering i think there are some oelvns out here that dont seem to try to be japanese but dont look too amateurish either i forgot their names though  speaking of this shit has anyone played seiyuu danshi yet how bad is it
  seiyuu danshi  its bad the writing is very cringy and its clear it was made by an esl the humor is anything but it really beats my mind why its so popular the art work is also very amateur with some weird anatomy mistakes thrown in as well i would never spend my money on this
  what are some exceptions to that in your opinion  not the guy you replied to but here are some evns i thought were alright    red embrace hollywood bl and otome  demo only  average  mc arrives in hollywood and is unwillingly turned into a vampire and must choose a coven to join  above average art for evns  tons of choices/character creation as well  if you like trashy vampire stuff this ones for you    sinfonia bl  demo only  slightly below average   murder mystery set in an english all boys catholic school  based highly off of 70s era shoujo manga kaze to ki no uta vibe  artwork is a bit below average/goofy at times  i may be biased with this title as i like old shoujo manga    wishes in pen chrysanthemums otome  demo only  above average  mcchan is transported back to the past of ancient japan  if not for the kickstarter i wouldve believed this was originally japanese made  high production values with nice backgrounds and live2d sprites  same face/boring poses with the sprites  based on the demo id say this game could even be played by the otome jvn purists in here    cinderella phenomenon otome  complete  above average  mc is a princess who is suddenly cursed into being poor because of her shitty and bitter personality  unique personality of the heroine in an otome for once  art is sometimes alright and sometimes below average with the characters facial anatomy  story feels a bit cliche with the fairy tale curses  plot and world building has a bit of a childish feel  probably the best otome evn that is also complete out there right now sadly which is why i rate it above average    what my neighbors are demons eroge/otome  demo only  above average  mc is a sex addict a succubus and an incubus move in right next to her  some of the best art out there in evns right now  too much usage of the chibi art in sex scenes makes it hilarious instead of titillating    meeting in the flesh otome/bl  demo only  above average  takes place in some alternate world where humans dont exist but instead beastly and horrifying monsters do  you play as a monstrous creature too  actual monsters i should clarify not cat boys or something  interesting world building the important of salt for example     obviously most of the titles ive mentioned are not on par with japanese visual novels when i say above average i am referring to evn standards
why are you even talking about this garbage in /jp/ in the first palce isnt there an english original vn thread in /vg/
  no it died
i feel there was less stuff this agf
whats with the lack of good monster boy content
    holy fucking shit i hate black friday   anyway heres the rundown on this mess of a game  ok so the website that you went to was the main page for the first game the one you absolutely need to stay away from somewhere on the page there is a link to the second game the one i actually recommend  so you get to play as a customizable main character whos default name we will go with as lynn the game has no real plot but generally an episode consists of lynn doing some dumb shit and playing therapist/counselor to the retard shitcunts she goes to school with absolutely none of these people or even the lis are likeable or nice and they all need help with something or another lynn in both the second game and last 13 eps of the 1st is nothing like she is in the beginning the first 15 episodes shes a stupid nosy bitch who blames other people for the messes she makes later on she turns into a nice and caring person who is only slightly nosy to genuinely help the people who need her as well as possibly having an anxiety disorder and getting slim thicc 8/10 waifu for me  regarding the lis in the first game part of why it isnt worth playing is because 3 out of the five routes were removed and replaced in the second game theyre all just boring archetypes most of the time and not great characters in general so despite my criticism in the other post the newer characters are actually improvements the first game had a military brat who was a dork but not all that interesting a gentlemen character obviously based on ikki except hes a fucking idiot who likes and wears victorian fashion but doesnt know much about it like in the beach episode he doesnt know there are victorian era swimsuits so he just wears modern swimwear instead and theres a lol us epic gamers amirite reddit xdddd faggot who does nothing but spout references and gets pissed if you dont understand them so a good reason why they were all removed but their fans are literally on suicide watch because theyre gone now and only stay active in the fandom to fling their shit at the developers and anyone who likes the newer game  my personal best boi in the first game is nathaniel and he is the student council president characterized as a very responsible and serious student hes actually kind of bitchy to you if you criticize him at all in the earlier episodes and hes slightly different from the archetype in this way and also that he boxes and isnt afraid to start physical fights with his rival or anyone who pisses him off its implied that hes slightly fucked in the head and you later find out its cause his dad beats the shit out of him at home for doing anything even slightly wrong which is apparently very frequently also most likely because his dad got cucked out of a really good position at work by a younger coworker who looks exactly like his son you essentially have to try and save him and through some rather controversial decisions you succeed and nathaniel emancipates himself the rest of the game you solve other peoples shit and every once in a while its implied that now hes even more fucked cause he doesnt know what to do with himself now that he isnt being literally whipped into shape the first game ends without this being resolved   apparently french people cant fucking do math so the second game takes place after a 4 or 6 year timeskip and the main character returns to the town of the first game to finish college you meet nathaniel when some guys are harassing you late at night and he tells them to fuck off his appearance has changed entirely and he looks like the biggest fuccboi thug you could possibly imagine he acts like one too except for relatively frequent moments where you both just sit the fuck down and talk about your feelings and find out that after you left and possibly broke up if you were dating he had a rough time living alone after high school as it is implied his father and mother abandoned him and his sister so he had to resort to doing extremely shady things to continue supporting himself in addition all of the socalled friends you had in high school abandoned and shunned him so he was essentially alone all these years in an extremely fragile mental state and just got all fucked up cause he ended up spending all his time with shitty influences and no one who actually cared for him until the mc comes back of course and he stops acting like an asshole as soon as you show him youre not also abandoning him
  beautiful formatting youve got there
  hes basically an abused puppy who wants head pats in exchange for not humping and pissing all over your stuff if you decide to take the plunge anon i highly recommend his route although the others range from decent to pretty good i cant stress enough though to not play the first game and to remember even the second works more as a trashy guilty pleasure rather than a quality otome nathaniels route is the only one i would truly consider to be great also customizing the main characters looks and seeing how it shows up in illustrations is fun too
  are you being sarcastic  listen im tired and shaky from work its almost 3 am where i am pls no bully too stupid to undsrstand jokes right now
  youre going to have to look outside /blog/ stuff for that kind of thing    digimon onmyoji smt come to mind digimon is probably the best bet given all the content and the mons being treated as characters usually onmyoji youre stuck with just a mobage and smt varies in how much spotlight the demons get as characters
this never got an ost release huh
  metamorphaser thats why you gotta check vndb first for some things thankfully that seems to be the only game out there with that premise    i only pay attention to english stuff because they have a slightly better chance of making something in a scifi setting this my soul was ok
what will happen to otome localization cr 2nd fandisk will be the last thing aksys localizes to vita
   in suprised no ones bitching about all the english otome posting       aksys said they would do what otomate did so prepare to buy a a switch      also is anyone playing that new japanese dress up/otome game helix waltz i like the love interests but theres alot of typos and spelling mistakes in the localization  im not really even into dress up games
  in suprised no ones bitching about all the english otome posting  i for one was pleasantly surprised to see so much civil discussion about it besides a lot of discussion was relative to jvns        smt  i havent played any of the raidou games but from what i understand there is some sort of partner demon mechanic in it with the exception of more recent games though smt has traditionally prioritized their occult themes over otaku pandering and the demons generally arent designed with an intent to appeal a la monster girl waifus a lot of the male demons that fans regard as being attractive also tend to just be humanoids like cu chulainn but there are some proper monster boys like naga
  i was looking at the screenshots and wasnt into the few outfits shown or the main characters sprite i used to play romantic diary though which was pretty similar now i only play love nikki but how is helix waltz so far i dont see it on the app store anymore  also i would just make a new oelvn thread but as i never go to /vg/ i didnt even know it existed until this thread so i wouldnt know how to make one i also get the feeling most anons would only want to talk about katawa shoujo or ddlc if anyone else makes it though ill migrate over there and stay on topic here
  new japanese dress up  i am pretty sure its chinkshit
  but the prequel was a japanese rpg with japanese voice actors
there are a bunch of otome games on the switch anyone know if theyre any good
  yes and still made by chinks
  theyre all ports of phone games / vita games nothing brand new
  youd be surprised at what people are into look at all the porn of dagda from iva
  well my mistake then it wasnt the quality usual chinese phone games are
  i was just mentioning that in case anon was looking for more of the designedtobeattractive/fuckable monster boy types although dagda getting a lot of porn seems about right
  didnt otomate just release a brand new switch title
  aksys said they would do what otomate did so prepare to buy a a switch  is the switch the future of otome games
  i also get the feeling most anons would only want to talk about katawa shoujo or ddlc  yeah the oelvn general /evn/ didnt really discuss those other than as examples of success from what i recall i dont even know if it was still alive when ddlc came out theres already generals for both of them on that same board i dont think you need to worry about them derailing your evn thread plus most of the discussion used to be about developing vns the newest releases and gossiping many people there also liked otome    go ahead and make a thread id also like to discuss western otome
  aalright ill try and make one soon you wouldnt happen to have a link to the last one the most recent one i can find is from 2012 and dont have time to go deep diving to see if there were any past 5
    latest thread is from 21 days ago
  thanks fren will make it as soon as possible
new oelvn thread is up now  
    
  this is /jp/ fag
  you mean 
  yes so im redirecting the evn conversation there  dumbass
  and i meant you need to crosslink to /vg/ retard
  also thnx anon never crosslinked threads before forgive my retardation
  i need to know if its worth it splurging on a switch if new otome games are going to be released for it itll be totally worth it thank god its region free i wont need to import a japanese console anymore
  cendrillon was released last month and otomate has a few more coming up but everything else is ports
  isnt there also a new hakuoki to be released exclusively on the switch
    anon who asked for the rundown here thanks for all this info im going to take a look at this game once i get off work thank you also   some rather controversial decisions  controversial in what way
  controversial in that lynn essentially forces nathaniel to get himself out of a situation that he was fine with being in she calls social services despite him saying no and as usual in these situations the police do fuck all except make things worse he goes to school the next day with a black eye saying his father was worse than ever because nath actually tried dissuading him for once and failed a lot of people say it was her fault but as someone whos lived through this kind of thing before i say shes more naive most people dont know the police cant/wont do anything so it isnt entirely their fault if things end up even worse i say its more rational to just blame the abuser and the law for preventing anything from actually being done butnmost people in the fandom dont see it that way
  yeah it was that i was just browsing the recommended section on itchio and came across it and several other bl games each more of a disappointment than the last i wanted to try this my soul but i couldnt bring myself to download it the looks of the robot guy literally repulsed me what made you like it
  i just love robots eastern or western and its a rare enough situation that i take what i can get
  game is called my candy love  deals with cps abuse and abandonment   could they have chosen an even worse title i dont think its possible
  binch thats what ive been saying for 5 fuckin years desu though none of the other character arcs are this dark though they can be pretty depressing should be my mental love or something all of these characters have serious issues
  whats issues do the other characters have
  the first arc deals with the bad boy li his exgirlfriend comes back and is a manipulative bitch who threw him under the bus to pursue her music career mc just has to prove how evil she is naths is the second character arc the one after that is the gentlemen character who is the victim of a hit and run and loses some memories including the fact that his father is dying of cancer and that the girl he has a crush on is fucking his older brother you have to retrieve those memories and also make sure that his stalker isnt abusing his loss of memories in order to pretend to be his girlfriend and sexually abuse him presumably  4th arc involves the gamer and he just does some dumb shit that involves hacking government files to find out who his birth parents are only to find out theyre dead but he has a long lost brother who was sent to live in a military camp where he was raped at the 5th lis arc is tied into this reveal as he was a former nerd whos father enrolled him at that same military camp to become a better man he was friends with the lost brother and when they all reunite the two of them start constantly picking fights with other people and sexually harassing other female characters until the lost bro almost gets killed and the li talks about how their toxic masculinity was a result of being bullied and abused at military school and was the only way to survive in a harsh environment so theyre just reverting back to their old ways theres nothing the mc can do to help him its only until after the lost bro is hospitalized that he stops acting like a prick
  yikes sounds like a shitshow     are any jvn otomes this dysfunctional with minimal bad end consideration dialovers need not apply
  i feel like most jvn otome are pretty tame i have yet to see edgy otomes that can compare with some straight shit and nitrochiral
  which is a damn shame i feel like jvns could do a much better job with a dysfunctional cast mcl was ok in that regard but since almost none of the characters were likeable it wasnt very effective  but yeah essentially nitrochiral is the only jvn company ive seen thats done this  sweet pool next month  i am excite bros
    nitrochiral  isnt that kind of edgy shit common in bl games in general
  yes but youre talking to dumb eops nc  all bl games to them
  i dont remember every single fucking bl game that ive played anon especially not when im falling asleep of course i know theres a shitton of them with edgy content  doesnt have to be edgy to be dysfunctional though any games like that
  a lot of them
  people still think fuchii kabura is one person
  yeah weird
  game is called my candy love  theres no candy anywhere
  who cares all gayshit is garbage
    the original post was talking about otome with dark and edgy themes and anon was saying that even the edgiest of otome isnt as edgy as some straight shit or nc stuff not talking about bl      i get that they have to promote the game but saying that new fans to the boys love genre should start with sweet pool is a terrible idea  thats how you end up with the cancer that absolutely doesnt understand the games at all and just spouts stupid memes
  the best of bl games are better than the best of otome but go off      nc  not talking about bl  either retarded or backtracking hard
  cancer that absolutely doesnt understand the games at all and just spouts stupid memes  so the entirety of eops theres no escaping that either way eops should be gassed
  either retarded or backtracking hard  anon read the first posts in order its not my post but the original was talking about otome       pretty much but rather than just eops its mostly the tumblrina brand eops
  nc doesnt do otome
  i think you may legitimately be retarded  chiral is nitros bl game division and they were brought up as the sole company doing something thats common in bl games in general just makes the anons sound like typical eops that dont touch any other company
  but they werent replying to that post they were replying to the ones that brought up nitrochiral
  go on 2ch or another japanese board than you self hating fag
  theyre worse than here
  last time i was in a 2ch thread they were discussing how much they hate koreans  if you try to seriously discuss the games beyond complaining you get told to fuck off back to twitter
is touken ranbu dying
tfw a va never does cds in the voice you want
      i mentioned nitrochiral specifically because all of their games are edgy and have edgy content i am not familiar with straight shit all that well as i dont play it which is why i didnt name a specific company nowhere in my post did i imply that nitrochiral is the only bl company to make edgy bl games
  it does imply its the only company youre familiar with
    it seems like these days most of the tourabu discussion is confined to the /cm/ thread
  hows it doing popularity wise in japan
have you ever wanted to fuck a voice because i want to fuck morikawas
  name 10 edgy bl companies
  yes i want to fuck ono daisukes
  i can name 7 at the top of my head but why should i spoonfeed you
  bullshit
  just because you dont play shit doesnt mean others dont
  not them but youve got pil/slash karin chatnoir zombilica lovedestroy mada koubou parade cyc rose at the very fucking least dude what do even read
  spoonfeeding
  enjoy your ban
the fuck where did all these eops come from
  did they hurt your fee fees
complaining about eops in the eop general  that aside though why is there always somebody mad about nc its not the cool thing to hate on anymore and its not like dmmd tumblrinas are gonna invade  even your precious jp only vns arent safe from eops or shitty fans overall      i dont find parade edgy imo it has violent themes sure but its not edge edge is something like omega vampire but even so its not shock value edge like nc tends to do
  is it the stage cast will be appearing on kohaku
  i thought they died with the bl translation scene good to know that theyre still the objectively worst posters here though
  i didnt even actually want you to name any company  holy shit can this general take a fucking joke apparently not dumb old hags
someone mentions something about at bl company  another non accused them of being s filthy eop  shitflinging startes  someone else mentions how eops are garabage  a criclejerk commences on how eops are the worst and rapists    sure but its the eops who are running these threads but this thread wouldnt survive if it didnt have the same people going muh eops so thanks i guess
spend 2 days talking about evns and bl without anything happening  someone says something about eops  waaaaaaaah you are being mean
so did anybody play anything /blog/ related recently   dont force me to talk about shitty freem stuff i havent even touched any boy mobage lately
  is just 4u the best group though one of the guys looks like tsukasas twin brother    
  i like laverittas swishy costumes
  been playing confidential money its amusing how most of the guys have a big age difference with the mc but its mostly played for laughs rather than drama
  i replayed omerta recently kiryuu is still best boy
still the best kouhai
 get both code realize games for black friday with extra game because of preowned special   cases smashed up at the side and pieces spread out due to shipping  fucking hell
  im more of a laveritta person myself but id put just 4u up there and yeah he looks like kasas less approachable twin the chihiro guy from rayglanz reminds me of koga too
  its that shitty preowned gamestop crap anyway no pretty pictures  the last time i bought something from them the disk had a big ol scratch on it and it was to late to return when i noticed never again
    as silly as it was i7 anime was pretty comfy
  i finished all the routes in second reproduction to find out the real dealio with mcs crazy mum nearly got knocked out from the boring introduction/syuns route in rebirthday song and then finished all the routes in beyond eden to satisfy my revenge themed hankering beyond eden really hits the spot
  i tried rebirthday song but i noticed really quickly i only was interested in the unbirthday song guys and the writing was fucking boring
  unbirthday song  was the writing there better than rebirthday song since it seems to have a smaller cast or was it boring as well
  bproject s2 animation studio is changed to bn pictures not a1 pictures i wonder if it will be a good thing considering a1 pictures have too much other projects at the moment
  the anime was surprisingly good and fun to watch looking forward to the next season
  they keep getting a bunch of literal whos to voice swords it sucks considering they have tons of money  i guess they decided to make it a 3dfocused thing instead with all the recent musicals and stage shit
  after i dropped rebirthday i didnt want to try unbirthday i played the first blackish house instead that was bretty good   i think i remember somebody saying the unbirthday mc is worse than the re one
  its nice to see fresh talent though but i suppose its subpar fresh talent or actors in general based on the way youre talking about it
  unbirthday mc is worse  odd i thought theyd step up their writing with the sequel the only thing that was interesting in my last re birthday song playthrough was that tsundere side character hiiro i thought he was better than syun i guess ill check out blackish house later thank you for the info
the furries and scalies are more popular than the humanoid guys    女性向け is going places
wish more bl games got translated
wait actually does anyone know where i can download code realize eng ive never played an otome before and it seems pretty interesting being steampunk themed and all
tfw you finish a route but you liked the guy so much that you dont feel like moving on to another route    there was less spiral of suffering in this route so it could be more romantic and hes so op that it was basically the two of you curbstomping everyone together genji literally not even trying i think i might still have the best boys route left but i guess ill take a break and go back to haruka 1
  nice
so heavens radio started     waiting for game
rip マジカルデイズ
  was uta prince always this gay i thought it was a full on otome
  its on vita and ps4
  you could say it shifted its pandering over the years iirc shining live removed haruka and being able to date the boys
maybe this will last more than a year
  surprising that it lasted 3 years started off great then they drove players away by trying to increase the grinding so that rolling gacha was the only way to make progress in events while committing character assassination in event stories waste of top tier boys
and then the most ridiculous not an actual sex scene followed amazing what you can get away with with cero15
how was the fandisk
android otomege character descriptions are so fucking shallow and bad its hilarious
  why wait for a translation when you can learn japanese and read them before they get translated
  the red in this photo reminds me of kanade and im still mad about drefes ending
will tohlovekh ever be playable to those who dont speak nip i need to fuel my sad sad imagination with the boys bros
  leaning jpn takes a while when youre lazy  im still on hiragana       can you romance the girl
  i hope so
dlc routes included with preorders will also be available for purchase  in 2020    what
  gotta make it worth it to buy the expensive box        its a duel protagonist situation
game talks about how idols cant get into dating scandals because the fangirls they tricked into falling in love with them will feel betrayed  game that nets players by tricking them into falling in love with the idol boys    really gets the neurons buzzing
honestly i would have been in a better christmas mood if cr second fandisk came out right before christmas
  im surprised the current fanbase didnt kick up a fuss wy dont they just make new games instead of removing the mcs
cute concept but designs kinda eh  
  天月  wait like the utaite    i like the art style
well fuck it is december
have a very merry christmas /jp/

  youre right four okina threads shouldnt be allowed  okina merit at least 10 thread

junko with doors
20315028  shitposting like this doesnt even deserve a you  stay mad though   junko is a one off character that will never be relevant again while okina is a sage that will always be a main character of the series from now on

why are new dmm games so bad either straight boring auto battle shit or they die like 3 months in
im really down with what that other anon said about gameplay aigis has actually enjoyable gameplay and id like to enjoy it for more than 510 mins every day popping in to do some autosorties is fine but it leaves me feeling empty  fuck the likes of grind kamihime has though
    players have a short attention span and doesnt want to put in any effort    take meikyuu kenbu for example its an actual rpg not some watered down auto battler shit with some pretty indepth gameplay and look how no ones talking and playing it
god why are load times in unitia so massive  i really like the ost though they should just sell it

    personally i really like gemini seed and have been playing it since it started the starting events are very earlyfkg with it currently alternating between mat gathering and medal/staracquiring
  i dont like how the game has insanely high stamina cost for material grinding maps the highest level ones require half of your stamina bar for one run and the game has awful stamina regen rate
  i think the main problem is that it takes forever to increase your level after 25 most people on my friend list are still only 3035 myself at 33 i suppose those 40 stamina wont matter as much once you hit lvl 50 or more
what the fuck is this  ive been able to get the spotlight srs in like a single 10 roll for the past couple months and now that i actually want them i get this instead  what is this desire sensor bullshit
so as someone building an imperial team is using two tanyas a good idea since soldiers are kind of costy  also who should i get for my black ticket at rank 25
  it should be fine just be aware that merchants will have a somewhat harder time stopping really early zerging with their slower attack speed the tokens will help with that but they only have 1 block until aw for the ticket most would probably say rinne especially since you only have 1 healer shown
  building an imperial team  wheres marika then
  is azurite worth using i always roll for the omake and somehow i got four copies of her
who are the essential imperial buffers
  rinne is kinda bad until she aw and i wont be reaching that in a while i was thinking of getting the imperial healer instead    no such luck mainly focused on getting my cute kitsune
  very much especially if you also have angelite with both azurite and angelite watch as enemy level 40 alexandrites struggle to do more than 5 damage to most of your units and not even including attack debuffs azurite also immediately kills trance units and her skill 1 wears down shields fast
  a bit of an exaggeration but yes alexs damage is still reduced down to double digits
fuck i forgot to build mission parties in advance and the earliest my defender himes go off cooldown is in 2 days so i guess ill have to skip this  that said with this itll be my first time going into floors 11 what should i expect
the gacha industry should die
  how can you even consider that theres got to be some other way
im glad looks like the semen demon mashin is actually coming to aigis    i guess the mc is the freebie and the other four are gacha chars
  goddamnit so its a free male and 4 gacha females  lame
    new here do you get to fuck collab characters
  considering this is an eushully game theyll probably be in the r18 version   so most likely yes  not the guy though
why did they start putting collab characters in the gacha i remember the rance collab didnt have any sill was just free
  rance was an exception all the other collab has their own gacha
  shiropro
  we got tenma they got moritan
  tenma is just an artist collab though and does not exist in the original collab it hardly counts    if artist collabs count then rakshasa would be included as the games kept hyping about the sensei back when she was first released
  building an imperial team  so youre building a team from units that are exclusive to a gacha that comes around maybe twice a year and is mostly bad/mediocre units      i wont be reaching that in a while i was thinking of getting the imperial healer   unless you luck out before next maint its going to be even longer before you get the imperial healer not to mention theyre not really comparable in their usage
  not the guy though  dropped
    that goddess kiss collab with rance had a fascinating idea they gave out rance as a unit but when you get full affection with him you get him presumably raping one of the bad guys minion pretty interesting way to implement a guy and still have a scene
dear diary today rate up was not a lie
now that auto dialogue works properly on fkg mobile i can finally record these      
  this cutie any good
  with prince katina and lumian she pumps out 28k damage per volley if five targets are within 450 range a dancer would work quite well with that combo aswell since both horse girls fire so many arrows it adds up fast
  i need to start saving for katina then
  saying 28k damages is misleading
    normal skill is garbo fully ramped saw makes her the best physical dps in the game
  this is wrong    youre dumb
  if my math is correct she can do 55k per arrow for 24s on fully ramped saw with prince katina and lumian in team and skill active definitly better for single target but im not sure the normal skill is so bad if you get rushed by a dozen war elephants
  dude is log in bonus bottom right is event clear reward bottom left is gacha plat and the other two are gacha blacks    my friend works at eushully
  bottom right is the only dfc from what vndb shows so thats good for me
    she would be better if they lower her skill multi but make it doesnt need ramp damage dealer with ramp skill suck
  did it have my glorious days playing
  ramp skills with infinite top stage make me hard
  man i got two blacks on this spotlight and none of them were risley i wanted but i guess it would feel even worse if i got her the other spotlighted black
  i hope they take it easy this time and dont do either of introducing a mega limited gamebreaking collab character or 6 different collab exclusive classes that eventually just end up forever behind powercreep because no 2/aw ever
  whats the nip words saying
  free login unit ranged black that heals all units in range and has a dodge chance for herself    new class type like every recent collab
  based the one that i wanted is free probably means shell be shit but oh well
doesnt look like theres a collab gacha or maybe theyll announce it on wed
  well know when they announce contents of pug if there is one
  shes has a healer type class and not a retarded hybrid one at that shes also black unit so shes probably not too bad
  shes not actually the girl from  but a doll she uses or someshit from what i gathered from the website i havent played the game so maybe she can only fight through the doll and this is basically as close as we get to having her and we fuck her in the hscenes rather than the doll would have thought shed at least be in the art if she wasnt going to be her own unit though      therell be one gacha news is always on wed even for collabs
  she might be the exp fodder then    
  she turns into the doll
  collab mc fucks her  while prince fucks her doll  what degree of shitstorm could this cause
  didnt prince fuck the koihime collab girls
look at himeuta for fkg patch notes  the last one was from november 12    did the guy doing these disappear or some shit
  no their mc showed up with them but had passed out when he wakes up all of them taking their turn with him
  the answer is in that november 12th post
  oh rip where am i going to get my updates then i wanted to know what was new this week and last one
  google translate the news section if youre really desperate i guess   anything major would probably get mentioned in these threads
  you know they will
  shes ill and can use her original body only when blue moon there are two moons in dir lifna other one is red is full all other time her soul resides in that doll she recruits protag to fix this issue    doll is tiny about size of typical aegis fairy so i bet shes like happy/joy exp fodder with no scenes
  they already literally said she was a new class that heals  
  that akabana suiren  looks majestic
  bout time akabane suiren got her bloom
  maintenance got extended indefinitely new rgs are flamingo plant ginkgo and sourwood
  maintenance got extended indefinitely  apolostones
deito time
  time to replay ones i already did on the pc for the better look and sound
  literally as soon as i started recording them on my phone    oh well recording on phone is easier though uploading is a bit more of a pain

21th raid battle  twentyoneth raid battle  jesus christ
  you lost your right to complain by playing nutaku shit
  shiva ssr  meant aw my bad
  rebalancing  susanoo aw  didnt they buff her before or that was someone else
anyone else think shengpu is kinda overrated   her clones die way to fast with the hp drain to the point where its not really practical to get her at full power and her skill doesnt really do anything special apart from clear the map of trash which other units can do not to mention shes magic damage which still tickles a lot of important enemies unless you have certain units for mr reduction i dont really consider her ability to solo easy maps a pro either which other units can also do     so with all things considered i really dont see why everyone rates her so highly when the only truly great thing about her is shes one of the hottest waifus in the game besides that shes an average s tier unit at best on a scale where ss is the highest and still doesnt stand out enough in s to be ss on a scale with sss
  lol
  chinese hermit of balanced  overrated  thats a good joke their anon
    dont reply to me if you cant form a coherent sentence
  post the tier list
  she cant clear entire game alone guys i guess shes overrated  i hope someday youll forgive her
  dont even post if you cant substantiate your preposterous claims with multiple low unit count level 15 majins then
is the free premium draw a daily thing now in aegis or is it just a temporary thing
  its for beginners is not time based but once you use up your 10 rolls it doesnt come back again     like revival scs aigis is kind of cruel to oldtime players
are any of these plats worth raising besides lychnos
  bashira totono chloe and lieselotte if you dont have another good soldier besides katie and even then only if youve costreduced her a good bit or all the way in that order lychnos probably should come after the first two
  did you buy that anna
  yeah people use her for 18000 exp right
is this tower quest just a test to see how many water kamihime you have
  dont waste rainbow crystals like that dude
  its a test to see why are you still playing on nutaku
  you know you can just  buy white emperors with a nonpremium currency and get 20k exp by using it as fodder at lv30

  if this really is the end i want you to know i have always loved you as a friend
  thanks you its been an honor    whatafuck man
  oh i dont make the threads unless op is late but i think he might have been using a blank character that i provided a month or two ago
even when the thread is late remi must die
flan loves her big sis
flan is superior to the remi
i want flan to smash a glass jar fill with grape jelly at my fresh loaf of bread
  please dont bring /v/ cancer to sacred flanfly threads
ive always wondered what happens to flanfly threads after i fall asleep
cookie
  flan has a cookie
post the remirya one
  op screwed up immensely so now the thread is hosed
its 200am
i made a festive wallpaper for tewi because tis the season and shes cute    but thats not all

awesome
ok thats all for today
  thats an erotic flan

thank you wallpaper anon
id pay money for this girl to break my fucking spine
this is a meiling appreciation thread
  literally
  yes literally cant think of a better way to go
that sounds painful and will probably leave you like a vegetal
  do you want her to just snap it or to go full toblerone time
  great balls of china
  uh oh has there been a change in management
  it would be extremely painful
  shes a big girl
id pay money to break her fucking spine
  i love  this  artist
  try carrying her sleeping ass to bed
  for you
  virgin hong vs chadpanese goburin
i love this chink
  what if she broke your face with her butt
  id rather sleep on her ass
    poor meiling how will seiga abuse her
  whenever meiling goes for a kick like this her opponents eyes fill with intense lust a powerful distraction but it feels really gross
  id rather her sleep with me
sleepy guard
winter soon
  does she do it for cheap
  maybe shes not a glorified janitor like sakuslut so you likely wont get her to do it for free
  maybe she enjoys it
shes so gentle and motherly wonder what kind of men she likes
  jesus christ those legs  generaition
  strong men that can rival her strength anybody that can beat her in a fight is fucked right on the spot if you then get her pregnant shell marry you
the reason why they have a gatekeeper this beautiful is to lure weak humans to be used as freshly prepared meat
  well its working
  i imagine she would be a pretty pleasant face to encounter for any outsider that ends up at the scarlet devil mansion perfect for luring people into the mansion where sakuya can invite them over for dinner
  there a reason why the place is called scarlet devil mansion
  what if they already had their own food
she have turn against her master
  her and what army
  then they could still stay for a cup of tea with the mistress im sure would love to meet a person of your extraordinary taste
  i want to be the 10th person in line while running a train on her
  thats gonna break the train
  she can handle it
she is perfect
giving meiling a sensual foot massage after a long day of gate guarding
  i cant decide whats better her shapely big breast her firm tummy her plump ass or her soft thighs
  thats what makes meiling so great every part of her is perfect yet somehow when put together it still manages to be more than the sum of its parts
  does she eat humans
dont need spines when youre an invertebrate  an invertebratemade of pizza
红美铃是我的美妹
  she says in eosd that theres a rumour going round that shrine maidens are the kind of people its okay to eat so probably
  do you know this sentence makes no sense anon  its fine though i think meiling will teach you how to speak chinese
  teach me meiling what did i get wrong
  dropped
  hope she suffocates you with her smelly feet
do you think shes gonna be replaced by automation
  thats human meat isnt it
  why is the ling so massive in this pic shes like twice sakuyas size
  i think she was just trying to be intimidating going by her behavior in the fighting games and her description in pmiss she doesnt seem like the kind of youkai that eats people       nah shes mentioned as being unusually human like for a youkai i imagine she would have a problem with eating people
  the maid uses her as a stress reliever so her position is safe so far
  the maid is a fucking cunt
i like her antlers
  define stress relieve
  it also says her food is provided by the mansion which makes her a non threat and we do know they serve human blood and meat
  source
  live for this
  she needs to fall into line
  even at that size she could still kick his ass
  its possible she gets human flesh from the mansion might as well since it would go to waste otherwise i doubt she would hunt humans though if she didnt work at the sdm
  oh cool she has company from one of her kind
dont let her gentle smile fool you she can easily kill you if she want
  i dislike this meiling
  i like this meiling
  fuck you
mmeiling
  slut
  giant meiling  summer by scichil
the crush my head between your thighs toho
you dont need a spine when youre a pizza snake
  tfw after this itll still be another year or so until the eventual grudge match against yuugi
  fair point
  they need to interact more  even though its most likely they wont understand each other either due to time difference or speaking the different myriad languages in china 
  interact more  they interacted
  in bed
  more detail please
chinas cute smelly feet
teasing china about how big her big fat butt is
  imagine chinas feet after a long day of training must be absolutely disgusting from marinating in sweat grease and bacteria when she removes her shoes at the end of the day she probably gets flustered at just how smelly and toxic her bare feet are her own body betraying all standards of decency by producing an unbelievably lewd and slimy biohazardous zone of filth within her own footwear shoes designed to look pretty and appealing now soiled and turned into unusable smelly ruined trash by her own festering feet its almost amazing how an odor so potent and foul can come from a girl so cute what a contrast    the contrast would be captivating on one side youve got her beautiful pale shapely happy feet theyre works of art and can arouse anyone with their perfection on the other hand youve got endless of amounts of potent stink to contend with imagine seeing the china dip her toes in the ocean and turning it into a bubbling stinky green mess with her odor and killing all the fish     meilings big pale smelly chinese feet
  nice
    all the grass around the china should be wilted from her smelly feet dont you think the tree also
  yeah for sure
  communist party of gensokyo
  that just makes her more sexy
  her feet smell will kill me

  if you like following them then why not i would say following the ll seiyuu has definitely helped me stay happier overall
  him or not doesnt matter i stand with orctaku    the silent majority stands with orctaku they always have they always will
  it has definitely made me happier when all the women in your life are a bunch of thots and worthless sluts having people that pure and that make you smile is worth it i was really happy when tokimeki runners was released

  shukas hairstyle was illegally cute

i lost my dog the other day and ny grandma died im ttying so hard to make a living but not even my girlfriend is helping me i regret studying the carreer i picked its not giving me much money
  can we lose the purityfaggotry it does make sense they dont date in face of the fans but i wouldnt like them any less if it turned out they used to have/still have boyfriends that even makes them seem less out of reach if you will
dont worry boys once aqours is done i know exactly who i should ask out on a date
  the purityfags and orctakus are responsible for everyone wrong with these threads they are at fault remove them and threads will be good again    dont stop reload
  if its not someone from fkt you have no idea what youre doing with your life
  how can anyone get hard with this girl she looks just like a little kid
slutfags literally ruined the whole world  bbut remember that one time when purity bros were mean to hirano they are the worst we must destroy them  epic
  they go on the attack not just against hirano but many others as well it is time to say no to put the foot down to stand on our feet like the greeks who fought at thermopylae freedom or death    kill the orctakus
  the only thing that needs to be put down is your little delusion about female equality
  the thing that needs to be put down is all the orctakus and purityfags out there they are animals they will be slaughtered like animals    great hero goblin slayer shows us how its done how we save the world and indeed civilisation
  i always knew you had shit taste
    official group name and subunits voting soon
  it was never about shit tastes it was about doing the right thing it was about making sure that girls like ayana taketatsu would never again have to suffer tribulations alone    being the lone voice of dissent  a silent guardian  the candle that burns brighter in the night  a crusader king

who was there when oonishi aguri emotions drove her to teary eyes
  post the video link
  
    i mean the youtube link i want to see the entirety of it but i lost it
  
have to confirm that nijigasaki will continue effect because people started to get sad        i seriously wait they announce an anime aqours anime was announced while moose was still a thing so theres no problem with that
them sad puppy eyes  cant say no to dem sad puppy eyes
  will continue activities  i need some sleep
insert warm nightly oyasumi gugu tweet
  oh so people do care about them noice
  literally all of the answers to the cancelation of the 4komas and the video cancellations were some form of this is sad are they getting an anime or more activities or  a hopeful i will follow them on whatever activities they have on the future the hopeful answers were mostly used because aguri and later mayu and kaorin confirmed a new development to be announced in monday and the most liked answers to the tweets talk about them getting an anime they have already won the heart of a part of the fanbase so they went through the first major hurdle their cd sold solid numbers for unknown artists vaguely related to an anime franchise so thats a second major hurdle already gone now comes the next trial by fire and thats the live concert in march if the live in march is successful i could be 100 we get an anime
gugu  save this worlds haato  with feminine pinkku power    ippo ippo
  their cd sold solid numbers for unknown artists  ttheyre riding on the success of their predecessors
  that effect is certainly there too anything with ll sells or gets money just look at the 50m crowdfunding for fucking manhole covers
  well thats what happens with stablished franchises the thing with stablished franchises is being able to dig yourself into the stablished fanbase and not provoke autistic screeching     kimi no kokoro did relatively well thanks to moose effect 2015 was a huge year while this year has been relatively slow but the choice to attach the single release to allstars and the muse cameos also probably had some effect
kingkyancenter2019
for love and joy
  of wonder what happens if its a legit tie
  why did you betray aguri kaorichan
    was thinking about the same the other day best way to sort that would be a kinkyan duet and that would be glorious
  it would fix the next center voting as well if one of them wins this center the other is going to win the next one which makes things predictable and boring
i ask  i wonder  wht the fuck does it have to be about those two  knk this aika the other  but why always those fucking two  have you forgotten what it means to kagayaki  there are 9 girls and soontobe 4 singles  yet its always about those fucking two    ugly aura desu
i love feet     fuck you guys for turning me on to feet fuck you

    thanks for the informative answers fellow pikarin fans
does pikarin actually have a lot of female fans she claims that to be the case    what idols have a large amount of female fans apparently babyraids did and maneki seems to have a decent amount despite their pinchike image hp seems to have a lot female fans in general and keyaki seems to have more female fan than akb or nogizka ever did bish has a lot too ano definitely has a lot of female fans but do they actually care about yurumerumo/go to their lives
  wheres the rip tier   pouring one out for nazi ayuni anon

  no  whos that
  not as many as you your record is safe
  2018 was rough  2019 will be the year of perorin
  they cant have choreography anymore because nemu has fibromyalgia    also this song has very few individual lines in general
  nemu has fibromyalgia  when did she say that  also this song has very few individual lines in general  she gets to sing less than the other dempas and not only in this song

new thread      
has anyone tried daos new controller    its not made of paper mâché so it might actually be able hold together for more than a month or two
sdvx is a furry game
  its not made of paper mâché so it might actually be able hold together for more than a month or two  people use dao for years wtf are you talking about
  are you back from the dead angryanon  hows the solid steel popn project going
  i thought that was popn music
  sdvx is furry and weeb
  popn is a dead game now instead of a furry one
    im hoping yuans controller is a winner    11th trys the charm
  arcana would agree
reminder that here at plife we are trans and pocfriendly and no racism misogyny or transphobia of any sort will be tolerated at any time
  can you repeat that in english
  
  whats the p stand for programmed
  yeah
  join cgate
  is corin decent at any rhythm game
does plife even offer anything that arcana doesnt do they get data from the same place or from ooc why the split
  better webui better quality of life features like score statistics and scorecards more skilled playerbase actual popn support
  where do you get an invite does the doctor give you one when you pick up your hrt meds
  basically this
  idk if youre being serious but if you are assuming you know someone who is in there ask them to request an invite for you
  i dont know anyone because i dont talk to anyone outside these threads ill just stick to arcana for now then
  one of my friends is in it and told me that id been blacklisted despite not really having negative interactions with the community
  if youre blacklisted then youve probably done something or given people some sort of vibe
  i guess so i try to be nice but im sure at least one person dislikes me im not going to get confrontational about it though no point
  theres like only a handful of people who are /actually/ blacklisted and its for pretty good reasons    like xybur harassing a dozen people trying to get an invite
  yeah ive definitely not gone that far maybe blacklist is a strong term then
ainsun and psun go back to your little rivalry and stop pretending you stand a chance competing with programmed rice uk idiots go back to osu lmao
  wtf corin is actually based
  just because everyone uses it doesnt mean it isnt without its faults especially with the fp7      if youve ever used it imagine the rainbow controller enlarged to the size of an fp7 and better pcb
  there are plenty of things wrong with the fp7 but durability isnt one of those things
  id suck his cock
  how tf do you damage your fp7 without actively trying to destroy it lol
confess your biggest shames  ive never cleared a 12 that one song from sinobuz doesnt count  and i was close too clearing higher tier 11s with decent accuracy    its all in the past now
  キャトられ恋はモモク is one of my favorite charts
  the nuts arent locking nuts so they loosen easily causing screws to fall out without the person noticing and they get lost  also daos glue is notoriously shitty and ive known over 10 people in my circle which isnt very big who have had a side panel come off because of that
  i aaa failed mermaid girl a once
  i still find special summer campaign difficult despite beating b tier 12s
  i have 0 max scores even on sleepless days
  i play rhythm games
  i only listen to eurobeat and denpa
  absolutely patrician taste
  i cant beat the kaiden average on verflucht leggendaria
  i havent got a 19 aaa in sdvx    t 9209 volforce 11dan
  im stuck at 7s
  verfuck leg bpi is inflated as fuck because everyone grinds that song lol    tier ratings that youre citing are only for initial clear special summer campaign is really easy to mash as a first 12 clear but actually playing it accurately is different altogether
whats with the bga for kill each other the song is all dark and aggressive yet theres just a bunch of kiddies on the screen
  it straight up looks like weak fanart lol its not good
  subscribed
  ive been playing for 9 months and im a 5 dan
  you should probably kill yourself
  i unironically love spada and hope to god 死神自爆中二妹アイドルももかりん1歳 gets revived with a leggendaria chart someday
  i unironically love spada and hope to god 死神自爆中二妹アイドルももかりん1歳 gets revived with a leggendaria chart someday  what

  no shame in that spada is good though i do slightly wish all the charts werent like twice as fast as every other style
  dead or die
  i hate all the osu kids playing bemani because they say the most retarded shit from what they learned in osu and think theyre the shit
  im a safari refugee
anyone know if you can play on a server and save your scores/clears to an offline server at the same time
  i played ddr for 7 years on and off and only got three expert pfcs after the game of love higher and let the beat hit em
  spada was mediocre but momokarin is unironically redpilled
    are you me thats one of my favorite iidx songs of all time
      in my defense ive only played 23ish hours a week for that time still definitely havent been efficient
    no and the majority of the offline servers do not reliably save your scores so make sure you are constantly backing them up or writing them down if that sort of thing matters to you even if it seems like its saving them
  writing them down just take a pic of the screen lol
i dont like driving 10 minutes to go play a 15 year old game  but finding dance pads are impossible  tuskete
  10 minutes  i have to drive 50 minutes to my nearest ddr cab
  is it at least a new one
    you are weak and 573 mixes are dope  just stomp some arrows and stop caring lol
im doing all in one arcade stick just because fuck myself    just one question  will treating rotary encoder signal as button inputs and binding them as buttons in kms do a huge difference in how lasers feel  i dont feel like spending 10 on an arduino for a meme controller if i can just wire it to a chinese gamepad board i use
  it is but i honestly would love to have an extreme cab near me again   its been about a year since ive played anything other than a ive been longing for some solo 4th plus for a while
  should be fine in terms of gameplay but im curious as to how youre planning on connecting quadrature encoders to a chinese gamepad
  wakarimasen    im not good enough to reach 4th and im tired of playing the same songs over and over again once a weeks for years now the nearest a is 4 hours away i played it in japan when i went and i loved it i hope the db thats less than 5mins from my house gets it one day
  fat chance all anything db execs have said and their quarterly reports all point to that theyre exiting the rhythm games business as theyre wholly unprofitable
  lame
  i still cant clear the last striker dpa after three years but im fairly sure that has to do more with playing the game once every three months nowadays more shamefully i pretty much dropped iidx just to be bad at sdvx
  tasukete
    nailing the left handed roll immediately after the break is the key
why does gambol have 2 level 1s and why are they both the same
  gambol sph has different timing windows except for pgreat  if you want a fun experience fire up cs red and play gambol spa which is so fucked up you can only pgreat or bad
thats fucked  every chart should have the same timing windows imo
  thank you anon im glad at least someone will speak up for these unpopular opinions

much better alice likes it rough
  looks gay
merry christmas marisa
  exposing arisus loneliness
  alice is lonely and wants to die
      very rude
  me on the right
  this picture excludes afterward when alice downs both those chanpange glasses and then sadly masturbates herself to sleep
  alice should stop being so jealous
yes im lonely  wanna die
  theres someone out there for everyone shovelface dont worry
  marisachan should ditch that whore and date me instead i could make her way happier than that ugly unlikable skank ever could
noooo alice loves patchouli
a balanced mariali is so incredibly heartwarming to watch

mariari is my justice
a little bit of courage is the real magic

  where is yajusenpai

                        some good marisa x alice doujins
alice is the loser in this relationship
daily remember that alice slept in marisas house in imperishable night bad ending    
  and thats exactly why its a bad ending
  of course they have to solve the fake moon incident first
marisa only likes alice as a friend
  the idea of marisa friendzoning alice is pretty hot
do not bully
    every touhou except marisa loves alice  alice loves marisa  marisa likes boys
  factually wrong  every touhou including marisa fucking hates alice  alice loves marisa because she knows no boy is ever going to love her  marisa will never reciprocate and alice is going to die alone
  adds a extra layer of erotic depth to the images in this thread
marisa will protect her precious significant other from that horrible slander

this is sagume shes the worst 2hu i hate her so much i definitely dont want to hug her
  why is this lunar heron so pretty
  she needs no reason
i want to do lewd things to her
  whoah lunarians sure are impressive to look at
  are you the same guy who made the previous thread
    wow she looks so similar to her daughter
  no
is sagume a joestar
  and here i thought theres a dedicated sagumefag shame
  reversed no  yes
  i see
  i dont think thats how it works i dont think thats how any of this works
  it just works
oh no sagume
  sagume gets off to murdering people as expected of a lunarian
sagume has a fluffy wing
the heron loves the baku
gu
sagume boobie
sagumegane
the gu attempts to be a lunar rabbit
gu pixelart
  may your path be a fun one  what are you saying sagumenow shes cursed isnt she
the gu is happy that you love her fluffy wing
sagume with her daughter seija
  yep
  what is she doing there
  saved
  so cute
sagume is pure
gu
  disgusting
  cute    you meant impure
the heron loves sleeping with the baku
my wife sagume is very cute
best sage
dont talk to her until shes had her coffee
i want more loligume
cute
gu a cute
  yeah pure sex
soft pure yummy lunarian pussies
i want to hug her and fluff her wing
i love her so much
the gu is sleepy
  sweet dreams
sagumes fluffy wing
the gu can be very loud occasionally
fluffy wing
  burd lap pillow
  id die for a gu lap pillow
id die for the gu
such a qt
gu
a cute
  how is she a joestar
the gu is comfy
the baku wants to look like the gu
  why is the gu so lewd
  shes not doing it on purpose shes just unfamiliar with modern fashion and has few friends to talk about such a thing but dont tell sagu shes being lewd shed be very embarrassed to learn that since its not her intention at all
the gu is tired from overworking
sleeping together
  is she the amenosagume of legend
  shes based on that  check out hisonas let dreaming dogs lie and enchant the left manga
playing with the gus hair
  silky and nice smelling
    in the one myth amenosagume is featured in they got freaked out by a pheasant sent by amaterasu on the advice of omoikaneeirin and urged their superior amewakahiko to shoot it however since the arrow was given by the heavenly kami it instead turned back on amewakahiko killing him along with being the originator of all amanojaku it is easy to see how it inspired sagumes design and gimmick of the world turning against her words        apparently in japanese birds and rabbits share the same numeric counter suffixes and groups of rabbits are at times referred to as flocks instead of colonies evidently this linguistic feature has many origins appearing in one story about emperor tenmu it was said that he issued an imperial edict that forbade the consumption of meat and fish due to buddhist teachings however due to the wording of this ban it basically overlooked birds        some people who really liked their meat went through some impressive mental gymnastics and decided that since cormorants and herons are okay rabbits are also birds and good to eat as well the significance of this is when you say cormorant and heron together quickly it becomes a pun spelling out u  sagi        when put it into the context of lolk sagumes wing is most likely a herons wing sagume sagi ends up facing reisen usagi who is the messenger bird sent by omoikane/eirin resulting in sagumes attack getting turned against her
sagucci gang
heron
soft silky fluffy wing
  hisonas art style is very nice
  indeed
why dont you atone for your sins and prostrate yourself before the lunar gods anon
  i would sin a lot with the gu
cute couple
  lusting after alluring women isnt a sin but the way nature intended
  this
cute
i wrote a bunch of sagume porn last night
  whats the point of this post if you dont share it
  llewd
  anon no
  very creative anon
  
    he did flip my skirt before a bunch of younger rabbits to their  and my  endless embarrassment i disciplined him mere days after he sneaked up on me in an empty hallway  and cupped my breasts that time my blood high i laid a curse on him i whispered to fate he would not forget his lower wear when he woke next morning  and fate turned over he caught me alone once more and pulled my skirt  together with my underwear i caused him to stumble  and to do the same to an elder female rabbit later that evening he smacked my butt in a busy hallway i made him trip and spill water over a girl he was i thought trying to impress he walked in on me bathing i made the elder from before walk in on him getting overly familiar with the girl   sagume is too nice for her own good
shes the purest and cutest and has the fluffiest wing
  you thought that was the nice part
the gu makes my heart flutter
yorihime loves to fluff the gus wing
  as expected wonder why the world turned against her
  maybe she convinced houyi to shoot down those suns here
  maybe youre some kind of moron
dont be rude in my wifes thread
  any good reversed wheel of fortune arranges
doresagu
baku having a date with the gu
  cutest couple im jealous
gu a cute
i want sagume to give me that angry look of hers im not sure what i want her to do to me afterwards though
i want to mate with this heron
  curses you
seijas mommy is autistic
  no shes not
i want to rescue sagume from a terrible fate and thus improve her opinion of earthlings
  that was a very good doujin
  very much so yes if only there was a sequel of course that would mean seeing sagumes tragic dissolution as well so maybe its for the best that there isnt one
i wrote more sagume porn tonight
  sagumes cursed tongue doesnt work like that anon she cant just say a thing and the opposite will happen plus its a curse so trying to use it for her benefit will always backfire
  yeah i know but when i told my boner he just spat at me
pocky day with the gu
what is the gu reading
  well clearly what you need to do now is write a followup where things dont go as planned
  that particular story is done but do feel free to pick it up yourself if you please id love nothing more than more gu erotica
  im not taking your sloppy seconds
  im still not exactly sure what the heck sagume is in various places ive seen her labeled as being either an amanojaku or a god what is she
  a cute
  in terms of species she is an ascended divine spirit ie a god currently residing on the moon making her a lunar goddess in terms of function shes an amanojaku the amanojaku are in fact descended from ame no sagume and take their function after her sagume is technically the first amanojaku but the category is retroactive like a writer who invents a new nameless genre who is then retroactively named after his followers when a term does come up    so functionally an amanojaku but in terms of taxonomy a lunar goddess
  a rare god
wearing the bakus clothes
heron assaults baku
posing with the gu
  no note how it works
  touhou is too deep for me
  fucking buddhists
  rinne tensei
will the gu appear again in the games
whats the relationship between the gu and the baku
  she was in vd
  so its sagume is like some sort of proto punk
  in a roundabout way i suppose you could say that
the blowjob goddess
gu boobie
drinking shots of sagumes saliva
i want to get a taste of sagumes cursed tongue
do you think she will let me touch her wing if i ask her nicely
  i see your point anon but no you need too keep her mouth open so she can accidentally say things during lewd activities
on the other note was there any implication of what she was discussing with eirin when she was in eientei
  would you accept this corrupted heron
  anon dont say such mean things about her youve made her cry  of course i would accept her
they are so cute together
  during sex and at the height of pleasure sagume cries im gonna cum before her eyes go wide with horror i love it
  this image freaked me out because her leg looks 2d in like a paper mario type of way
  gay image
  cutest pairing
  cute image
          gosh i hate the way these fucking eyes are drawn
  why
  not him but they look like tumors
      sheyas art has a bad case of sameface otherwise its fine
  i thought she was poledancing when i saw the thumbnail
  hours of edging with sagume until shes a sweaty quivering mess
we need more sagume art
i want the gu to wrap her wing around me
  i want to wrap my wings around the gu
i love the gu so much
  i want the gu to slap me with her wing
did the gu hatch from an egg
what happened with the gu after the lunar invasion
  i want to hug her and pet her head while fluffing her wing

i want to marry her
  my wife sagume is beautiful
  she doesnt look very merry

  yeah me too 
these are so cute
another touhou doujin artist betray zun to follow fad shit _
i dont really care
  i will never blame an artist for following the free exposure/money
  artist decides too do something else every now and then / artist abandoned touhou and left it behind i dont know why this is such a novel concept too people youre allowed too enjoy more than one thing
i dont blame em
touhou fans are so obnoxious no why even draw more book for them
  i cant wait to see grimdark fate douijn
at least its not kancolle anymore these days
  at least the medjeds are kinda cute
you didnt believe me years ago but hear me out now /jp/ touhou is reclining
  zounose doesnt fucking owe you anything
all touhou artists should be moved to a remote island where theyre not allowed to even think about anything that isnt touhou and theyre forced to pump out waifu doujins every day forgetting any recollection of the outside world
  so basically they should be moved to gensokyo
  what are you saying not only did zounose explicitly say in his twitter and afterword of 境界ダンサーズ that he is releasing his mugamubiru 5 implying that he will release a new work as a bonus just like the past 4 issues did but he also has a bunch more touhou doujins planned    this guy is a full time artist not only does he write touhou doujins but he has published several digital art books worked as an illustrator on a few gacha games oshiro project and did promo art for some doujin novels releasing illustrations of some other thing that isnt touhou is not unheard of from him and doesnt mean that zounose will stop doing touhou doujins    op is just some unnecessary doomposting coming from a fake zounose fan
i really like zounose arts but his story scare me
  there need to be boobhu reeducation camps
  his stories are worth reading because zounose practices internal continuity did you know that the bonus manga of his compilation books are all based on the stories included in the compilation man im just excited for how moriyasama will play out in the bonus manga
    im annoyed hes placed sanae ascending to godhood somewhere late or outside the timeline or forgotten whichever
2hu is cringe cant blame him
  muh continuity doesnt save his stories from being edgy pieces of shit
  you do realize every doujin artist can do what they want right they dont have to stick to 2hu all the time
zounose shouldnt be writing touhou stories anyway
  try again this time without using vague buzzwords
literally hundreds of doujin circles who have done a lot of touhou doujin books do a book that is not touhou every year  anyone who acts like it makes them fad shit is probably fad shit themselves
    betray is such a fucking stupid word there    zounose isnt contract bound to write touhou
  we can all still enjoy his gag centred comics like frandog and momiji roll
  this is your brain on doomposting
  when he takes a second to stop cutting himself his works can have some really funny moments his arts great too i wonder why he feels like he has to make most of his stuff so dark
  it really shows touhou is reclining hard
  i get not liking what he does but i wouldnt really question why he does it
  dude its spelled to
whats the story behind this thread i cant figure it out by lurk moaring did i miss a 2hu trend
  1 zounose is a fairly popular touhou doujin artist that has a reputation for writing stories involving grotesque/shock themes  2 op shows zounose is making a doujinshi not about touhou  3 op suggests artists that dont always draw touhou or eventually stop drawing touhou are traitors to the fandom    this is perplexingly not an uncommon opinion to hold honestly im surprised so many people here are calling out op because historically /jp/ has been full of people that say stuff like this
  imagine being a 2hu and seeing someones comic of you getting fucked
  pic  wwhats going to happen to sumi
  oh i was trying to see the touhou connection to op pic too thanks man artists are supposed to have their freedom over what they draw maybe touhou got him where he is today but good for him for trying to make something more personal
      hes an incredibly talented artist and dare i say it a talented writer as well pretty much every single one of his works left an impact on me because i was just moved by the subject matters at hand and how he uses them to create a compelling narrative i think thats why his stories usually focus on dark themes to make an impact and to stand out     in general a story thats lighthearted doesnt leave as much of an impression as a heavy story stories that talk about how touhous deal with outliving regular human lifespans are a favorite of mine tsukumizus flan wants to die azmayas lost girl lost lady and zounoses higans camelia all talk about this read a doujin with that as a topic and youll find yourself thinking about it a long time after youve flipped the last page  zounose wants to make a mark on your mind so he makes his themes dark    also it seems like he doesnt make illustrations in the style of the pics you and i uploaded anymore
  i get what youre saying but desu the immortal outlives loved ones and gets bored of living forever storyisnt that kinda played out i remember cringing hard when the brownies brought that up with twilight sparkle i mean unless your an old man watching all your friends die as you live on who is that story even for
  read a doujin with that as a topic and youll find yourself thinking about it a long time after youve flipped the last page zounose wants to make a mark on your mind so he makes his themes dark  thats actually a really good point i hadnt thought about that like them or not it still gets people talking about him a lot more than other artists even this thread is an example of that    i miss his old illustrations too they had a lot more character to them
  foolish tengu raid too
  yep i agree i really enjoy zounose works too i just dont see reason to argue about taste regardless of if you like eem or not  im definitely more on the light hearted side and my favorite story on that topic is morino hons if i were to die today but the story does a good job leaving an ammount of uneasiness in you as the story  progresses  i should eventually reread some of his works too the only thing that came to memory when i thought of higans camelia was akyuus feelings about her relationships with komachi and how she despised the feeling of pity people felt towards her      shes going to be nibbled by the youkai ladies      hell yeah i need me some more good mom nemuno
  zounoses stories are rarely grimdark for the sake of it the only one that was lolgrimdark was cannican and even then there are people who think its a perfectly viable story that could have happened in gensokyo    instead he often explores the results of alien sense of morality and bizarre social structure but not without love or friendship look at vintage or kaminare there is often true friendship between humans and youkai/gods real fondness but marred by an absolutely alien sense of propriety and morality because curse gods and ultimate predators ultimately dont think like humans no matter how prettily they coat themselves    if you have a predator youkailike morality vintage is a very sweet friendship story about a master acceding to the wishes of her servant even against the masters very wants that it involves cannibalism to make a point is but secondary    if you have a thousand years old cursegoddess mentality kaminare is a cute coming of age story about a human accepting her inheritance to rise amongst equals the little orphan being ritually eaten is certainly sad but no more than a cute doe being slaughtered for the butcher    zounoses stories are quite dark but never because he wanted people to be grossed out by cannibalism or whatnot instead he often has a point his marisa is remarkably enticing she is slowly becoming more alien in thoughts by virtue of starting to become a magician and sees no particular issues with going past human morality matteroffactly
  cannibal fetishism  is that what this is i guess im not all that surprised people will think anything is deep if its shown as artsy
  there are so many stories that pretty much everything has been played out already especially if its a theme as general as that one  as a regular human being you can relate to this with the fear of losing your loved ones especially those who are older than you you know youll outlive them and preparing for that moment or being unprepared for when you have to live without them is a familiar experience with every one  besides theres no need to be able to completely put yourself in their shoes to appreciate a good story in reading alisons the immortal who outlived the universe im pretty sure none of us were immortals who went yeah thats gonna suck when it happens to me in a billion years instead we sympathized with the loneliness and boredom those girls would have to endure for all eternity despite knowing it would never happen to us that panel where they found sakuyas grave really hit me hard because i knew how much she meant to their plan      yeah i just wanted to explain why zounose makes his stories dark and its not just for the sake of it  speaking of rereading if any of you have read happy birthday remilia and are confused about what the hell just happened thats because there is a series of glaring translation errors ill dump the images talking about it here theres this one guy that does the translations for most of zounoses stuff on voile and he messes up a lot id like to do it myself but im busy with schoolwork      i think you hit the nail on the head here too most of his stories are a believable take on humanyoukai relationships
  and there you have it i hope this puts the doujin into a new light in the ending i think what happened was sakuya turns back time and somehow steals remis ability to see her own future  even though im sure sakuya cant do either of those things ironically making remilia truly a master of her own fate since its not predetermined anymore
  i do remember feeling lost when reading happy birthday remilia went back to it and considered the translation you gave and it makes much more sense now  thanks anon
  i really love his marisa she lives exactly how i think an ordinary human girl living among youkai and gods would when we see her shes always preparing for something and the latest marisa manga was an especially nice peek into her busy life that one was sort of a tease on how he plans to handle the insinuations in aocf about marisas desire to overcome her humanity what with all that talk about leaping over barriers      glad i could help someone out i was gonna do the latest one but danbooru guys were faster and so far it seems like a good tl
  i agree that his stories explore the weird morality of youkai but at the same time it doesnt really do anything with that exploration none of his stories have any deeper meaning than youkai being youkai and as a result its hard to care about anything    like i walked away from kaminare thinking wow sanae kanako and suwako deserve to die horribly  i walked away from vintage thinking wow remilia deserves to die horribly and i walked away from his work as a whole thinking wow gensokyo and everybody in it deserves to die horribly i dont mind dark stories but when all you get out of it is shit sucks and its not going to get better then i dont think youre a very good writer
  i disagree zounose marisa is a unlikeable bitch that doesnt give a fuck about anybody else considering how she is actually a pretty decent hero in canon despite her many flaws its actually pretty disappointing to see her portrayed like that
    if you only look at kyoukai dancers and kodoku no mahou thats the image youll get but those are both mangas where marisa is forced into something she didnt want to have to do accordingly she threw her empathy away and got her hands dirty but i dont doubt that it affected her anyways considering how she wept at the end of kodoku no mahou    in her other appearances where she has a choice in the matter like the 1st and 4th bonus manga she was the hero or one of the heroes that saved the day even risking her life in the case of magaboshi i havent read the 2nd one but shes on the cover must have been another heroic moment  in babanbabanki she was roped into bankis problem but instead of making them handle it on their own she agreed to help  in her other manga curse of crimson marisa literally went to hell and back just to make reimu some ofuda   theres also rainfall where if marisa hadnt helped we wouldnt be seeing reimu and sanae in his doujins anymore    she definitely gives a fuck and has lots of heroic moments if seemingly reluctant
  who is that story even for  for me  you just dont like his works
  i mean i guess she has her moments but she doesnt seem to be particularly cornered with the wellbeing of anybody outside of her circle of friends all of which are also pretty awful horrible people at the very least she doesnt seem to have any problem with the mass murder going on in gensokyo which makes it pretty hard to view her as even a remotely good person just a bad person who still has some empathy and humanity left
  okashii zo  why does remi talk like a man doesnt she supposedly portray herself as a right proper little girl according to canon sources  they did this in one of the canon manga too but more with posture had her sitting spread legged and hunched over like a dude this has been a source of disconnect for me with most manga portrayals of her i dont think she uses masculine speech in the games iirc
  oi neesan yo yoru ni hitori de arukkunayo kiken ze
  thats a distressed internal monologue    when she talks to someone else she uses feminine language like she always does in canon    besides zun doesnt really seem like a good character writer case in point is suzunaan reimu the same person as ibarakasen reimu the only character i think he writes consistently is marisa since right from eosd zun was already teasing her desire to walk the boundary between human and youkai
  i mean isnt that gensokyo beneath the surface
  gensokyo beneath the surface is a bad place but its also one with plenty of good people and there is hope that things are going to get better     its a world half full while zounoses gensokyo is a world half empty
  but its also one with plenty of good people and there is hope that things are going to get better   i doubt that
  touhou is pretty boring everything has been said and done and the only new thing zun adds is just another overpowered ability to some character    x can destroy the planet   next week  y can destroy the solar system  next week  z can destroy the entire galaxy and she has already done it and the world theyre living in was created by her as a form of amusement
  gensokyo beneath the surface is a bad place but its also one with plenty of good people    which is why in rainfall we saw how the youkai helped each other and the humans during times of natural disasters as alluded to in forbidden scrollery the doujin cannican which is probably his darkest work depicts a concerted effort by the youkai to fill their bellies while exerting the least suffering on the human population they have to eat people but theyre being as good as they can about it    it doesnt even have to be a coordinated effort for the youkai to occasionally help out humans in kaze ni mo narezu aya goes out of her way to help out a disfigured girl because she believed that the girl would be shunned in human society    those are some depictions of good people and youkai in a bad place like gensokyo in zounoses works i think its wrong to look at his works and think that they are looking at the world as halfempty when     im left more hopeful than pessimistic after reading a zounose doujin    and there is hope that things are going to get better  the ending and general tone of fs pretty much says that the status quo in gensokyo is going to remain
      i agree thanks for posting this anon
    yeah rainfall shows that she still cares
    everyone in gensokyo does deserve to die horribly anon or are you okay with them actively or passively accepting that the scarlet sisters get to feed on humans that are round up for them its not a zounose what if story thats canon
  i mean the village drove her out when she tried to pursue her dream/passion
  rainfall was one of the more positive stories but it doesnt make up for the countless crimes literally every single character committed in his other works meanwhile most of his stories are about how much gensokyo sucks is going to keep on sucking and how much better the world would be if the entire place was turned into a fucking crater and every youkai human and god  in it was killed i mean even the human villagers are portrayed as very unsympathetic the only person that seems even remotely decent not simply horrible with the occasional nice moments is mokou and im 99 thats just because zounose doesnt feature her that much     fs was mostly about establishing what the status quo actually looks like obviously it wasnt going to end with kosuzu kicking of a human rebellion shes a literal nobody and doesnt give a fuck about other humans anyway meanwhile with the religious leaders growing more and more powerful the sages growing more active again  and outside forces becoming more and more interested in gensokyo i do think things are slowly but certainly moving towards some kind of endgame one that is almost certainly going to end with the sages all dead and gensokyo moving towards a new brighter tomorrow well unless zun is just some kind of weird neo nazi or wants touhou to go full grimdark
  i dont think thats fair the only reason anybody has to die is because of people like yukari and the only reason why most of the cast accepts her bullshit is because she would murder them if they did not i cant blame somebody like sanae keine mokou marisa or the human village for just trying to carve out a living inspite of living in a land run by a mass murdering monster
  didnt they drive her out because both marisa and the villagers thought she murdered her mother
  when we see her come to the village again in kyoukai dancers the villagers presumed that she came there for revenge which means they may have known about her alleged connection to her mothers death  the conversation between patche and alice makes it really clear that her halfbaked curse didnt lead to her mothers death only that it affected marisas psyche    whether or not it was marisa that was driven out or that she drove herself out is an open question
  wheres the betrayal    grimdark fate is just fate
  yes anyone who likes boobhu needs to be reeducated
  youkai like remilia and flan feed on people because of yukari
    without sages to maintain gensokyo it would stop existing    there will be no endgame because zun will never move the status quo forward
  youkai like remilia and flandre can feed on people without killing them although that is pretty difficult in the case of flandre but yukari still chooses to hand them living humans instead of just raiding a blood bank      gensokyo would do just fine without the sages at least if people take over their former position also zun is not that averse to changing the status quo while it might still be far far away i do think he does have some kind of eventually end point for touhou
  its more of there will be no endgame because zun clearly has none in mind and probably has never thought about it especially when you read his interviews its very clear that hes still just making it up as he goes plus it would be fundamentally bad idea for touhou too have an end as that would greatly impact the future of fanworks the whole point of zun going wider rather than deeper with the lore is so certain aspects of it can be explored in fanworks instead zounose is a great example of someone who does this      i truly doubt he has an ending in mind or even ever considered it the man plans too just keeping working touhou until he dies and has made it clear he still just coming up with things has he goes the idea of an ending doesnt really fit touhou its more about its characters and world and the smaller stories that take place in it we will inevitably see endings too some works like fs but if zun ever wraps anything up it will be the smaller stories that touhou is based around and not some big climatic all encompassing ending
  i agree that his main plan is to just keep working on touhou but i dont doubt that he intends to end it whenever hes going to retire/becomes too old to continue making more until that point things are going to keep widening but thats only to make the eventual ending all the more spectacular
  fate  fad
  who are you quoting
  if zun were to end touhou i doubt hed do so by killing the sages or drastically changing the entire structure of gensokyo probably something on a smaller scale like reimu getting a new successor

  they are for sure but i wouldnt want to leave her tits and ass hanging
  no thanks
sanae happy in a barrel what could possibly go wrong
  she get get stuck
  evil artist begone  and that set sucked anyway
  honehone is a very bad man sanae must not go near him
  i agree with half of that statement
i think its very cute that sanae is descendant of suwacko imagine her walking after a loli saying yes suwacko sama and suwacko is like i demand candy offering
  didnt she not know about their relation until recently
this is the first thing i always see when i open up /jp/ and im scared if this is just a coincidence or if this is a sign
  akuryo taisan
  isnt this a good thing
  sanae is not an evil spirit and does not require an exorcism dont be strange
  i still want too see the translation anon
    alright ill try excuse me leaving out most gagging and panting sounds and my lackluster japanese to begin with    quickly i have to escape at once  againnn aaa haaaa  haa haa i cant endure this for long  i cant slip out of the suit if i move even slightly it will make the belts tighten  what can i do if i dont get out quickly itll be morning soon  somebody someone please help me    in the previous slide its mentioned that shes locked with vibrators inside the suit
  good good thank you could you do the whole thing
    tomorrow sure
  ill be waiting moonspeaker
why did sanaes parents abandon/forget her
  what makes you say they did
  to enter gensokyo you need to be declining/forgotten/abandon so sanae must have been abandoned
  her divine side and reputation as a miracle worker was being forgotten but sanae herself was fine was having a normal life theres no indication that her parents ditched her i dont think theyre ever mentioned in fact
  brings that one british book/miniseries to mind enter the underworld and you may as well be erased from the real world
  slut
sanae is cute
    may sanae bless your day and damn the slutposter with baldness and impotence
  sanae already has sex with bald impotent men every day
  how can she have sex with impotent men how does that even work
  you ask her shes a professional slut after all
  theres no indication that her parents ditched her  what kind of parent allows their kid and a good one at that to go off into a mystical land with two moreorless strange folk the fact that her parents arent even mentioned at all is indicative of their total absence from her life
  which one you have me guessing good
  maybe she ditched them ever thing of that
sanaes mom is bad person

  the beginning of the story had some girl running away from some bad dudes this guy decided to help her when no one else was his life got screwed over by that after he went to the underworld it was like he had been erased from history and all his coworkers and friends had no idea who he was and he had never been a part of their lives the very beginning of the miniseries started in some sewer and it was a british work if you can recognize the title from all that please share
loving sanae  treating her well  doing nice things for and to her  being very kind and considerate of her  please do not view the spoiler image if you are very sensitive
i like adult mommy sanae
  i wish you could buy cute girls like that at the grocery store and take home
  sanae voluntarily breastfeeding orphans
      cant get enough of scenarios like this its like a peril scene except instead of a time bomb theyre racing against its the bad guy waking up and doing terrible things to them struggle harder sanae   thanks anon its appreciated       as someone who works at a grocery store please no

  imma hag
  imposter  no way in hell would i go out with a slut id stay the hell away from her marisa says it best i value my health    even though i am a neet
the miko outfit is her worst outfit
    agreed i prefer her bound and gagged in a bodysuit
  you take that back      both of you
  bbut her hecatia shirt is much better  
  sanaes miko uniform is a divine regalia she bases her entire look around it sanae is beautiful and therefor her miko clothes are beautiful and visa versa how could a tacky hot topic tshirt ever compare
sports wear sanae
  hot topic tshirt suits sanae more  miko outfit is just shameless armpits show off
    sanae is your simple purehearted nextdoor girl its only natural that casual clothes fits her better        best outfit i do agree
  last time i played ut99 was when i used to do it at my cousins place years ago thats some fond memories
please be quiet sanae is sleeping
  you find sanae taking a nap  her defenseless figure makes you think     a maybe ill take a nap beside her too  b i should go find a blanket or something for her  c quietly observe her to confirm her cuteness  d look inside her hakama  e tease her
  i chose f put a blanket for she and leave some gifts
  stop shitposting in her threads and go back to hell
  i already have a moriya shrine charm in my bag but thank you
  kiss her nipples
  i want to put her on the side and roll her around
  anon no shell throw up and die
  throw up for sure  die i dont see why she would its just a harmless prank
  well shell feel like shes gonna die so dont

cotiza salae
evangelion is a pretty cool gal she fights teh aliens an doesnt afraid of anything
    does this make reimu asuka
sanae please go to sleep it past your bedtime
  is reimu an onahole if so indeed she is
  creampie and mating pressor cuddle
    rei is the onahole though
  all of the above
  yes
  /ck/
  the fastest way to a womans heart is through her stomach anon learn to cook
  disgusting
  no thats asuka
  how
between two worlds she lives
is sanae gay
  bicurious at the minimum
  thought this bitch was elena shimabara at first
  no she loves shotas
  get out of /jp/
    very festive
    no asuka is the girl with intense mommy issues
  may this charm fill your day with delight luck and miracles  thank you very much but i dont need to fill my day with anything  i just need to fill your ass
  no thats shinji asuka has i am a walking talking mocking flocking onahole issues though yes she does have those because muh puppets and muh mother committed suicide in the next room when i was a little girl and dont forget muh daddy issues
oh shit habbening ddd  
  not even any mind control the worst
  sanae is so cute i want to have sex with her too
  take off the shirt first
  her parents can be dead for all we know
  she doesnt miss them for sure and whos surprised
who would be the next generation of wind maiden after sanae
sanae has three threads
  sanae has one quality thread for her true fans
    this artist is such fucking trash
  please refrain from bullying osashin
  ok
fun fact if her td ending is anything to go by sanae cooks for the shrine    a perfect wife that one
  sanae uses the semen of the many men that fuck her in her cooking
  thats just foul there have got to be better ways to dispose of that stuff even if theres a lot of it
  i would marry her
  your wife is my prostitute dude
  god sanae looks so lovely in pantyhose the things i would do with her
  every girl looks good in pantyhose
  what kind of things
    i hope she made lotsa spaghetti
  thats lewd anon
  you know what is does a maiden need to put inside the charm for it to work right
  you wanna try that question again
  its nice that meido seems to always let this image slide
  horrible things  cough she wont be able to shit for a week cough
  i dont think the horrible things youre thinking of work like that
  yep sanae is a good girl
   snow angels
  the most unexpected answer ever
  who are you quoting
  fuck well wouldnt be a very healthy side effect anyway  cough shell be crying for hours cough  sanae is so loveable and so sexy shes a very pretty miko
  why the fuck has this meeting never happened
  a person in the danbooru comments said probably because itd draw attention to how no one seems to really age in gensokyo dont know about that but thats the word around that particular water cooler
  
  that new danmaku fireworks book has both sanae and sumireko as judges though    given how often both of them show up they had to be introduced to each other at one point before that zun has the perfect opportunity to show just that in new cola but it didnt happen even in the recent chapter    im almost inclined to believe zun is a bad writer were it not for cilr id believe that hes physically incapable to move the story away from reimu no matter how important the alternative would be
would be so great to explore her past theres a  lot of background here
  or maybe he just doesnt give a damn and he left that hole to be filled with doujin artists i mean what would their meeting be about  oh hey youre from the outside world what changed  we have touchscreens and better cameras in phones now  really cool  sounds really interesting mate
  my first 4channel post and it will be a good one  sanae is a cute lady and definitively not a slut
  this is like a kid asking what an encyclopedia is
would sanae take my virginity
  no
  there is no way that nerd like sumi wouldnt know what famicom is
  secret sealing club is for necromancers not gamers anon
  you can take hers
interesting
  you cant
  why having sex is normal at her age
  this anon isnt going to take no for an answer sanae time to get your cherry popped
i would marry sanae
  id be content with merely worshipping her just to put a smile on that face
    sanae wants to give her virginity to someone she loves shes a romantic girl like that
  but im her lover
  slut
  oh really
  yeah
  sanaes animal friends
  relaxing time
i want too see sanae wearing pantyhose and high heels
  all it takes is a booru search friendo
adorbs
  beautiful but i prefer black pantyhose
  black doesnt suit sanae
i love sanae
good day /jp/
  goo day to you as well sanae
sanae probably does lurk these threads since we all assumption basically worship her i wonder if she schliks to the dirty sexual fantasies that are posted on jaybee that involve her  sanae is rabu sanae is laifu  kaguya probably lurks too
i wish wily toad was depicted more often in fanart    its pretty much her signature spell at this point not to mention awesome enough for her to be respected
thanks sanae
  why is wahh sanny so cute
  she is grass type
did you know that both snake and some large frog eat rat i wonder if sanae ever eating rat
  that explains a lot of things
  like the green hair
  its hard to call it her signature spell when its just her channeling suwako its not really hers you know
  and why not being kanakos avatar is how she accumulated her own faith and power in the first place    sanae doesnt visibly summon suwako for the spell and even if she did sanae can easily summon suwako even against suwako herself and she can use wily toad away from earth for that matter so its not like shes somehow limited at all    hell suwako doesnt even have a similiar spell card
  im just saying it doesnt feel like a sanae original   id say the day the sea split is better more unique memorable and not tied to one of her patronsbut then thats mosess thing so maybe not  whats the name of that youkai power draining attack she uses in ds
  okay
                i always enjoy it when character centric threads devolve into hardcore bdsm fetish posting im a little surprised that nobody posted any of lilishs art yet i know hes a reimu man but hes drawn sanny a good number of times
  it only devolved into that for a little bit anon sanaes so sweet that even the most hardcore bondagefags cant bear to torment her for very long right right  and yes lilish is very good
  im glad you didnt spoiler your image
  i wanna make sanae squeal  yes she is super sweet
  i mean zun clearly likes wily toad and propably considers it a sanae staple himself considering that article and wily toad being a bomb in 2 games    makes a hell lot more sense than gray thaumaturgy at least considering what that spell is for
i used to like marisa but now sanae is my most favorite 2hu
  pretty understandable considering how similiar those two are in personality    sanae does not steal though
i just got word back from the clinicme and sanae are going to have a baby
  are you a loving father
  congratulations whos the father
  kanako
  oh no what if it catches her aids
  yes
sanae has quite a sense of style
  all sanae needs in that picture is glasses for her to look like a dork
  and you cant make her any less cute either
  that sounds more like a task for tickling not bdsm      you better make her the happiest woman in the world anon theres an endless stream of anons out there to kick your sorry ass if you ever make her cry
    sanae with glasses is cute
  sanae looks like a total dork in that picture
  nononono anon make her squeal in terror isnt bdsm though falls within that branch of fantasies however would sanae be willing to help achieve this fantasy consensually you think
  youd have to be more specific but im gonna guess not sounds fishy
  how it works is that sanae plays pretend with anon and anon pretends to be raping sanae even though its perfectly consensual and shes enjoying it meanwhile sanae acts like a scaredycat and pretends shes getting raped and totally not enjoying it even though she is of course any kind of bondage would have to wait until lots and lots of trust has been built because bondage with strangers is very very very risky
  do you think any of her outside clothes made it into gensokyo
  horrible bearfeet
  she probably brought a suitcase full but the more delicate items like smallclothes wouldve worn out within the year so now she has to check in with rinnosuke for bras    someone who grew up with proper support for her bappers is not going to be okay with a sarashi or freeballin
how does she deal with menstrual cycle anyway
  same way as everyone else in a society without pads and tampons use cloth or just deal with it
  eirin probably sells drugs to suppress it
fumofumo
  cloth dont underestimate her sanaes put so many things in her vagina shes become desensitised and probably just grabs the nearest object and shoves it up there

do they
i want to smell her hair
good night sanae
forever gensokyos biggest slut night night slutnae
the taishō period 大正時代 taishō jidai or taishō era is a period in the history of japan dating from 30 july 1912 to 25 december 1926 coinciding with the reign of the emperor taishō
  and this has what to do with otaku culture where are the idols
reimu has her own flower
reimu is a very pretty flower
i want to sniff reimu
fuck yeah
why reimoo is shy
reimu is officially fucking horny
ah fug anodder inciddent ddd
  that image was my old phone screensaver
  praise be to hecatia for putting that shitty fucking miko in a dark hole in hell
  because you posted a weird version of this good picture
i want paizuri from this miko
  no one can contain the miko
  wrong in a serious fight hecatia would decimate reimu
  gross it smells like old clothing and dried blood
  menstruation blood
  i agree
just look at this frilly reimu
  youkai blood
  the blood of whole gensokyo
  why the hate
are those reimus parents
  picking up reimus for reimu
  be nice please  direct your hatred to that slut sanae she deserves it for ruining many relationships and denying the chance to live to countless others on top of her horrendous job as a shrine maiden which she fails at horribly
  ohhhh so thats why shes called the crimson slasher  shes supposed to be the white miko but she is the red and white miko because of the dried blood she never cleans off how did she manage to keep her sleeves clean
  is reimu santa
  wait santa lives at the north pole does this mean that getting to gensokyo requires one to go to the north pole yukarisan so cruel   how did the others end up in gensokyo what about that plane that aya saw does everyone in gensokyos outer world go to the north pole often
  shes killed millions
  she was told to do it and the one who told her to do it was right because youkai fairies and other nonhuman twats must be killed    in order to bring peace to gensokyo you must kill millions
  implying the people that die for the sake of gensokyo are youkai and fairies  how blind can you be reimu is a traitor to humanity and her master our greatest enemy both should be killed
  whomst quote
  reality
  humans were dying while fighting with faggot youks and reimu is finishing their job    and if human visit youkai mountain he has beaten by youkai because he is just human  yukari and reimu is doing their best to overthrow   ultrayoukai nationalism    yukari and reimu must have a lot of respect as they both deserve
  irony
  iron turns shit brown
  are you into scat play
  no  i just pick up random knowledge along the way
    whats that face trying to convey
  smugness from knowing that she successfully pushed that man too much to make him pin her down and do something to her
  sanae is a good girl reimu is a bitch who deserves to be killed
  reimu is not a bitch and doesnt deserve to die
  shes a stupid brat who needs to be taught a lesson badly
why is reimu the best and one and only touhou  because every other touhou is a heretic
  that just isnt true there are many other touhous who are shinto
remember reimu friendskeine is behind every antireimu post
  keine wouldnt do such a mean thing
  humans were fighting youkai and winning until they all foolishly started relying on the hakurei shrine maidens now theyre basically little more than glorified youkai cattle all because of reimu yukari and the other hakurei shrine maidens and youkai sages
  wrongeveryone have territory   oni and demons have underground  youkai have mountain  and people have their own territory  fairys are trash niggers of whole gensokyo  the reason why ultranationalism is in place in gensokyo is that of the past
reimu patriotic songsun miko    at the shrine there miko is standing her red dress is like a burning sun and standing bravely at her post fearing nothing even death    there are sun miko her black hair is like raven wings and her brown eyes are like a soil her light is warming up the mountains and happiness around gensokyo    the sun mikoreimu hakurei  we believe in you sun miko  the mother is proud of you reimu hakurei  destroy the unclean spirits and protect your name   the savior of the human race and warrior of justice reimu hakurei    you will be dominant and always remembered those who curse your name will meet their fate    lets go sun miko we believe in you   the traits of your mother are like your shadow  you will be remembered as the god and the savior  of humanity     lets go reimu your mother always with you   and the future of gensokyo is at your hands  destroy the fake gods and destroy those who curse your name    remember that you are not alone no matter how bad it will be the sun will uprise and burn demons into the ashes the sun will uprise and clean gensokyo of evil energy with your faithful heart and beautiful nature enlight our hearts    those who support evil spirits have sold themselves to commit blasphemy against the saints and as long time ago your mother had brake their spines and is now your job to finish the deadly war the future of your race is only at your hands
  humans were fighting youkai  okay  and winning  lmao
  who quote
  lrn2read shitposter
  read what  wheres the text i dont speak youkai
  here  smoothbrain
  stop replying to me jellobrain
  i wanna fill her pink pistil with my thick stamen if you catch my bouquet
i love reimu
  how fucking dare you say that to me you fucker you wont get away with this and live
  why is reimu angry
  this is not reimu  this is keine  remember keine is larping as reimu to make people dislike her  fucking keine i want to take my white gloves and smack her face until its black and blue and then force her to do me a blowjob until she chockes and dies   keine is a fucking bitch i hate her so much
  remember keine is larping as reimu to make people dislike her  why bother when reimu herself does a pretty good job of making people dislike her already
  and what is this job that damages reimus reputation
  some one got dumped by his waifu  my condolences anon
  in short youre a florist
  a sexual florist
reimu is olev pure and simple
  the human villagers used to all be badass youkai hunters each one of them capable of fighting youkai they were winning
  source
  its a known fact that prior to the establishment of the great hakurei barrier the people who would come to settle in the area of gensokyo were great and powerful hunters of youkai sent to the land to rid the place of them it was only relatively recently that in the 1880s it was decided among the great sages of gensokyo to seal gensokyo away from the rest of the world ending conflict between the humans and the youkai with the joint effort to erect the barrier coincidentally the erection of the barrier was the last time anyone had ever seen the creator god of gensokyo the dragon since then there has been a lasting peace between the humans who had stayed within the barrier and the myriad youkai and gods where the humans continue to provide belief to them and sustain their existence and the latter protect and bestow upon them miracles to satisfy them the whole purpose of gensokyo is to preserve protect and save the mystical beings thrown to the wayside by the rapidly advancing world outside after all the whole land is essentially one big wild animal reserve for gods youkai and other fantastic creatures    becoming a youkai and killing either humans or youkai without the approval of the hakurei shrine maiden is punishable by death not too sure if breeding with youkai is a crime but considering it dilutes the small human population its not a widely accepted practice
  too bad nobody pays her even a penny
  lowcost more like nocost haha
  becoming a youkai and killing either humans or youkai without the approval of the hakurei shrine maiden is punishable by death  遅滞  not too sure if breeding with youkai is a crime  no rinnosuke morichika is a character we are looking at now if he was disapproved by reimu he would be killed but hes alive but dont live in human village probably because of discrimination i cant understand why those who become youkai and dont harm others are killed while those fucking youks if they see a fucking human they attack him or otherwise kill him   reimu explain your self
  villagers can still get pretty powerful by outside world standards even if an entire village of badasses isnt sustainable the secret history society was described as hunting weaker youkai and when kosuzu develops superpowers no one thinks its weird    it wouldnt be that hard for villagers to kill guys like the dineanddash snake assuming they could catch him
  this except    coincidentally the erection of the barrier was the last time anyone had ever seen the creator god of gensokyo the dragon  there is no the dragon that was a mistranslation of dragons as a species a pretty stupid one since the pmiss article was in the species section not the characters section but somehow it got entrenched for years
  it wouldnt have been surprising to me if ryugujou was at the bottom of misty lake now that i think about it i think itd be pretty cool to explore the bottom of misty lake if mermaids like wakasagihime can call it their home i wouldnt be surprised if the lakes way way deeper than anyone really expected kinda like having lake baikal but in japan and the abandoned dragon castles been infested by bigbreasted mermaids
fly me to the moon let me play among the stars
im shooting high got my eye on a star in the sky
today is my birthday and i demand a seija thread
go learn some polite words you fag
it was a good birthday  not thanks to you tho
  here have a seija
  imagine how fun it would be to bully seija until she cried
i want her to butt me with her tiny horns
  doink
  theyre really sensitive and itd hurt her more than itd hurt you
i like all the seijas    total antagonist bitch seija  dumb out of character tsundere seija  goofy rape doujin bait seija  wife seija    but my favorite seija is the seija in my heart
  that must be the most level bed ever
  how do i get a bed like that
  step 1 be friends with seija  step 2 sleep on seijas chest
she looks like a goat
  goats are cute tho
  exactly
  wouldnt this mean she would act like a harmful bacteria since she would do the opposite of what a normal platelet would do
  shed be a cancer cell the cutest little cancer cell ever
  so what you are saying is that she will unable to stop herself from reproducing uncontrollably
  no bully thats not nice
seija fumo never
why do we love seija so much all things considered shes an absolutely detestable youkai among youkai
  she a cute
  her unshakable confidence and pride in herself
  shes not detestable at all the only thing related to her that could be defined as such is her contrarian amanojaku nature but even then i think than if you look beyond that you will find a very admirable person whos just chasing her life dream at all costs  shes a weak youkai but that doesnt stop her from being creative and using whatever tool is accessible to her like the miracle mallet or the cheat items in isc  her confidence her skill and cleverness makes for a pretty fun girl that is not only admirable but also really cute
shes truly the worst
  but my favorite seija is the seija in my heart    sugoi
how would she react to a human confessing to her
  disgust apprehension anger revulsion fear and horror
  bump
the best way to hurt to her is to love her
  but she wouldnt enjoy someone punching or humiliating her
  seijas just a little annoying brat that likes giving people a hard time no wonder why people want to bullylove her so much
  is she actually a brat  how old is she
  because she wanted to help those who were weak whether it was youkai or humans
  seija is old enough for stuff
  stuff
  you know stuff
  like
  it involves long rolls and salty sauce
  oh is that what amanojaku like
  id be surprised to find someone who doesnt like sushi and onions sauce
  why is she crying is the sauce too hot
  gag reflex seija is such a messy eater
  wow seija is so nice helping clean shimmy like that
    this means shes 100 dere in the bed
i didnt like seija too much at first but shes really grown on me
  it certainly is crazy to believe that my wife seija was the 30th most popular 2hu this year which by my standards is still pretty darn good
  my wife  excuse me  that is my wife you are talking about
  sauce
  seijas only in a few pages its about shimmy  
  oh too bad thats a pretty cute seija
  anon you must surely be mistaken
  i am 105 right  she just went shopping for me
  shows what you know anon she was dropping off all the crap we just caught in the lake to the market
  thats what you wish tho  we are going to sleep together now
  its nine in the morning here in gensokyo though we were making breakfast and were gonna head out later
seija is cute
  thats weird i just asked her and she has no idea who you are  you probably got that filthy bakedanuki instead of the real deal like me
  pretty sure shes the real deal she even let me touch her in the mallet
    its seija shes playing both of you nerds
  she let me touch her sensitive little cute horns
  she touched me in places i wont say where      totally worth it bro
  oh yeah well she touched something really personal my heart
  maybe anon the real seija was the seija in our hearts all along
sagumes daughter is a tsundere
nice thread
im so sorry
  what are you sorry for
    probably about seija not being in the first page she deserves more than the shadows
  seija deserved more than the unmarked grave she was buried in rip
  where is this grave located  i need to do some stuff there
seija will be mine
  no seija is free like the wind
 you was not able to protect this smile
  that smile means someone is suffering
  on some small hill near the base of youkai mountain its kinda along the road to the shrine so it isnt too much of a hike cant imagine anyone wanting to show such a despicable youkai like her some respect
my wife
  your wife is my onaholes personal back massager dude
  shimmy is not an onahole that is a fairyonly title
does seija like to take long baths or does she prefer to stay sweaty and smelly
going to bed with my wife
already in bed with my wife
seija is not my wife
just imagine how awful itd be to raise halfamanojaku children on the outskirts of the village
  seija is clean
    its awful but someone gotta do it and that man is me so hands off the seija fuckers
  that man is me  seija is mine you fucker
how old is she  did she come from that oni world like shimmy
  its really hard to say how old seija is exactly as youkai tend to live for a very long time until theyre killed off but i dont think itd be wrong to assume shes leaning on the younger side as many of the older youkai arent on familiar terms with her    considering she happened upon shinmyoumaru and stole the mallet its possible that she is also from the world of onis hell/old hell but considering the target of her rebellion wasnt against the onis but against the humans of gensokyo its also likely that she had traveled down from gensokyo found the mallet and after learning that only inchlings can use its true power sought out the shining needle castle as amanojaku arent actually oni but another kind of youkai after all what would really help provide clarity in this regard then would be knowing how exactly she had gotten the other youkai in gensokyo to go along with her rebellion so i think the fact that none of the rebelling youkai fought in ddc are from the land of oni or are also inchlings but various youkai in gensokyo and tsukumogami granted life by the mallet its likely shes a gensokyo native who after the events of sa was able to explore the depths of gensokyo and delve into the underground where the oni live and eventually find a way to enact her revenge on the strong    the fact seija has so little interaction with the oni and youkai from old hell is probably indicative that she knows very few people from there and thus wouldnt have been able to rally as much support as she could have from the surface youkai who she has spent much more time being around considering she is one of them
  there are two of them theres clearly enough seija for everyone i pick the long haired one
  the fact seija has so little interaction with the oni and youkai from old hell is probably indicative that she knows very few people from there and thus wouldnt have been able to rally as much support as she could have from the surface youkai  she doesnt know or interact with the surface youkai either they are just getting affected by her plan and the mallet  i wish zun gave use more info about her   i wonder if hes been pretending she doesnt exist on purpose just so he can bring her back in a really unexpected way
  i was too late dang
i hate her
how would /jp/ react if she were to come back as a playable character for th17
私は鬼人正邪にゃん
  悪の猫ですでにゃん
猫猫にゃん
兎です
  とても可愛い
meow
    translate weebs
  you have to have a basic level of japanese to post on /jp/ ごめなさい
  it depends on whether she is relevant to the story or not  i still want to believe zun is saving her for something important in the future
me with seija
  silly anon seija would never kiss an ugly human like you
  whiter than you youkai
  you are as white as coal
  get the fuck out you unclean bastard  seija is my waifu now
  waifu
  my waifu
  go back there
  where
seija cant be anyone elses wife but mine because shes already pregnant with our first child
  oh that means is going to be a  newborn
  oh man octuplets im so proud of my wife seija
would you smooch a jaku
  id smooch her until our mouths get sore
time keeps moving
i miss her
  what a fucking cunt
  shion is pretty bad yeah
why
  seija is as dead as aniki
  she still lives in everyones heart
i wish seija had more merchandise
seija is the fricking cutest
  there have been newhus that have received their very own fumo before seija
  there have been newhus that have received their very own fumo before seija
  shes not memetic enough among secondaries
victory for my queen
can seija be feminine
  my wife seija is the most feminine
  bad sameface artist
  happy now
  what a cute tomboy
is it wrong that i cant think of any other possible sex situation with her besides rape
  yes as seija is only for slow sensual loving
  thats unrealistic unless you tie her up and torture her like that which is basically rape anywany
      good sameface artist
the mother of my future kids
a terrible daughter can only be a terrible mother
  blue seija is cute
  dont cover her horns theyre cute
  what horns  i only see 2 cute village girls and their cute little doll
seija is a truly messed up individual which is why shes the best
    denpa seija    moe moe
wholesome thread
i wanna rapelove seija until she breaks
  oh no
would seija ironically enjoy a date with me just to crush my hopes at the very end
  she would deny your orgasm if thats what youre asking
so let me get this straight where this meme came from and why sanae is called a slut  is very simple lets look at the history about mikos and sanae    during the feudal kamakura period 11851333 when japan was controlled by warring shōgun states    the miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy disassociated from a religious context her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a nonecclesiastical nature the traveling miko known as the aruki miko became associated with prostitution    and now lets look at sanae is not native to gensokyo   the reason why moriyas left their homeland is that people lost faith in her sanae or the gods  you know no faith no money  and they decided to move to gensokyo  and kanako ordered sanae to get some faith   by sucking everyone   muh headcanon  but this is true moriya shrine is not very popular but it gets some visitors mainly youkai or a few humans    well this is my explanation of the origin of this meme
first place for /jp/ faggiest post of the year 2018    congratulations
first place for /jp/ truest post of the year 2018    congratulations
    there is a rivalry here
  this  this is the shittiest thread thread on the board  trips to boot this thread is over  go fuck a fairy or something /jp/ nothing to see here
  who are you quoting heathen
kanako  snek  suvvaco  frag  sanae  slut  this not it
  stop posting on /jp/ sanae get back to sucking dicks for money sugar daddy kanako and pimp suwako need it or else theyll beat you up hoe
  that aint sanny dude   5 star knuckle shuffle
  its actually slug or slog   its a fair mistake the t key is just above the g after all
sanae attempts to combat perverts 20xx colorized
a filthy slug
  sanae trudging through some garbage scifi corridor when suddenly a naked anon bursts out of a vent and screams that shes a slut and she has to fight him off with a buzzsaw sounds fun
  only to find out that anon can teleport behind her as a extension of his abilities
  if a perverts pin her down she has to mash buttons in order to get them off she uses her gohei to danamku them into oblivion the most common type of enemy is the grabber who tries to fondle her and touch her extremities theres also the sticker who tries to directly violate her orifices and the stealer who tries to rip her clothes off her sanaes health bar is called purity meter and the more damage aka lewds she takes the more submissive and exposed her demeanor becomes at 0hp a fanservice bad ending scene occurs sanaes gohei has multiple patterns available and enemies take damage in relation to how close the danmaku strike is to their crotch a direct hit on their crotch is an instant ko while a hit on their hands feet or head will be nigh ineffective
  just gotta kill those damn dividers
the origin of this meme
  a cute slug
  mind break is a sin anon
  i want to pour salt on her
  dont do that
  please keep posting slug sanae it amuse me
  sorry im out i was hoping others would post so that i could increase my collection
  that it is honehone is a pretty fun guy
  i think you mean kanakp
  slut meme sanae is called a slut because she is a slut sometimes you have to call an apple an apple
  and here i was willing to actually discuss the matter    well thanks for reminding us that slutposters are brainlets in every way imaginable
  well you can see that apple because its an apple   but sanae is a girl and to see if shes a slut you cant see it   sluts are ugly as fuck but sanae is very cute
sanae is a tree
  its a fair mistake the o key is just besides the p after all
  i thought people called her a slut because of the number of lewds she has when compared to the other girls
sanae is a cute girl
  this is incorrect
  this is incorrect    this is all correct  go and look for yourself
sanae is pure
people call him slut because of    1 assblasted sakuyafags during ufo release  2 her retarded dialogue during sa extra    look at the doujins about sanae released before sa she was a much more normal character after sa she became retarded as hell
  assblasted sakuyafags during ufo release  her retarded dialogue during sa extra     try again
  1 assblasted sakuyafags during ufo release  why would they be assblasted
what i find funny about the slut forced meme is that its obviously being done by about a dozen people who think theyre trolling sanae fans but the forced meme is old enough that newer fans take it at face value and are therefore attracted to her because shes a slut    theres evidence on /jp/ that the meme is starting to spill over into other characters im excited to have a /jp/ community in 2023 that is 100 devoted to touhou orgies and sacral prostitution
  people who think theyre trolling sanae fans  or maybe its a dozen sanae fans who have a fetish for sluts
how slutmeme started is ancient history and not really worth wondering about for better or for worse its here to stay
  as an aside i noticed that after that one yuri manga about a depressed lesbian who coped with her depression by hiring a lesbian escort got popular prostitution fantasies among touhou fans on /jp/ increased and the tone of the fantasies was noticeably more positive especially in sanae and tewi threads      it could be that but some of the more persistent sanae slutposters seem to be motivated more by a desire to ruffle feathers given their behaviour at least two people one uses punctuation the other usually doesnt comb through every touhou thread on /jp/ and slutpost whenever sanae is mentioned
sanae devours a plate of cocks every day for breakfast
  people call sluts to every character out there but i accept i forgot about that      some people were asking for sakuya to comeback in ufo but we got sanae instead autists went on a rampage calling sanae a slut
sanae is a highschooler so its kind of obvious shes a huge slut
  nah op is most certainly a faggot and a /v/irgin
  op is just the other anon
  autists went on a rampage calling sanae a slut  the wizard/sage at 30 meme was a mistake /jp/ should have driven away the purityfags and neurotypicals from the board in 2013 by doing uncle remus and blogging about the heroin or cosplay prostitutes they spent their autismbux on
  no i mean the sanae is a slut meme predates even sa it cannot be sakuyafags doing at least not originally    if anything she was just out of luck right now we have her playable in multiple games and prominent in canon manga so we know her personality all too well but before ufo she was pretty bland so anything could have stuck to her
  but before ufo she was pretty bland so anything could have stuck to her  this is important mof and sa sanae were nice enough to gain a little popularity but not exciting enough to really build a solid fanon identity so slutmeme starts up for whatever reason then shes suddenly announced as playable in ufo at the same time ayas slutmeme was a thingpoor girl never stood a chance
  in the end i dont think it matters all that much  most of the old userbase for /jp/ has abandoned touhou or followed most doujin artists to twitter the board is a shell of its former self who cares if a few retards fight each other among the crumbling ruins
  anyone who abandons touhou should be put in a mental institution
shes made others get infected by her slutiness
  haters goth sanae makes me want give her womb a fresh coating of cum paint
  zun approves
support touhou by using haters lewd sanae as your cellphone wallpaper
  sluts are ugly as fuck  ever heard of gyaru
          slugs are hermaphroditesaka futanari
    is that the same slut poster we has in this thread
  id like to have a lot of casual sex with suwako after that wed have pleasantly frank pillow talk about life and suwako would use her thousands of years of experience to help me settle my anxieties before telling me that i remind her of an edo era daimyo she was in a fwb relationship for five decades
  kinda forgot about how sanae was seen before sa and ufo but you may pretty well be totally right about it probably started by some reimufag calling her slut for being another shrine maiden or just bad luck overall but i susten my point over the slut meme gaining force after those games
  because its hot and i get off to it
  butthurt sakuyafags  that all the analysis it needs
  be me   notice your reply  ever heard of gyaru  lol who the fuck is gyaru  googles it   right sanae is a better choice
  perfect for dicking sanae
  why did they get such a sluttylooking woman to cosplay as sanae
  sluttylooking woman  where

sanae is a plant
  the absurd contrast of anime or video in this case characters in the real world never cease to amaze me
  would lick
  sanae isnt a plant she just hasnt bathed in a really long time
  sanae loves to get pollinated and fertilized
  its true

  he is so annoying
  matt alt grew on me hes not that bad
  that guy is so disrespectful and boring gladly i only watch the show on youtube so passing from his part of the episode is always an alternative

  he  hi alt
hey guys  me too right
  is he from newer seasons there is also another old man similar to barakan but taller
  not exactly  i mean i dont think hes ever been on japanology but he has been on a bunch of nhk shows most recently tokyo eye 2020  really hes known for his youtube channel which is the same thing as japanology where hell talk about vending machines for one episode and then the next is about kagoshima hot springs or whatever else    except that hes way too eager to get naked on camera at every opportunity
  do all youtubers get to work with nhk or what like that annoying brit too get to some projects
    based nhk knows their target      except that hes way too eager to get naked on camera at every opportunity  i demand  gender equality force an attractive female host to do the same

    the sassy brit thing is just so overused
      hes done some genuinely interesting good videos but there are a lot of british people like that and it can get grating to some especially when that whole negative nancy thing isnt a character or something that hes forcing for the cameras thats just how a lot of british people are  like karl pilkington

how the fuck do nips keep their charms on their bags without losing them
   try and make sure the connecting bit is vertical i have some but with that type of chain not much you can do pal
are the charms sold at shrines just a tourist bait since the charm products themselves were identical at every shrine i visited when i bought myself one    will the miko do laughing_whoresjpg if i buy a charm for luck in finding love
  theyre not quite tourist bait but many source their stuff from wholesalers since its faster and cheaper depending on their popularity  will the miko do laughing_whoresjpg if i buy a charm for luck in finding love  they will in spirit unless youre yellow enough to pass yourself off as part of the faceless natives
  spoiler  reminder that mikos are the og idols
  i lost my kirari charm just by walking around and pulling her out of my pocket a lot she was attached to my keys someone walking to class hopefully saw it and gave her a nice home
  the little rope tassels work better
  after losing two precious phone charms i started to super glue vulnerable parts of charms if its one like op i guess you have to be sure you want it on there for a while or have a super glue dissolver handy
  this superglue works wonders for little shits you need to stay there
i lost several in the morning train when leaving for the airport on my first trip almost got a tear in my eye
  the same way you keep your dog tags in the army you reseal the lock with pliers
  dog tags  speaking of which you can also thread the chain through a piece of paracord close it and then use a lighter to fuse the ends of the paracord together so that the chain is completely covered  the paracords nylon coating helps protect the chain from the elements and takes some of the slack and even if the chain breaks completely it should still hold the charm
    how the fuck did this thread from japanese lucky charms to army dog tags
    surprisingly similar items yet for different purposes
  they use the same kind of lock mechanism
are you ready
  
  i miss tohou and vocaloid era desu

take a minute to think about how young you were and how exciting vocaloid and all the fandom was back then
  kuso thread right out of the gates
  _master1200jpg  dont save samples
how do i build a time machine and go back
  watching these youtubers feels like a chore compared to just listening to vocaloid mvs or playing some 2hu
do you guys remember these triple bakas
i love you all
i want to go back to a time when she was popular and everything was better
  i remember i had just flat out given up on the fact that touhou would dominate comiket forever    now here we are with fgo and kancolle

    i really miss lon somehow maybe for the most of people just knowing her by this cover    but i think she kinda good to follow  cute voice kinda tomboyish though    but sadly she just not doing anything this last 4 years she just singing for maimai project like this one        i really miss her collab with soraru  goblin slayer ed  one of my favorite is when they cover love is an open door from frozen movies its really cute    
  weird neither of those two have as good of a doujin music scene as touhou did
  shes still streaming on youtube though wishing someone would translate her streams
  mobile users will not stop until the internet is destroyed entirely they ruin everything
  cute stumps 
  if only
  nun
      yeah but its a bit shame because she no longer sings regularly this is because the fujofag bully her so she stop her activity as an utaite    i feel pity about her soraru leaving her and their circle asakunya is somewhat disbanded since suzumu is leaving but nah suzumu is active again with another name though    but their circle still cant recover since soraru and suzumu relationship is not same again like before
  every website being redesigned for phones makes me want to kill myself
  this is because the fujofag bully her    this drama is news to me why though

  its less about looking good and more about just being able to access the site at all desktop view on mobile devices is painful to browse the internet i just hope that web devs choke on a dick for pushing their cancer responsive design ideology having two separate sites  one mobile and one desktop  was fine but nooo they just had to shit everything up by making the entire site change depending on what size your screen is which meant having some uniform style across everything so they stick with mobile friendly aesthetics because its modern and its responsive absolute cancer

  fujofag just hate her because soraru belongs to after the rain right now they say that lon just became a third wheel for soraru and mafumafu and they start spamming on lon channel nnd comment with something like this  soramafu better just go away from soraru  what a disgusting voice    that make lon sad and stop collaborating with soraru again soraru said on his namahousou that they want collaborating again someday but if people still harras lonsan its good thing that he not collab again with lon for protecting her
  what if that anon is actually moot
remember to start your christmas shopping early   wouldnt want your girl with no presents to open on christmas eve would you    old out of date faq dollfaqbuyfagsmoe    previous thread 
new head arrived  now she just needs a body a wig and some cute outfits
still hesitating between a smartdoll and an iris collect
  iris collect are not worth the price imo smartdolls and dds are larger and look nicer at the same price
  thing is the iris collect i found will cost me around 200  less  but some of the smartd look so soulfull its hard to resist them
  awww she is so sad
its been a long time since ive visited these threads im reinvigorated in the hobby after seeing all the dolls at animenyc    i know there were some other dolls on here that had lizanna eyes i found that my pairs did not seem as white as they used to be they are noticeably yellower than my volks eyes has anyone else seen any changes like this is this expected in urethane eyes or is it possible that theyve always been like this and i just noticed now
  i do not recognize these flaws even my oldest girl and mdd mirai whose eyes i exchanged for that of green glass eyes has yet to show any noticeable wear of any kind yes this is a repost from the last thread but it illustrates the eyes that have been in my girl for around 10 years
  man i wish dolls were a thing at my local con
  i have a few pairs of lizanna eyes i cant tell the difference but maybe i wouldnt since i can see them every day and ive been getting used to the changes in appearance have yours been exposed to sunlight maybe
  you kind of dont trying to maneuver around entitled gradeschoolers carrying their big kid toys with ratty wigs and be calm buy a smartdoll tshirts way in front of them in a crowded dealers hall while their mothers helicopter a few inches away isnt fun
  they really dont look soulful once you start checking out other angles and comparing them to other dolls at least in my opinion a big part of that look is the smartdoll brand eyes which i do like a lot but are expensive for what you get
  no you dont
post a doll i can fap to
post a doll i cant fap to
  that ass is so fat shame you cant pre order it right now
  those stockings are pretty cool
  which iris collect is it dont let one anons opinion discourage you from getting a girl you like  personally i like dolls based on the obitsu body like the iris collect and other 1/3 scale azone dolls over dds or smart dolls simply because their joints have better range of motion and its easier to pose them  just remember that the most important thing when youre buying a doll is to make sure you buy a doll you like and are happy with       they really dont look soulful once you start checking out other angles  i find it kinda funny that this is your complaint and youre talking up smart dolls when one of the biggest complaints i hear about smart dolls is that they have flat faces that dont look good from any angle but straight on  not that i have any problems with smart dolls myself i just found it kind of ironic that youre using the same complaint against another doll thats usually aimed at the kind of doll you seem to like best
  which iris collect is it  kano she just look so comfybut my autism dictate that i should be getting a dd to go with 2b that and the fact that they look so soft
  this is a sexy doll
  out of stock  fuck my life
  what i dont really like smartdolls at all theyre the ones i said have flat faces the only thing i like about them is their eyes which dont have the nasty clear/white plastic line transition that lots of eyes have what did you think i was saying was flat
  what doll is this
    i just dug through this guys twitter and good lord what does he do for a living
  has his own mansion in akihabara  drives a red charthemed lexus  goes on expensive dates with gorgeous women  you missed  has a weibo account   hes definitely one of the rich mainlanders living the dream wether or not its of his own hard work doesnt matter anymore
  ywn be a weeb son of a crime boss  why live
so i have two mdd girls  an mdd mirai from around 2008 and an mdd cirno from around 2012 is it worth upgrading their bodies to the f3 bodies thats around 375 eu for each one  should i save up and go for it like one each in the next couple months is it worth it
  winter yuzu
  i know i wont bother not only do i not feel its worth it unless their bodys are damaged i also know i will use it as an excuse to buy a new head and then make more dolls with the old bodys
  uguu thats one of my main concerns what to do with the old bodies if i get a new one yes i could simply stuff them into a a box with the clothing and accessories but id feel disquieted about doing soe
  personally id upgrade any original mdd bodies theyre not great the mdd3 is better so i probably wouldnt do those
  i just got an f3 i like it my other mdd from only like a year and a half ago cant even stand because the feet were loose from day one and i havent wanted to disassemble and all that overall the f3 feels like it holds poses more strongly than the old one especially in the arms but mainly i figured that if i bought the f3 i wouldnt have to worry about them discontinuing the old frame parts
  sorry i misread the comment you where replying to i thought you where saying the iris collect dolls looked bad from different angles my mistake
  thats a really cute mdd
finally done it  i have my first doll ordered
  what did you get
  this cutie a new wig
  i had to look her up shes super cute and that outfit she comes with is great especially the fluffy ear muffs
    lovely be sure to post pictures of unboxing her and posing her when she gets there
  ill with her new wig and sweater
  congratz anon  im still waiting for my first girl to come
    top eye is the default volks eye for ranko which is her daily wear bottom row is lizanna which were purchased together bottom left has been on display for the past month bottom right has been on display for years in the same condition as ranko     looking again im probably just paranoid and theyve always been this warm white
    unboxing  we can skip that this isnt buyfag where we celebrate spending money please just share how she brings you joy and company
does anybody have an idea when volks will restock the f3 base bodies i need to know when to try and pounce
  what region are you in us euro asian
  tuesday december 27 1100 am jst     just fucking contact them not random idiots on the internet
  i wonder what she looks like with all those clothes on
got articulated hands for ai
    nice  how did you attach them
are they going to restock this doll
  i didt attach it yet the bone part of new hands are a bit thinner then original obitsu hands so for now she can hold it when arm is raised but i will find a way fix it later
and just one more pic different eyes bur still red color and different hair color
    those are fantastic where do you get these
  yeah sure after i get my kasumi restock
  gensoushopcartfc2com  about a month ago there were 3 pairs of hands for obitsu dolls in stock i was so glad that i finally found them they sell and ship in japan only so i used proxy service and had no issues but it wasnt cheap after all i was in rush because the hands became out of stock pretty fast
does azone not sell their azo2 bodies and heads by themselves i only ever see the neemoshit on sites even their own site
  nice picture shame he burned the whites
  less sexy
  as far as i know they dont sell the bodies separately only as full dolls kinda sucks because i do like the body shape more than the default obitsu shape  i did mention this last thread but some of the angel philia option parts are close to the same shape and size as some of the az02 parts my girl has an angel philia typea bust and its only slightly bigger than the az02 i bust and fits clothes made for az02 bodies
  when i called last night they said theyre getting more stock on december 1
  more sexy
  i love those angel philia thights do you think they would be compatible
  my girl has typef thighs but i only have dresses and skirts for her which work fine i havent tried any pants or tighter nonstretchy leg wear so i cant really say if stuff like that will fit or not
  sounds good enough ill just have to wait for restock
what happened to 4chan while i was asleep i know this isnt the place to ask but this is the board i frequent most
  if youre talking about the 4channelorg thing all the sfw boards got moved to the new 4channelorg domain while all the nsfw boards stayed on 4chanorg  basically hiromoot thinks that by separating the sfw boards from the nsfw board he can actually get legitimate advertisers to put ads on the sfw boards       cutie
im glad this other wig i bought a while back looks decent on the new head  it kind of sucks that the two wigs i ordered to try on her might end up staying in the box indefinitely  i her body ships soon  i want to take more pictures of her but it feels weird having yuzus head disembodied own right now
  also dark wig  dark eyes makes black and white stuff look pretty nice  i should get my old film camera fixed so i can see how she looks with that
  my heart she is adorable
i hope granblue is popular enough for a collab
  for smartdoll i hope so too
  granblue still alive
  ded after the love live collab
  really makes you think
  is she wearing panties 
  you tell me
  wow what a slut
    those absolute units
so many lewd dolls  _
so this is interesting i dont know if he will but this makes it possible to have different expressions that you could swap out still i am not sure how i feel about a plastic girl and i still want to know the cost
    that would be really interesting but im doubtful especially with how he is about the few faceups they do put out  now if he starts selling these as blanks then weve got something really interesting
  i dont understand the value offered here its not much different from just having another head oh thats right there isnt its just danny wallet raping the its new to me crowd
  indeed it will probably he wasted potential but there is a dream plus he said all cortex use the same back so maybe someone else could make a blank face pack that is compatible
  its strange with another head you might treat it as an expression swap or wipe the face and get it a new body or something if you get bored what are you going to do with a faceplate and i doubt theyll cost much less than a head to justify their existence if faceplates come with their own other half of a head then literally what is the difference danny is a mysterious guy
  wow thats really freaky potential for different expressions or not
    it depend on danny what the value will be  because its half a head and easy to swap in and out it would be neat to have different expressions etc  think like the different face plates that come with small figures like nendoroids or even larger scale models theres potential in the idea but well see if its realized
  does anyone itt own ranka lee im thinking about buying her soon
  no because minmei is the superior idol
ive finally heard back from ringdolll apparently i havent been sending my emails to an account taht is checked for customers it seems that my girl is still sitting in my girls face painting ques and is waiting for her finished painting to be  shipped to me
  i dont but when i do have the money to get a doll itll be either her or a custom mdd shes so cute and her set has nice stuff in it too
would a ddh10 fit a ddp body or should i go with a more mature head
do fuck dolls belong in doll general or onahole general im confused
  onahole
working on getting my first doll but i was wondering what body would you guys recommend for a ddh06 should i stick with a volks dd body an obitsu or a smart doll body something else that i never hear mentioned itt just looking for general opinions on the matter thanks anons
  really depends on what you like the look of best though ddh06 is large so it may look a little bobbly on an obitsu 48/50 also the smartdoll neck peg is very thin iirc so youd need to hold the head in place somehow so it doesnt spin in place for ease of use id suggest a volks body since its a pain to attach the head to other bodies but again its really up to what you like the look of best
  obitsu and smd both will require extra work to make compatible so a dd body would be easiest i like the dds the best but you should pick your favourite
looks like volks took my money for toobie now i only have to wait 1 year
    thank you
whats your favorite thing about your dolls anons
  her motherly chest
  her flat chest
  shame that danny gave up on that automated smartdoll project
  im honestly not sure thats a bad thing imagine having to painstakingly program or move your dolls remotely any time you want to pose them or take pictures right now its one of those things thats like  just because you can doenst mean you should   im also not willing yet to lay down a few thousand for a doll and its hardware and firmware
  imagine having to painstakingly program or move your dolls remotely any time you want to pose  desu that sound funjust give me a mass produced programable robotic body for dd and ill be happy  i wonder if i could use part of those robot for kids
    people have made their own robot dolls  
  a bit stiff but that looks good    otherwise anyone heard a  about that shit   smell like a scam but who knows    
  wo you identified me when i forgot my tag _  i mean shit there was talk and video of people making internal robots for their fucking suiseisekis back when i bought my first girl around 2006 im not unwelcoming to the idea of them being animated and controlled in such a way im just really weary the know how to first make that is extremely worth while but then to dilute its structures and controls to the layman takes an even greater understanding of how it operates
  funny thing is that the people who were working on the project with danny ditched him to work on the dd honey project
  big fat doll titties
so im ready to order my first doll body i have a custom ddh07 and im going to get a dds body for her  but i dont know if i should wait for a restock on the new body or just go ahead and buy one of the old ones  does anybody own both and have strong preferences about them
  if you can wait i see no reason not to wait but i own two of the current dds bodys and there fine
  how cute they all are and how fun they are to photograph
  taking doll photos has become one of my goto hobbies its very rewarding to do something just because it makes me happy to do it
  id like to own a cute little mdd someday i really love arle but ranka is much more affordable and also very beautiful
  how big are mdd anyway
  around 40cm tall regular dds are around 60cm  heres a pretty good height comparison  from left to right obitsu 60cm obitsu 50cm mdd and dd
  thanks anon that helps a lot
  piggybacking on this whos everyones favorite doll body are there any youve seen that arent normally discussed here that youd consider trying with a head you like i saw evokedolls last time i was poking around but the concept of trying to maintain a silicone doll body is horrifying
  man thats hard obitsu 50 and dds are the best in my opinion but smd is like right on the heals with that built in doll stand dd2 and dd3 are the bottom of my list
  i like dddy bodies but i worry about finding clothes for them the builtin stand that smd have really makes me want one but i think i missed out getting my favorite one moonlights skintone was really pretty to me obitsu bodies can look really nice too depending on the doll
    i was more wondering if there were some negative responses to the new frames  i havent seen anything about them at all on any of the other sites i check so i thought id ask  i cant imagine itll be too long of a wait for a restock so i guess ill wait thanks
  man we must have the same tastes arle is my absolute grail doll but shes so damn expensive on aftermarket hopefully i get a chance to have her on the slim chance she gets rereleased for that best selection anniversary poll i voted for her every day ranka is easy to find for a good price so shes more doable and id definitely want her anyway cause shes so pretty
    silicone to me as a whole body is just nono silicone is heavy and in the long term no known skeleton and wire fingers can handle the constant movement    not mine but a recent one on ebay dont know if i can link here but just search for the most recently sold evoke doll body to see even more uh grotesque pictures if you neglect and in the long term
  dds by far im waiting for my first ddf3 to be shipped excited to see how that performs i have a few silicone busts and i agree an entire body of that would be problematic
mah girl finally arrived
    you will post pictures wont you
  yeah ofc after i buy a new battery loader for my camera because it looks like i lost it
  im going to need to go with dds  i like my mdds but the dds body feels much nicer to pose and is a decent size for my wider lenses
  between my two sd16s two mdds single yosd and single smartdoll im very conflicted i absolutely love my limited sd16s because of their beauty theyre ascetics are amazing and they look beautiful however my mdds are much easier to care for and handle the recent addition of my smartdoll girl has further cemented my love for dolls with internal skeletons although the ascetics are nowhere near as good as traditional dolls
  these were so pretty in person that im going to be jumping off the edge and joining you in doll hell shortly    experienced dollfie friends how bad can i expect the staining to be from those allblack clothes and what if anything can i do to prevent/reduce it
  they should generally be fine from the inside but be careful about what touches the clothes from the outside  id be more worried about the masks than anything else though because stains there would be more annoying to get out
  thanks i guess ill refrain from putting 9ss face on 2bs lap until they have some less dangerous wardrobe options    up close it looked like the reverse sides of the blindfolds might have a plain fabric sewn in where it touches the face you can sort of see a fleshcolored edge on 2bs in this photo
  id be more worried about the masks than anything else though because stains  can we get a moratorium on this does this need to be said every time a black piece of clothing is posted really
  570x570  that might just be a shadow so be careful yo as was said before facial staining is magnitudes more problematic than body stains
  i ordered 2b as my first dd and i can assure you shell never wear those clothes out of fear for stains  good thing ddy clothes are easy to find
  noooooo
  couldnt find one in town i have to order it from amazon  ill take some pictures with my phone tomorow
  yay
so choo has said he has been careful to test clothes for stains before he sells them but with cortex he will be releasing clothes that will stain so anyone that buys smd clothes for vinyl smd or dd should be careful he said he will label cortex items so you know what to avoid
  but why buy the character doll at all if youre afraid to even use the clothes the manufacturer gave her
  just because of the head and i dont have a ddy body anyway
  im going to get a base dddy body and head to display the clothes on ill keep the 2b head sealed since i wouldnt want to risk ruining it somehow to be perfectly honest i prefer the anime look of the regular dd heads anyway so id prefer that for displaying
  i didnt know about evokedolls im pretty interested now i already have a sex doll and toys so im familiar with maintaining silicone type stuff im excited for a new doll now
  well is it really a problem or not
  thatd be wonderful id enter the lottery for her in a heartbeat
      pretty certain that 2bs mask is black on the outside and white on the inside it looked that way in person    and ill be staring at it again once she arrives next autumn havent even played the damn game and ive fallen for that face    very tempted to try to outfit her as a shunya yamashita style ayanami rei as well
  sure looked that way to me i dont know a huge amount about volks attention to quality but id hope that when designing the outfits for these two they included measures to prevent them from staining irreparably just by putting them on i noticed that they both come with full bodysuits already included    i hope volks presence means they might decide to have a dollpatype event next anyc id love to attend with my new children if the timing lines up
  ranka is easy to find for a good price  volks site has stock of her available for immediate purchase right now or they did last night anyway
any tips for making clothes for a pureneemo i want to make a shinki from a character that somewhat looks like her
  look for tutorials for blythe clothes a lot of people put them on neemo bodies so most things  headwear nothwithstanding  will fit well for anything going on the head size guides between barbie and monster high will generally work well good luck anon
    piggybacking on this barbie tutorials and clothes are generally less reliable tops are usually too lose unless your doll has a larger bust and bottoms tend to be fairly tight additionally barbie shoes basically never fit  pullip bottoms are often a bit too long but tops are quite small and tend to be too short monster high clothes are a bit big overall but shoes are generally an okay fit licca clothes are pretty reliable sizewise so those might be another tutorial realm to look into but blythe are the most popular dolls that share a sizerange with pure neemos so id recommend starting there    one other thing id suggest is washing any nonwhite fabrics a few times to cut down on the risk of color transfer from cloth to doll you can also line the inside with white but its more work the good thing about neemos compared to a/3rd dolls is that if you make a mistake its a lot cheaper to fix it im still saving for the day when i can get my first large doll     be sure to post your doll one day anon neemos are rare here id love to see her personally
  so heres my girl waiting for her clothes to be washed
  anon pls do your girl a favor and lower that wig she looks bald right now
  yeah youre right since its my first doll im not used to it
kanos clothes dont fit as good as on the boxe
  she is so cute
  thanks anon
  looking good hope to see more pictures
      i will thank you also have the marisa and alice neemos
  she took a selfie    on another note i need to find her a christmas costume  even finding a dd sized one is hard an azo2 is even harder
  nothing does
  i tought since she came with it it would fit  she looks nice in it but the skirt straps dont stay  since they arent strech
  did you maybe shrink her clothes enough that theyre not viable anymore
  the oposite the braces on the skirt are too large
i made my girl a kotatsu
  i love the room you made themthey got everything to neet out so comfy
  damn i should steal your idea
  you should its adorable
why isnt her body here yet
  shit i need to steal this idea for my next winter scene thanks
  i need to get better at this so i can get it right the first time
  something feel really wrong with this picture  like you kidnapped her and shes in the trunk of your car
where can i find the hotglueing videos
  the regular websites like pornhub
morning coffee
i think i am about to bite the bullet i will probably  get a mdd or would you recommend a dds in regards to clothing options
  dds are nice starter doll imo
  i dont like the mdd heads too much and dds have a nice body
i dont usually go for character dolls but i am really tempted to put in a pre order for this
  who makes that one the face looks quite pretty based on the character he head probably has a unique mold to give her the pointy ears too
    nevermind i just found out shes an azone 1/6 model id think of getting her myself but i dont have any other girls that small ive been doing whatever i can to try to make sure all my girls are comparable sizewise
  adorbs
    mdd and dds have a lot of variety for both bodies  it really depends on what kind of girl you want
      thanks for your feedback seems like i still need to ponder over it
    also the same head but different bodys and face ups can really make them look different both of these are a ddh06 one is a mdd and one is a dds
  clumsily cut pumpkin  stop please stop thats just too damn cute
  there are three pumpkins cookies skeletons cut her pumpkin
    part two
      nice family activities
  no but seeing her in this pic makes me want her now
  maybe just find her head then
  adorable
      good stuff
      i love photo shoots these are all so cute and precious thank you for sharing
since /toy/ isnt being fucking helpful    are dollfie dreams copies/ripoffs of smart doll     i cant figure out any information but i can see that smart doll mirai released in 2014 while the dollfie dream mirai was released midlate 2015
  volks has been making dolls since fucking forever and the first internalskeleton vinyl doll they made came out in early 00s
  are dollfie dreams copies/ripoffs of smart doll  other way around  dollfie dream has been around since the early 2000s and smart doll started in 2014  smart doll mirai released in 2014 while the dollfie dream mirai was released midlate 2015  dd mirai is just one of volks standard models and isnt based off of mirai suenaga
  is this shilling or genuine stupidity
  considering he posted the exact same on /toy/ and got the answers he wanted definitely a shill
  thats towa
  oh look here is danny himself talking about how he loves volks and dollfie dreams not long after this volks declines makeing a dollfie dream of mirai and that led to choo starting smart doll     
  im aware was just adding cute doll pic i found online to contribute to the thread
  i see she is indeed cute heres another
  dds got god tier lingerie shame my azo2 will never wear something like that
  this is a private picture of my wife how did you find it
  dam she is cute
just what i always wanted

  i like miyu bro    i know akbg thinks shes uggo but thats what would make her a great wife i bet shes good at cleaning the house and makes good food
    announcing 9th gen auditions right after 46 joint auditions was perfect idea
  she spends too much time singing badly to cook or clean
erii centering this performance was a success
  kawaii
  why did they put the 2 babas either side of her
  to torture us
  calling sasshit every time theres some sort of big event  getting real tired of this shit
  tfw no miyu wife  it hurts bro i just want to make sweet love to her for the sake of procreation      shes female so im sure she can do those chores well
  yokochan center  any other rendition so far mv included
  based big dimes sasshi working anon into a shoot
  two sluts escorting another one of course
  recognisable faces around and unknown new one
  aaahhhhh
  pretty much this
  stage version was better but this is certainly the best tv version
  dungeon dwellers and kimchis cant compete
anon salty af because sasshi is in nwm senbatsu and present in all tv performances  youll have your desertors for fsn now shut up
are hamas eyebrows real
these namba sluts are drying me out
  tall girls are the best feel bad for 3rd girl shes got nothing anywhere
does anyone have the vid where sasshi was singing nakos parts in love whisper
  not really
i just want to drink their cunt sludge _
  that one yorcoyama fan is delulu and likes to reply to his own posts nothing new
  lovely kurenyan
sakura returning for fns is going to be an embarrassment after yokochan
  
  she makes terrible faces when shes dancing if she didnt do that shed be great
  totally such a difference when aks gives the spotlight to hot girls that are also really good at dancing
this is a very nice cover
dem legs
  what the hell are you talking about mai is super hot
  best yokoyui making everything better and lewder again  glad we got this gift to our eyes 3      ant that makes the vanilla fag really salty      10/10      hot
  yokoyuis thighs  hnngh
  vanilla fag really salty  just his usual state      definitely the best nwm   yokochan is a superb beauty
  fucking hell yokochan
  the absolute state of okada
  yokoyui pb is a must
  this      everything is better with eitos centering
  wheres the streamable
  not before best yui
  yuiyui pb now
  we dont even know when or if hiwatan is returning from hiatus though
how many of our girls are gonna cry when performing badly at the contest
tfw we will never deserve team 8
  wanting a hiwatan pb over yuiyui  youre crazy that being said i wish hiwatan would come back
  any cover with yuiri on it is a very nice cover
  miru stealing it
  yokochan  anon
  because mako is a slut
  what couldve been  but the power of the dick was too much for mako
  i wanna cum all over her huge ass nose
spergs about yokoyui  cant even tell the difference between her legs and some random stus
  i dont want either because i know that my dick would see its last sunrise
  who is this and is she good
  no
  nmb48  of course shes good
  she makes me want to sing the yokai song
  stop sexualizing hiwatan shes a cute idol not a sexy idol
  shes the good odan
  based miu
    sometimes its hard tell if you do it on purpose or if youre actually that stupid
  top 2 eitos
someone spoil me on the singing contest whos scripted to win
  too pure but it would be better with nana x yuiri or some other meaty girl
  thanks for saving nwms chreo yokochan
  probably yuiyui
  kawaii best 48gs gamer 3
  so good
  both seems more likely
  dont know about the other guy but i was complaining about okadas stance compared to everyone elses
  now youre just being rude hiwatan is absolutely pure an intelligent qt that would focus on her studying over idoling because it is the more important and shell be better off
  cutie
  wasshoi
  akashi ni naru
  i dont see anything wrong with her stance
  tomu
  just his usual state  accurate/10
  where did she go
  her legs are angled a bit differently than the others but that doesnt necessarily mean anything
  she wouldnt win even if the only other contestant was hori shion
  it wont happen even tho shes getting better at singing its just not believable for her to win
  they really need to release a dungeon crawler 48group game  also  anchu is a cutie pie
  memes aside shion has a pretty good voice
  hiatus to focus on school apparently
  48  believable
  singing voice
  still more believable than mion
  yeah shes focusing a lot on a lot of first hand studies of anatomy and biology im sure
holy shit shion
  sugoii yokochan
tell me when our girl is on
  maybe she is shes a caring enough person to go into healthcare
  most of them are tomorrow
so far shion  yuzuha
  flawless as expected 
  yeah yuzu was a little weak  cute though
  kurena is streaming right now
  was this the flower dress girl
showroomlivecom/48_kurena_cho    shes so pretty
  what does that have to do with his request
  yuzuha
  thanks
  light years beauty indeed
i cant tell if yamarina was good or not but i didnt really enjoy listening to it
    pb when
  too pure
  what am i wrong
  effortlessly beautiful
any site where to watch the singing constest live
  no  and certainly not in the op either
  she is performing with her guitar so smoothly that i dont know why she is not part of the contest
  yes
  nevermind
  oh
hori shion unexpectedly good  2nd flower dress girlyuzuha too much vibrato voice heard for the millionth time  mita mao unremarkable  yamarina sings like she has a coldtoo much nasal sound doesnt bode well with high notes  kato yuuka sweet voice though plain performance  kawakami chihiro the worst for now
  shes honestly not the best singer in the world but thats okay
  she knows the shit is rigged and commuting for 4 hours just to unfairly lose is not her cup of tea
fuck i missed shion 
  this whole month of sr has really shown that she is really good at it maybe she just fell asleep and forgot to send her inscription or something
  i thought chihhii did alright  but what the fuck do i know
  just in time for miru
miru showing her korean training
miru should have called her doppleganger sister and make it smoothly to the finals
  she didnt reach a couple of notes but i like her voice really much
were all just waiting for horinouchi right
rurina should be eliminated solely based on song choice
let it gooooo  let it gooooo
  frozen is legit choice
  i think shion was good totally an unexpected tone dont know why she uses that retarded voice when talking    but of course let it go
i thought my girl was going to do horribly in a few days but she might do okay given most of the competition
wish cho would do bingo more often thats a good song and she always sounds great
  mius mius
  yes  she is ending her stream now 
  the only thing wrong about her voice is you not liking it
i wonder if some of these girls are doing this just to be on tv
  most of them  48g has like 6 singers the rest is just for the attention
1692  onethousand sixhundred and ninetytwo  what the fuck
  maybe they are obliged by management to do it    captcha already kicked in
contest should have been an akbingo special like before
  then no one would take it seriously
love this drama
aoi singing version
akashi was the best imo
now i can go
  this those were the good days
why the hell isnt rikatii singing kurenai
  how is that any different from now
  he wants pointless drama and jokes getting in the way of his talent show
  because the song wasnt on the list
is there a song list for what they are singing
  ill never tanoshii again
  anyone who can actually sing
  far more relevant than  02/13 stu48 2nd single tba takino yumiko center
  but it has to be someone in 48g
  chō
  yeah this shit is lame as it is now
  imagine the team k dressing room
  i swear to god if she wins that magazine contest somehow im gonna be pissed she shouldnt even be allowed to participate because shes the only stu with a push
ami
  now we know naachans secret techinque twister fingers    seriously though yokochan looks so apologetic for taking center position from naachan
oh amimaru
as expected cuteness  singing ability
whats the reward for singing contest  vocal oriented subunit
why does fuu always put her fist around here nose
  indeed theres no problem then
  yeah
momo feet
this ami can sing
wowowow yamazaki
yuzu is such a cutie
  i was waiting for satoami     not sure why im still awake
  thank you
  solo song written by akip though if naachan wins expect a solo single sometime next year
  i bet shes thinking about lopping her fingers off
  more like what theyd feel like inside
  attached or like twix in a tumble dryer
whats this song 
  thats what happens when you dye your hair green april fools is long past
  attached obviously a better question is inside where
rip i dont have time to watch it live please tell me this is being recorded
kobayashi monotonechan
here she is boys
this sasaki girl is pretty bad
i didnt expect that voice from her
  and she is terrible
not good at all but i love her anyway
  i hope yumirin wins she deserves it
    shes cute tho
so its only nmbs today
exceeded my expectations  she did a good job and im proud of her
  no this will last for 4 hours more groups now
  yes they will debate for the next 3 hours of the live
who do you think is the best so far  for me it is natsuko
hkt really is the best
is there anything sluto ami cant do
    steals your oshi
  miru
  wrong what the people really want is fuu or hina they are what stu really needs it should be a group focused on young and fresh girls not some 20yr old
ah when you get no replies on dscord so you repost it here
  i hope yumirin wins both the singing contest and the magazine contest
  shion
  probably akashi  amiru was pretty good tho
    shes for gravure only
whats the format of the contest  will they pick a certain number from each group to go to a second round or are they listening to all performances first and just picking from all
  all she needs is a mizugi contest
  all we need
17 stu whos to get through  time for a shit i think
idols with hoodies
  american idol format
  missing out on 15 of the top 20
who is this stu shes actually kind of cute
  judges mangement will pick a winner to give her a push
  learn to read
yokoyama yui solo single and center
oh shit its the real deal
yes miyumyu
this girl sings better than miru
sex dance machine is on
  i wish i was part of that group hug
  didnt realize the names on the bottom left
she can sing she can dance shes cute as fuck truly the best stu
  shion for singing miru for cuddling
  shes a bit weirdlooking though also whats her personality like
stu being the high seas buccaneer group should be forced to sing ye olde pirate shanties like drunken sailor and yo ho ho and a bottle o rum
  delicious just like her 3
the ear
good singing this girl in the red right now really guys really
    9/10 top pb this year were sakamichi akbg 0 pbs in top ten
  the cutest
  700 jpy for three mini nuggets and french fries   sasuga nihon
we have a new worst singer
is this girl tone deaf
actually believing is a talent contest and not a management san please pick me as your new pillow one
  at least until seichan tomorrow
now thats a shit singing jokes aside
  stu was great until her turn
the looks on the judges faces
  the same target that pays to talk with girls for a few seconds they know their users
  dont forget the coaster
  we all realized it when the true dance competiton winners were made to perform only once and then since it didnt fit the narrative the management wanted to push go phased out in favor of sasshit yukirin and yokoyui
im getting pretty tired of ハナミズキ already
  komi wotas earn 700k yen monthly they can afford some nuggets
yuiris kimchi dish was filling and tasty and the desserts are probably alright but the rest of the food at the cafe is way too small and overpriced
  on a group with like 3 good singers only fools would think otherwise
  fun
  this
  yappari yuiris has the fans best interests at heart
  kimchi  the joke tells itself
stu is doing it only for promotion
  if i wanted to know id read your twitter wl
  which you do obsessively
  i love me some kimchi but damn is it rough on my stomach and asshole
yappari stu is a fucking tone deaf group truly the worst so far and we are only halfway through their contestants to think of all the government money that goes into making a boat for these hacks shinzo abe should reconsider
not drowning out their terrible voices and listening to the piano only
  its mostly rice and a boiled egg hidden by the nori
  thanks now im hungry
arichan a cute
  when do the akbs go
has sasshi right of the first night over stu lolis
too adorable
its alien time
maiha
stu lolis a strong
  she ceded that right to naachan when she ended her kennin
  naachan
  you mean prima donna nocta
  she sold the rights to meru
rip yuiyui
fuu a cute
dental
stu for motorboating
finally a cute stu okay some of the others were cute too
cute eitos
  tba
  psh
oki yuuka a qt
yappari stu is za future  has lolis  has sluts  some can even dance and sing  will soon have a boat  has naachan  how the fuck do you stop them
  why do you think rika kept sabotaging their boat
  iceberg
  shes a good girl
imagine the mayority of girls chose nekoya or la vie en rose to sing
this girl has nice titties
imagine fuus nose placed more up where its supposed to be
  aks wouldnt pay for the rights
there was only like 23 decent singer from stu the group really was a mistake
  id rather imagine okiyuukas nose right up against mine
stu is better than nmb on average even with that tone deaf girl
the queen and her kids
  i think the opposite  nmb were fairly consistent while stu were all over the place    maybe the average was higher but the variance was huge
  by coming back to reality
  code
  rika doesnt have time to deal with small fry
  unf
  that beret loli was a cute though
  its fine the way it is
  those fingers
  the middle judge fell for her lolita voice
  has naachan  when she scandals with a dude itll all be over
uhhhhhh guys  
  thats not even impressive
  noticed by senpai
  call me when shiina momo comments
  so this is the power of memes
  now shes imagining them inside for sure
a fucking jurina ad
  naachan av collab when
idol is basically a jurina appreciation film
    rip my dick
  frog scandal finally exposed
  probably just another rika misdeed    boring
what did she mean by this
shion
  this now her fans will be called 5
  my gf
all the stu lolis making the cut
so proud of amirun
finally our beautiful frog
  shame about the voice though
  it was alright not terrible but not amazing either
  perfect split 10 each totally not rigged
why isnt anju flaunting her tits around
  thats not what this contest is about
  not for your eyes
  lucky judges
mio when
  this part of the contest
  what would you respect from a nonrigged contest
  vibrato bonus
  tell me how to convince you it isnt rigged  nice try aks
whats really surprising is how many of these girls arent completely hopeless
  shiina sora is garbage
noepi is for
tfw noepii will get through thanks to p48
bear imouto
what a cute bear
ngt is surprisingly decent so far
  the only real horror show was that one stu
bear was adorable too bad the song was too high for her
my cherry fairy
  nice
oh dear
mini yukirin is cute
  suzu with the clutch
  should have sung sweet memories
  suzus time will come to shine and become the center nmb needs
  a cute girls pussy of course
literally who hour
ngt has so many pretty girls
this girl is kind of like a cute version of cho
  you can just say like cho
  and lie on the internet
  i wasnt trying to insult her
oh nononono
rara will sing in english
who the fuck are these people
  the winners of rh 2019
this girl has some technique but she aint hitting those notes
  ngt kks
mirii is cute  shame she sucks
  no she wont we are all in this together and this is me are not on the list
why is ngt so good
  looks like a chubby riripon
i cant believe it but ngt doesnt have anyone who is outright terrible
is this guy retarded you dont join a singing competition if you cant even hit one note
  that first kks was useless
is ske today
  no
hkt is the last one for today
finally the good girls
  akb isnt until tomorrow
onigiri isnt feeling the lyrics
this song is not for her
  did you not hear that stu girl
cant tell if its nerves or a bad song choice
  i did dont be so harsh on that 13yo
  no mio  pointless
  you dont choose superfly if you cant move like nao
i like to imagine sakura being in total awe of eunbi to the point where she goes to the toilet immediately after her so she can feel her warmth and smell her piss
  this desu
jiina waki
jiina  mute and fap
yui top 10
  would make more sense for that to be nako than sakura
why yui isnt more popular
  didnt do enough exercise streams
  she offended rich hkt wotas
  she used to be
meru looking really bad
you can see her channeling her power from loli souls she devoured
sassuga next jurina
tsunkus training paid off
t h i c c c c  h  i  c  c  c
  she should deflect to hp for their lolis
rats shouldnt sing
i feel bad for ngt having to be put up against hkt they never stood a chance
  mole status
based aki
  what mole
  i bet its still an even split
i would yaguchi momone aki
damn the judges seem to really like her really good song choice too
fuck this shit aki is gonna be 1
the cute bear
good slut
  exactly
cute
racist looking rough
maichan is ugly now
  now
speaking of looking ugly now
you have one job murashige  
  fuck off putin
hkt has a lot of decent singers
  yes and shes ugly af but i bet this is some fine schlicking fodder to naachan
why is eretan so smug
  naachan only likes cute girls but sora does follow her so
  shes cute a good singer and know how to moonwalk youd be smug too
  getting thicc again for her fans
  why is eretan so ugly no seriously i could see her fuzzy hair even in this lq stream
  you dont like mustaches gay as fuck
  who did great on hkt i was taking a shower
no  potential  no
  aki not really anyone else
  aki and kumazawa maybe meru
  like 3/4 of them
  bibian will
  aki and murashige are the best most others were decent too
speaking of decent singers
ouch
bibian  lol
          im now going to wait 12 hours to watch them im so ffucking stupid thanks anons
all that korean training for this
  kek
yeah she should stick with gravure
bibian is starting to look like a normal human and i hate it
  i humbly regret posting this
  normal human  as opposed to
  it opens a door to other lewd girls naachan will be swimming in rezu jav viewer pussy
  a sexual demon
did alien already go how was she
seiko is crying come one tiffany
  skip the last 2 girls
  she was good
  she made it   14
  she did well didnt put much emotion into it but
  a greasy elf
again with the jurina ad    reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  queen jurina
  the bibian that i loved
  the only way to stop it is to get rid of all of ske
the cute bear made it
amane that high
aya
quite the change
wtf is this hkt bias
do these guys have a thing for hkt or something
this is bullshit tbs
  aoki voting for the girls whove stripped
  /our guys/
this is retarded
  wwww not even trying to be subtle  what a waste of everyones time
sure ill trust their judgement
akiyoshi was fucking shit and shes on 7
miyunas going to get robbed i should have seen it coming
did he say there are 82 members still to go tomorrow
time to boycott this farce thatll show em
produce48 was so much better
  yes 80 akbs and 2 skes
to be fair if you listened with headphones it definitely did sound like hkt had better audio quality than the other groups
  im not even going to vote tomorrow
  akb4 and team 8
    its a good thing i dont have a life
  thats two too many
  theyre still trying to get them off the ground gotta try something new after the big failure that was hktbingo
fuck this shit the people that are not in top 10 today wont make it no if there are 80 other candidates
  rip akashi
  i doubt even anyone outside the top 4 or 5 will still be in
  unless the other 80 candidates just completely suck
  ske  akb  plausible
with team 8 still to go nobody who went today will  be in the top 10
mayuyu
  whoyuyu
  not impossible just highly improbable

  weird ugly face big boobs  weird ske didnt pick her
  7th gen was too packed
    so beautiful
  love shion
  theres more to ske than just weird and ugly faces im not sure what but theres something
  shion looks like that
  a general sense of competence
  the greatest ace the world has ever seen
  watching esports instead of our girls  tsk tsk tsk
  naachan  scandaling with a guy  too pure for that if anything shell date one of her fellow idols and try to live out her yuri manga fantasies
  looking forward to the t8s rina maho and kano everybody else can kick rocks

  nojima will do horrible tho
  she was fine last time
  flat ass as all japanese girls should have i dont want to compete with black guys

  kpop is all about twerking though
rooting for okada in the singing contest i know shell do well
    how is she not an idol

  our trashy qt
  ah i never bothered to look up the plot because of the title
    no mercy
  michelle is ruthless
  new thread 
  no image limit  not page 10  why
  finally its back
  there werent enough closeups of aayan in that stage
  thread being too positive about naachan so he needs to falseflag
    smiley goddess
  this is unrealistic because they are still wearing clothes
  she wants him to look at her cleavage
    i cant control myself
  absolutely gorgeous

  meeting a man you like enough to give private info too
new   new   new 
  but it could be you  what if it was you    this thought is what made sasshi queen
previous thread   what pattern gives you more trouble than it has any reason to  for me its chens final spell
i cant beat the first levels of the easy games on easy mode
i did it after starting touhou in late september with eosd i finally got a 1cc with reimu b on normal i know its not much but goddamn does it feel good  the thing is i still have this bad habit of refusing to use bombs unless im completely cornered if not for that i might have been able to get a 1cc earlier
  thats hard to believe you can practically stand in one place and not move for some of them
  train yourself out of that habit asap
  good work anon eosd is one of the worst games gameplaywise so youre in for a treat with the reson of the series if thats a factor for you
  yeah i definitely ought to use bombs more often    im really looking forward to the rest of the series going to start pcb soon  eosd is one of the worst games gameplaywise  why is it the input lag or something to do with the spell cards
  the game is kind of unrefined at that point the movement is a little off so the spell cards have to be wider to compensate etc thats not really a big issue though probably the worst is the gain lives by scoring thing other games in the series have different mechanics which are usually more interesting
  is it the input lag  were you playing without the vpatch or an appropiatelyancient computer
  without vpatch i got used to it after a few weeks so i decided not to apply the patch plus i dont like modding games like this unless its to fix a completely game breaking issue
  i would think disgusting input lag is a game breaking issue but you do you
  chen in general i dont know what it is about her that gives me so much trouble but i almost always fuck up something
  i think the input lag comes from compatibility issues making the vpatch more of a fix rather than a modding
  id definitely recommend getting vpatch for pcb input lag in it is worse than eosd for me at least
  i beat flandre today even though there was a moving flicker of death bug on my screen from using vsync    secondary status destroyed thanks flan
  great so are you gonna touch any other game or will you continuously post eosd for all of eternity
  grats    who pissed in your cereal dude
  there is no reason for more than half of all posts in each thread to be about eosd
  the fuck are you talking about its only been like 20 posts people are playing the game so theyre talking about the game hows that hard to understand   show me the 155 posts last thread that are about eosd ill wait
  move on
do most people play with keyboard as opposed to controller  ie dualshock analogs
  every single one of youmus nonspells in pcb
  controllers are for gays
  ive got to try this now  as for your question i say deadly toxin poisonous moths dance in the dark      congrats anons
  keyboard is for gays but controller sucks cocks for 2hu dont even try it
talent
    its only been like 20 posts
  some play with keyboard some play with gamepad but nobody play with analog
  i play with analog
  yeah but do you also dodge stuff
  its just a small and not clicky arcade stick
  that didnt answer my question
  yes you dodge stuff with it you can dodge stuff with it thats what people do with the library of shooting games on the xbox 360 after all
  yeah no my best is only lnb on an easy lunatic and my progress is pretty slow sometimes i wish i could play on kb but it just seems a billion times harder pressing  2 keys in order to go in 1 direction seems unnatural to me compared to just pushing the stick in the direction you wanna go  btw how is progress going everyone
  i just tried that with xbox analog i dont believe you
  are you a games journalist
  just because you cant do it doesnt mean it cant be done nice ego
  well obviously playing with unfamiliar device sounds like a bizzare difficulty challange though
  btw how is progress going everyone  very slow unfortunately
  thats what people do with the library of shooting games on the xbox 360 after all  normal people play with dpad duh
what do i need to do to get around this is there some money glitch im not aware of
  yes its called make your own thread faggot
  ive got to try this now  make sure to start from one corner and move to the other other corner at around 20 seconds otherwise it gets a bit too dense
does anyone do all timeouts runs
  ill try it for mof give me an hour
    wait did you mean all timeout no miss or just timing out everything because the former is aids
  its not worth making a thread for a game very few people play when theres already a general
  i suppose both
are there good/bad endings in podd i dont use continues ever only finished it with rikako so far
  yeah nah its too stupid also i just remembered that kanakos first nonspell is a thing so im scrapping that idea thats harder to timeout than vowg honestly might explore some other games though
  its not worth  neither is your shitty fangame
  im not the guy who made that post i just think its kinda dumb to be upset about a single post a guy made about a touhou game just because its one you dont like plus its a kind of fun game
  yeah was just mentioning it in theory not with regards to a specific game
  i dont think normal people want to use the 360 dpad at all
    not a fan of aquastyle games but you should kill yourself regardless
  you should kill yourself  you should go back to the horrible board you came from
  i have some trouble reading bullets moving diagonally stuff like poisonous moth dance in the dark or the blue rings on pristine danmaku hell sometimes i misread them and end up moving into them
  i got stuck there for a while as well since the solution is a bit unintuitive  you need to fill the spaces around you with piles of money then drop the swap talisman  with no room at your feet it will land on the other side of the wall  as usual the marks on the ground indicate where to stand and such
  already there bud
  dont respond for me ever again
i cant beat kanako because im autistic and dont want to watch someone do it on youtube even though im almost definitely going to have to
  i figured that out when i saw money spawning on the opposite side the next floor was a pain since you had to put eirin to sleep make her incompetent place the empty suckgap on the panel above her then carefully throw the money down the hall to the giant kisumes equip the oni cup and then throw the money to kill every single one in that row
  she has only 2 spellcards with a hint of gimmick in a game where you can bomb every second spellcard for free
  i guess im not using my bombs at the best time her non spells fuck with me too the rest of the game seems very easy in comparison
  suck my dick
lolk makes me want to commit die
  its mof you can win by pressing the bomb key over and over
  commit die
  just for you i tried lolk on lunatic pointdevice mode  it took me 30 minutes to beat seiran i had to use one bomb
  i feel like i just ran a marathon  i now want to commit die like   at least i beat ringo thats the farthest ive ever gotten on lunatic with this game her last spell card was surprisingly easy considering the awfulness of the one before it and her first nonspell
  you should probably stop now clownpiece will kick your shit in if youre already forced to bomb here
  clownpiece will kick your shit in  already used to that im more worried about junko she gives me a lot more trouble than clownpiece
which game has the easiest gameplay for someone completely new who is most probably terrible and also has lots of either suika or luna
    race ya
  suika is in fightan or photo games that you dont to play them now luna is in gfw which you dont want to play it now   download eosd hold shift for focused movement
  well for suika theres also sa but you probably shouldnt do that first either      i guess if you really like suika and luna you could also read the manga
  woo
  retry count 4
  congratulation  lolk is basically my first game because i hate myself so im dumping upwards of two hours into getting my ass handed to me by single attacks instead of picking an easier game like a more reasonable person might
  why would he want to avoid gfw its a fun game even if its hard
  its a shit
dying on last 10 of the last spellcard is totemo kanashii desu yo
  yeah but hes completely new do you seriously want him to play gfw
  i feel you man
do you know where i can find replays for the games past td the archive at  only seems to go up to td and i want to try lolk extra but cant seem to figure out some of the spells on my own preferably id like a replay at my skill level i know where to find high score runs but theres no way i can emulate that
  look on youtube
    seems like somebody made an updated archive ill try this  
anyone have a link to the eosd patch that lets you set rank ingame and choose which stage section you start at
  
    cheating
  running the meme to the ground i see
  who are you quoting
  thanks anon
anyone have the eosd cheat that lets you pick your starting lives
anyone have a link to the eosd autobomb patch
  there isnt even a lolk extra replay there that isnt a scorerun if you want i can make one for you that shows how to bomb your way to a win
holy jesus solo reimu does no damage how the fuck do you even get past marisa
how is mystic square easy mode easy took me a few tries to 1cc and i can barely 1cc most of the games on hard
  guys its not a cheat i swear
  are you doing this shit unironically rank setting and stage warping is used for practice you dont need that shit if you just want to cheat through the game for whatever reason life and bomb counts take like 2 seconds to find in cheat engine
  /jp/ in a nutshell honestly
  dont reply to him
  its obviously not the same person asking all three times because specifically asking for something that lets you control rank would make absolutely no sense if they wanted tools that enabled them to cheat the latter two questions are more than likely the usual anon that labels everyone that uses practice tools as cheaters trying to stir shit as always
  he is just an unfunny retard from discord ignore him
  i found a nomiss nobomb run that im using basically i looked for the lowest score run i could find ive already figured out where ill need to bomb thanks for the offer though    the lolk extra is actually pretty easy except for that one heca nonspell until this card if i was using reisen i could get through it with one bomb if im lucky but im trying either reimu or sanae so i just have to get good at it i guess
  fuck junko
  okay  wheres the address i have to change in cheat engine to activate autobomb  its certified not cheating now
guess ill commit to one instead of just jumping around  0024 in  2549 mof  5074 td  7599 ddc  roll
  is there a patch for hsifs
  there is no ingame practice patch for hsifs most games that got a practice patch are those without spell practice atm you can still use spoileral as there is an ssg for it
  there we go  0133 in  3466 td  6799 ddc
  you managed to get extra clear in 17 hours
  its suwako bro i beat her when i still couldnt 1cc ufo on normal
ghosting keyboard
  no im knocking out the exnns i still havent gotten one by one with the exception lolk and gfw
  unfocused marisa b doesnt count bro
  you should be able to lnb after 17 hours
  naturally
  suwako is still easy just figure out the spells and it should be easy the only hard part is surviving 2 survivals in a row
  it should be easy  yeah but not easier than ufo normal i dont believe you post dem replays
  youre replying to wrong anon but joke on you i still have both replays with timestamps    now i remember how i was losing most of my lives on shous curved laser festa0 and 34 lives on byakurens last spell constantly  i also remembered that i beat in extra and pcb phantasm before ufo normal as well but its a story for another time
  forgot pic
  you choked hard during byakuren and lost 6 bombs and still end up with 2 lifes though meanwhile you defeated suwako with your last life and bomb
  and
fuck i decided to actually start playing around late july and managed to 1cc pcb on normal about a month ago which is really shit but now it feels like im going back in progress and getting frustrated which hasnt happened before  sorry for blog
  why do i keep dying to fujiyama volcano in the most stupid ways every time i cap rings fuck i also cant seem to get is down   long road ahead
  why do i keep dying to fujiyama volcano in the most stupid ways  are you doing it right
  i do the circle around her method but i keep messing up the timing in runs even though i can do it 10 out of 10 times in practice
  just because you choked it suddenly makes the whole game harder    i do the circle around her method  dude pls
  someone with your skill level should know about choking easy stuff after doing the hardest stuff in a run
  dude pls  whwhat have i been doing it wrong this whole time    it usually works
  its suwako bro i beat her when i still couldnt 1cc ufo on normal  i dont believe you post dem replays  here  just because you choked it suddenly makes the whole game harder
  where did i move the goalpost you beat suwako with your last life you beat byakuren with some lifes while you choked heavily granted you get more resources in ufo but even in your suwako run you lost a life with full power that should make them at least equal if anything
imperishable shooting  green waves  fucking how
   do the circle around her method  dude pls  this is the easiest method though not sure why youd say that
  no one can do that
  i dont know i simply moved left and right like here  circling around mokotan seems unnecessary risky to me    
cirno really is the strongest
  i mean that link bombs the card you get unnecessarily close to the forks and the blasts and much of it depends on mokous movement when you circle around literally the only dangerous things are the circle bullets and you dont even dodge those in the most dense part of them its this way thats pretty risky
  i dont get it
  i also dont get it why isnt anon using the doll as sub instead of the useless yin yang
  are you me
  do you really believe that
  that bomb was also pretty bad even you must admit it once you get the timing right the card is pretty manageable i dont know maybe your version is easier but im already using this version so yeah    
  i mean yeah just found it funny that youd use an example that doesnt even capture the card i couldnt care less what strategy somebody else uses if it works for them
  17 hours real time and without previous shmup experience anon
  do you really believe that anon had never played a shmup before despite posting here
  or that you cant just clear your scorefile
  also i thought that hes talking about that method where you constantly spinning around mokou unfocused cant find that video though
  thats for honest mans death anon
lunatic impact  lunatic impact  why does this godawful spellcard exist
  just a glorified version of fairy overdrive go back to fairy wars
what are the touhou games ranked from shortest to longest
  thats an oddly specific question i think fairy wars is the shortest the mainline games are around 35 minutes the photo games and isc are probably the longest but in my opinion they dont really count
  oh dog disregard that post i suck massive cock
  roughly  9 128  1 2  4 10 16  6 11 12 14  7 8 13  15  3  photogames not included ymmv depending on how much you bomb/shotgun etc
    whoops 5 sits with 6 11 12 and 14
  not him but why are td lolk and podd so high i can see pcb because it has that overlong stage 4 and in because it has that and a normalsized stage 6 unlike pcb which had a really short one and theres the survival section at the end but i dont remember anything from the three games you listed as longest that makes them well the longest
  ive recorded some of my replays before and just went off the length of those you can go look up some youtube videos and youll see it more or less fits the list  the difference between the tiers are pretty small too you could fuse the first two the next three and the last two together if you wanted into 20 minutes 20 to low 30 minutes and mid 30 minutes and above podd is the only one that has some really big variation but i mostly see 35 minute runs
  based on speedruns at speedruncom the world record times for mainline windows games using normal difficulty are  eosd 18m08s  pcb 22m40s  in 21m35s  mof 13m56s430ms  sa 17m30s  ufo no normal runs easy is 17m20s  td no normal runs easy is 19m25s  ddc 21m03s  lolk 30m48s pd 26m12s legacy  hsifs 23m24s
  hsifs 23m24s  really my lnbnr was only 26 minutes makes me want to give it a try now
  hell upload any ufo or td normal run and you get a free world record
  kinda sucks that the touhou games are so niche i just pulled a 1940 hsifs normal out of my ass that had like 6 stupid deaths the lunatic record looks like it might actually be tough to beat though
i needed some rehab first time 1cc ms  shinkis theme is so amazing
  kinda sucks that the touhou games are so niche  its more that the theoretical bottom is hardlimited by the game and the path for improvement is incredibly linear strict and optimizey
  the doll sucks
  yyou suck
  this speedrunning touhou has very little to do with what typically draws people to speedrunning games in the first place besides much more niche games get speedrun pretty regularly
  mof 13m56s430ms  woah what the hell i assume this has to be from marisabrokens laser shredding through bosses way faster than intended yeah
  whenever youre at 5 power you should basically be itching to bomb your way past the soonest even remotely challenging danmaku pattern unless you know an even harder one is coming up immediately after it
  are there even enough bullets on some of those stages to deplete your resources
  it seems to vary persontoperson whether pcb or eosd has worse input lag regardless both should be fixedup with vpatch
between ddc and td which extra is easier   ive gotten to almost the endurance spell on both stages but i want to know which one to grind for a clear mamizou starts out easier but theres a huge ramp up in difficulty td is also stingier with resources at least compared to ddc raiko is moderately difficult throughout and its easier to get resources but the game punishes you harder for tilting and i cant figure out how to get a bunch of extra lives with marisab so im either going to do reimua or sakuyaa      a 2hu speedrun would basically be spamming bombs and shotgunning bosses to get through as quickly without getting hit doesnt sound that interesting really      ive played pcb a lot more than eosd so the input lag is more noticeable it feels like almost half a second delay without vpatch which makes the game unplayable unless youre king crimson
  td extra is fucking impossible
  it isnt that bad for me until this bullshit spellcard everything after this is complete and utter bullshit as well i guess ill stick with ddc then
  between ddc and td which extra is easier  id say ddc but theyre both around the middleground when it comes to extra difficulty id say
why did zun removed extra from spell practice in lolk
  what are you talking about lolk doesnt even have spell practice although pointdevice mode comes close  just use reisen and bomb your way through if i can clear it then it cant be that hard
  td extra has less resources but doesnt do anything nasty until around the second half of mamizous spells ddc gives you plenty of resources but the stage and raiko are nastier
  oh right  just use reisen and bomb your way through if i can clear it then it cant be that hard  i want to clear it with sanae for personal reasons
  just use sanae and graze your way through
  thanks for advice just beat it thanks to you
  i mean its legit strategy probably the most legit
whats 4channels favorite mainline game i bet its hsifs
  what do you think
  4channeller here i dont play anything but eosd on repeat endlessly
  player penalty    sorry to break it to you but you didnt actually 1cc
  yeah i noticed a bit later that i forgot to set lives back to default thats fine ill move on instead of letting eosd drag me down
ok that was fun except that survival spell what the hell was that
so this happened i was trying to change the name in the scores table and pressed x ththats still an nnn rright
  yeah a very stylish one
  you dont need to move side to side going up and down is enough to clear it since the pattern is kinda similar to guerrilla
i wonder is anybody using stimulants before danmaku energy drinks large amount of coffee alcohol etc any notable effects or improvements
  thats cheating
whats the hardest survival spell
  how so
  probably sukunachans
  doesnt hers have the same route every time its just memo and not a hard one at that      my votes for pwg
  my vote goes for suwa war and philosophy of a hated pérson still getting me despite all my practice
  which one was pwg also yes shimmy is routable but that doesnt save you from bullshit hitboxes and tight streaming
  which one was pwg  ayas from mof
holy fucking shit i captured eternal meek and i finally beat this game on lunatic using continues though
  ive heard people say that touhou is different from other bullet hells in ways other than just the aesthetic in what ways    i installed moedan and intend to play it a bit today/tomorrow
  nice me too
hands down everybody  post your 1cc charts/progress or else she shoots
  dont hurt me please
  shouldnt it be hands up
  its a little slower and less memorizationbased but mainly zuns patterns have way more depth to them  its hard to describe if you havent played them but they strongly reflect the personalities of the characters and the setting with their form names and often synchronize with the music
  nope
  seijas the one talking so
why are the inbetween games 1v1 fighting games instead of beatemups where you can fight monsters much like the ones in the shmups as you go
  because fighting games are easier to make if you dont care about balance and tasofro are well known for being lazy shits
  compared to arcadestyle/cave shooters touhou   is much slowerpaced rapid dodging is usually needed in specific spell cards like eternal meek here  if it was a legit capture   has a lot more fixed patterns which arent aimed directly at the player but are designed to look pretty while being dangerous at the same time   requires less streaming thats not to say its not present but is usually only required in stage portions and specific spellcards   has an easier learning curve id say most arcade danmaku games are at least as hard as touhous hard on their default difficulty   makes heavy use of grazing in its scoring system a lot of arcade shooters dont even have a grazing mechanics in touhou you get rewarded bigtime for grazing except in mof and somewhat in sa   requires less memorization in that you can often make it through a situation through sheer skill    essentially the stage portions of touhou games are more like your average danmaku where you have a bunch of enemies firing bullets that are  mostly aimed at you the bosses are the unique part that makes the series stand out each game is also different in its own way particular in scoring and how you get extra bombs and extends
  they made grief syndrome so they obviously have the tech to do it just not the goahead from zun
  ygb but ive never bothered to route it just bomb  hell eclipse always fucks with me because of the randomness involved    lets reverse this whats the easiest survival spell the extra stage ones seem to be much easier than ones that appear in the main game for whatever reason after all the bullshit before it trinitarian rhapsody is almost like a joke it only becomes remotely dangerous towards the end possessed by phoenix is pretty similar and even easier because the game has spell practice
  youkai polygraph
  its not that they arent capable of doing it but they probably wanted to get a long term contract with zun by doing something that could be more popular and secure a good number of sales so they decided to go for a fighting game i may be wrong but i think people were asking for a fighting game at that time but sice i wasnt into touhou at the time i cant tell for sure    either way dunno about the sales of the last 2 games but i hope tasofro moves over something other than fighting games for touhou given the poor reception hm and ulil had
  so are we all just going to ignore fantasy nature
  i dont think survivals get any easier than that
  thats what he asked for right
  because they had the experience and engine from having made eternal fighter zero and then it became sort of tradition so they just kept going      the poor reception hm and ulil had  objectively nonexistent except for you chileans and your shitty secondary rngtrash game for secondaries    sokushit is never never coming back why cant you kill yourself already and leave the rest of the world alone
are doujin games welcomed if so how to get touhou puppet dream performance yume no kakera translated all patches i found so far only translate interface but dialogues remain  japanese
  what monsters all of the nonbosses in touhou are just fairies or blobs of energy
  are doujin games welcomed  no
  fairies are monsters though theyre beasts sex beasts
  yes
  yes
  the big difference youre missing here is that traditional arcade shmups usually have some sort of a bullet canceling mechanic and huge part of the gameplay revolves around it  with touhou  save for two exceptions  thats not really the case
  some of them are but definitely not that trash  make your own thread if you care that much but my advice would be not to play that hot steaming pile of cow manure in the first place
  who says you need to stick with the mainline games  touhou features such a wide variety of monsters in its lore you could make ten beatemup games out of it and still have some leftovers
  i get that it has completely different from actual touhou and it wouldnt be relevant to the thread but tpdp is by no means bad
  didnt ulil have the urban legend effects which was pretty much the same as weather
  why is it actually bad i have been playing for two hours and havent found anything disturbing or what i could call disgraceful
what are some good tips for capturing most valuable vajra i dont die to it but i always get cornered by the lasers and forced to bomb      the translation patch came out a few months ago check the archives for the puppet dance threads and there should be a link
  thank you found it      you just should stick around the center when they are away from you then when they get faster follow closely the leading one
  they always happened at specific times during a match they were still random but theyre much easier to plan around so it doesnt disrupt the skill parts of the gameplay nearly as much as lole now your getting pulled to each side out of nowhere xddddd    so no soku is shit stop comparing it to actually good games and go fuck yourself
  so it doesnt disrupt the skill parts of the gameplay nearly as much as lole now your getting pulled to each side out of nowhere xddddd  but thats exactly the effect of one of the occults i dont even play the fighting games that much but i just found it kinda odd you would hate it on soku yet let it slide on ulil im not even insulting you man chill the fuck out
  but thats exactly the effect of one of the occults  no its not retard  but i just found it kinda odd you would hate it on soku yet let it slide on ulil  its almost like one isnt as disruptive as the other like i just fucking told you just now remember    are you done yet
  why do fighting games make people go so fucking autistic cant you enjoy fighting games and not be an asshole
  usually  not really its definitely a common theme and can define how a game plays but to say nontouhou stgs usually have bullet canceling is a gross misrepresentation
  hm physic is literally shit and ulil only got any hype for kasens appearance and ulil also had a fucking dlc only aviable for ps4    stop trying to defend those shitty games like there were better just because muh rng weather can be easily controlled by using a fucking card but you are too autist to even notice that
  the only thing literally shit here is your skill level thats why you need rng because otherwise youd never win fucking shit  dlc  oh no secondarybait from sokushit whatever shall i do nevermind that aocf includes her anyway    stop trying to defend those shitty games like there were better  im not doing that im defending them because they are better more creative gameplay instead of being generic anime fighter but with a lot more projectiles a far more varied cast much better looks and sounds and lack of outofplayerscontrol bullshit in the cases of hm and aocf and even then ulil at least has the courtesy to reduce it you just hate the lack of super invasive rng because it means you actually have to put in any sort of effort to get anywhere instead of button mash your way to a resolution the computer decided for you ahead of time    and no weather cant be easily controlled we fucking had this discussion before      no i dont understand what youre trying to get at with your monkey poop painting cant you use words to communicate ideas like human beings do      god hm and ulil are so bad and shit and had bad reception from my proud white country i wish theyd go back to my waifu sakuras game soku   fuck off retard  wow cant you enjoy fighting games and not be an asshole  die
  first off who are you quoting  second i dont give a shit about soku ive said exactly nothing bad against ulil ive already said i hardly play fighting games but here you are with your persecution complex and piss poor manners constantly making an ass of yourself repeat after me its just a game i really should just relax
  i dont give a shit about soku  it sure seems like it especially coming from the guy that first went hurr new games bad old games for secondaries good pls go back to rngshit tazerbro    inb4 tthat wasnt me  are you going to fuck off or what you moronic cretin
  inb4 tthat wasnt me  anon it literally wasnt me my only offense was daring to state that ulil and soku share a mechanic its nothing to get so worked up about i just came here to discuss shmups not whitstand your fighting game fueled autistic screeching
  nevermind that aocf includes her anyway  and you cant play as her on ulil anyways just becase they added her in a later game doesnt change anything    more creative gameplay   like 2 or 3 character max have any creativity to their gamestyles the rest are just prettycolored  attacks    a far more varied cast  literally whos doesnt make the cast more varied    much better looks and sounds  the new engine that made the game feel like shit even zun said it was bad    and lack of outofplayerscontrol bullshit in the cases of hm and aocf  because you cant do shit while being in mid air     it means you actually have to put in any sort of effort to get anywhere instead of button mash your way to a resolution the computer decided for you ahead of time  you are trolling at this point hm took away any sence of gamestyle making it just a random button smash to win you dont have do shit to win other than spamming the same combo because pressing the same button 3 times in a row makes for a combo now to win any fucking fight because attacks now are much more spammier or cover a whole lot of the screen     the skill level for hm and onwards got nerfed hard same goes for alternative builds and stuff hm became a casual game with characters from touhou some pretty attacks here and there and literally 0 skill involved to win as combos were ditched out of the gameplay and we got a 2button combo instead    aocf actually made some decent gameplay thats why i didnt mentioned it
  you still havent answered why im supposed to be obsessed with secondaryshit like you are if i wanted reisen so fucking badly id play hisoutenchilean instead not like it matters in that shit game shes just a projectilevomiting sprite argue all you want that only 2 or 3 characters in hmera fighters are creative thats still 1 or 2 more than sokushit    characters actually really relevant to gensokyo such as kasen sumireko and doremy  hurr literally whos  and i bet you wouldnt be saying this at all if they had been in soku this is why i fucking hate secondaries    the new engine that made the game feel like shit  chilean opinions dont matter  even zun said it was bad  citation needed    because you cant do shit while being in mid air  you cant apparently play the games either    you are trolling at this point  please youre saying this while pretending as hard as possible that sokushit doesnt involve doing whatever because whether you win or lose is 100 dependent on what the computer feels like oh that powerful and useful move that could mean the difference between winning and losing you cant use it now because lol rng 10/10 chilean game design right there not that it matters to you because it means you can win matches and feel like youre one of them mlg pro players or whatever when in any real game they would destroy you and youre calling hm a casual game what a fucking disaster you are      anon it literally wasnt me  good so are you going to fuck off or what you moronic cretin
  if you get this mad at discussing games im not entirely sure how could you ever muster the patience for any 1cc
  who the fuck are you quoting
  whether you win or lose is 100 dependent on what the computer feels like  so i take it you were never any good at soku in your life
  literally not an argument  and i do have 1ccs aplenty thank you very much      how do you get good at the lottery
  oh are you the pofv autist
  ichirin futo nitori mokuo  yeah sure thats a lot of important people right there literally the essence of touhou project    i bet you wouldnt be saying this at all if they had been in soku  even soku has a far better list of characters despite being a game that focuses on pvp rather than story    chilean opinions dont matter  whatever makes you feel better with yourself faglord    whether you win or lose is 100 dependent on what the computer feels like  youd have to be smashing random buttons for that to happen which only tells me how much you suck at soku
  of course a sokuchilean would be unironically proud of not knowing shit you wouldnt know what the essence of touhou project was even if it started biting your face but you couldnt pry it off because that card wasnt available in your rngshit deck    youd have to be smashing random buttons for that to happen  thanks for not denying that the computers whim is literally the only factor that matters in soku matches now go be a disgusting secondary somewhere else
  that would explain a lot they sound pretty similar
  today i completed gfw and pofv yay  eosd next
  yep its the same nigga      
  wow it all makes perfect sense i bet sosd mods are cheating screeching is his doing as well
  eosd
  this guy cant fucking dodge a stray bullet that isnt 100 static so he probably shitposts anything related to eosd as well
  how do you get good at the lottery  you should be able to defeat any player 50 of the time then right
can get all the way through alice without getting hit or using bombs even once  lose half my lives to the prismriver level not the sisters just the level before them  lose the other half to youmu  yuyuko kills me  this is basically how every single one of my pcb runs go
  guess you need to practice the prismriver level more  does pcb have practice mode
  stage 4 is glorified streaming those thingies that puke bullets at different speeds only do so when they die dont kill them and they shoot easier patterns stay still and dodge  youmu is actually hard so youll just need to get better at that
  go watch a pcb lnnn replay you can replicate stage 4 movement regardless of difficulty and most youmu and yuyuko patterns work similarly
  you wouldnt know what the essence of touhou project was even if it started biting your face but you couldnt pry it off because that card wasnt available in your rngshit deck  so whats the essence of the series then
  if the computer gives me all the best moves and fucks over the opponent 50 of the time sure      stop being a sokusecondary and youll find out
  thanks for not denying that the computers whim is literally the only factor that matters in soku matches  you probably are the kind of guy whod complain about pofv being too random i pity you despite being a moronic faglord
  stop being a sokusecondary and youll find out  what did you say back the oh right  literally not an argument  if you claim to know so much about the series you got to back it up
  not an argument      firstly i claimed no such thing this knowledge bullshit started when you reacted with pride and happiness over not knowing who characters are and what they do  which leads me to my second point i dont owe shitty secondaries like you a damn thing if youre interested in knowing more about touhou youre welcome to do the thing everyone else did  play the fucking games oh but wait most of them dont have secondarybait shit like youre le epic waifu sakuya do they i guess youll be staying a willfully ignorant secondary then
are there rough success rates to aim for on books sm and sg before attempting lnb
  if youre not going for low miss then nah not really as long as you approximately know what to do for those patterns just go for it and pray
newfag here been practising eosd for 5 months now on normal mode and ive been stuck on level 4 for around 3 months i cant seem to git gud or improve in any way should i just quit
  how do you practice do you just play the game and try to make more progress than your last attempt or are you making use of stage practice
  have you really been practicing or just grinding your face against it without learning anything tried watching any replays do you know basic strategies to begin with if youre looking for more specific pointers youll need to give a more specific description of which parts youre having trouble with  but in any case you definitely shouldnt give up normal is very doable once you know what to do and/or develop some effective practice techniques
    i use stage practice a lot but im just too autistic to learn and memorise the patterns so i always make the same mistakes even though i know what im doing wrong i know about streaming and safespots and ive watched many replays from others i lose my temper quickly because im unable to learn simple practice techniques in a short time and i have a very slow reaction time im probably too retarded for bullet hell games
  i have a very slow reaction time  this doesnt matter as much as you think it does
  hmm sounds very similar to me when i was starting out about a year ago how much do you actually play i used to get really angry at myself if i fucked up something simple after 30 minutes of playing and then not play for a few days so in a month i played about the same as someone would in a week    of course its up to you if you want to give up but since youve kept going it tells me that you want to improve and i would recommend you to just keep trying dont look at how many months its been since you started because that probably wont make you feel better it just takes longer for some people and i am definitely one of those people
  i was around this bad starting out and have a fair amount of normal 1ccs now if youre playing eosd make sure youre using the vpatch i couldnt 1cc it for years and when i used the patch i did it with 4 lives left over 1st try you also might want to consider bouncing around between the other games it doesnt help mechanically but it can relieve a lot of the fatigue
    i just came across this fix i made a while back for someone that wanted to practice nonspells in hsifs  using a hex editor copy and make these changes to the games executable  at 0x043139 replace 48 with 90  at 0x01c8e7 replace 518d8ebc020000e89d8cfeff with 3ec744240400000000909090  youll be invincible and timeout is disabled so as long as you dont attack the boss you can practice a pattern infinitely
  cheating is bad  i should call the touhou police
  can this count as a 1cc
  you count as 1 cheeky cunt
i managed to clear mikos last three spellcards on normal on spell practice in like 5 minutes after not playing for like one week
  but im just too autistic to learn and memorise the patterns  isnt being autistic a literal opposite of that
  can you make infinite release
  losing your temper might be one of the worst things to do in these type of games i speak from experience i also get  tilted when i constantly fuck up simple shit that i can easily do just take a break or go practice another stage or spellcard ignore the urge to prove to yourself you can clear the games and make the act of playing fun think of every attempt as a opportunity to fail in a better way than as a opportunity to instantly win
koishis release of the id and superego are driving me mad i cant track those hearts for shit
started streaming again     this time we are going for in nmnb no focus extra with imperishable shooting capture    
  youll get it eventually its a pretty difficult exercise for normal players note theres a rhythm to it and the hearts are more forgiving than they look
how can one girl be so perfect
  how can one idol be such a slut
  fuck off mate shes the opposite of that
  because she is an alien who eats other idols
  takane is good friends with her colleagues and a kind person that would never do such a thing
  she turned them into mindless drones
  she turned them into her friends
  shes pure
  i want to join her on an enlightening ramen expedition
  if that were true then she should be fat
  she is fat in all the right places
  her brain
  that too
a fat brain sounds like one thats covered in fat ie stupid even though myelin sheath is essential for brain function
  mindless friends
  whoa takanes sideforehead
  only a small selection of fans is allowed to see it
  she is bald
  a lot of hair for someone bald
  what a privilege it would be to brush her hair
  what would you sacrifice for it
  i love all the hairbrushing scenes in the anime
  i especially like the ones where theyre brushing the best hair
friendly reminder that fat takane is not allowed takane is not a cow
  i was already looking at her beautiful eyes
  cool now lets see your heart
  my virginity
tanakes beautiful pink asshole is well groomed by me the one who plucks her ass pubes using my teeth
man i would eat out takanes asshole even if she had slippery shits from eating 6 bowls of ramen a day
takane is celebrating hibikis birthday with her
what articles of clothing would you like to share with takane
  her panties
i wonder why the guy that said happy birthday hibiki in every ims thread left this one out
  its a simple answer i forgot
  forgetting about hibikis best friend i hope youre ready for your punishment
  delete this
  takane is beautiful
  i want to go to a festival with takane
  what would you do with her
  we would both be wearing traditional japanese clothes so i would get to admire her beauty in those since she likes to eat and i like trying food aswell we could try all kinds of snacks theyre selling there while absorbing the pleasant atmosphere  if everything goes perfectly we might even have some romantic private time afterwards
takane is a ninja
  you are not you when you are hungry takane eat a snickers
  am i allowed to touch there
  you must not
  why not
  why is she wearing fishnets
  because thats what ninjas wear
  doesnt seem practical
  why not
  such an area is of sacred importance to a woman and not meant to be taken advantage of lightly
  to turn me on
  i wish takane would mind control me
  but i just wanna feel her heartbeat why else would she pull her boobs away
  it doesnt do anything
    help i was on a date with takane and after that she put some eggs into my stomach with one of her tentacles
  sounds great i dont see the problem
  and you shall but it must be when your hearts are aligned and minds have become one
  so either mind control from takane or i successfully woo her former is most probable though i wont remember it
  how can you know that
  i just do
  are you fishnets
takanus
  no but im a close cousin
food and takane
  how come takane never gets fat
  she does get fat you just dont notice where it goes
  takane eats a lot imagine how big her stools must be
  she probably does a lot of sports
  literal black hole for calories just one more reason why shes perfect and unbeatable
  where does it go
  jabarandposting is still not permitted
  i understood that reference
  cute feet
she must smell so nice
is takane a goddess of fertility
  she is the goddes of fertility if you revere her you will be blessed with a healthy family and many children
  like flowers and moondust
is it true takane was in contact with neil armstrong
  literally perfect
  literally perfect
    i like it more when her eyes are a bit more narrow
  what an irony she is actually infertil
  slit eyes
  wrong    ultra mommy tier  yayoi  takane    if you cum in these two at all youre going to be a dad no form of birth control works calendar method is useless they ovulate 24/7 impregnation will probably happen within the first week of trying    higher than average tier  azusa  hibiki  mami    contraception is possible but it is still a risky move i would recommend wearing a condom in combination with pills calendar method is not recommended impregnation is likely to happen within the first 2 months of trying    average tier  iori  haruka  yukiho  miki    these girls are much more typical you can safely get away with just pills calendar method is reliable if done correctly it will probably take 35 months of trying for a baby to succeed    below average tier  ami  makoto    these girls are much safer although they are still capable pulling out is the only form of birth control you need youre more likely to use the calendar method to try to conceive rather than prevent with these two it will probably take 6 months to a year of trying before you get pregnant    sterile tier  chihaya    cum inside all you want theres nothing here no medical treatments help either
  we cant be sure until i try all her holes
  what do you mean
  a girl has four fuckholes
  four
  a goddess
  i doubt they wouldve revealed themselves to him if they did wed probably know about it
  thanks for this informative post
  goddess of fertility
  alien takane has maybe more
  scary
  cute bunny
  why does she need so many
happy halloween
  alien sex
  sounds terrifying
  its actually pretty good until takane lays her eggs into your body
  how long is the incubation period
  give myself up to vampire takane
  the path you chose is eternal have you considered it thoroughly
  i have meditated deeply on the matter i am fully prepared to devote my new unlife to takane forever
  48 hours until little takanes are starting to eat you alive
  are they as ravenous as their mother
  what do you think
  i cant wait
  but i want them now
  beautiful
    but they gonna kill you
  imagine
  thats fine
takane steps up to the plate
  playing baseball with a skirt and highheels  i dont think thats how you dress up for a game
  isnt a skirt pretty common in sports
  not for baseball and softball
  wow
  i love takane
  this picture captures everything perfect about takane
  i dont like her hair too much in that one maybe mostly because the colour is too dark   other than that its pretty perfect though
    you like ponytails huh
  that anon is a man of refined preferences
  every anon in this thread has excellent taste desu
takane is so damn hot
  stop eating too much
  eat as much as you like
  just dont eat the apple
the rumors about takane coming from moon started when she got called moon face in school
  you mean when she smashed you moon face in
id eat takanes apple without a second thought
  one of my favourite doujins
  moon face takane
i wanted to post something in this thread but i forgot what it was
  you cant provoke me into doing something illconsidered
  what do you mean
  can i have some
  why do you want hers
would takane forgive me if i fap to some hdounjinshis of her    i want to fap to somenthing else but i always end searching for hmaterial of takane she is so perfect i cant control myself
  if your love is true i think it is okay
  it looks really good
  then get your own
  they dont look as good as takanes
takane would be supportive of whatever you wished to do to her so long as your heart is true
  i want to have sex and a family with takane
  sex for the sole purpose of procreation
  takane is too good for us
  also to show how much i love her
happy birthday
  but youre boobs are down there
  why are you looking at her boobs
  in my opinion love is something you have to fill even if you have to expend every last drop in your groin
   yeah well you know thats just like your opinion anon
  takane has the best chest in all of ims why wouldnt you look at them
do you think well get the new puchimas ova uploaded
  shouldve preordered the volume
  puchimas onaholes are a thing
takanus
  i didnt know things would turn out like this
  takanes face is the best thing about her
  this is what mind control looks like
  pleasure the guards when she is caught
i bet takane has butt pubes
  why would takane need to use mind control
  pleasure how
  taimanin takane
guys   i want so badly to masturbate to takane but im in a middle of a no fap  what should i do
  delete this
  follow your heart

  nope
  chen is my pet mam
  ran here  prove it
  i saw her with some guys in the village
  its cause she changed sex
  shes right over here i gave her a snack
    is one chen sexally abusing the other _
  cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
im goin out west  where theyll appreciate me
  mommy
  do you believe now
  did chen kill another outsider
  no anon kun yukari sama give me some jam
whats going on here ran
  i wish that was my blood
will chen finish homework in time
  seeing how she just woke up where are those two hurrying if its already evening
  god i want to fuck miscreant yukari
  here she is
  muh kokoro
  looks like a lot of questions keine is gonna be very upset at chen for failing to finish her homework today
    yukari set a very bad example ransama should really kick that hag out
  your cat was sleeping on my tv
  why does ran look like shes on amphetamines
  ran here  ti tails and timestamp
  what the hell is that disgusting creature  youre getting no answers out of me ive seen ran with my own two eyes before you filthy imposter
  its past your bedtime chen
  this image stresses me out please never post it again
  ainu ran is a kiseki
  ainu patterns unironically look better than japanese ones
ran is ready for breeding
    doesnt look like so maybe resisting is one of her kinks
  t ainu
  shes in gensokyo  
  if thats so than ranfriends are some really lucky guys or girls
ran is a bunny not a fox
  why not have a fox with a bunny instead
    god i want to fondle rans chest and ears so bad
  wat
  not a foxy bunny    god ran is beautiful
im so glad my favorite artist is into ran
  ran and reisen are the best
  both
  wise choice
  at this point i seriously think ran could 1v1 yukari
    is this the famous yakumo family domestic abuse
  i have a suspicion that yukari has molested chen quite a few times
  she molested a big blonde chen alright
  i prefer the fluffy droopy tails myself
    is ran sexually frustrated
  yes
  i never knew chanta drew this and now i wish he never did
  cool
i want to sleep next to ran everyday and hug her while sleeping
ran is a very pretty kitsune
she has good memory
i want to touch chen i want to trick her into doing lewd things with me
  ran is a fox deity not a run of the mill kitsune
  kyuubi no kitsune arent always deities also zun has called ran a youkai multiple times
  ran is clearly a fertility youkai
does ran make those weird fox noises you hear in the middle of the night
  sorry if we woke you up dude im connected with ranshama every night
  unsecured rdp how foolish
  sometimes a man has to do what he believes in
    very healthy kitsune
could ran beat tenshi
  no ran is a youkai celestials like tenshi are highly toxic to youkai
  i feel like this is a part of something for some reason
this would be a really nice picture if she wasnt nerfed
    god i wish that was me
  ran is fat
  ranshama
  ran has a fat ass
where is ainu chen
  i cant believe chen is fucking dead
  wtf i felt something in my cold dead heart
  that even exists
  if i were ran id absolutely despise getting my tails wet
  i wanna creampie rans tails
  i want some oyakodon
why does this image exist
  favorite 2hu is ran  just bought more nicorette gum and monster yesterday at the grocery store    im going to guess my doppleganger clone made it to show what his daily life with ran is like
  what a useless fox
we found chen
  pretty fox
  our special girl
  now this is adorable
heal
im right here
  ran is adorable she also has a huge ass
    the burden of carrying her weighty tails has given ran a powerful waist
  chen no
  i wanna impregnate that waist
mama rans hoping to find someone to cuddle with this christmas
  ooh ooh pick me
  getting wrapped up in ransamas extremely soft tails
  that shade of blond looks nice
  chen yes
i love mama ran
        im going to impregnate that chest
  this guy is open for commission what kinda ranshamas do you guys wanna see
chen ops the line
  ran and yukari holding hands
chanta drew this so im already happy
  fat tan ran with big pale tanline tittes
found her she was just drinking with aniki
why is ran like this
  motherly instinct
  baby chen was so cute too bad she grew up into a delinquent  her moms raised her so well how could this have happened
ran bought chen vbucks
  nice poggers in the background
found this in a japanese store today theres another cup where shes sitting in profile with no panties on there was no info on the boxes     any idea who she is
  your mother
  help yourself  
wow this bug has a nice ass

  the smile of a woman who reeks of confidence because she lost her virginity
back in black me on the left
  the smile of a woman who reeks of confidence because she lost her virginity    the comment of an incel that still has his
  she really is so beautiful though
i like this girl a lot
    who in all exgakus finally achieved supa lady status and why is it hinata
  super ladies  miyomatsu  hinata   megu is on her way
  su is in the same boat as hana in that they have all the skill and potential and looks and everything but they are just being criminally being underused or improperly used by their employer and would be better off doing literally anything else
  i think hana likes her job honestly
  dont bee too sweet now
  yeah youre right  i dont know if she wanted something that was a little bit more down to earth and not as idol as the usual postgraduate jobs of trying to get on tv or in plays or becoming a solo singer or whatever  not that she dislikes the attention but she seems like the kind of girl who doesnt like to be at the front of spotlight all the time so torahime gives her a balanced job where she cooks and cleans like a regular person but still gets to go on stage and do her thing  its better than a maid cafe    i have no idea how su feels about her own situation im real curious
  even if you dont like what bm is doing currently theyre still easily the most successfull graduates ever which id say is pretty suparedi like
  definitively the most super lady yet and im not even a bmfag when bm finally shuts down you know su will be great in what ever next project they put her in shes a freak of nature a natural talent born to be on a stage
  
  su in sweatpants and tshirt is a million times more epic and powerful than all this crap and shit that koba makes her wear thats just visual noise and a distraction from sus natural beauty
  looks like the meth head grocery clerkfemale who hit on me today but with worse hair
  
  shitty audio but we can tell that shes still the best singer from sg
one of the most exciting weeks ever for kawaiiko has passed  first she told us about her date with megu she had before the sg festival they took picture ate delicious food and overall had a lot of fun together  kawaiiko then went to the live viewing of the festival even though she already saw it in person isnt it great how much she still loves sakura gakuin  the most important part however was the release of her second single choice on december 1st im sure everyone here has already watched it numerous times but nonetheless heres the link to the mv of the same title   its a really beautiful song and i hope you all love it as much as i do  you can buy the single which also includes some other wonderful songs here  kawaiiko also did a lovely livestream to commemorate the release of the single which you can check out here   as if all of that wasnt great enough december 1st also marked kawaiikos and marins birthdays happy birthday to both of them   in her thank you tweet to her followers she mentioned that that senpai also contacted her it has to be yui right  last but not least kawaiiko asked what name should be given to bearchan the teddy bear that has appeared in her mv and other instances alongside her what are your suggestions anons  im very proud of /ourgirl/ as shes taking large steps towards super stardom please make sure to continue to support kawaiiko on her journey
  kawaiiko you are also blessed with supa lady status
    hmm
  you can get a taste of the other songs on the cd here   enjoy
  her english is really good does anyone have a link to her carpenters cover id like to hear the full length version
  the single is on the discord just search for smile
  more than one person calls her kawaiiko lol
  her music is very nice and relaxing
  yes ayami makes great music
  ayami does too yes    and aiko will probably not do well if ayami decides to occupy the same music type in her future plans she did say she didnt want to do idol much anymore 2 years ago but maybe she had a change of heart based on her setlist
lets play a game one of these doesnt belong with the others can you guess which one
    morisensei is a good guy
  im happy to see this so far it doesnt look like any of the gakus attended ayamis show i hope im wrong
  replying to myself like a moron i guess she saw airi but i dont know if that means airi was at the show ayamis twitter    yesterday afternoon i met airi after a long time and it was all fun nonstop talking
  marina is an angel with a pure heart unlike others
has annas bikini photobook been released yet
  my fucking heart
reposting this from yesterday because shi chan too perfect
  is it just me or is she actually looking younger than before  she looks 20 years old here
  shes barely 18 shes looking healthy though so thats good
  kobametalfag has no power on sg
  4 more months i dont think im ready yet
  poor aiko is being overshadowed by everything thats going on recently now we will see if she really is singer material or just being pushed into the industry by daddy
  he has in the way that he has brought in massive amounts of fans to sg with bm when he finally kills bm with bad decisions the massive funnel leading to sg is gone lets be honest no one in the west would know what sg was or even cared if not for bm except a couple of pedofats we already see less fan translations of sg stuff and there isnt the constant new blood coming in as before imagine how things wil be when bm is officially over
  4 months left  the three seniors hasnt done shit no other projects etc  fucking rip  another rinon shirai and oogabooga
soyo is more successful than yuzu maaya and marin combined lmao
  important  this is not a fan fiction or shitpost im the anon who had the rats yui jhs yearbook photo and trolled everyone with it im the guy who works as a teacher in japan and whose friend worked at yuis public jhs  ive received some very exclusive information from him just now    he is currently still teaching at a school in the same general region as the mizunos residence just today he was called out to by some graduated students who recognized him on the street in small talk he mentioned going to a concert this weekend for a rock band and one of the students mentioned babymetal he brought up how sad he was about yui quitting and a students reply was this     actually she didnt only quit my friend in high school is yuis friend for a long time the record label told yui she was too gestures fat with arms out and gave her some months to change it after some time she decided to leave shes sad i hope she can come back next year afterall    considering the last few shows she had some noticeable weight gain this checks out but more importantly that means yui was never sick and sorry she cant perform  amuse blacklisted her from performing on the lineup until she could lose enough weight to fit the image there was never any contract dispute mental illness pregnancy i was one of the folks who initially pushed that theory or any disgust for the band on her part it also makes sense considering the tweets saying she was still a signed member of the band and the general unsureness of her return    amuse/koba was the one who told her she couldnt be in the band anymore if she didnt get skinny again and she couldnt lose the weight fast enough    if you dont believe me here is the full size original rare yui the one i posted a couple months ago was slightly cropped
  anon who had the rare yui   autocorrect miss sorry posting this from mobile at work
  shitpost or not this actually makes sense for one asian agencies are all over idols weight hell sg has a song about it in their lineup but i think agencies contracts do have a weight rule that might get overlooked by idols when they sign it unlike anon said   but now the question is why make bm the shit it is today
  thats all fine and well but heres the thing that she could not make weight in 10 months does not make any fucking senses at all especially since op excluded any form of illness even if this isnt a self insertion aspie fanfic post and the guy really heard from another guy that heard from some kids he talked to on the street it most likely is just a shit rumor at best
  this doesnt check out with the legend s thing though but does check out with the whole physical condition thing i am skeptical that somebody with as much physical activity as yui would not be able to drop a few pounds given her health exercise and diet was strictly controlled yearround by the bm staff
  do you know nothing about genetics  short people especially with round features can have rapid hormonal and metabolic changes in their teens which leads to very easy weight gain that is very difficult to lose we dont know the outside circumstances if she had a fondness for stress eating if her parents are wealthy and have big meals etc  plus the stress of being told you cant perform if you dont lose it doesnt help    i didnt say she hasnt developed some illness of some variety in the wake of this but rather than some  presumed back injury or mental illness wasnt what caused the disappearance
  agree this is a quadruple hearsay he relayed to us what he heard from a teacher who heard from a former student who had heard from a supposed longtime friend of yuis about some rumored weight gain that somebody as active as yui could not lose in 10 fucking months
  anything more than what you initially said is pure speculation the story/message has gone through at least four filters before being relayed to us here yui supposedly told a longtime friend who then told a male student who then told a former teacher of his from junior high and the teacher told you and then you told us
  well they didnt say anything about depression op just assumed that that shit could have taken a toll on yui and could affect her weight
      you neckbeards are pathetic holding someone to a standard to lose weight and keep it off in a time frame claiming that because a teenage girl couldnt handle being told shes too fat to be an idol anymore she shouldve just worked out and gotten back in or its her fault and that somehow makes the whole plausibility of it questionable for you    legend s doesnt check out in what way you all laugh about it yourselves that her last after show photo looked like an unhappy fat face clearly she was being pressured and becoming self conscious by that point
  i call bullshit the teacher anon posted the uncropped picture when yui quit
  the backbrace from the last two big fox shows could have been a body shaper/waistband then since her movements and dance did not seem hindered and she looked bloated af
  op correcting here it was a female student who attended yuis jhs and whose friend still keeps in touch with her they had no reason to lie or exaggerate the story to my friend given the conversation flow
  no i cropped an almost fully uncropped version back then with the surrounding studnets names cropped out check the archive if you dont believe me jesus people
  i believe what youve written what i doubt is the veracity of the story that was relayed to you
  if this is actually true this is some fucked up shit especially considering legend s how fat could she have gotten that she couldnt perform during sus birthday and how cruel are the two girls to let this go as is fucked up
  hey anon what do you think about getting cum in your eyes it hurts real bad tight
  thats what doesnt make sense fat or not 2018 makes no sense with respect to the mess it became for babymetal they would have done a lot better with a slightly overweight yui on stage than whatever the fuck they call what they did in the us eu and japan tour shows and festivals
          you guys are so pathetic grasping at straws trying to explain why she left when she answer is right in front of your eyes countless times have people made fanfiction about her stalked her and her friends went as far as having very personal school photos leaked was almost assaulted on a plane by some weeb constantly bullied by trolls for being fat when she wasnt even fat yet and everyone here and elsewhere has the audacity to be like huh i wonder why she left it must be she got pregnant or the evil agency when its obvious she quit because of you fuckers always being so mean to her and breaking her innocent soul several times every single one of you is the fucking reason for yui being gone now take some fucking responsibility
  it didnt have to go extreme weight just enough for them to tell her to fix it before tour and what could the other girls have done they have no power against an agency that has them under contract
  thatsthats a lot of damage
  amuse has never had a problem with artists who ask to leave they could have threatened to walk if the supposed relationship between the three was real and not just scripted reality tv act
  what about moa then
  community full of incel weebs  virgins who live with mom  tell them to take responsibility  i admire your intentions but your effort is wasted
  i agree its cruel thats why im trying to get the word out its 344 in the afternoon and i have papers to check but trying to get this message out there in hopes the fans will take some action or spread the word   if this place werent so jaded and cynical maybe thered be hope for some justice for yui  but from the responses so far im very skeptical  random potato photo i took at tokyo dome
  what about her her personality is very different she loves attention she fucking wants to be a public figure you think she didnt make sure hawaii photos got leaked she took photos with her friends on instagram doing kitsune sign she let off fucking sirens to make people find her  also she almost never gets bullied extremely little compared to yui people always praise her for being awesome and sexy
  remember guys op is the homo who was bragging about having the picture and not sharing was a yui is pregnant fag and is now presenting this water tight revelation on fucking 4chan he was probably masturbating al the while typing his post and probably still is as he sees us respond classic attention seeking edrama fanfic autism hes full of shit guys
  lmao get your choreography ready to dance for those fuckers tomorrow
  yes  yui cares about a 25 people community with nothing to offer to people who arent cryptopedos looking for an outlet
guys someone said before but did yui leaving have to turn bm to the trash it is today  if they really expecting yui to come back then all the backup dances are reasonable but if not why not just replace her with somebody else not hana you fags
  you are so retarded if you believe this post was only directed at bmsg but this community is very well part of the problem stop being so narcissistic believing everything revolves around you
  youre actually brain dead if you think yui quit her high stakes job after 8 because of le internet trolls maybe youre this weak willed i dont see this being her you trying to put your self on a virtuous pedestal by saying everyone but you is an evil bully is fucking pathetic if you want to make a worthwhile post post some legs thank you
  i dont see this being her  of course you dont itd mean taking responsibility    if you want to make a worthwhile post post some legs  yes live your life fapping to legs idolizing little girls what a great life you have you incel trash
  yeah i had the photo and i was going to share it and then i did withhold it for a long time because of shit talking cretins like you with posts like this making me realize that by sharing it with the members of this community i would also be giving autistic sperglords something they dont deserve but in the end i still posted it anyway how about you be grateful instead of continuing to act like a condescending cunt for once    i dont give a shit about your attention i care about the truth
sorry for realising so late you dont believe any of this shit and just popped back to stir shit up i will stop replying now
  deserve  responsibility  the truth  get your head out of your ass captian virtue signal
two options here 1op is fanficfag and should kys 2is trolling and samefagging because edgehomo check discord for heh guise causing shit on bmsg lul
    try hard troll confirmed  23/10
post legendary legs
        okay calm down obvious samefag calling others samefags we get it you got roasted by the op and your feelings were hurt that doesnt make the story presented here false hes presented no reason for you to doubt what he said
  shut the fuck up i dont care
  aside from shitting on you for your microagressions im not trolling anyone  the kids in kawasaki is as true as it gets my relationship with the autism that takes place here is a separate matter
the people on here are so toxic its no wonder bmsg has gone down hill you guys cant even read someones anecdote without immediately jumping to doubt pessimism and bad mouthing people      this general deserves exactly what babymetal has become
  this general doesnt care about your idiotic moral ramblings or about what happens to babymetal people were uninvested way before the newest fuckup
  speak for yourself one arrogant seascum isnt the standalone mouthpiece for the entire community
  all the anons who care about your idiotic tumblr jargon and about nubm may raise their hands
    this doesnt surprise me sadly ive read a lot of articles and seen documentaries about these idols being disgraced and losing their fame for changes to their looks weight etc    its sad if yui had wanted to keep performing but was kept off the stage
  im not even the storyposter fag i just dont like people making sweeping claims about the general like they speak for everyone
  all the anons who care about your idiotic tumblr jargon and about nubm may raise their hands
lol xd what happenedhere
  huh thats basically lingerie wtf what a 
  and the fourth will pull a momoko but worse screenshot this post
  profound autism
  the fourth  who
  wheres the lie
bmfags are literally the worst
so assuming this amuse/ yui weight gain story is true what now even if she gets in shape and back to kobamuse weight standards the narrative that yui wants no part of bm is already out there they have essentially already made her the villain this is all kinds of fucked up
  she got fat and didnt want to lose the weight enough to get back in time of course she is the villain fat yui ruined something that was good and made it into a joke
sg fags never pull this shit
the thought of plump ass yui makes my dicc hard
  kuru exists
  god among men
  its not fucking true  yuis teacher said she was too fat xd  yeah really fucking believable god you bmfaggots are so fucking stupid taking that bait why dont you crack a book you fucking prick    bmsg never used to be so easily fooled
so yui is fat pregnant and broke her spine 
  it still isnt the ones that are are just shitposting    big thing happens   ayami back  oldfags reappear  shit gets started  its always like this
  and unemployed lmao
  i think i just hate normies
  s a n a
  thanks anon
  sana  koko are very crazy funniest girls
  nobody said that did you even read it a japanese schoolgirl friend of yuis caught up with their old jhs foreign language teacher and told him yui was banned from performing due to weight gain and yui was sad about it   that apparently was witnessed or relayed to the story poster by the teacher or maybe op is the teacher and just using 3rd person to avoid entangling in any potential controversy    i have no reason to disbelieve him this dude was trolling with the yui rare but he had it nobody should have that kind of yearbook photo if theyre not legit    do i mindlessly 100 believe the girls explanation as fact nah but its a good possible insight
  you got any tips on how to get cum out of hair
do you guys think my chances now of hooking up and actually fucking yui has increased now that shes fat
  you think youre that level on the dating market yui may be fat faced but the average japanese woman is a ghoul
  everything is possible but the guy has a track record for being an attention whore  its hard for me to believe that they would destroy the group trio dynamic over this despite what others have said about fat idols there are plenty of examples of idols going through bloated periods and it being considered more of a challenge than the end of world besides the same pressure exists on every occupation where your looks is a significant part of your selling point
  to be fair yui has shown interest in american culture so its not unreasonable she may have developed a bit of a white boi fetish and japs have shown they have lower standards when talking about gaijin see airi and ayaka at the french bakery granted this is assuming anon isnt some kind of fat goblin troll even if yui is one
  thats the exact same photo yui rare that was posted before lol
  ofc not anon how dare you  im a 7 foot tall swole viking god from iceland
  4chan secret club is best and the most legit source of news  lmao xd
  i find it hard to believe a story that has only information we already knew and nothing new we knew she was she was fat she performed in 2017 while fat why not tell her to lose weight then frankly id sooner believe the pregnancy conspiracy theories before this
whether this is true or not im afraid that if yui sees this she might an hero  pls stop
  well done bmfags you played yourselves its time for you all to go back
  just make sure you grow a beard and youre good to go for some whale hunting
koba didnt kill yui    bmfags did
  why cant i find this thread  did it get deleted
  yes because its retarded shit
fuck yui right in her fat pussi
  i just checked it    the image that was posted the day yui announced shes leaving babymetal has the exact same resolution now fuck off you larper    i knew this wouldnt make any sense they would never simply throw her out because amuse knows they would fuck themselves over
  finally someone with a single braincell to actually go and check the image its the fucking same lmao    gj
  thanks mate tried my best
more proof bmfags are cancer
geez still bickering about bm    anyway sorry for the delay fureshu 74    
  theyre cancer daddy what should we do
  thx bud 3
    fuck subunits sanassu is all i need
  hey asshat thats why i said assuming you fucking waste of brain matter were all just speculating here getting this triggered over the possibility that japanese people dont like their entertainers fat
  yui got so fat she now has pussi
  since when does kokonat have braces just noticed her tooth gap is already gone
  no shes sitting next to me and i just confirmed she has only one 1 pussy
  youre so fresh anon thx
sana such a dumbo she thinks vessels have tires  race mix  not even once
nassu is fun    
  i love love dumb and pretty girls
  this webm blew out my speakers
  saikoooooooooooooo
  okay you smartass fucking prick   here is my icloud registry of the fucking photo with timestamp from 2016 what more do you want   i guess i didnt zoom in on the one i posted in october i thought i had to leave out the names of the other students for privacy but i guess i just fucked up and sent the original    im not a fucking larper or posting fan fiction its 100 legit and despite my known history with the yearbook photo ive been also posting pics and video links and good shit on this general since 2015 translating sometimes and been watching the japanese and western news community regularly   i cant do anything more to make you twats believe what im saying is true other than the photo i posted in october and now and why the fuck would i lie about this   i dont want your attention i dont want to make you pricks mad for fun on the contrary i come here and post some out of nowhere inside news i get from my buds fluke encounter and spend half a fucking day angry and defensive because you are the ones trolling and shitting on everything
  anon how do i get cum out of hair please youre the only one who can help me
  i dont want your attention
  tell your friend to find those girls again and demand a picture of fat yui until then this is all just words
  stop dont make it more embarrassing than it has to be i have no idea about apple shit but faking the creation date of a file is a trivial task
    and why would you have lied about the cropping in the first place    aslo charge your phone and turn off bluetooth
  oh this is priceless
  jesus fuck yeah okay i faked the date on the screencapped photo sure     if my friend went to his local grocery store happened to run into yui asked her to take a photo while holding two forms of valid id you guys would still say thats shopped or you know how easy it is to get a random fat japanese girl to fake a photo    you people are hopelessly in denial worse than the ear plugging lalalala that cant be true plebbit fags
stop giving this faggot yous
  dude you literally have no proof why dont u do something better with ur life
  i thought i had cropped it we are talking like two and a half months ago bmsg isnt the prime focus of my life i honestly fucked up by not cropping it didnt really pay attention at the time and realized it now why would i post the exact same original photo with the same proportions as evidence if i had realized it wasnt cropped before  i was confident that i could use that as some clout to prove i am who i say i am but misremembered what i actually sent on a random night in october
  dude no one cares about your bullshit story youre literally just posting the same photo weve all seen post beforeyou have nothing
  anon please my hair is all sticky
  the photo in my phone from 2016 and my pristine knowledge of all the past occurances of my posting bits and pieces of the photo until eventually the full thing should be plenty proof  who the fuck would fake being me clearly i triggered people when i didnt upload the rare back in the day what would anyone have to gain from saying theyre me to share news when you people have doubted me for years
you know i might actually have believed you if you werent such an annoying whiny little attention whore
i love the way i look and feel because im just comfortable i dont feel any different from anyone else  i wake up and see myself as this normal person    i always tell people that i love my belly i love my boobs  those are the squidgy parts  they might be seen as fat to someone else but to me its just comfortable
  explain how being exhausted by defending myself from trolling doubt questions about cum stains etc for the last 9 hours and giving up on being polite makes me a whiny attention whore  you get shit on for 9 hours after trying to provide your community with some valuable info and lets see you keep chill
  you had a photo from a yearbook anon thats it plently of people would have access to the same thing youre just creepy enough to post it online and tease people with it and claim you have inside info
  basedosauce here youre a whinier attention whore than i ever was
  right plenty of people have access to a japanese junior high school yearbook from a public school that she didnt graduate from isnt widely known and didnt exist online in any capacity before my 4chan posts because japanese are very hardcore with their 個人情報 personal information privacy for minors  the only way for a bm fan to have that very specific item is if he knew someone with access to a yearbook to snap a photo of    and yet still you think im full of shit    at this point i just think a large amount of this is jealousy and yalls disbelief that someone could have such a connection  i dont blame you its really a crazy coincidence he worked where she used to attend and i used to often give him shit for not starting there one year earlier to have the bragging rights to say he was actually her teacher    but if any of you ever by some grace of god get the chance to meet her face to face ask her if she remembers meeting the foreigner teacher from her school who was a bm fan she would say yes and that would prove 100 im not full of shit i honestly hope someone here gets the dumb luck for that to happen one day asks and gets btfo with the truth  posts the result then they get called a liar too
girls i like girls
  um y
  working with pure guess work now are you anon of course more than the one person you know had access to the photo you are deluded if you think otherwise    the more excuses you come out with the sadder this is and thats not even starting the i hope one of you meet her in a street crap pathetic cries for attention this all is
please yall stop arguing now lets enjoy the good things and not drag each other down because we all miss yui
  they dont make fun of me openly
  boys do
  kurumi so young 
  the art of letting it go
  why are you posting any of this on 4chan even warm and fuzzy reddit would call bs you must have known before you typed one word that nobody here would believe you  let it go and stop digging that hole deeper
  yes they are mean
      just because you two or one samefag is so vehemently against believing what i say for no reason other than not wanting to doesnt mean i shouldnt try to post it    initially i wanted to share the findings with whoever cared regardless of the medium if you dont wanna believe what im saying is true fine dont   but your opinion doesnt void reality
  regular shampoo doesnt help anon what should i do
  whats up with your shitty hair
post real women kill a pedo today
  momo was sooo underrated
  ive been telling you for hours its full of cum how do i get it out
  how did  that happen but you better hurry up and get it out before mommy comes home
  anon wont tell me but ive been asking him for so long 
paragraph kun is still on autistic rampage i see
  your made up stories for attention also do not void reality
yall better watch the new fureshu episode now instead of bitching
  dude smelling his fingers after taking it out of hana  my dude
  yes
  ciaooh
this is one whacky lore thread how will the fox god react to this how does this fit in with tomatoes and deloreaons otfgk     kitsune up
i kiss kurumis inner thigh
  why not go a little further dont be a coward
  i make my way there make her feel slightly tingly for a bit
yui got fired when she got fat  does that explain why ayami left too actually
  yuifats eternally btfo  she isnt that fat guys just bad picture  shes so fat she got fired lmao and thats a fact
yammy looking like a fine lady real glad that she left her old style behind
  what the hell is going on with the casual drink on the stage looks tacky
    
  i kiss your mom
  guys like you are so fucking retarded look at her body and youll notice she isnt fat at all her face is bloated because of health issues possibly even drugs like painkillers and whatever else to keep her going
    yuzumintsugumin btfo
  show me that sweet sana thigh
  ikr it should be a diamond encrusted chalice
  yummy mommy
  actually now that i think about it there is a cultural difference between japanese and westerners where westerners use the belly as an example for roundness but japanese use the arms doesnt prove that guys story but considering how retarded the storyteller seems to be id be surprised if he fabricated the story while including an detail like that
    
  id like to think this is the pose yudumi will make after im done with her
  why do you want her to regret doing bouncybouncy with you
                                          dont mind me just cataloging this shit in case i ever need an example of what real autism looks like
  hana looking fine as always
  dont be rude
  yes
  notice the face of disgust of the only girl in there
  are these redditfags
  what do they do anon
  why do people do gay shit like this
  just cataloging this shit in case i ever need an example of what real autism looks like  spent time cataloging posts on 4chan  you really made a good example of how autism looks like being completely autistic
all this stupidity and bickering and all this time poor little megu has been sitting all alone in her dressing room now thats just not right
  no worries anon i joined her right after she snapped me the nsfw version of her in the dressing room
  also she almost never gets bullied extremely little compared to yui people always praise her for being awesome and sexy    you should have been here during 201415 she was relentlessly bullied on this vietnamese oil painting newspaper  moa a fat moa an attention whore hepimami can smash it anytime he wantsjpg etc just all of the top shelf autism
  hepimami and oliposting were absolute kino
  why dont people think beards and tattoos are cool anym  ooh
  kino    like i said top shelf autism
  i want her
  imagine the smell i lost my appetite
  delusional fucker you have even more issues than fat faced yui please seek help asap
        i didnt know that 4chan was filled with alpha chads who totally dont look exactly like any one of those guys in the pic
  the far right one looks alright
  oh god looking at his twitter  the only time hes mentioned sg was when he got a sg tattoo along with a yui and babymetal tattoo  refers to yui as the tomato princess   retweets people who say yall and tells others to sit down and shut up   oh man i can already hear his shriek of anger and dispair when he finds out that amuse fired her because she couldnt stop gobbling down tomatoes
  im literally shakeeng right now
  trying this hard  there should at least be some kind of base for your troll attempts thats a whole lot of effort that poofs into thin air
  well as far as i know all the anons who arent also in the reddit bmsg community fall to either end of the spectrum we dont have such generally mediocre people like that superior or mato nothing in between really
is it common for idols to quit because they got pregnant no  is it common for idols be be scolded threatened and penalized for their appearances yes  is there evidence that has no other explanation than yui being pregnant no  is there evidence than has no other explanation than yuis appearance suffering yes    the chances of an idol being fired for being fat does seem pretty slim but for a young adult to develop some major chronic health condition even more unlikely fat chance thats true
this thread is gay yui always had a chubby face even when she was auschwitz levels of skinny she just hated babymetal what babymetal was becoming and rightfully so
  why is ayami doing the same idol stuff again why not just replace yui be part of babymetal and become a real international star
  probably because she enjoys freedom in being a solo singer whos in charge of her own style and is also allowed to have her own twitter account as an adult  doesnt have to be at smelly sausage fest metal shows in yugoslavia and arkansas all summer long
  ayami is cute again
  angel 1
  but how can ayami be on par with her kohai if she does the same thing again
  does the same thing again    well this was a sort of warmup comeback show so obviously she doesnt have a new album and everything but she got rid of the ipoop silly outfit which is already a major step in teh right direction
  ayami wont ever play 2nd fiddle to su ayami had a strong following before joining sg a lot of the girls including yui and hinata looked up to her can you imagine her out there as dancing monkey support for su
jesus christ why is every clueless dumb newfag here spewing dumb lore   this thread has been subpar for months but this makes it way fucking worse  give me dead thread you fucking clueless spergs are worse than anything else
  hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggg
yui mizuno if you are reading this go fuck yourself you fat cunt you should be ashamed
  no wonder moa and su openly despised her she killed babymetal is getting all the sympathy and doesnt even need to live with the consequences of her actions moa and su do
  no anon she could be a real international star like    uh    muscle dancer number 5
  no wonder moa and su openly despised her    wat    she killed babymetal    wat    is getting all the sympathy    wat    and doesnt even need to live with the consequences of her actions moa and su do    nani
  i need an angry sana image
who would win in a fight  su moa and yui or himeka ayami and mariri  pleas keep in mind that ayami is 411 83lbs
    love the girls but this is cringe
    most retarded posts ittfairly impressive considering the competing posts
  true
  too kind  but i guess the point is made
so is maaya a moody slut and does sana have a boyfriend shes been  fucking
hi kumar from bangladesh here  how high would wypipo you rate s a n a in terms of look seeing as you guys are used to seeing a norma white girl everyday  does she look better than an average white girl her age
  ignore the troll my friend
  for her age she is well above average
  i dont hang around preschools and playgrounds so ive got no opinion sorry
  shes better than average but does look awkwardly ordinary since im used to expecting japanese looking girls
  nah i dont think she looks beautiful
im watching young japanese girls out in public and i cant stop
  thats cool bro just dont stare too intently
  but thats where all the cute girls are whats a grilling or two by the local police

  do not care either she is too old
  shes younger than raura silly pedo
  thats a good point
  show me where i said i cared for raura boobs 17 is the limit
  not caring for rauras oppai    if your t levels were any lower youd be wearing them as shoes the absolute state of pedos that are only attracted to stick figures
  
  implying sara mirena momoko maaya marin aiko yuzumi all have stick figures
  yeah most of them do and ticktock theyre getting older by the minute and shortly be too old for you thank god
  is she actually mentally challenged
  you are deluded if you think most listed have stick figures and im sorry to upset you but being over 18 really isnt a real factor
  marina is a gem precious
  real idols have curves
  not on their chin
  typical nusg fan  spits
  what a retard lmao
  
dont know about you guys but id still stick my dick in depressed smelly fat lard yui
are we sure mikus actually the age and grade she says she is
 should have replaced yui
    little miku is a healthy girl who is improving day by day
  no doesnt fit at all
  damn she looks actually cute when her ears are hidden
  miku mountains
  shes so proud of her development
  nassu feels uncomfortable next to miku and tries to push out her chest as much as she can
new yui    
yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui yui      nice spot you got there buddy 
    where was this show straya
  is this just a musclemetal or maybe the new yui or both
  the question is she sing
  doesnt sound live to me maybe not yet
  okay it isnt the studio version so maybe it is live
  shes one of the dancers from the japan shows not new yui
  looks awful from that angle as if shes bald      meh so they just didnt care to bring more than one background dancer for strayan fags
    on the other side maybe she will replace yui nonetheless who would be a better choice than one of the girls that already learned the choreography and she certainly looks like a qt314 in 
  you can all put the fat yui theory to rest not that this girl is ugly but her face is bigger than yuis ever was
  ill claim her just in case she will replace yui thanks
  she is skinny now
  is no one going to notice that moa is going fucking auschwitz
  new yui
  she needs to eat some proper food thats not shitty american junk food trash such as burgers
  everything going according to kobas plans soon moa will be moonfaced and exiled from babymetal leaving su on her own which is what he wants
  i wondered where my laundry basket went thanks su ill take it now
  maybe now all those fanfics faggots can shut the fuck up about their yui was too fat and got kicked head canon the new girl isnt any slimmer than yui at her worst
  who is this woman
  kano buds
  moa dont want to lose her fucking job
  im so fucking erect
  juicy nipples
  you blind cuck see the picture again shes slimmer than new auschwitz moa

  this is the monster girl thread you will only discuss monster girls how hard is that to understand
  dont fucking reply you stupid bitch
  he wants to turn monstergirls back into 3dpd
  if we dont reply he takes it as a sign of approval and keeps going if we do reply he still keeps going    its a loselose situation
  report and ignore
  
  in this case the mods eventually take care of it so this is best 
hellhound metal band  and for our first song of the night were going to be doing our own cover of let the bodies hit the floor by drowning pool   wan nothing wrong with me      do we even know why he does it
    even if they do hell just come back because nu/jp/ mods are allergic to permabanning
fight the spam post deer pussy
  all i have is this moose
  that would imply permabanning does anything at all against that kind of mindset  the only way out is to fight it when it crops up even if the fight is endless  unless youre willing to garrote the cunt on liveleak or something
  hes just some underage autist from /b/ most likely
  please understand apathy  spam happens until he gets bored of wasting his own time
  because hes an underage autist obviously    no seriously if youre looking for rhyme or reason with that kind of person then youre wasting your time
  i take great solace in the fact in the deep seated regret hell eventually feel a few years on once he grows up
  i am grown up  didnt your parents ever tell you lying is wrong
  out of ammo  continue the good fight  god speed
  picklespammer is also fuckoffspammer  suddenly it all makes sense
  prove it  post two separate pickle pics in under five seconds
  he likely still lives with his mom no chance his dad is still in the picture lol
  tried to turn himself into a pickle but would up a gherkin    seems to run in the family
  if gherkin is some slang for daddy and mommy never got along and now her single job isnt enough to support both her and me then sure   thing is its usually her fault in these situations dumb single moms raise deadweight kids more at 11
i dont visit these threads much but what triggered this guy
  nothing absolutely nothing
  dont ask  just ignore and report especially the latter
  weve gathered that he posts late in the evening at least in america shows up when there are multiple threads posted or threads posted that cant be filtered and that hes a very grown up adulttm who definitely still has both his parentstm
  dont know but fuck him and the mods    the faggot has been doing this for a whole hour and reporting does jack shit
  i
  you get what you pay for i guess
  yeah working on it just got to wait for him to get banned and come back again and should have a general idea
i wonder if nocturnal girls like werebats and owl mages get along better than with other species   sort of a late night sisterhood
  considering how many nocturnal creatures there are would it really be any different from people in the daytime
  probably but id bet smaller mouse or bunny girls would be wary of owlmagechan     how many are there that specifically say theyre nocturnal
    nothing wrong when you are to told to return from 2 to 4 am for her to be open and of course it isnt about the store
  how many  i dunno but just looking at creatures from the real world you get plenty cats for example
  scandalous    i can see nekomata being more daytime girls while werecats are more nightime girls meanwhile cheshire is just cheshire
    are gargoyles technically nocturnal
the better question is if dark demon realms count as nighttime for the sake of such things werebats would probably like those kinds of areas moths not so much not much lamp
  i mean they would have to be wouldnt they
  theyre just on a timing cycle i dont remember it saying anything about them specifically being nocturnal   wheres that gargoyle pic latenight did when i need it     the sun still goes through the sky and such in them its just that its well dark and moths in mge see hubby as light so its all good
  i forgot if it was sunlight specifically that set them back to stone or just a set amount of time   either way i imagine they like to make the most of their waking hours regardless and are pretty perky girls
    nah it says they can only move at night though i had forgotten about the whole chain breaking thing
  devil bugs are basically cockroaches yes shape shifting cockroaches that can shape shift into small bugs and to cute girls
  cats get into all sorts of mischief at night
  marshmallow cats and their satanic rites
  nothing about shapeshifting theyre just plentiful small cute girls     satanyac get it right
  maximum pesky
  at first glance this seemed like a sheep it is in fact a lizard
  can you really even get mad at them
  yes i can see the scales    you can throw boots at them
  i mean the worst they could do is summon up marshmallow satan and from what i hear shes just a great big puffball
game over
  my bet is the marshmallow cat would just catch the boot on its head and use it as a fashionable hat  i wonder if owning one is a ticket to get mgs to be attracted to you
  these threads have weathered much worse for much longer
  so ive seen      this little excursion was quite insightful
  especially since he doesnt seem to know what 4chanx is and what it can do
  finally all those boots to the head in grandpas will make sense
  the uncivilized are oft the unintelligent its true
  okay anon     what would you do if a genie gave you three wishes
  1 i wish for fug  2 i wish for fug  3 i wish i was the new demon lord so i can live out the most chuuni inseki shit i guess or i can wish for more fug
  wish for things of course
  permanent good health  a good life for my family   lapdances from her every day for the rest of our lives
  dont let her con me into a fourth    three wishes i grant you great wishes or small  but you wish a fourth one and you lose them all
  wish i wad wishes
  obviously the answer is to create a time paradox  also offer to eat her ass
  enough money to live comfortably for the rest of my life  total immunity to sickness or the effects of age  the ability to use portals to go anywhere in the world so i can visit my fucking acrossthecountry friends already
  1 i wish that this wish and all further wishes be granted based on my intentions not on my specific wording  2 i wish for the ultimate dream starting within 24 hours after wish 3  3 i wish to have no memory of meeting the genie or of any of our interactions so that wish 2 is a complete surprise
  a good nights sleep and a sandwich
so i had this one idea about a medusa that magically boosted her needles so when her husband gets unpetrified he has an orgasm
  why dont people like white horns
  id like her much better if she had 2 legs and a human pussy
  get hit on by cute whitehorn  no way fag    she tried not to cry but she cried a lot
  would a genie be the best companion to have on a long adventure
  money  my dog to live as long as i do  her hand in marriage
  mega satan wants to marry his dog  gross
master you didnt meant what you said did you
  i meant the genies hand in marriage silly
  they get a free pass if they save my life
i got a follow up picture for the thanksgiving miia picture i got from ramenwarwok     its of my daughteru cherry trying to fix miias meal before everyone actually has to eat it im really happy with how it came out
  this is the original
    decent
  whats the guys deviantart account or art account sauce
  a portal for all anons to live happily ever after with their soulmates  fix me  you go get yourself a husband too
  did you just go all roadside picnic on us
  youll have to be more specific i know more about the games than the original film
  the original film  roadside picnic is a book anon not a film stalker is quite different as are the games in any case at the end of the book the stalker red reached the wishgranting place and the book ends in the lines  happiness free for everyone and let no one be forgotten
the welsh for microwave is popty ping
  hakusensei is kingdom hearts light or darkness
  i dont thing even chinese mystic cow understands kingdom hearts
  well then i guess i did go roadside picnic     ive thought about this a lot lately id be living a completely different life if one or two things had gone just a little differently all i want is to change paths very slightly and id likely be satisfied the other two wishes would be wasted on me id agonize over it if i used them for myself but i could be content with knowing everyone found their other half thanks to me    youre a cool bunch most of the time i want things to work out for all of you too if i ever get three wishes you all are getting two i dont need them
  youre a real human bean my man
  most of the anons who hang out here are too even if they deny it there are a lot of people in the world who are full of love they just havent found the right place to put it yet i think these threads are just a tiny glimpse of some of those people    monster girls at the core are an expression of willingness to embrace someone strange and different from yourself that you know you would need time to understand an ability to see beauty and humanity in what others might see as grotesque or alien i think someone who loves monster girls must be a good compassionate person at heart some deeper down than others of course
  this post makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
  pretty much whenever a cute boi is stuck with a monstergirl
  sauce reverse image search and saucenao would not give anything
  whats the pic supposed to be though curious
  a cow
  its the cow girl from granblue sturm being thick and cuddly
  theyre draphs from granblue  females are entirely shortstacks with horns
  also that artist has made 5 or 6 doujins long ones one in full color in addition to a bunch of color pages
one the one hand i want a strong dom muscular mino to hold me tight in her arms every night   on the other hand i want a very busty sub holst to rest my face in her milky tits     im torn
  my choice is strong dom wife who lets me bury my head in her massive chest pillows
    cute
    holst for endless tease well not so endless lets say a ton of teasing and just when she got on the verge of breakin in tears you unzips the dick
  imagine if monstergirls got a hold of mystic messenger or any bishie ikeman game/media aimed towards women
  thanks for the nice words anon
  i have found myself to be more compassionate in the recent years maybe its because i have matured maybe because of monstergirls either way i want to work to create a better world for future generations
  why not both
  ive thought about it but im more of a monogamous type of guy id prefer to dedicate myself to just one girl
  a switch with strongfat body
  id go with holsts i fucking lose those delicious cows
  when is kc going to do leprechauns
  ill fuck three fat bitches
  leprechauns in the hood
  i need thicc foxes
which girls look best in bloomers
all oneesans should be in sweaters
  not all
  i need maxsoft monster girls
  a proper oneesan dresses like a traditional japanese housewife complete with that anime mom hairstyle
  matching couples winter hats with white horn waifu
  if i got a handmade jacket from a white horn id pretty much never take it off  i hardly remove the one i have on as it is
  is it a cool leather one or one of those trenchcoats that you just kind of move into and dont need to come out of like you were a hermit crab
  i wish she was a nice genie
  1 i wish for my following wishes to be based on my personal intent rather than my exact wording  2 i wish for a journal in which anything i write is immediately reflected in reality  3 i wish for the genies freedom    but if shes a total brat  3 i wish for the genie to become my personal oral and anal slave   or  3 i wish the genie would become my personal narrator for life
  ive had my threewishes planned for years now  the very first thing i do is speak with the genie and promise to use one or more of my wishes to get the genie whatever they want if they dont fuck with the wishes and give me exactly what i want exactly as i intended it    1  i wish for the ability at will with no restrictions on how many times it can be used to enter into fictional universes including ones i myself have written  2  i wish to be able to set a fictional universe as a hub world that i return to should i die or become trapped for a long period of time in with no way to move or seek help including if i die in said hub world and i can change which world is said hub world  3  whatever the genie wants    i then write out a story about a place with no one around but is also outfitted with lots of modern buildings and technology that cleans and repairs itself and will forever continue to do so and never lose power or malfunction  said buildings are restaurants of every style of food i like a grand library with all of the books and other media ever written in every universe ive ever been in and my dream home    within my dream home are various pills  one grants me physical immortality one makes it so i will never go insane become senile or otherwise become mentally impaired in any way  the third gives me the ability to reset my mind to the way it is the moment i consume the pill in case i ever after millennia exploring fictional universe become completely bored and/or suicidal with no way of recovering otherwise  and the fourth makes it so i will never become a worse person than i am at that moment so anything that i consider horrible will forever be considered a horrible thing to do    i then spend eternity meeting everyone ive ever wanted to meet from fiction explore all of the fictional worlds i love including the towergirls and mge universes play true sword art online level vr truly fall in love and spend eternity with my waifu and do basically whatever i want forever while keeping to my moral and ethical code    this probably wouldnt work with an mge genie considering they cant even do proper immortality
  a warm weresheep down parka with yeti fur lining on the inside and the hood and a matching wersheep wool scarf that says my dear deer wife on it
  its just a light jacket i just wear it nighpermanently because my place of work is always overairconditioned and im a bottomless heat sink  its comfy too
  reminder that she can make the prerequisite for any wish one lifetime of sex and thats assuming it wouldnt require that much mana or more to grant in the first place
  are you saying that if i wanted to make the genie my narrator for life i would have to give her a lifetime of sexual intercourse
little monster girls are the best
  people that dont forget the subjects when making threads are
  you unzips the dick  sticky fingers
  imagine being in a relationship with both a dormouse and a cheshire seems like a great combo for both comfy and fun
  sabbath day at the local strip club  old bapho thats been working the poles for years  sometimes takes back a single guy she thinks just needs a little convincing  shows him a good time  converted hundreds of guys to the local sabbath branch this way  be sure you know which say is sabbath day so that you dont end up getting seduced by them at the strip club   or do if you like that sort of thing
  for some reason phantoms come to mind
  ask a shoggoth
while looking for a place to get your vcr fixed you stumble upon some kind of gypsy fortune teller or maybe an oracle she offers you arcane insight in return for a small fee
  ufufufu you must be interested in some very esoteric wisdom to need my help  oh darkness no doubt
  i want to have a conversation with a shoggoth about everything shes seen
  turns out you dont bother with eyes a whole lot when youre sleeping under a glacier
  i dont think there are words for all the things shes seen itd be like a mantis shrimp trying to describe all those colors humans cant see
  cheshire wakes up early each morning to get you out of bed  sometimes it works and you go on wonderland adventures with the little mouse riding on your back  other times the three of you just cuddle in bed for hours
  she must have been freezing id tell her shell never have to be cold and alone again    good point hopefully she can help me understand her revelations over time shrimp knight when dammit kc stop holding out
  preserve and protect traditional human romantic relationships
  traditional human romantic relationships
    may the blessings of eros guide thee poor souls
  i want eros to bless me with an ultrabusty cupid ive been good and given love and have nearly given up hope from being cheated on
  why does her tail extend from her shoulder blades also she is clearly a succ disguised as a vamp
  tfw you will never be a beefcake eros paladin who can make monsters especially muscular ones swoon just from flexing
  ive never sold my soul to anyone its mine
  would you have an entire conversation with a minotaur just by both of you flexing before ending it with a respectful handshake
  human woman that will grow old ugly gets irritable certain times of the month and will probably cheat  or  mamono that are always beautiful hungry for you and your cock and will always love you in this life and the next so much so that if you died before and she couldnt revive you shed take her own life to be with you in the afterlife    the choice is obvious
  sandals rapidly thudding on the floor  screen door slides open ochimusha steps in holding her katana to her abdomen  did someone say take their own life  sigh and tell her not now dear  shes earnest ill give her that
  silly ochimusha shes undead she cant die by sudoku
  do not bully shes trying to reclaim her honor
  neoorder propaganda produced shortly after the fall of the chief god 2 af after fall colorized  although not visible the couple depicted is actually an incubus and his succubus wife early works such as this were influential in defining the neoorder as a group of monsters and men dedicated to surface purity with immense lust bubbling underneath
  now this i can get behind
grea  
  what about her
saki episode today   literally cannot calm my titsgif
  do other alps have controlling their new tits too or just you

  sharks are safer than dolphins
  irish canadian ancestry
  shin megami tensei collection no you cant touch it
  what did you do to suffer such a fate
  food
  imagine dolphins are rapey to begin with monstergirl dolphins would be the hellhounds of the sea as far as rape goes
  total devotion to the elf empire
  maybe some forest hunter species werewolf or maybe some wood elf
  dark elf paying a wood elf to make sm gear  awkward
  i guess but at the same time it can be nice to deal with something more familiar
  tailbulb doesnt have a swimming cap   shame
  freckled manticore  ill take it
  manticores strike me as the type of girls thatd easily get addicted to their hubbys cum much more so than other monster girls
i still want to go spelunkin with a tunnel dragon
  thats all well and good but how many hours of  digging a hole  a hole a hole a hole  im digging a hole  can you stand
  not him but im digging for shortstack dwarves
  i teach her a fuck ton of songs while down there
  like what
  just uplifting and fun chants  anything but the chemical workers song
  its a small world after all
  the underpants gnomes song  gotta go to work  work all night  searching for underpants hey  we wont stop till we have underpants  yumtumyummyyumhey
will my satyros wife accept if i want to spend some sober time with her
  well does she need to be sober because no matter how long she goes without alcohol shell be drunk on love
  no because she is a drunk much like those annoying people who identify as a stoner because epic weed and beer
  monster girl hate crimes  danuki that are mugged also have their legs shaven either to sell on the black market or for trophies  arachne homes are often vandalized with granular substances and shears  werecats are ambushed by thugs and are briefly beaten with various fruits
just reread ybas graystorm under a nostalgia attack i still somehow vividly remember reading that story from over three years ago looking back it upholds the bar set by original impression too bad life in general since that time does not schedule dog a qt
  i will never write anything people will go back to years later  well thats not a feeling i was hoping for
  brandishing mountain dew at canines especially anubi  making salt circles around giant slugs  owning or using garlicy products anywhere in the vicinity of a vampire
get ready to fight and ignite the flames of romance
  owning or using garlicy products anywhere in the vicinity of a vampire  you see she would enjoying it  build doors on all of her manors windows/doors/exits
  shed take her own life to be with you in the afterlife  yea no thanks
  werecats  assault with a cucumber
  fight with passion
what monsters make the best sukeban
  shed enjoy it but it would make her look bad ahegaoing isnt noble or femdom
there is any kind of wiki or site with a list dedicated to cataloguing monster girls from multiple media
  your wife doesnt ahegao while in control
straight horns or curved horns
    horns are okay but i prefer tails still its a respectable fetish
i for one support vampire domination over this continent they will set things straight
  im really not into biting
  i want multi type b fashion horns
  depends on the girl i generally prefer curved but straight has its niche
playing ffta2  finally start using gria race  starts using only gria and viera for the rest of the entire game  i aways end up doing that if any game that allows me to play only using monstergirls it is exactally what i end up doing  i arent the only one who does it right
  they will bring in other undead though an empire of undeath
  agreedfor that reason i insist we must expand the vampire population
    i do it too but it helps that viera red mages are broken as fuck assassins were broken in the first one too
  kidnapping human girls for them to turn
  i am not gay
  hehe expand      seems like theyd prefer to hunt their own prey no although i suppose letting their husband do that has its own appeal
  any issue with the word expand
second vellu pic is finished and with that the second meolucky set is done     
  thats a fetish
  sleepy maus
    thats both adorable and fucking lewd good shit
  how did peter parker get into the shinrabansho universe
  id take a zombie and wight her for sure
  it looks like she has sealed herself
  thats fine as long as you are loyal to the new order
  quite the opposite i was reminded of a kiss shot age progression webm that tickled my fetishes
  id be loyal to anybody who supplied me an eternally loving wife and decent status in a gloomy place
  very nice
  how loyal
  good vampires will lead humanity to a better future
how would a manlet fair in mge universe  what monster would be the best match for one
  mg shitposting on 4mon about that they will never have a bf who will make them winter clothes  also god damn is that monoeye cute
  its all fun and games until the monsters mistake him for a little boy and decide to treat him like that
  lamia
  doesnt sound so bad
  i just want to go where there are tall and beeg girls
  you wanna suace a brother
  a dwarf
  neither can reach the top shelf  try again
  snoozer mouse is cute
  suace
i heard you were talking shit about how lewd and stupid us knifeears were roundy
two wild foxes appeared
  yes please
  saucenao nigger use it
  yes i was  wheres the lie
    they dont look so wild to me i can take em bare knuckle prison rules
  i would never say something like that about dark elves i swear
  id dress up and go out with the hope of discovering any resistance and report them
  if you stack enough dwarfs on top of each other they can reach the top shelf thats what teamwork is all about
  damn zankuro and his artstyle  always makes me to revisit ecm collection
  sweet which one wants cubs
  all of them
  they all do its just a fight to see who gets you first
    is that adult froppy as a mucus toad shes lovely
  dwarf  not engineering a shelf that lowers itself at the push of a button  not living in a home with top shelves she can reach  bzzt
  youve failed to take into account the idea that she might keep overly tall shelves as an excuse to ogle her husbands ass as he gets things off them
  looks like it
  why is the image mirrored
  in which case neither of you being able to reach the top shelf is a good thing and still a nonissue sasuga dwarves engineering at its finest
    big monster girls go great with small husbands
no mg to smoke cigar with  im sad
  i thought that was female pinocchio for a second
    i welcome my future
  why are they crying
  i agree i wish i had a big monster wife
  big soft monster girls
tfw you get 2 ass 2 eat
  thingken of dicks      if only i had an mg waifu to shitpost with
  can reach the top shelf  can also pick you up  can also protect you   only trade off is shes fat  i guess its an acceptable compromise all things considered
  you probably do
  thick tails are the best
   trade off is shes fat  wow rude and false
  thats very big good
  wrapping her thick tail around the back of your head to push you closer while you moisten her crevices with your tongue  its okay i didnt need to breathe anytime soon
  if only _
what happens if you inject manticore venom directly into a little alices nipples and clit
  she would get scared and start crying
  my ween becomes the big ween
  big hugs
  furthermore in a cruel twist this venom doesnt influence the mind anywhere near as much as it influences the body this lewd venom has the effects of causing a mans body to produce huge amounts of semen and spurring ejaculation     who knows if it even works on women/monsters it seems pretty male oriented
  big fugs
  jabberwoky is fat fat so is papillon
i had a bunch of commission of my waifu finish and i think they all turned out super great  
tfw no gentle femdom hellhound waifu      those are super cute
  gentle
  on the internet no one know youre a kiki
  gentle femdom is the best
  wuoaahhh  fishie
  why is it that women like that
  meryl come here
  because mge
  i want a demon to reward me for my loyalty to the demon cult and the cause
  no anon you are the deamons
  and then anon was a zombie
reminder that mofu sluts anonymous is a lure to trap people
  but im not stuck with them theyre stuck with me
    liz has the weirdest horns ive ever seen
i want to feed loli vampires
  if you think women arent capable of being as perverted or more than any guy youve been isolating yourself for too long
  i am no demon i serve the demons
  reading is lit  im ashamed of myself for laughing at this one
  im only subscribed to the daily mofu those snuggle scouts selling magazines door to door had a good deal
boner fuel acquired
  shes just trying to stay hip and keep all the anupups interested in reading
  not nearly chuuni enough shit demon lord
why are monstergirls so bad at eating yogurt
  saki is the best zombie    i would like to pet this creature
  good man
  vulkan no
  thats just a demon
  but if shes my queen doesnt she become a demon queen
  this is the closest image we have to what the demon lord looks like    
  demon duchess      longhaired mommy succ  the best
  slap on extra wings   bigger horns  woooow so fuckin edgy if she wasnt giving everyone free monster puss shed have been impeached  notmydemonlord
  impeached  but she is the senate
  i wonder if lilith looks like the lilim or if she looks like what succubi from the previous era looked like maybe she has two forms spooky demon lord and cute mommy lilim
  wow dude that is some blasphemy
  rules of oniichan plays in distance
  she definitely has mental fuckery powers
  1 i wish for immortality  2 i wish that every man not including myself who has ever harbored the intention of dating an mg to find their perfect waifu  3 i wish to watch the most beautiful sunset imaginable satisfied in knowing i did the right thing
irl cats and snakes are assholes  mge cats and snakes are super affectionate   im not complaining but someone explain
  i dont recall kc saying that succubi looked different in the era of the old demon lords
  i hope he doesnt take away dolphins pnsion for rape and make them just playful i want a viscious rape dolphin
  playing the long game i see waiting for those daughterus
  snakes are assholes  9/10 the snake only attacks you because you are considered a threat or are in its territory constrictors are actually pretty affectionate not to the level wed expect of canine symbiosis sure but they do appreciate food and warmth    crocodiles though those are the real assholes
  viscious
  arent crocs just really fucking dumb
  crocs are assholes  tell that to the guy whos best friend was a croc madman went swimming with the fucker for twenty years and never got chomped
  theres speculation pocho had been partially lobotomized      they are kind of on the dumbass side yes but theyve also been nearly unchanged for millions of years so i guess its all a matter of not fixing what isnt broken
  what is this face trying to convey
  saki is the best zombie  i agree
how do power struggles/competitions between monstergirls get solved both political and personal
  tit press   whichever one can better leverage and often bigger bust wins
  sexual domination  at least in the wild
  delinquent girls are the best girls
  they duke it out if they are low rank ones
  coming across a hellhound thats just recently been defeated by another hellhound for territory sounds hot maybe even try to dom her till she regains composure and doms me back
  i would pump her so full of my seed that she will turn into a wight after im done with her
  she washes herself with a rag on that stick
  isnt she already technically a wight
  
  i think it depends on the cat my two are pretty damn affectionate hell the oldest one likes to ride on my shoulders while im doing housework and continuously nuzzles my cheek in the process the other will forcibly grab my hand with a paw and pull it back if i stop scratching her head
  falling for the trap  you fool what if the dominant one left her victim as bait to draw out a human you could be in the middle of pounding a tired and vacant eyed hellhound when the alpha bitch pounces from her hiding place
  for hellhound vs hellhound its probably a mix of this  and 
  saki as a wight well i wonder if drawfags could deliver on this
  normally i dont like harems but that scenario seems even better than what i imagined
we really do need a western setting in the world i want to be a dastardly cowboy getting by on bounties and hunting getting into gunfights with gangs of girls trying to take me prisoner obviously the bullets are made of demon silver or even more ridiculously shoot bullets made of se
  i meant specifically the man ass surely theres better parts to enjoy right
  everyone loves ass  women really love a mans ass though its surprisingly common to get slapped/groped if you have a nice one
  shoot bullets made of se  demon makes joke about bounty hunter being a quickshot
  oh dear mge trains must be very dangerous then
  can confirm this happened twice during highschool and another two times when working in retail  monster girls would be all over a guys butt with their paws
  maybe their are three types of train one for mamano one for couples and one for men woe the man who make the mistake of taking the mamano train
  if paws go on butt  what go inside
  business anon wanders into the the horny school girl cart  the shaking alone was almost enough to derail the train
  your head in your own ass apparently go back wherever you crawled out from
i want to have sex with almost all the monsters which monster would be the most difficult to find and agree to fuck
  baphomet dragon echidna lilim or any of the powerhouses
  that right there is my place of worship
  speaking of power levels doesnt fucking monsters make them stronger could you fuck them until they go super sayain
  maybe if you do it for centuries
  imagine being a boy dared to go on the monster train
  that train is full of cc monstergirls for some reason
  even if one reaches his limit as a human being through effort and talent his power will never exceed that of greater monsters and gods who possess high abilities far beyond human limitations but those who become heroes and incubi are able to possess even more mana through continuous training they can not only acquire power surpassing that of monsters but even that of gods  incubi can become as powerful as gods as well as some breeds like 9 tailed inari and youko
  i wish for jinko waifu  i wish for daughters and sons human  i wish for genie to go free
8c     who called the ice queen a shit again
  okay so you can literally just fuck a snake until you mazinger z and surpass god and the devil okay     shit actually now i am mad there is no /m/onster girl someone tell kc or w/e to make a golem you can pilot with your dick
  gentle for a hellhound or really gentle
  automaton
i want to watch the annual rapetag game at the local elementary school
  she probably headpats you after raping you until you pass out
  me
  anon what the hell is rape tag
  if all you do is fuck you just become a god of sex becoming an incubi removes all limits but you still need to train in whatever you want to become good at
i sure do love manticores
  automaton  pilot
  mamono mana is pretty much spiral energy and the chief god is basically the antispirals
  thats where a bunch of little monsters chase a slightly smaller or equally sized bunch of little human boys around in a field all of the monsters are it and when a human boy gets caught the girl who catches him gets to rape him
  also me
  given how much more chaotic it is demonic energy seems more like getter rays
  id be careful with that too much getter rays isbad
  if youre a coward
  automaton that can be weared as a mechanized suit of armor  i want it
  
  well the catch is  its not anywhere close to instant gratification it takes a long long time to gather power people seem to think that no limits means i can have anything i want but thats not the case the dl is gathering power faster than anyone else for a good thousand years and theres still a lot she cant do yet   its not like the power is free either it takes a shitload of effort and dedication to gain power and you only gain ability in the area you train in wg3 makes it very clear that you have to actually combat train to hell and back to gain superhuman combat prowess just abusing the fuck cycle makes you good at being sexy but it wont make you any better at swinging a sword than a clueless peasant
  im a /m/an and i dont want a bunch of super robots shitting up the place
  a better way to put it is that becoming an incubus removes the level cap but does not give a bonus in experience gain if the max level a human can get to is 100 and takes decades of dedication getting to level 100k with the same experience gain rate is gonna be absolute living hell not the best example but it gets the point across
  a nerdy crow tengu really concerned about the distinction between super robot and real robot a cc haku telling her to stop wasting time on frivolous things and focus on her studies and under her breath mutters that the distinction is artificial
  mechanized
  tfw no living armor gf who would protect you from the harsh realities of every day life    why even live
  pretty much sums it up
  yeah i would settle with just becoming a really good knight or something
  there is literally no downside to this its broken as fuck
  ice queen is a big cuddlebug and a cutie pie
  blushing armor clinking noises
  that she is her regal appearance on formal days may be impressive but its her laid back snugglebug attitude on free days that will warm your heart
  wheres that gargoyle pic latenight did when i need it   late but here
  its ideal if you want to be energy drained every single day
  i prefer here
  it tastes great too      that looks comfy but my heart and soul belongs to the demons
  what happens if you take a gargoyle to a polar region where they get 12 hours of sun
  this is what causes a satyros to go full on mafia mode
  satyros bootleggers
  instead of shoes that leave hoof prints to shake the popo they wear horseshoes that leave shoe prints
  
  unlabeled bottles of wine with special ingredients the goat mafia is scary
  you getting cute with me anon  where is my fucking liquor you prick
beware a vampires hypnotic abilities
  she cant hypnotize me if i keep looking into her blood sacks
  i want my mistresss red eyes to ease me into a comfy sleep in her embrace
quick sketch of the wife in her wedding dress came in
  what a cutie pie
  thats a meaty mouse
  how pissed does a genie get if a girl finds the lamp
  i smell a sitcom
    
  beat it sister this aint a charity
  such a classic im sure geniechan would appreciate it
  baphomets are easy to agree to fuck according to the profile theyre pump and dumps     lilims dragons and echidnas definitely are hard to find and fuck same goes with pharaohs since you have to sneak through the ruins without a mummy anubis or sphinx finding you first
  baphomets are easy to agree to fuck according to the profile theyre pump and dumps  wtf i hate baphomets now
  this is the place for me
  i am just going keep preaching about the pharaohs greatness in a city until i get kidnapped by one of her undercover servants and get brought to her
  whatever wish she grants is going to come with the cost of instant monsterization
  i normally dont do this but i can give you a special arrangement to give you infinite power otherworldly beauty and even more  she leads her on a quest to find an empty lamp  she uses her magic to turn the girl into another genie
  dont they need to be awakened by a man entering her resting place  just cover yourself up with butter head to toe and run in and make a bee line for the royal chamber even if they grab you you can slip away also youll be primed for some slippery and tasty sex the first time with your new pharaoh wife
  dont they need to be awakened by a man entering her resting place    not if she is the daughter of some long ago awoken pharaoh i guess
  i wonder what happens to pharaoh daughters that dont end up inheriting their mothers kingdoms do they go out into the world and declare themselves queen of the beach does a suburban husband build a giant sandbox in his backyard so his pharaoh wife can feel more like a real ruler in between regular domestic life
  what if another monster girl finds the lamp
  there is some material covering this iirc
  they find a guy together
  thats the mge dragon doujin right source please

  femalelizard girl
  homebrew characters/ocs    
dont forget
  
    what manga was this one traced from    also kinda hope picrelated is a recurring character
  is there any sight as wonderful as getting to see your maidwife cheerfully doing her chores
  why would i forget about monster butts  that the best part
  why does she have goat eyes on her breasts
  it might be a coin slot
  a coin slot  so shes a coinoperated succubot
  the sight of your vampire wife and kiki maidwife bonding over both being pregnant
  shes pregnant shes pregnant and youre pregnant too  unending baby shower
  vampire letting her husband breed with the commoner servants
  next time on maury  in a shocking plot development  the baby is actually hers
  how else will she know that her daughters are going to have servants of good breeding in the future
  what the fuck is this garbage
runya is such a cute and sleepy baphomet shed probably never hurt a fly     she shouldve been the one to meet mimil shed pat the loli and make her feel better
  wait what
  reminder if you are a lost and or scared shota please find the nearest monster girl they will show you the love you need and protect you
good night anons take care and dont burn down the thread     instead remember that some girls dont handle the cold all that well   slimes in particular dont like feeling more solid than they normally do
  you can stop now druella
  all those poor shogcicles on antartica
  what is this kdf shit
  shogs can make winter clothes from their slime  they cant replicate the warmness of the clothes just the look
  dont worry theyll just hang out in the savage lands
  dilute them with alcohol or add salt to lower their freezing point  a large colony of drunken shogs should be fine
  im sorry
  hundreds of grape puddles making postalcohol aaaaahhhh noises  hard but rewarding work
  but how much does it take to intoxicate a shoggoth
  depends how big they are i imagine   ywn have a xbox huge drunk shoggy yelling about the necronomicon and antartica being shit
  im gonna water that plant
  it seems to be based on that one viral image of an entire pig vacuum packed at a supermarket
  oh mastah it was ever so dark and lonely down there in the cold all my maid sisters were just as sad as i was and the only friends we could find were the snow birds  you mean like penguins  yes precisely six foot tall pure white and blind as mice the poor dears not much for conversation though  shogs can have a lot of interesting stories about the time before they met their masters but they dont like to talk about them for some reason
  isolation is enough to drive anything insane  next thing you know youll be serving drinks made from that prescription stuff you got from that dr west fellow
  isolation is enough to drive anything insane  now i need a shoggoth to tell me im not prepared
  the thing is that after baphomet will lure said guy she screwed back into a demon realm its less pump and dump and more the pied piper of hamlin had a vagina

the scenario of introducing your waifu to your family has been brought up but what would it be like to meet her family    do you know what her mom is like how many siblings would she have wouldnt the fatherinlaws basically just be overpowered anons
  i do not have the imagination for such things an entire clan of dragons are they even called clans
  i think theyre called oh shit theres more
  well in that case meeting my wifes oh shit theres more for christmas would likely be quite an occasion
i want to be kidnapped by a pack of hellhounds and be forced to breed with them until i have both a harem of hellhounds and a harem of heckpups
  i dont think too much about her family anon itd be neat if my daughteru had some cousins but itd feel a little weird to assign personalities to her parents or siblings especially if i actually end up meeting them one day
  dont dick the daughteru
  dragons christmas parties would be pretty exciting    superlavish feasts  stocking stuffers worth small fortunes  land deeds companies and titles are exchanged  firebreathing earthshattering reactions to big gifts  that one crazy weirdo zombie dragon in the family
  who said anything about dicking them  of course they wont take no for an answer
  dont mind aunt festerea
  ive never thought about her extended family much but after weve been together for many years she will split into three slightly different copies   she might have been created by an entirely different mamano who made her with magic a lilim or something
  her mother would be the standard for the race but obviously milfier a father who was a former solider and one sister
  i mean calling something a harem usually implies giving out dickings
  this is bullying
  my wife was adopted by a nice old white horn so she doesnt know any of her family or if she even has any works fine for me since i only really talk to my grandfather it makes the holidays much simpler
  i dont understand what shes implying
  id be kinda terrified of seeing my houris mother i dont know if she would see me as good enough for her
  huge freakishly strong christmas cake zombie dragon aunt  manages to be tsundere deredere and yan as fuck all at the same time  wears huge cokebottle glasses even though she can see just fine  talks like shes from another planet and rambles about highminded philosophical concepts for long stretches without breathing  hands postcards to everyone with pictures of her eight dogs on them    crazy auntie festerea needs to get laid bigtime
  im sure a houri would be able to sense the bond you two have
  the penguins its an at the mountains of madness reference
  is she a shog are you sure she wont just drag you into the abyss to meet cthulhu and the eldritch brady bunch
  if she didnt smell like rotting flesh and took a bath once in awhile im sure some chuuni dark knight wannabe would at least mount her
  you will never outdo your fellow death knights by rocking up with a dragon zombie as your mount
  why does this retarded comic get a chuckle from me every time i see it
  huh cool so are shoggoths supposed to represent the black help gaining independence and ruining society knowing lovecraft thats the impression im getting  more importantly does that mean my shog meido could act like a southern maid
puppy tummies are best nap pillows
    gentle femdom is for dudes too weak for real femdom
elder thing mg when and how would she interact with shogs since in lovecraft canon they created the shogs
  shoggs getting pissed at elder things and throwing a tantrum
  having a witch waifu i would assume the mom would be a loli too personality would either be lolibaba or just as childish as her appearance maybe alternating between the two as the situation calls maybe also a sister that didnt choose to join the sabbath family gatherings would look like a grade school field trip with that one sister looking like the teacher trying to herd her siblings aunts and cousins
  shed be like a doting mom in a really weird incomprehensible way like shes super nice and all but when she touches you or looks at you you feel like your skin is going to explode off of your skeleton in a way thats somehow pleasant    half the words shed say are just white noise and random errata and her form wavers slightly every time you blink or move your eyes like a mandelbrot pattern going to have tea with mom would cause ongoing sanity damage if you didnt bring your psi blockers
  i like the idea of having an ancient shoggoth as a meido shes got millennias worth of stories and knowledge but she never speaks about it unless asked by mastah and only mastah shes borderline insane or perhaps entirely insane its hard to tell especially when he mere presence is a constant drain on your own sanity points     are you mad am i why do the walls have eyes and mouths you ask its perfectly normal of course why are you asking the hallway is that way dear whats that its the master bedroom interesting i could have sworn that was the hallway to the kitchen where are we in the kitchen silly youre wet from what slime howd slime get your shoe look around youre in a house of shoggoth those eerie ungodly noises its nothing just ignore it the room is shaking even spinning you say goodness mastah youre a silly one today youre getting all worked up over the toilet on ceiling whys there toilet in the kitchen silly mastah this is the study you were reading that tome of forbidden knowledge i gave you as a birthday present tentacle i assure you im merely a shoggoth no plant matter anywhere inside me well living plant matter that is that pesky rat in the basement well he didnt last long encased in me delicious treat you should know i keep the place nice and clean slime you say look around mastah i dont leave slime anywhere in your shoe silly mastah i think youre imagining things just join me in bed and ill make things all better for you the study mastah weve been in your bedroom this entire time watching tv come with me lemme clean you and your mind of these silly thoughts and feelings ill give you a pleasurable eternity thatll youll never forget well maybe if you dont go reading those tomes of forbidden knowledge again if you do ill just give you another pleasurable eternity that youll never forget my ever so silly mastah
  so dont read her books got it
marune runs an oppai loli sabbath because they all eat nutritious produce that makes their breasts grow  can you come up with a good reason why a baphomet would run a bottomheavy pear shaped sabbath
  theres a certain romanticism unique to shoggoths and eldritch girls the idea of an ancient nearomnipotent being looking for a simple weak mortal to spend a span of time with is really beautiful to me one of our lifetimes is nothing to them but she still wants to see what you do in a day    you couldnt tell her anything she doesnt already know you couldnt really help her with anything you couldnt even surprise her with a thoughtful gift or compliment and yet she still finds you fascinating she still wants to observe you and serve you all while restraining herself so she doesnt hurt you or cause you to change    she likes you because youre constant you change slowly at a controlled pace you live by rules and are strictly restrained compared to her she just wants to observe and see you do whatever you do because youre you you couldnt possibly have anything she wants she just likes you how pure can you get
  an offshoot sabbath of marunes that is less focused on the agriculture and more on straight culinary marune has a hoe for a scythe the culinary sabbath bapho has a big elaborately designed spoon their confections cause significant bottom heaviness
  the idea of an ancient nearomnipotent being looking for a simple weak mortal to spend a span of time with is really beautiful to me    isnt that a majority of monster girl stories though
  well golly gee i guess i just like monster girls then whoda thunk it    i dunno theres just such a huge gulf in perspective and relatability with eldritch girls compared with your average kemomimi the fact that something so infinitely complex and superior could want something so simple from a human seems really sweet most monster girls are similar enough to humans that they could converse normally but shogs are really out there
      now that i think about it how many stories are there that involve monsters that are generally seen as weaker than humans
feis fattiddies demon lord hero elf queen was just translated save for the last chapter
  shoggoth hoarding rare tomes of forbidden and ancient knowledge   lich constantly inquires about borrowing and even buying these coveted tomes  sends numerous requests to mastahs address  letters come in everyday from her to the point that its spam mail  god forbid she get a hold of your cellphone number or email address
  fine day sunday why is that shoggy
victory moo
  mail isnt delivered on sunday thats probably why gonna need to tell your shoggoth to start destroying the mail from the persistent lich in town
  maybe she already absorbs her letters and other mail as well mastah doesnt need to read any unnecessary texts especially those boring ones were letters are in order and dont move around
  she is a dark slime but thats close to a shog in a way and i bet shed look cute in a maid uniform
  wouldnt that be kind of depressing monsters need the strength to overpower humans for reproduction    on the other hand you would have monsters roaming in packs to take out a single human at a time which would mean theres a lot of sharing/group sex    it would make me feel bad if and when the humans did the raping for sure
  do ant or bee girls form couples with their men  or does one become a queen by finding a mate
  those are some perky tits for a humble worker
  i want to supply and ant/bee colony with holst milk
  honey bees only keep the man if the queen isnt interested in him    ants become queens when someone fugs them enough times but i think they keep the men who follow them home in their nest for sweaty postwork sex
    i wonder if kc will make an entry for ant/bee queens
get creative the weekend is perfect for that so you better come up with ideas now
  stop shilling youtube shit
christmasobsessed yeti waifu  decorations are up as soon as the thanksgiving leftovers are in the fridge  has twentyfive festive sweaters to wear as she counts down the days  humming christmas songs and swaying her hips to the rhythm as she works on other christmas decorum  doublesized batches of her special gingerbread cookies the secret ingredient is love also about a tablespoon of orange juice
  push her
  gently for speed
  why should he
  i need a study fairy to motivate me to finish my reports
remember your kikimora maid isnt leglocking you like her life depends on it because shes baby crazy and desperate for your seed she just doesnt want to make a mess definitely no ulterior motive
  reminder that christmas tree dryads are likely and suprisingly powerful    the trees that the pagan festival use to be located around were often directly related to their most powerful gods and were given a large bounty of offerings and charms to ward off evil and bring in good luck got so much love from the community that the christians couldnt even phase them out entirely and had to adopt them into their own tradition    i wouldnt fuck with a yule dryad
  youll know them by the ancient chant padoru padoru
    its finally done
  christmasobsessed  hard pass its bad enough as it is
  the mad man actually did it
      8 bit sprite style  not using 8 bit color palette restrictions    authenticity man
  ill admit to having a similar sentiment but holidays are made better depending on the people you spend it with having a kid makes them exponentially better few things compare to seeing them ecstatic and happy
  for some reason that sounds pretty bad but if it was a white horn id be okay with it
  she would be cutest dragon
  christmas yeti always wants to cuddle in front of the fireplace with her long shareable scarves
would you marry an extremely experienced mg prostitute if she stopped work once married
  i hired an escort to watch madoka with me once i cant see myself sleeping with one even if no money changed hands
  depends on her personality and race
  i hired an escort to watch madoka with me once  story time      what type of personality and race
  really gets your noggin a shoggin
  mg prostitute  extremely experienced  id sooner start questioning why none of the guys shes been with decided to stick around despite her being an mg
  no
  no
  no i the only person i would ever sleep with is my waifu and she wouldnt be a prostitute
  white horn waifu would wear red and white clothes instead of her normal blue and drape a net of colored lights over her back you can see her coming from a mile out on a dark winters night
  they were all from /d/
  a prostitute isnt a girlfriend anon
  sure id probably have slept with a lot of monster girls before if it was like that
would older succubi be less popular
  she is for the night then i can go back to being my lonesome self
  christmas lights white horn carrying the little wendi with christmas lights and ornaments on her cape would be a spectacle to see
  if this thread has taught anything shell have suitors left and right
  if anything theyd be more popular
  i want druella to enslave me
  casuals not enjoying horns on all shapes and numbers
tfw no kejourou girl to hire to paint my fence
  was i too forward
  pretty soon well have young succubi trying to emulate christmas cakes to be more appealing
  i trust succubi as far as i can throw them    theyre devious little tricksters
when papa wendigo finds who was bullying his daughters  
  honestly no the only people who should marry them are the ones who also slept with a lot of monstergirls without care or the ones with a healing fetish i guess
  id marry a mg with experience but not one who was a prostitute
  ill take number 1 and number 9 thanks
  there will always be someone fool enough to play captain saveaho and its not going to be me
  9  not 5 or 7
  8 weird that i want the most normal looking one
  why not
  it could be
  all but 3 are good shes a bit too furry 2 6 7 and 9 are best not in that order
  doesnt it make more sense to marry a monstergirl who had to sell herself to survive than one who just did it for the sake of it
  i would all of them including 3 shes cute and as long as the follows the monster rules shes fine
  to each their own anon shes just a muzzle away from being 100 furry and i dont want fuzzy tatas
which sabbath baphomet would be the easiest to beat and seduce into being a good little sister
  i hope you arent implying they wouldnt all be good little sisters by default i want to sit runya in my lap and brush her hair while she drifts in and out of sleep
  i want to have a completely nonsexual brother/sister relationship with a sabbath leader
  then dont be surprised if she gets someone else to blast her womb full
  thats a dangerous game to play can you imagine the stuff shed do to try and change your mind about that  shed start in the morning by slipping into your bed and cuddling up to you before you wake up then would come her making you breakfast but after setting down your plate and turning around youll see bare back and ass from her wearing nothing but the apron little tail beating back and forth to draw your eyes later shell offer to wash clothes but shell make sure that you see her taking deep whiffs of the crotch of your underwear for lunch shell mention how she found a great deal on mushrooms before serving you a salad that has more raging mushrooms that actual lettuce shell be persistant about wanting to take a bath with you in the evening under the pretext of helping wash her back and her hair so that she doesnt get soap in her eyes before bed shell say she wants to watch a movie with you that ends up being sabbath brand loli porn are you sure youll be able to survive your attempts at a platonic relationship with a baphomet little sister
  so why the fuck would i care if my sister fucks someone else      the fact that im already taken puts that one on ice
  the fact that im already taken puts that one on ice  harem route anon
  no
  that looks gross
  imotou harem is best harem
  saying no to not just a baphoment but a sabbath branch leader  im sure ones like kuro would find that cute
  what are they going to do stop me from loving my demonfu so id love her itd break her heart  the relationship stays platonic
  what are they going to do stop me from loving my demonfu so id love her  of course not theyd just convince your waifu to let them join in so they could both tag team you
  if a monster feels so strongly about a man that her instinct has recognized the man as her husband and shes already begun to change into a female exclusively for him then theres no way shes going to be able to ignore her intense desire merely because of something like an implicit understanding shell give in to the urge assault the man and fuck him after that the monsters who share a husband will end up living together cooperating at times to milk energy from the man and at other times fighting over who gets to have sex with him longer and more often once this happens to a man hell have to catch all the desire of multiple lascivious monsters with his one body hell end up having to keep offering them large amounts of mana every day switching off or perhaps doing all of them at the same time
    im a one woman sort of man anon nothing can change that
  one question if you have a demon waifu why would you keep the little rugrat around if she just wants to get in your pants shes not getting dicked and youre getting annoyed so it would be better for everyone if she left
  face it anon saying youre the monagamous sort isnt going to deter one of the strongest species of monstergirl and unless your waifu is a unicorn or shirohebi shed probably be open to sharing you your only hope would be to introduce the bapho to someone she feels more strongly about than you to pursue
  youre a wo 
i want to only use a baphomets mouth never her pussy just to get her frustrated that i wont use whats supposed to be the best vagina of them all
  youre assuming the relationship isnt platonic on both sides anon a fatal mistake      that was the idea yes
  i mean if you enjoy having your balls curb stomped while being pegged then more power to you
  cant you have gentle pegging
  thats going to get you level drained until theres nothing left
  gonna milk that hound
  for whatever reason that made me just imagine a lilim with a fetish for helping her husband grind up the to the level cap and then level draining him back to level 1  imagine a blowjob that only stops once all your levels are drained
  are you ready to hear her moan as you coax her milk out of her titanic tits   are you prepared to fuck her doggystyle while you do it
  imotou harem is best harem  i want a loli wight demon and dark mage three pearshaped little seductresses would be fun in more than one way
  you know it   gonna encourage she love her bust      so long as theyve got the booty it looks good
the best harem  a baphomet little sister  a demon big sister   an echidna mother   an alp brother   im not serious with the last one 
  ywn have a waifu peg like shes trying to put a baby in you      thats a long succ
how would you convince adults that your schools nurse is a powerful undead lich when they dont believe you
  how could i convince them when i dont believe it myself
  she is the only one who sees them as a married couple  meanwhile the husband sees her as the big bad end boss instead of as a wife    this is what happens when a lilim falls in love with some kid living in an order town
    keep your shitposts in /lgbt/
  sneak into her house to get proof what could go wrong
  thats a cute lich
  you ever played little nightmares
  sucks to her then dont it
  big brother   platonic  silly anon big brother is simply the sabbath word for husband
  not now i need to figure out how to handle my roommate im beginning to suspect shes not a regular human girl
  or master if youre in the good sabbath
  shell be out of her house for a school meeting
  when they dont believe you
  anon keeps grinding up his levels to fight her time and again  she keeps just opening with her blowjob heaven move and draining him down to level 1  every time he passes out seeing her practically ahegaoing with a mouthful of his cum  what he doesnt get is that the trick is to fuck her before she can blow him then after hes finished inside shes his actual wife
  why are lolicons so pushy with their shit fetish
  smart man
  what tipped you off anon was it the shark teeth the knife ears the tail or the constant morning wood titfucks
  what a devious succubus waiting for a boy to start going through puberty while subtly making sure that no girl could ever measure up to her for him
how are office ladies so good
  implying the other groups like the onee/mommy/shota fags arent just as pushy
    sneak into lich nurses house  everything seems normal until you find the basement  go inside to see all sorts of strange symbols on the walls very old looking books and stange potions bubbling in vials  you then notice a head inside a jar  it turns to look at you its a middle aged man with a pipe in his mouth got the stereotypical 50s dad look  hey there pal hows school  so shocked you dont know what to say  oh right the jar im in what can i say my daughters a wiz with all that black magic hoohah gets it from her mother you see decided she was gonna keep me around after that little car accident i had  you hear the front door start to open  you better head on home little guy dont want her catching you down here do you  quickly squeeze through a small window at the top and run home to tell someone
  tfw you will never give ropu belly rubs
  keeps waking up in his starting town after he fails
  no it was all the underwear she leaves lying around our room no human has a natural bra size that big
i want a true loli unicorn that joined the momonika sabbath and dresses like a slutty jc bitch
  thatd be jarring just imagine going from the titfuck/blowjob scene from kyonyuu fantasy and then waking up in an inn in the starter town feeling as weak as when you began  shell keep putting you back there until you love her too anon and you cant get out by going for another monster because shes marked you
  at least the adventure is different every time though you always seem to meet the same mysterious woman that helps you out from time to time
  you know sir anon i hear the lilim in charge of this realm has the tightest pussy you could imagine  what was that  i said her castle has tight defenses you might want to use this secret entrance i found  when that boy finally figures it out and makes an honest woman out of that cute lilim shes going to cuddle him for weeks
  plottwist actual villainy and bad guys gets introduced in one of his runs and the boy hero has to team up with the lilim for real
  whats going on here
horny
  look at my friend i drew  aww he has an imaginary friend  they didnt believe you were real for some reason  ufufufu  it aint that hard anon
  it turns out powerful monstergirls level like disgaea characters instead of having the standard level cap of 100  every time the lilim level drains anon shes adding 99 levels to herself  hell hath no fury like a level 2080 lilim who just found some bitches who were hurting the humans in her realm and trying to steal her claimed husband  for the record she started at level 100
  based
  no shortstack tanuki boss with a fat ass to sexually harass you into becoming her private sex toy  shell never make you sit at her desk and manage her emails while she deepthroats you for hours
  i was thinking of human villains but that is fine too
  not having her milk your dick as she uses you as a seat till her womb is overstuffed
  shes got you from 9 to 5 every day anon theres time for lots of different positions
  
  this part is important
  important part of my job
  poor kid
  get a great succ caretaker and comfy cuddle sleeps  poor kid
any of them have a mating dance
  so long as the other girls start making comments about her habits im ok with that
  of course it would all be just an act once you start approching her the facade drops and she gets fidgety and flustered
  nobody believes him when he tells them how lucky he is
  what i dont get is that no one has made the connection between his imaginary friend and a succubus
  when they express the most desire and fondness of all by moving using their whole body it appears as if theyre dancing and is called a courtship dance the cancers pincers make a brisk rhythm bubbles of demonic energy float around and in the midst of the bubbles they dance shaking their body intensely and alluringly men find the spectacle irresistible and those charmed by this dance will end up getting showered in the demonic energy of bursting bubbles during the dance and their heart will be completely stolen by the unusual dancer
  if nothing else shes gonna start getting high fives from the other monstergirl workers
  for  it to be a goosebumps story you have to tell adults who dont believe you and sneak back to get evidence so you get caught
  cute
  so long as theyve got the booty it looks good  think of all three having similar bodies to navs wight the optimal bodytype for stuffing loli wombs and creampieing young monstergirl anuses
what would be some survival tips for surviving monstergirl middle school as a guy
  finally some fucking genie fan art
  start homeschooling
  ive had ideas for an elder thing for a while now but im too burned out to attempt it
  get under the protection of the teachers a group of delinquents etc
whats the most complicated device a shoggoth could form    could she turn into something like a car or a plane if she had enough practice
  i mean being under the local delinquent gangs protection probably wont help you  that just means that theyd hide you under their skirts  just imagine it anon a bunch of hellhounds kakuen cheshires and oni all making you their slut
  i really want to be raped in the coed bathrooms by a hellhound or manticore
  just use the t1000 rules
  i see them as ojous that make men their servants
  wheres her leaf
  you asked how to survive not how to survive pure
  why not both   of course theyre gonna have to play rock paper scissors to decide which one has to ride your face and which one gets your dick
im surprised kc hasnt done a wonderland version of the dullhan yet considering how fond the og queen of hearts was of cutting off heads
  i want to see an ushi mating dance
  the problem is that kc isnt following lovecrafts lore that heavily shogs are from the bottom of the oceans not antarctica and the monsters of the chaos sound more like super chaos slimes that can fully merge with their husbands than elder things
  the childhood friends most kids come up with can be fucking terrifying
  learn to defend yourself with some magic and fighting
  assume submmisve pose
  cute
  pretend to have a girlfriend i dont see how you cant go wrong if you lied your way through middle school for the sake of be unharmed
  can
  monsters can sense when a man is strongly stained with demonic energy or a monsters scent and they can tell that that man is a monsters husband and whose husband he is  yeah im pretty sure thatll work out well
  i want a tubby demon loli and a fit familiar
  i have a girlfriend  nno you dont know her shes uhh canadian
  i dont need it i dont need it
  i want to be fought over between a runya sabbath witch and rata  witch tugs one arm  sensei has to finish writing his manuscript with me  rata tugs the other arm  no niisan has to go out and do interviews with me
loli monsters are not for sex
  canadian
  that is where you are incorrect
  i agree they should grow up to be pure monster waifus
  youre right theyre for furious breeding
  or a maple tree ent that supplies you with lots of gooey fresh maple syrup for your breakfast yum
  well that cant be right
  some of mastahs organs are quite complex
  canadian monster girls are the best
i want to make a familiar clean my old crusty cum rags with her mouth
  i often imagine a shog who becomes a queen shog could create a whole mansion and staff it with cute meidos   same principal for a shog pirate ship shog tank crew and shog intercontinental railroad
  this would be concerning to hear shoggy say
  shog intercontinental railroad  thats a nice idea passenger trains and their attendants and conductors are underrated and underutilised
  ill have you know that dr shog is a licensed doctor
  licenses from other planets arent valid
  oni drew shog tiddies and i had no idea she looks so happy
  they would be a mix between feral wolfus that havent left the forest like her mother semicivilized hounds that patrolled the forest of a small town before moving in with their husband and rare cityslicker alley wolfs family get togethers are camping trips    the men in the family would just be a variety of normal dudes hunted down by wolfus
  dr shog is a proud alumna of the grelia medical academy
        all i can imagine now is a shog with dr zoidbergs knowledge of human anatomy    heres the problem mastah you only have one heart  uh all humans only have one heart  silly mastah everyone knows you need redundant organs of course well never break your heart mastah but well put in another just to be safe
  cute cute cute
  it was quite the trial getting her to accept her masters degree
  they are for tender anal
  it makes me think of something similar    mastah kiki informed me that your love for us comes from the heart  this heart is a pulsating organ located within your chest yes  will you let me see it mastah i wish to return affection to it    all said with the most innocent and sincere of smiles and expressions
  
an ancient evil awakens
  shoggy and kiki are just too cute and lovely we have no right coming up with such wholesomeness
  your loyal meidos dont care about right and wrong only about loving and being loved by their dearest mastah
  tender and slow
  is it ok to have a jinko maid
  so perfect cuddling/makeout sessions on the couch with both of them at once would definitely be next in order
  source  nothings coming up
  yes
  
  watching over them as kiki teaches shoggy maid work would be adorable imagine being woken up gently every morning by getting a kiss on each cheek one side from shoggy and the other from kiki
  maids are olev be they furred scaled or otherwise
this is your senpai for today
would you marry a permanent sabbath fusion
  when the headpatted becomes the headpatter
  indeed theres just something irresistibly cute and alluring about maid outfits fancy kimono and miko outfits
  i want my senpai to occupy my pants
  i dont care about the consequences i want to quickly run my hand underneath her shirt and fondle her fat cat tats
  i want to rub my hands on her tight tiger tummy
do any of you guys still have that dullahan edit from a few threads back

    headpats monkeys paw style
  empire loves their damn lists
which non cow monster would be the milkiest
  imperial warhorse centaurs pretending not to be interested in the rugged horse thief in the back of the cart
  imagine caring this much about a headpat picture
  jubjub gone completely grey from captivity and abuse  you better heal her back into pink
  imagine trying this hard to defend a spamming faggot that gets offended about a porn setting having porn in it
  now those are wings
  being that i actually talk to ace on a regular basis he just likes headpats as well as taking a q tip to cats in heat
  small time wings

  good to see youre still about friend
  but what if theyre tears of joy
  youre retarded
  what if it is their death that makes the monster girls cry
  gonna caress that tiger tummy every chance i get
  always try to get a reaction out of her by saying things like lets get married and i want no less that 20 daughters from you but it never works  when your bodyguard returns to her private quarters she masturbates furiously to the ideas you gave her throughout the day
  10/10 would lick tummy

  shush im sleepy  zombie harems are good for snuggling though
  some guy who makes tons of commissions of raijus getting headpatted
  yeah well lichsan has a fat butt especially in her holst form
  waaarm  waaaaarm   waaar  girls could you please keep it down    softer waaaarm
  now imagine that problem but with a zombie dragon who doesnt understand volume control
  its pretty easy to mock it i guess
  he also hates the idea of monstergirls having sex
wife doodles
  draw something you enjoy loen  like lala or something
  cute that artist is super good
  such a cute hoodie for a snek
  waaaaaaaaooooooooaaarrrrrrrmmmm  whole house rumbles and she thumps her tail against the bed loudly while burying her nose in your neck like an excited dog  hhoney please not too l  youre silenced by her tongue racing into your mouth with a delighted moan  huubaaand huuband goood
  simply the best doughragons
    so true such unrestrained love when a doughragon zombie wants to show love to hubby she just does no inhibitions or tact or any of that coy stuff just love love love for hubby
  married to gorgeous dragon zombie  over time she eventually learns that you like her tits and her ass learning is hard for her  now she just immediately presses either of them against you all the time when youre in the room   even tries to follow you around with them constantly touching you even if she has to shuffle weirdly to do so   smile and ask her what her silly self is doing  hubby like soft part  she beams like the sun as she wobbles her tits against your face as if its the most obvious thing in the world
  speaking of zombus  is the transition from zombie to wight instant or gradual  i wonder what a exzombie wights first coherent thought would be
  it would probably be i love husband
    what is a trap
  my goodness sweet husband is so warm wwait ohmygosh a thought
retard moe    i dont understand this desire
  a miserable pile of penile secrets
  it makes my heart and dick surge i dont have any concept of why imotou stuff is at all atttractive but accept and appreciate that others like it a lot
  something cute
  its a dude so its gay and not allowed here
what if the demon lord is not in control of the monsters look at this little bottle made with concentrated succubus love juices but not even lilims are certain of its existence or the extent of its power who has the most access to love juices in the entire setting     the so called traitor hero    think about it he broke the demon lord cycle by defeating the previous one and enthroning somebody on his place that was less interested on ruling and following the chief god and more interested in cummies his cummies     as father of any potential replacement he is first in line to groom all lilims into following her mother and her ideals and the demon army has changed tactics and command from a mongol horde structure to a real army    he is surreptitiously doing that which must be done to free humanity from the shackles of their god and the panacea is merely another one of his tools to advance what we would call a transhuman agenda
  he never asked for this
brown elves are the best elves    
  weird face  i do like tiny hats at jaunty angles
  yeah but whats a trap exactly
  note to self   do not open gelbooru links in public
  a guy who can convincingly pass as a girl next question
so anon its the weekend and the start of a new month last one left in the year too   how is the writing/drawing/commissioning coming along
  pretty good would service
  lots of commissions in the works like always hopefully more done soon rather than later i would like to keep writing more too but life has me busy hopefully i can do one or two nice things for christmas
  commissions have been pretty light lately the only one i have going right now is the kind i wouldnt post here as for writing i dont have any fresh ideas but if i did i might do a bit now that ive got the taste for it back a little
  i sent a pic of astolfo to a an artist as a reference and now i think he thinks im into traps
  drawing sex is hard
  theres only one person to blame for that and its not him
  i didnt know who astolfo was at the time
      this much denial    time for the weekend lgbtbbq
tfw no cuddly loli  duckling harpy with fuzzy yellow wings in a school swimsuit  feels bad
  im waiting on one to get back to me after 3 weeks and if another is kind enough ill get top of his list for the commission ive been looking to get for months now
  ive got a  commission qeueueueueued up  and im working on a waifu draw for her birthday
guys i have a sickness
  it a terminal disease  and only cute images can  treat it
  theres nothing wrong with wanting your dick in a cute little girl anon
  hug
  what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow
  ive been trying to get back in the habit of drawing but since an online friend passed away ive been finding it difficult to do it at all  i hadnt spoken to him in quite a while and i wasnt as close to him as most other folks were but it still feels bad man
  african or european
  i dont know that
good night anons take care and dont burn down the thread     instead please remember one thing   gazers are watching you with one eye always
  i still dont get it
nobody understands me
club suit cheshire  diamond suit cheshire  the choice is hard
  jokers wild
  business suit is my favorite
  hearts diamonds  i can do anything
i want to trick an elf into letting my cum in all 3 of her holes and then grape her
  why grape her
  i want to see the full potential of exotic and novelty grapings
  because i plan to free her from the inhibitions of her own pride
  cease to exist
  can a girl don two suits
  what makes a joker different from the standard suits
  she rides a unicycle
  she lives in a society
  which species is best if im looking for a lover that wont blow my cover shes so hard to find
  shes a gamer
  didnt mean to quote anything
  she can rise up unlike veronica who keeps stealing chad away from her
  she can do anything
  gotcha

genies
  so does she have the characteristics of each suit  an energetic lazy degenerate introvert that cant get her hubbys cock of her mind
toyo and yori are married  junko had a kid  kaguya has had countless suitors  yet no one wants the wrinkly old doctor
marrying her is out of the question but id give nearly anything for just one round of paizuri with her tits
  i would practice any fucking technique on her wanna see what position is best for getting knocked up shit yetah
  it cause she a hag
    all men are intimidated by her genius intelligence
intimidating amazonian size
  yet no one wants the wrinkly old doctor  you know thats not true
  because eirinchan doesnt want anyone
who needs men when you have a moonbunny in heat by your side
lets destroy the earth
  i would fuck her and let her experiment on my penis
shes a single mother with miss lunarian and bunch of lewd bunnies no sane man could have had healthy relationship in eientei also   that being said its still worth of try
  she wants kaguya      i want paizuri and a buttjob
  does kaguya want her too
  looks at pic  if thats what passes as wrinkly and old i guess im into that now  if theyre that hot im game
  kaguya wants a filthy neet sinsack to mess up her perfectly shaped pussy        she might be a genius but she still has carnal desires no one has used her crusty cobweb infested pussy
  cute pairing i really like the doujins by that artist
  would she let me experiment with her nipples
  lunar ass
  gross at least go for women your own age you wrinkly old hag
i love how you can see her sexy bra in this pic
  clearly fake not saggy enough
  eirins milkers
post more q cups
    how will eirin cure his erection
  eirin can cure priapism with just a glance
  castrate him erections permanently cured then he will get to be a cute girl
  no cure only treatment
  holy shit post more
    delicious eirin tummy
  lewd anon
im afraid of this women
  its almost like shes 6000 again
  imagine how the rest of /jp/ feels having been forced to go to school for a chunk of their life only to become a neet as fags they knew at one point have kids of their own as the neet continues to live on in his gensokyo    that just came to my mind sorry eirinchan  hows kaguya fitting in all of this shes living a rather comfy exile if i have anything to say on the matter
  cute cupid
  toehoes with bowhous
eirin should have killed patchy
  why
  titty archer
    how does she fire her bow without accidentally twanging her q cups
  its not an accident
  archers should be more elegant
eirin paizuri
  truly the best
  byakuren is better at paizuri
  byakuren is built for paizuri
  you cant get anymore more elegant than that

  hell no shell drain my wallet dry
joon has two 2 threads
  whats the breast bottle 30 will get me
  roki makes my dick go doki doki
  sure i dont have that much money to lose and id love to get her drunk and leave her pussy dripping my cum
  its well worth the price for such a beautiful lady anon
  vegas got the big money rolling out
joon more like my johnson
  yes
  thats not my joon    my joon is flat and smol
joon is the star of touhou
  dont be so narrow minded
  its not i need to eat and pay rent and buy things besides her plus i know shes not going to put out enough/at all and just sees me as a moneybag   absolutely refuse
  she will only out for her prince anon not just for everyone why not be her prince
  yeah how many princes has she had how many broke and used men left in the gutter   joons reputation has reached the point that she cant play this game anymore anon not with me not with anyone its over
  none anon why dont you take your head out of the gutter shes pure as white snow
i want to make this rich hu my bitch and give me money galore
  sure anon
i want to hug joon for being adorable
whats with this guy giving all 2hus the same exact bodytype i mean sure it gives the necessary hardon that i should feel but eventually ill get bored with it you gut to have that variety that spices things up you know
  she deserves more
  ive started not feeling anything to his stuff for that very reason just like with marui maru even though i really damn liked the artstyle i got tired of it since everyone looks the same
  would joon make a fine mother
  probably not  she would spend all the money on herself
i want joon to be the mother of my children
  i wish roki would make a doujin of her
  considering rokis usual subject matter i agree
  there already exist the perfect doujin
  ryona is gross
  cute bunbun
  sure thats crap wine though gimme a second
  pleb
  i want to thrust the goddess of pestilence if you know what i mean
  she isnt that kind of girl
  but for 5000 yen she could be
  shes a pure girl who is looking for her prince to marry
why would i spend my final waking moments roaming the earth with a girl that possibly drugged the drink so i would die and she would take my money and pin the crime on some innocent commoner  hell no havent drunk and will never onis like suika can sadly never be my friend    i would much rather go to the hakurei shrine and bother the shrine maiden with pointless questions until she tells me to either go away or help her with tidying the shrine which consists of her doing absolutely nothing to help

  white knight  you dont seem to know what that term means try again next time      i think youre looking for one of the general threads or that shitty thread over there     make meaningful posts that dont come off as low tier trash kudasai  just because im less likely to be near that walking apocalypse doesnt mean anything more than i actually value my life fairies are superior anyway so i see no reason to ask her for anything
  not him but do not bring the precious boihu thread into your shitty arguments

  his new alice doujin will make it even more
  who would refuse a drink from a beautiful woman
  a gay man
  1 anyone who values their life  2 everyone since they already know there are more beautiful girls than that walking deadzone
  you dont drink red win from champagne glasses you fuck

  a fucking wineglass  yknow those rounded shaped beauties like pic related
  yes

  a gay man
  only in our wedding
now were talking
  cute
  kinky
  why are you asking etiquette to some flithy prostitute
  because im paying her
  only if i get to drink it from her cleavage
  joon or shion which would you choose to be the mother of your child
  joon
  roki is a plague on the touhou doujin community  he must be stopped
  she is
  what are we drinking for
  her impregnation
  shion would miscarry on every attempt
    metal cap  color barely shows through glass  square label with tacky border    come on at least get me something with a cork in it peasants
  joon because shion wouldnt be able to dont girls stop menstruating when they havent eaten enough
  god i hope roki makes a doujin of shion  or joon
  which post are you quoting
  only if she covers her shoulders
  room left vs an actual talented artist right drawing the same design
  but thats the same artist anon
  roki is an artisan
  roki is making a new alice doujin
  roki is fine when he doesnt do mind control
  whats his best doujin for me personally it would be either the kokoro or alice doujin im still hoping someone would translate them and the rest of the untranslated ones
  what would you do in this situation jp
  you have that reversed anon      this books the exception though
  his kokoro one or one of his sanae ones   shit taste
  nice all three of those are translated
  the right alice is better
its december again /jp/another year and there are no angels in sight    i truly wonder what happened to this project i hope whoever was working on it is okay its been nearly a decade since weve heard from them last every year i hold out hoping for a christmas miracle but i am always given nothing but disappointment maybe this year will be different
dude any logical reason you havent learned japanese in all this time
  some people are born in the anglosphere and therefore cannot learn another language
as a 10time amagami challenge finalistthis is my favorite time of year
  subhuman excuses
you should realize that fantranslators get literally nothing from releasing a translation besides feeling good about themselves    its really not worth the massive time investment in any way
  it must be very restrictive to only speak one language
my personal project is finding doujins that are relevant to my interests and translating them while fapping since translation is fairly slow for me i end up edging during that from 30 mins to 90 mins depending on the size of the thing im trying to read after completing the translating ill edge another 30 mins and experience a god tier fap    good thing about this project is that it is completely dependent on me dont have to wait anyone to do it for me
this is the initial project     then it got taken over by a russian named loss who frequented tlwiki and ensue on rizon fuck knows if hes still there
  the amagami challenge threads on /anime/ were tight    i hope that by finalist you mean you finally found a girlfriend
  rule 1 never trust a slav to finish anything

whats your favorite zun drawing
  that one
this one and some pc98 drawings too
finally i love discussing his art the design and flavors and fashions and tiny details are seriously peak performance like moukous charm pants/ burnt shirt my absolute favorite zun quirk though is his obsession with bows and putting them on shoes i dont think any cultures even do that much just a thing his brilliant mind likes as a result i have a pair of black vand that i gave bows posting on ps3 so unfortunately no pic of the result i love everything about touhou fashionit helps me forget my shit life
beerko
almost all his art gives off the feeling of a middle school girls    hows the ps3 posting experience
  i dont think any cultures even do that much just a thing his brilliant mind likes  its an animu thing
its gotta be this wriggle portrait i love the look shess giving    you rock ps3 anon
  pissed wriggle is cute too
marisa is at her cutest in the pcb trial too bad it didnt make it to the full game
its hard to choose but this might be my favorite
these ones
  zuns good at drawing when its not digital  can someone just buy a scanner and leave it in the shanghai alice building
  you buy it
  buy it yourself nerd
  this too
  wait zun drew this what the hell
  he drew the pictures and wrote the fortunes but someone else colored that
sakuyas eosd images mostly because they have this so bad that its good thing going on
ive always liked his pc98 art especially the covers hands and feet are a bit weird as usual but i wouldnt have it any other way      we seriously need to send him a scanner
  its always surprised me how much better the art for the pc98 games is compared to the windows era
whenever i see zun art i cant help but think of ciryes and how he betrayed us
  thank you i forgot how good wriggle looks     its annoying because even a small paragraph like this takes 10 minutes to write because i have to use the keyboard and the proprietary copy paste mechanic but until i get a cheap pc im stuck communicating this way at least its comfy and i have all my touhou images backed up on here also pic related sucks for captcha verification
  i hope things get better for you soon anon remember to say rabbit rabbit at the start of the month to improve your luck
  oh damn i havent done that since april thank you very much kind lucky star anon
  hmm is it not possible to use an external keyboard or are you just really stuck with the ps3 keyboard
  i have a ps3 myself and you can just plug usb keyboards and mice into them
  yeah i used to own one but i remember it had some issues with some applications been a while though so i dont remember that well
  i agree i think ive posted something similar before  mystic square cover is my single favorite piece it just exudes a dreamlike mysticism and innocence that departed from the games as they went on  not that i still dont like them but its different now
pcb youmu ufo marisa and eosd sakuya
oh my god finally a zun art thread im so in love with his art and as someone who draws its so interesting to see his style develop no matter how kinda crappy he is his art has such a unique charm to it its interesting while not being highly technical which is a big achievement imo    i really do love his paper sketches such as pic related nitori from mof is one of my favorites too lolk and hsifss portraits are actually really well made reimu in touhou 16 is iconic
  ddc really captures that killing intent
would you go drinking with reimu
sanaes going to mess you the heck up     is there a collection of all the defeated sprites from the games the ones with their clothes all torn up after you beat them
  heres a collection of touhou graphics that goes up to lolk it includes defeat portraits  
  who
his art is good and hes often underestimated but the art is not exceptionnal really  but zun has his own drawing style and for that he merit more praise than some other drawing artists with their soulless style
  his art is good and hes often underestimated  hes overestimated as fuck not even by standards from 20 years ago his draws are good in any way
      its undeniably shit but its unique and i like it
  1000 times better than generic animeshit
  i got excited but then found in horror that ps3 cant download the meganz file dammit i wanna specifically create a zip of post battle portraits where they all look injured /rekt oh well    we think alike
  youll be able to show your family injured touhous on the big screen for sure someday
  use otheros firefox it should let you download the files
  people shitting on zuns art is the most annoying tired and overdone meme ever
i like miko shes cute
  her tufts are nice
  autism
is this zun
  youre right that was a fun thread we were in a couple months ago wasnt it      oh look someone who bitches about what is art and what isnt art do you need help for your final 9th grade art i exam sport
  whats psylosophy
  this guy again
feels so good when they resort to memes when they are unable to prove me wrong
  you have a point but you dont need to be so mad
  you dont need to be so dull its easy i bet these faggots think they are total pros in the subject of art in the subject they dare to discuss with such quality knowledge  while in reality they dont know shit at all  but it gets over their head you know nobody has tried to discipline them and now they they are hot shit
  i used to have a pen pal i wrote to who later was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and your thought processes reminds me of her literally what the fuck are you talking about were posting crude drawings which are unique and historically important to the development of independent video games i called it art because art depicts an image you pretentious fuck   hurr my intellect went over their heads thats why they called me out   go home to /his/ with the other faggots if your brain is too powerful to like zuns art
  okay then show us true art explain discipline us otherwise youre just another autist screeching
  i called it art because art depicts an image you pretentious  no mongloid you called it art because your think helpless brain thinks that drawing  art holy shit id like you callling i like this art whne posting a song or his art is so interesting while posting a script or a book  i know you will know you weak brat  go on and discuss art if you want to which it is everything zun has done and everyting in the touhou franchise religion topics messages etc because thats what art is you damm wimp otherwise if youre going to say how cute your mokou looks like then youbare only talling about drawing not art when i talk about a song i am not talling about art i am only talking about the song itself  refer to a song as art come on do it because a art despicts songs isnt that right  do not fucking treat me like a fool and stop consuming weeb shit it hurts your brain and process of thinking      i am arguing properly i am providing arguments  i see you are not so far you only did whine and use lowtier memeshit    here art spoonfed as you asked
  thank you for ruining this thread
  youre welcome circlejerking must die
  please be sure to go on more autistic tirades about pedantic bullshit next thread my brave internet warrior
junya really should make a picture book id buy it for my future kids        helpless brain thinks that drawing  art holy shit  youre discussing his drawing you tryhard mongloid  go on and discuss art if you want to which it is everything zun has done  implying junya didnt draw the sprites and characters   im probably just as insane as you are for trying to reason with a brick wall though  id maybe maybe understand if his post was the op and this thread was circlejerking around the drawings and nothing else but just look at the thread title
  you remind me of the anon that drew this   your retardation needs no assistance    thats not art zun sucks and circlejerking enjoying a niche on a niche thread is stupid   so whats art then   literally posts dolls in pseudo paradise as if this is somehow objectively more artistic than something else music images or otherwise  cant even make this up the eternal  4chan intellectual so smart yet he hasnt figured out that the dictionary  definition of  art is different from what his autism tells him it is
save this thread with more zun pics please
fish
  not even by standards from 20 years ago his draws are good in any way  i disagree see pic related
  lolk marisa is honestly really pretty post more marisas
can we just call these zunpic or zun絵 threads avoid all this nobody gets mad
this is my favorite of zuns circle cut images
  youre the only one who gets seriously upset over this
  calm down nerd
  but the drawings are part of his art discussing his drawings is discussing his art
oh is that artfag here again
  i wonder if hes the one shitposting in the 07th expansion thread that just got all their posts deleted too
shitposting  when arguments are properly provided is that your card
  this thread is a circlejerk just see how autistic fucks here get when people tell them to not talk about things they dont know shit about and teach them how things really are with llt of arguments to prove myself  but nah  shut up i call it like whatever the fuck i want to dont call my ignorance out      the dictionary definition of art is different from what his autism tells him it is  im not making shit up you retatd unlike you i know my shit  i know what art is i dont go around being autistically unable to learn what an artistic language/medium is and what art is a whole    yet you fucks didnt say anything about my music or script example you faggots circlejerk art as only drawingslikr i said i expected you faggots to use art to refer to say music the same way you do witj drawings but hey gues what you never do even tho you say x is allowed because x is an art form it is always a drawing circlejerk and nothing else    oh youre crying because i posted art dipp like you asked faggot dipp is art i dont know what are you bitching about
  call it zunpics  avoid all this  like i said its easy op did fine for once in my lifetime i finally saw a correct op in /jp/   did not not at all generic faggot   neither   aswell  i can go on    like i said its easy but if you decide to be dumbos then you have only yourselves to blame      youre the ones who decide to be retarded and get angry when being called out autistically talking about shit you dont know about
  when arguments are properly provided is that your card  this sentence does not even make sense
  it does  you are experts in blatantly ignoring things and looking at the sides that better fit you
    grimsokyofag right  i really wonder what makes you tick youve been at this for months trolling the jay i mean
i love discussing his art   youre discussing his drawing you tryhard mongloid check what art is before saying i like to discuss art xdd     typical secondary shit  you realize how fuckedup things are when these fucks choose to discuss art by ignoring that which rightfully id art ideas psylosophy etc  leee art xdd draws    cunt go learn what art is before opening up your ass
whats going on in this thread
  
  you realize how fuckedup things are when these fucks choose to discuss art by ignoring that which rightfully id art ideas psylosophy etc  art is whatever you want to call art
  whatever work you create for that purpose  not a drawing synonymous i dont know whats so hard to understand  you could sll be more legit if you you know posted a song but say i like this art instead of using song or music because you know a song is art like you do with drawings but you love do much to sutisticslly deny things and go full damage control
  but you love do much to sutisticslly deny things and go full damage control  im not the other anon im not hurt or anything im just a drawing artist and your posts make no sense to me
  nice samefagging   you means all of you dummies btw
  talking about damage control make even less sense then
  keeps ignoring the fact thst i am dealing with multiple people  sigh ok youre asking position    your socalled position as a drawing artist has little weight considering it is always you drawfags the ones that believe their art medium visuals they dont see this obviously is art itself  i deal with this everyday as a musician studying in an arts school  oh there is the guy who does art snd then there is the guy who does music or theatre etc
  youre asking position  youre asking for this  lol
  source on this where is it from
                  nice finds ive never seen these before
    i really like this style it looks like a cross between ramna 1/2 and beatrix potter why doesnt zun draw like this anymore is he trying to be moe
  moe  you dont know what that means you shitposter styles change  zun  its zun
  td marisa is really underrated i think shes super cute
  whats psylosophy answer my question you mongoloid faggot
i like imperishable night marisa
  yeah she looks really good i do believe he had someone else do the coloring on the characters in in
  nice headcanon   thats just zuns average coloring
  is that so  i think he improved between pcb and then in that case
  the only mainline game where zun had assistance was pofv where alphes drew the ending images and did some coloring work
  oh right i mustve been confusing the two  nevertheless i think in has the prettiest character portraits out of any of the games
neotraditionalism of japan has my favorite cd cover
  what the fuck is going on with renkos arm
  zun should make a mikos of gensokyou book
  lol miko isnt capitalized in the middle of a sentence and you dont add an s to it its already plural by itself
  i never understood this
  mikos of gensokyou is a title and its proper to pluralize things with an s in english
  miko isnt an english word you dont use an s in the pluralization of most japanese words including miko you dont say sushis you say sushi you dont say animes you say anime you dont say mikos you say miko
  you mark titles with quotations you should have said miko of gensokyo especially since its just a made up title of a theoretical book youve thought up
  you dont say sushis you say sushi  thats just because you say fish and not fishes anime is not a japanese word it is properly animes or animations using anime is overcorrection
  this doesnt apply for miko though miko is a purely japanese word the plural of miko is miko
  she has a stomach ache
  same there is something very charming about this marisa maybe its the hair
i really like that only suika image that zun made    of course
  i also like her dress looks like the galaxy kind of reflects on it
  lol
      arm  might i remind everyone of trex arms satori      you dont use an s in the pluralization of most japanese words when borrowed in english    says who you might be surprised to find out that grammar doesnt come from a textbook ive seen the word animes so many times now its commonplace enough that its an acceptable construction
  tsunami is a borrowed japanese word and tsunamis is the correct plural form in english
  anime is not a japanese word  it is though japanese anime is a different word from the latin/neolatin anima/animae and is treated as such even in romance languages  eg in italian its  1 anima  2 anime  and  1 animo  2 animi  for the latin definition  but  1 anime  2 anime  for the japanese one
tfw no best girl thread

  just reverse search the first pic it was mostly panchira anyway
  fuck off back to your containment shithole
  zr is so damn good
  skirt length suggests shes either a cosplayer/model/idol or an actual jk who sleeps with old men for money im tempted to believe the latter case since her eyes are censored
  or smelly unwashed cosplay neet
  i wonder if any of them ever go nopan
  hopefully more than those that wear shorts under their skirt nothing worse than cheating with shorts  it totally defeats the purpose of the skirt in the first place
  striped  cute

  asian girls should be forced to wear tights at all times
we all agree navy blue/black sera fukus are the best right
royally ugly
  id never let my daughter go out like that
  my classmates used to fix their skirts after the last period of class normally they would use them long but at the end of the day the will fold them until that tiny size
  i see im pretty sure those socks are against the school code though  i was unlucky enough to be sent to an allboys school it was good for academics but i feel like i wasted part of my youth there
  sorry you cant find naked images in this page  i resent your implications
i wonder what her parents thought about her modeling his dad was either a perv or the money was too good to pass the opportunity
  millennia of breeding/inbreeding read tale of genji to be an idle figurehead will occasionally make for such     heres a few more japanese princesses in uniform that are a bit more normal looking
i want to engage in enjo kosai
  shes that girl who has a porn video right
  looks a lot like one of the first year graduate students where i study
        korean look at the hangul
tiktok really is the best place if you like japanese girls in uniform besides the endless stream of girls dancing in their uniforms if you watch enough youll spot lots of them that accidentally showed something they didnt mean to before they or the mods delete it
  how do i find them on tiktok
  just search for them on youtube/google japanese tiktok or some shit liket that
  you may have to use a vpn or gps spoofing im guessing they use some kind of algorithm that shows you people mainly from your country i live in japan and get only teenage japanese girls when i flick through tiktok
  cute
this thread just highlights that my high school years were wasted in a public school without a school uniform feels bad man

shige is hot  her mom too  also her father  what a blessed family
  yeah why isnt she
  can i marry them
  kawaii
  also her father  thats super duper gay  not judging
  looks like dinner is ready
  have you seen her father
  no but im curious now
will we ever get a show as based as sasshi kita gassen ever again
  ayumin is 15  looks like 19 and is even taller than naachan  nice yumirin must have been jelly
  what about her sister though
  they are kinda cute but not as much as anna  their jaws are too strong
  i dont know why but i get some medium bad vibes from ayumin  hopefully naachan can save her
  sadly probably not what groups would it be this time though
  stu and team 8
  is she calling me a loser
shiges favourite alcoholic drink is vodka
  are you a loser
this is bretty good  
  she was the best day 1 imo   i still havent watched day 2 i want to see if nana really did as good as people claim     i know yuiyui didnt do so bad though which i wasnt expecting
  i also liked this one    the other girls didnt really draw my attention
ranran will win
  never enough michu around here
anyone have that yuiyui wasshoi link
singing contest prelims day 2    how the top 5 should have been like    1 yahagi moeka  2 oda erina  3 yokoyama yui team 8 very difficult song still good  4 yokomichi yuri  5 risen airi    quite nice special mention    taguchi manaka  ootake hitomi  yamauchi suzuran    not that great overhyped the fuck was that    okada nana my ears started ringing  yokoyama yui
  why does she have a recorder
  she is on the spectrum it makes her feel confident
  gift from her mentor
  because she is autistic
    is she really
  no girls cant be autistic
  no but i am
  of course they can   we call that cute
  so this is what people refer to as gap moe
  i hate your mole
yano honoka and that other stu loli were pretty good
  she didnt use the secret gargle to lubricate her throat das why she lost to other yui
  either that or she is an attention whore
  all the young girls that could sing decently caught my attention   with the right practice in 56 years they could be very good singers
  i want to see if nana really did as good as people claim  yes she did even better than what people claim in my opinion
  i know yuiyui didnt do so bad though which i wasnt expecting  she did really well actually happy to see her singing is improving        
  too bad theyre in 48
  singing contest prelims day 1    1 aki toyonaga  2 yura akari    good    shiroma miru    the rest was mostly overhyped trash    conclusion the judges are trash its rigged for okada
  yuiham was good   she just sang too high
hinana was good
moeka is unironically good she kinda has a kozue takada sounding voice
  mizugi kudasai
  shes waiting until shes 18 anon   have some patience
orin was terrible   what a mess of a performance at least shes cute
kano was good but man is she ugly
  shes not that either
  just judging her on her performance on that day and that one wasnt too great i still love her though
  she blew me the fuck away i thought she was just tits but she can sing wow
  yokoyama yui team 8  i cannot understand how anyone could have liked her singing like she did she was even painful to just watch
  gotta listen to a few candidates/songs more than once
  is and always will be  
  singing tits the best kind of tits
rara wasnt great but shes cute to watch
  yeah there were a lot of cute girls
  it all about her legs tb h
you know that aki is a good girl because she sang a song from the 70s because of the influence of her mom
  but the 70s were full of sex and other degeneracy
  her wakis actually
  not in japan
    nana did very good but it still wasnt amazing taken outside the overall level of this competition she and odaeri have performed live better in other occasions and i expect them to do way better at the finals    notable mention to the huge improvement of naachans singing over time just the powergap between her minus average temodemo with yukirin at rh 2017 and her setouchi no koe solo at the 2017 ranked in concert are very big
nana was pretty good   odaeri underperformed compared to usual probably just bad song choice  lots of underdogs did pretty well though
  i couldnt with her it was really hard to watch and i unironically enjoyed juris ultra weird performance
  iirc odaeris song was like her third or fourth choice so she had a reason to be mad since the get go
  the overall level of the competition was good at the top level and at the top level is where nana lost to most to the others of course nana beats the average girl but she lost to the best members that day and i dont expect it to be any different at the finals
  nana lost to most of the others
naachan should sing this it fits her voice  
the new akb girls are so cute but cant sing for shit   aks should actually do something about it
  16th is stacked with beauties straight outta mordor
  they werent that bad they had average singing voices not everybody needs to be a superstar but yes they were very cute it looks like akb still draws in very cute girls despite all the hype for nogizaka and staff seems inclined to welcome them good for akb
all those awful singers    thank god im here just for the variety
moeka taking akb by storm  triple threat
the things i would do to oshibas cheeks
  all the same almost every other member who the judges praised with points barely took the risk of raising their voice like nana did even if that new eito airi and eretan had great performances they lacked the emotion of a heartfelt one that if you close your eyes and only listen to the voice you get goosebumps the ability of a performer to transmit their feelings to the audience through their voice is very important and the judges recognized it by mentioning it plenty  still naachan can and must improve and i dont doubt she will
  yukitsun thank you brain
  her two tits plus her singing voice
  barely took the risk of raising their voice  nah just no there were not too many girls with safe songs  transmit their feelings  naachan has a rather monotone voice so i dont really know what you mean by that what naachan can usually do well is hit notes her steady voice is her advantage i dont know why but something was off this time
wakapeach
  now kiss
bibian is 19 and i still havent seen anything from her
  she needs to get a more common haircut before getting gravure work
homma mai really isnt a bright child is she  the fact she cant do anything right is getting kinda sad
  but that would kill all the fun
  dont look at the mirror then you might as well end up killing yourself  dabs
  shes cute though so its alright
does akbg like asai nanami
  you almost worded that correctly good job buddy

  holy fuck    good thing she didnt go to korea they can have uggo hiichan and the two hkt whores
  pilot academy
    i had never realized zukki was cross eyed   i cant unsee it now
  fun fact water is wet
  being crosseyed would be great in pilot academy much less likely to panic and rely on eyesight over the instruments in the plane
  no it isnt
  zukki is
  kek
  well yeah shes mostly water
  what about the bullies
  fun
  there will always be bullies cant let them get in the way of becoming a pilot

this yokomichi yuri is cute   is she fun
  sometimes but she breaks easily
  she was my favourite during the auditions streams still is
  my ears started ringing  next time dont take a shot every time someone missing a note
  image her crazy out of work bum uncle shaving her head while shes asleep
  addresses are based on chome whichre kinda like large blocks no one gives a shit about streets
  hed do more than that
  her hairstylist uploaded another pic of her hair       oh and heres that sky perfecttv special from friday  
  literally the ugliest shit
im livid that someone gets paid to touch mocchis hair
  based naaminbro
  hawaii
draftees are in good hands
  shes not wrong pretending that those things wont save the world will do no good for anyone
  what is khlium
  no idea   google points to some twitter guy that likes sato kaho though
  i think its supposed to be kalium
  it will happen again this gen is yabai
  she was snuffed out quick only good girls are left  kaho is an 8th anyways not a dirty 7
  google her name  ske48  first fucking image  that dude was lucky
  she might not have even been good at it leave her alone
  latest two ske gens are all about being lewd i cant wait for a sakae bunshun headquarters
  ego takes too much space
  boob shaming   not cool senpai
  she was bad news since the beginning
  but 7th and 8th gen was cleaned before promotions
  rara asai suenaga  yuzu ami marin  i fucking wish
yuiyui needs to face away from the camera more often
  surely someone has told her since the last time 
  same vibes from 17
  hngg chochan
  look at how pointy that bad boy is
  tomu and megu make a lovely couple
  nevermind the boobs  wtf title
  its nmb  theyre always moist
  mentally comparing it with her boyfriends
  cute ears  and hands  and nose  and lips  and everything
  straight out of an anime or something
  does she not shave
  horrifying
  i would eat it
  did anyone end up eating it
  cutest girl in the world
  that would be 
  shes an argument for and against teen pregnancies at the same time
  cute young sugawara
  the one next to suda akari is cute
  nice rukachan

  nanaho busukawaii as fuck

  you try to stop its not that simple
danceable  so thats what it means
  shes at her sexual peaku
its clearly super hot in there why arent they passing out like chumps
now shes wet
  theyre used to it
  they drink a lot of liquids
the angry yuumin joke never gets old
queentet on suicide watch
that was too short
is there only one show today
  they only did two on the weekends the next few days all have one performance at 7pm
  who is this  asking for a friend
our fato aint going nowhere  
  she literally said it though  日本語しんど  more like damage control
  lol
  believing a female
  she said on ig that its almost too late for fans to visit her handshakes now  and now shes all like that doesnt mean im going to graduate soon  except thats literally what it means
she would never betray me
  it could mean that shes at risk of losing her hands soon
  i bet she was really happy about team e mv
  plot twist handshake events are being abolished
  shiorin no
  seriously so much pink
  a transfer to shitty asia isnt technically graduating
iits too late because you shouldve come earlier yyou lost more than four years of handshakes
  comfy sluto
  kennin to korea48
  yuiri saving akb again
too late for hs on insta  not graduating on twitter    quit playing games with my heart
speaking of comfy
i hope shiorin does graduate then we can get a hot niigata instead of a beached whale
  hiatus probably
  hiatus properly
  so pregnancy then
azusa just graduated with immediate effect she must have been a bad girl
you all seem a little too quick to rule out the possibility that shes cutting her own hands off in the near future
what with the really lame fisher dude step up your game
  shiet  
  its real  and people said riripon was lying when she said that idols are hooking up with men all the time she must have gotten pregnant from one of those random guys
  she doesnt need to hiatus for pregnancy  nobody would notice if she was pregnant
  azusa has always been bad news
  stop saying everyones pregnant
  dude is salty because his girl is kissing mexicans like there is no tomorrow
  well my nights sleep is ruined im off to have a little weep    catch yas
  gf material
    is she trolling
based and pregnant
    wtf
  no its already been mentioned in the thread my little brainlet
  no shes getting married
who dis bitch
what the fuck is this shit
azucat
there is a dude enjoying this ones right now in celebration
back to wanking off to iu _
has an eito ever graduated effective immediately
im going to cry lads
  the fastest one was like a lill less than a month that one of the happy 1 year shit
  yuiyui graduated at the beginning of 2019 because a picture of her fellating a penis leaked out
well hope she didnt have any fans here seems like a bitch just leaving after 4 years with just a  cya
  it should be me i was the chosen one hs are a lie  she made me feel lov oh wait is not mikurin yay
  but she even got a graduation stage and everything imagine what these girls did to get nothing but a blog post
she was a regular senbatsu member gaining popularity
here i was thinking macchi was sudden  hang in there nmbros
  ill graduate you from life
kill me
  dates a married producer  producer gets fired  bunshun gets the scoop from the wife  we need to fire you because management must be protected
glad is not shiori 
    fuu is going to graduate immediately once im done with her
  she probably reached an agreement with management and was allowed to graduate this way after doing something was bad enough to get her fired
  speaking of people who need to graduate immediately
maybe idoling is not for me
i wonder what happened
  if she doesnt have to be in a wheelchair for life afterwards then you were too soft on her
  no sayane no life
  yeah she must of done something  i dont see why she would just graduate like that if nothing happened  i bet shes dating she rich dude
  caught sleeping with someone on the inside
  someone always graduates on her birthday but never her
    tsucchan graduated faster than her
  even if she was dating i doubt they would fire her like this
  id give it all for fuu and shes not even close to being my favorite
so whos the new cutest girl in 48g
why is jo still here then
she did something really really really bad
  still not faster than azusa
    yes they wont get fired for dating thats against the law reminder that riripon was asked if she wanted to stay in the group after she had announced her marriage she did something worse
  but we all saw that coming a mile away so it wasnt a surprise to anyone following eitos
  12/03 uemura azusa is gone forever
  same
  i think its still yuiri
did they find out she pushed someone onto the railway tracks
maybe she was just increasingly frustrated with something until one day she blew up and walked right out of the studio and said she fucking quit or a yakuza got her
maybe she has a severe illness
  reminder that riripon was asked    spotted a low iq faggot that ate managements narrative and asked for seconds
whos taking her slot in queentet
  12/03 uemura azusa will now be posted on jav  ftfy
azusa graduating  ruririn geting married
  amimaru
nice both shirais streaming at same time
  okubora chinatsu and moriwaki yui    fujimura natsuki and iwasaki moeka announced their graduations during the 2nd anniversary concert in okinawa and left that day yamamoto ai was the only one that had a graduation stage months later yoshino announced her graduation before her photo was leaked
  no need to project brainlet you have no clue how things work
this is disappointing i always enjoyed azusas cute sluttiness
yuiyui was caught stealing multiple times and management covered for her one of the mcs even went to jail for her rika is literally living with her boyfriend imagine what this nmb did
    she has a new twitter account
  so accurate it hit a nerve nice post anon
  i would love that
i feel like my dog just died
  you know you were never funny but you keep doing this every single day
didnt that bunshun faggot post a teaser pic recently
  yeah she definitely got fired if shes so quick to get on sns and try to collect her fans
  she covered it well
  he does the same in all the general all day long and keeps replying to himself he really has no life just ignore him
she was never posted anyways  no difference
  i  fap to this
  immediately fired in less than 24h  there must be a sex tape leak or something like that      about zukki46 and her pic sucking her boyfriend finger      you really called him out   10/10
azusa killed someone
  ah well 46 are all sluts anyways except fire no news there
    i wonder what suzu posted and then deleted
    about zukki46   no it was hashimoto kanna they had nothing new on mizuki
liar kun wk zukki again  kek
what the fuck  this is exciting tho about time we had something fun happen
shes off to canada isnt she
this is not how i wanted to start my monday
  this is not fun you sick fuck
please do be posting tummy_rubwebm    danke
  too brown
must suck to be a azusa cuck right now hahahahahaha  __
  imagine this is chiyori
  sorry my love for drama overweights my love for her
  clearly she was tired of being touched by strange people
  imagine chiyori is finally gone  yes please
no wonder there was no queentet on the special week
  nmb48 theater special week 4 live 1900 queentet 180517mp4
  yes please
  on this one
  might just be a coincidence they would have had to have known at least three weeks ago and at that point they could do a proper graduation      hes talking about this current week
  is that how he makes you moan
but how this ends   i guess well have to wait and see  but it dont look that good to me
  22 chan  someone wrote the same on s48    lol
  so are you idiot 1 or idiot 2 
im so angry
  whats why you should never allow your dog to eat chocolate
  thats what you get for falling in love
kawaiian tv got cucked lmaoooo
keito is save   banzai banzai banzai
we need a new bad vibes in queentet now     i vote mikanyan 
  did anyone really like her that much
  amimaru is a better fit
its fucking obvious bruv
  around here i dont think so  in japan yes
  she was posted here all the time
  only because shes so slutty
i guess someone took out the trash
  anon is way too horny
she was one of my favorites ever since the octopus eating like three years ago
  for me it was this show
  out of how many favorites
  top 3
i liked azunyan and posted her quite a bit but i dont really care that shes graduated
i hope its not the yakuza
  same nmb will be fine without her
you will never rest your rest on satones huge pillowy tits and fall asleep
omg what happened to showroom
  yoshimoto is
  you mean besides the millions of hours of stu streams
  why do i even bother living
  bibian took it over
  oh jeez she starts crying kill me now
  post it faggot
  satone is not for lewding
  cotton candy tits
where can i find archived akb general threads
  is it lewd to sleep on breasts i bet if i was a loli you wouldnt be thinking lewdly about it
    i can use this
    what the heck is happening  and there i was thinking that the only graduations left for this year would be predictable ones like yuumin or something
  none of this explains why she graduated immediately the fuck did you do
    summary  i never wanted to be an idol  ive already achieved my dreams within nmb i stole kokoros senbatsu spot  fuck you for leaking my past and flaming me  i quite enjoyed my job so i want to keep my flying mokeys please subscribe and like
izone members miyawaki sakura and yabuki nako are leaving izone to return to hkt48 activities this december
  falling for fem tears  lol
  must be some really juicy stuff because even k huna got a graduation stage and all
  we dont want them
  a couple of no akb no life discord calls us that often
  youtubedl it asap
  leaking my past  
  i did ill use it later
  who is this fisting expert
  the next queentet girl
  my daughtergirlfriend
  what a great girl    and jo    and azusa
  why would they do that
ywn ruin a trashy idols career with your dick
  the activities in krea have been underperforming hard only 120k cds sold
  my wife
  she said that okinawa belonged to china
  but thats not sato ami
  only 120k cds sold  pfft hahahahaha
    im just pretending to be retarded
  sheesh well instead of selling them at half the price of the average kpop cd they should sell them for a fourth
  digital albums are priced according to how many songs are on an album
  no one cares
  unf nanaho
  nanaho is a really good girl after all
  nanaho is cute
    id make this girl pregnant too if i had the chance 3 seconds is all that i need
when will jo fuck off
  when the staffsan that is enjoying her gets fired
  why do you hate nmb
  should have 5 months ago now is too late
goddamnit the one time i get to play mahjong at the same time as yanyan i get on a game that goes on for four rounds on 1500 point mode fml
  she always did what she wanted and how she wanted it
  no idea what that means
  on the new nmb mahjong game if a member is playing at the same time as you you might get paired up with them on a game and get a special title
shut up guatemala
  im glad they made rei do this
  clearly not him learn your thread personalities
  our resident mahjong fag really is annoying
  does aayan even know how to play it or does she just press random buttons
  she probably doesnt shes bad at everything
this is the worst day of my life
  shes not bad at sex
  she probably does shes good at everything
  where am i gonna get the right balance of shamelessness and cuteness now  momone is not quite there yet
          fuck   ill miss her   ____  she really was one of the cutest i liked her a lot  ill name my eevee after her as tribute
quit to become a youtuber  shes gonna regret this one real fast wwwwww  even popular idols like mio have failed on youtube
  popular idols  like mio
  i think its just an emergency backup  theres no way this was the plan all along she could have done that after a proper graduation without making her fans mad
  why are they mad it wasnt right after ssk
  not everyone is mad of course but its not exactly nice to be told alright see ya on twitter after four years of supporting a girl  that needs a justifiable reason and shes not giving it
  well it came practically out of nowhere she hasnt given any proper reasons she didnt get a graduation stage or a last handshake event she already moved on to new sns accounts
its like breaking up per text message
  she did the same thing with pd48 thats just how she rolls
  i dont think i have to tell you that thats an idiotic comparison
  aka got fired
what could an innocent girl like this possibly have done to get fired
  it was just you that took breaking up in person for granted
    she did give one
  aachan is such a good girl
  she gave a pr reason but not one that justifies quitting out of the blue on the same day you announce it
  those shady yoshimoto contracts man you know she cant tell you
  something worse than riripon and kinoshita
  a felony
13yo hanachan
  brown
  humbert humbert  based
  cho is so pretty and cute
i didnt think things would get so much worse after sayanee left
  i loved her
shell be a real mom soon
this is a job for ironside
  i am still mad at nattu for hiding her legs the entire day
vacant
  is she safe to have as fave young member im liking her more than honono
  she will be around 3 more years at least so yes
  you just want her mizugi
  it will be underwhelming
replace fish with zukkii and t8 would be perfect
  why not both
  japanese people are so fucking creepy with their phone cameras
  not her problem
  no i need a new daughter and i like rezu daughters daughters are not for lewd unless theyre doing it with another girl
  motherfucker you would do the same thing in that situation get the fuck off your high horse
  i already kinda like fukai negai and kitagawa yoshino too i need to make up my mind on who do i like the most or it feels like cheating since theyre in the same group
oh no no no
  eh this is old stuff
  ive been to a few dozens of concerts physically touched artists but i never shove my phone up in their face
sakura is returning to hkt48 will you stand by her
  would
  suicidal girl who lost her master  poor kid that draws like picasso on lsd  super cool robot kid  woman with needs  its an easy choice
    budding flower
  actually all stuff is pretty appealing
  what is kate going to do without her mom
never the girl  never drew a dime  never centered a good single in ske or akb  never cut a memorable moment  never put anyone over  is the reason why ske is the worst sister group  hogs the ske center for so long she acts like a spoiled cuckold  behaves like a christmas cake despite not yet a christmas cake  looks like a christmas cake despite not yet a christmas cake  shit hairline  shit taste in anime  shit taste in wrestling  all her hiatus reasons are fake  centered the lowest drawing senbatsu sousenkyo single of all time  only ssk winner to noshow every postssk events  only ssk winner to noshow mv taping and single cover  her wrestling cosplay was cringeworthy  her cgi replacement in the single she supposed to center was cringeworthy  tanked the vote rate of senbatsu sousenkyo 2018  was barely ever in the ssk center picture because she was never a big enough deal despite being the face of ske  renas jannetty  begs attention from rena every time despite rena clearly not giving a fuck  dropped out from produce48 because she got btfo so hard  worst solo photobook in history of 48g photobooks  tries to set a record for longest stay in 48g despite being in 48g later than minegishi  ate an expensive steak while other ske members only ate cheap food  used marikos birthday to get in quick onenight stands with ikemens  faked her age at debut  fake tough girl  fake lesbian  buried newer gen idols so hard ske management had to give ryoha/miyamae wcenter to get matsuis out of center  buried sakura and cherprang at the end of ssk 2018 for no reason  buried kito momona so hard she scandaled and became an av idol that drew more dimes than any 48g idol combined ever  tried burying the korean produce48 talent only to get buried in the end  almost exposed and killed the joshi wrestling business   spent the latter part of her career trying to bury superior young talent  is the idol equivalent of that one insufferably mediocre theater girl whose sole professional achievement is staying in the same shitty job for 10 years  the biggest impact she had on the business was sitting around in the back and telling one of her nodraw buddies to job to someone who could actually draw dime
  miku is our girl now
  takeko will adopt her
  aachan spends a lot of time with mechazawa so it might be a little hard
what the fuck  are you guys kidding me  this has to be a joke
hopefully she releases a heartbeat asmr video on her new channel _
  oh no shes even trashier
  whos left aapon is gone kushiro is a loser and antan is ugly  sararan is the best outcome
  ayatin
  udon
  takeko isnt trashier than azusa not by a long shot  shes a virgin for one
  negai is the answer
  yeah the one that almost quit once and said she wanted to kill herself is the answer
  gyaru kate  now i want this
  its as real as it gets
  she has the goods and its willing to do anything to succeed
maybe this is a good opportunity to quit idols altogether
  maybe take anons advice for once and stop getting involved with bad vibe girls
  anon always has the best radar for such things we should listen to anon more often
  mikami yua the second
i dont know why i even follow this shit day in and day out anymore
  for exciting moments like this
  for cute girls embracing each other
no pitty for azusa fans you knew what you were getting into
  girlfriend and daughter substitutes they make your life better
  this guy gets it
  unironically this  its beyond me how anyone can look at any of these extremely bad vibes girls and think its a good idea to oshi them
pokemon girls are the best girls
have any of these girls listened to astroworld
  fuck i just got here and trying to read the thread what did our honorary akb do
  exactly why i liked her  it hurts so bad
  yes
what happened i just woke up
      
  azusa super dead we dont know why
  i want kate to be a friendless depressed loser like kushiro too
  shes too cute for that to happen
i dont get it iwhy is she even the one uploading an explanation vid and all
  nothing suspicious about telling your fans that youre not pregnant
  well after you got fired you still need to tell your fan to stop give your old employer money and give it to her instead
  momona pure luck and rinatin first ever 48g to av shock value are the only ones to drew any dimes during their av stints most of those who jumped ship to av flopped just like most other 48g postgraduation career besides muteki is dead
  chiho was the good one after all
  chiho
and you said takatera was fired

  yua mikami flexing on jurina when

  this was supposed to be the year of the mizuno x yunana gravure
  this
she will never be forgotten
  is nanaho safe
  i will always keep her in my heart 3
  i liked her but shes really a bitch
  now that shes gone i guess i can use this
following nmb ever
  thanks for the memories azunyan
  i wonder if theres a way to till how fat someone are with their voice
  we like our hkts large and in charge
and there goes riorins ass  worthless ride
  shes coming back twice the size
uno mizuki should take over her kawaiian show
the new theater is being built so that the stage can be reinforced enough to handle the strain of a returning haruppi
  i still would
youre all gonna look like jerks when our haruppi comes back fit as a dancer that takes care of herself
  the new theater is being built  heh heh heh
i hope my oshi is still virgin
  frog is so confused
  shes a pure girl after all
  i loved that they all just thought it was a bit  the dawning realization was amazing
haruppi being so fat she lets out a fart with every step
  you can date her now
love fat chicks  from akita
  you could date her before
  someone has been
  real wotas dont do that    go back to /kpop and never comeback
  except they get stuck between the cheeks and then i come in and spread them and inhale all the juicy braps
  real idols dont do that either
  its not the 90s anymore gramps fuck off with your dated beliefs dinosaur
  to quote a certain wise anon  go back to /kpop and never come back
  i knew theyd fire these two because of those pictures with the bites
  sararan will never leave me
  bites
  more eroi than any gravure
  imagine her biting you down there
post some large naos
                she was so adorable beautiful and sexy  such a shame
she was an entertaining and hot badvibesgirl with nice ears shame it had to end like this
  why did you get bad vibes from her
  shell follow hikawa ayames career now
  bad vibes because shes lewd and shameless  which makes her a likely scandal candidate  its a fun chara as long as they dont actually scandal
  the only good girl to ever be like that is ranran
  satokaho
stop anon my heart and my male parts cant take it anymore
  doing them both while they wear that outfit
i dont know wheter to cry or to fap
did she ever had a photobook
  holy fuck she looks korean
  you can do both at the same time      no
  just the female oriented queentet pb
  i just kissed the screen as my tears fell on to it as well
i just watched a show about north korea and literally everyone there looked like azusa
  literal dream girl
  maybe i should move there  that one guy cant be that bad
there will never be a better eevee girl

finally a good thread
me reading kagetsu tohya theres no fetish i havent encountered in tsukihime im ready for anything   nasu hold my beer fag
this is not reddit
previous thread     post japanese gravure here  remember this is a sfw board  relax and rejuvenate your eyes with beauties  a gravure idol グラビアアイドル gurabia aidoru often abbreviated to gradol グラドル guradoru is a japanese female model who primarily models on magazines especially mens magazines photobooks or dvds gravure idols appear in a wide range of photography styles and genres their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality although gravure models may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body they seldom appear fully nude     sales rankings           whats new           profile info      
  wait does it only have a dvd version that is certainly disappointing i wonder why did the other releases not make enough money to warrant another bluray or something
  did the other releases not make enough money to warrant another bluray or something  im pretty certain ive seen on numerous occasions a gravure girls bluray be either a no1 seller or in the top 3 but her next release ends up being a dvd only  i dont really know the exact reasoning behind the dvd only releases particularly when its the extremely popular girls  i guess one reason might be that bds are still relatively expensive to produce compared to dvds so the studios might think they can get by with digital only hd releases every so often   theres also studios that seem to exclusively only do dvd physical  hd digital like spice visual and possibly aircontrol who did ruis latest
    i only saw the dvd on sale on various sites but that doesnt mean a bd wont come out later wouldnt be the first time as i recall
  but that doesnt mean a bd wont come out later  i think its still fairly rare but does happen on occasion eg with juns lpfd301 dvd getting a bd release almost 2yrs afterwards but if were desperate enough we can always attempt to get the digital hd version
  i hope jun releases another bluray soon her incredible body needs to be admired in hd
  thats a pretty hot cover is the content just as good

is gravure less damaging to the mind than jav
  its only damaging if you read the articles next to the pretty girls
  damn it they air brished her arm pits off
    only thing not photoshopped in that pic is the chair in the background    something i just noticed  that shadow dosent look right  it looks like they took a pic of her and then photoshopped it in to the background as just a shadowthe light source does not match up
  why is she so cute  even her voice
  i pray for a day that i see juns bare breasts

  theres also studios that seem to exclusively only do dvd physical  hd digital like spice visual  looks like theyre making an exception for ayaka nodas final release    
yall ever watch javs that emulate gravure in the way camera angles are shot and the way the girls pose no sex just focus on the girl

nice selection of girlies    
  hinano best girl though    
  guess this is the reason she refuses to wear glasses in her ivs      imagine being her classmate she asks you to meet her after school behind the shed she is there blushing behind those thick glasses she looks away from you and suddenly starts to slowly unbutton her blazer then her shirt
  graphis  send links pls
  then she says sorry anon i need to stay pure because i want to be a gravure idol
  i cant read moon am i safe

too cute
whoever think current hair oshino is good must be gassed but her armpit still lickable
  moo
mommy moo
old moo
  short hair is superior i want to lick that armpit too we can agree on that
  arguably just look at oshino and minorin now
  not really a fan of minorin but i think sara looks gorgeous i like girls with short hair
  and jun
would she let me have sex with her if i get good at street fighter what if i get good and get /fit/ there has to be a way lads
  i wish there were more girls like this making videos and stuff out there

meiri time
  holy fuck those milkers are perfection
  damn she was really a dorky looking girl back then
  i dont know how to feel about ako theres something about her face that turns me away while simultaneously turning me on
  just focus on her tats and you will begin to love everything else
  she looks really cute here though      i didnt recall this hana seto pic so i google it and there seems to be a new dgc photoset of hers do you guys know where i can get it only got the 4 sample pics i thought she was retired so good to be proved wrong
tiny
  
  behindthescenes of their shoot for the next weekly young magazine issue  
  nashiko is too cute
    you just know that guy from the latest harry potter spinoff movie  who played flash in the justice league film was trying to crack onto her
  heres the link where i got it from 
        i could suck on those tits all day long cute jap girls with huge tits are the best
  you can actually see her carefully distancing herself from him  kek
  ughh  this makes me more sad that i failed my japanese high school dream when i was 16  not being able to be blessed with the sight of things like this every day at school
festive eimi
  lewd face and body
    whos this shes cute as fuarck
i like ramu for what she is but at the same time i feel shes a big waste of potential she could easily be one of the hottest and sexiest gradols around but she wants to be the female filthy frank and star in review channels nobody cares about  though this may be because im biased against japanese tv
  you also are not the core demographic that  her releases and shows appearances are meant to attract    have you even bought any of her material or did you simple pirate it
  
alright listen up chumpsi want your  biggest and best idol butts i want names dvd codes and free easily accessible download links and i want them now
does anyone know who this is
  thank you anon i like how her mouth looks like 3 sometimes
  thanks my man really appreciated although it seems these are all from a dvd which means she probably is still retired feels bad
  leave now its for your own good
hey friends does anyone here knows about a guide or something to buy blurays or photobooks i want to buy rena takedas movie from amazon japan but they dont sent it to my dumb ass country chile and thats kinda weird because they do sent her photobooks
why has there never been a torrent or source for lpfd318 its truly an outrage
tomomi close up
tomomi in boots
  im really trying to like them theyre close to my type although i still have zero idea who is eri and who is mari but the one with shorter hair looks better  also downloadable photoset search for エリマリ姉妹erimari ヤンマガデジタル写真集
yuuki chika looking cute
  mooo
  everyones holding out for a potential bluray release instead 3
  rei kuromiya
  forgive me but im still kinda new to this idol world   will buying her dvds even change anything at this point since im not part of her core audience shes famous now so her stuff will sell no matter what so shell continue doing these bland and formulaic vids honestly i find the backstages of her shoots and the vids from magazines much more enticing than her professional vids    tldr is there any way to support her that doesnt involve buying vids that i dont enjoy too much and that i can find for free anyway
  dont mind that anon
  shes a young girl having fun and doing a bit of gravure on the side    
  if the movie youre referring to is the screenshot what is it
  i was referring to her only dvd/bluray movie lpbr30/yjlp008 the screenshot is from a series but i forgot its name she appears in only one chapter though there was a different cast to each of them in fact i remember yuka kuramochi appeared in another one too
me on the right
  airi shimizu is so fucking hot
  i agree but short airi is best
  short is fine but i think she was peak hotness during that esper movie
which idols are into metal and or prowrestling
  do you really have to ask
  she unironically listens to radiohead and shiina ringo im not joking maybe she listens to metal too but i havent seen her write something about that
what made ramu get so popular here just curious
  cute funny 10/10 body
  i think some people are just really into midgets
do any of you perverts know where i can find audio of girls making sexy moo sounds
i love this kind of shot and dgc usually delivers
  that doesnt answer anything        speaking of demographic and popularity made me realize that she is one of the idols with the widest intergenerational appeal  kids love her for the wacky goofball antics teens and young adults for her hip and rebellious style general audiences for her tv shows appearances and gravure fans for her unbelieveable body  though i cant predict if she can become one of the most beloved entertainers out there or crash and burn while trying to juggle all these things any opinions
    she should do more gravure and a bit of crazy shit on the side instead of the other way around her humour gets grating after a while
  dont watch she was doing dumb videos since high school i dont see her being in gravure for very long this is just a bit of fun and 
  that doesnt answer anything  answers everything you as a white male not living in japan you dont matter to the gravure industry you are not a core demographic you arent even a secondary demographic that they target you do not matter to the gravure industry
this is kasen kasen the not oni
    of course not shes my loving wife
  kasen is a oni
  bblasphemy zuns words are noncanon
  no where does he say shes an oni he just thinks it would be cool if she was an oni hypothetically speaking
  if kasens not a human how come shes breeding with humans all the time huh
  shes not
if kasen is not an oni then i vote to evict her from her personal pocket dimension and make her move in with the other hermits shes taking up real estate
  kasen dressed up as best girl  i wish kasen would buttpunch me in the face and obliterate every micrometer of my face from the sheer force of her strike
  wrong  kasen is the oni
  
  i want to reincarnate as an ant in gensokyo and be stepped on by kasen
scared of beans  when reimu found kasens arm it was labled as an oni arm  unnaturally high alcohol tolerance   literally says it takes an oni to know an oni when talking about suika who she personally knows  her comic is called wild and horned hermit  shes an oni bros
  wild and horned hermit  the real horns were the friends she made along the way
  do /jp/ posters call her a slut lewd sure but slutty
  sorry to tell you this but kasen is pregnant with my child
please stop making thread ops with hammers illustrations you could have chosen any other artist
  why
no matter how look at it that hermits an oni
  if shes an oni how come she could she possibly fit her horns under those cute little buns on her head
  why would you trust a tanooki though especially mamizou whos one of the 3 biggest tanooki that just makes her craftier then the already crafty pranksters that her species is
  because shes not saying that to anyone thats what she believes herself to be the truth
remind me again whats her job as a sage
  we dont know
  sucking dicks
  ah roki making my dick go doki once again
  to become a cum dumpster
  pink lewd oni
  wild and horny hermit
  she left that club when they realized they were actually post timeskip shounen villains
  it would be just like a mamizou to trick even herself
kasen is pretty and cute
  hand
  zun was obviously being ironical why are kasenoni posters so idiot
    probably because she has tiny girly horns  or maybe she sawed them off leaving only stumps
kasen the lewd pink
  because she has tiny girly horns  itd be funny if everyone in gensokyo was wrong and kasen was actually an amanojaku instead of an oni would make sense too because people tend to call amanojaku oni anyway despite them being two separate types of youkai
does she
  always

how much would you pay to get a massage by yukarins gloved hands
  i asked for paizure you senile hag
  whats the asking price
  depends on the type of gloves and the length of the massage
shhhh the grandma is sleeping now
  i love that particular set of webm as i am of dark skinned descent but people would either think im a cuck or trying to shitpost or both
  this looks like some guilty gear xrd 3d model
  i usually think its white s o y children when i see characters getting browned took me a while to realize that brown people draw porn and jack off to cartoons too
  you dont want i know what she does to the naughty ones
  what does she do to the ones she likes
  she likes the naughty ones
  god i wish that was me
  reimoo with her grandmother desu

  time to return the favour
  the table is set    100 oj  /jp/  yukari  
  nice
  the things an immortal would find fun will probably differ significantly let alone someone with her mindset on top
  you think highly of yourself  i suppose that is fitting for a maggot to think itself somehow comparable to a human how trivial
  anon i
happy gappy
  this book was a little too good
  m autisic and suffer from speech impairment  what a disappointment
  shopkeeper x sage
  weak comeback
  perhaps i overestimated your resolve
  yes
  is that a  could this be
  nah no way
  i want to snuggle with her
this morning i dreamt that yukari turned me into a cushion for her to sit on
  it was hot though i got the boner
  hey i think you got the wrong door hakurei shrine is two blocks down
faq      previous thread  
first a julia uncensored leak now airi suzumura  are we about to see a flood of leaks
  what blacked jav coming for 2019 first trimester are you hyped for
    youre about 4 or 5 months late to the party
tfw torrent significantly slows down the browser/internet    the fuck am i doing wrong use qbittorrent if that helps
why wont she announce her next title
rip in peace  drug addiction debts forced to do scat and bestiality and then retire just to get arrested
  i had that as well lately not really sure what causes it
negro gangbang  
meet the no 1 gigolo in japan akaya kunugi  asian boss  
  i dont recognize her and have searched please tell me her name
  i thought her face was cute before but i dont mind the new one her new boobs however look fucking terrible
  
  thanks
  i think her new boobs and face really boosted her confidence and made her feel sexy and feminine her performances are superb now shes a thirsty sucubbus in each scene ready to devour every dick presented to her  far cry from the submissive flatchested loli she was typecasted as before her transformation    her newfound confidence and satisfaction with her transformed look shows in her tweets too
  yeah thats true her performance in pred116 was really nice
  fuck you american
  akari mitani is a goddess        she was way more beautiful before sure her performance improved but the cost was too high
  but no anal
  can someone tell me who it is so i can avoid her  in the future please
  yuu roasted
i need more mommies in my life
whats the best torrent site
  where the hell is orihara yukari  i miss her everyday
  who this
  none every chinese group has their own site hottest current chinese group doesnt even use torrents
  ah i see you finally resort to that moral argument look i pirate jav too but i dont need any convoluted excuses to do that but i do realize that i dont have any input on the direction of the industry unlike paying customers   that goes for you too your scheme involves other people buying to keep the industry profitable while you make statement by not buying that wont work the only way it to work is when enough people share you mindset which will put significant dent in their profit which ive mentioned before but you call that as invoking absolute guess what your scheme wont work without it until then keep dreaming you make any changes with that attitude
so i found out nana ayano is doing delivery health but she also got pretty fat since she retired from jav
  the sex industry is interesting isnt it
  i pirate jav too but i dont need any convoluted excuses to do that  wait what  you believe one should buy av to support av but then for no apparent reason pirate it    your scheme involves other people buying to keep the industry profitable while you make statement by not buying  nope this isnt some form of activism   just reasons why i personally have no problem with piracy     the only way it to work is when enough people share you mindset   that argument isnt even very strong and can be applied to your position too  if one alone is just a drop in the bucket it doesnt matter that she pays for her jav either
shoko will never pop your cherry  its not fair
  nnpj307 is just as good bro
  what are you doing here
  looking for hot jap chicks to jack off to bro
rui hazuki with another anal title in 2019 one anal title every month it looks like
  nothing out of the ordinary though so thats pretty lame
  took her long enough
  whycome she take so long breaks between releases
  these kind of javs are always so boring is like the male version of dead fish
  these are my favorite because the woman is in control
  file name  dude thats not suzumura airi      
  loving the newer version and cant wait for porn of her
    are there any actresses that you are close to in your private life    there are some that im close with but on days off we dont go out with each other i really am a shutin on days off i dont go outside and just watch anime all day for myself a day off means not taking one step out of my house even when im off work and i even have just a errand to do i think to myself that this isnt a day off    how about going to city hall or doing a little shopping    no way not taking a step outside watching anime and just being lazy at home makes me happy    literally /our girl/
  thats called depression anon
  who ded
yu shinoda has to be the hardest working girl in jav it seems like she releases a new movie every 5 days
  ywn exchange line contact with her
  being happy at home watching anime   depression  what
  this girl nao jinguuji is in everything credited or uncredited
  fake
  asian  bossss
  wrong
  she has been my javfu since bf118 im proud to say i have most of her titles been saving her stuff since 2011
  meh can you blame him i wouldnt put it past agencies to tell their performers to say certain things in order to garner more support
mee so horney
  conspiracy theory
  no girl will ever look at you like that
  you can pay a girl to pretend just like the girl in that webm
  not the same ___
  which movie is this
  nao doesnt pretend shes realer than life
  you believe one should buy av to support av but then for no apparent reason pirate it  i just want  to counter the initial argument that the actress dont get paid per copies sold so no point buying anyway and so i explained basic logic on how any industry works they output products that when bought gave them profit to make more products meaning more works for everyone involved which in av case includes the actresses so if you decided to buy stuff yes you got to support them in a way   its that simple regardless any intrigues happening behind the door av as an industry lives by this simple cycle  my problem here is your counterarguments are mostly overblown/exaggerated generalizations yeah sure all thousands of those actresses are like satomi yuria financially surely all our money went to kameyamas pocket and everyone is yakuzas victim etc etc also i said i dont need any excuses not that i have no reason plenty of legit reasons not to or not be able to buy av legally like r18s shitty service or hell saying that youre not into jav enough to spend your money is acceptable you trying to argue that its morally right is just that excuse justification that i dont need  can be applied to your position too  and just like you its not a form of activism too or blind hope with this one purchase it can have significant impact but you do something making clear statement on what you support and that youre indeed the customer of the industry and unlike mere votes or election at least you get something tangible in return    tldr youre overthinking some basic stuff that i shouldnt need a wall of text to explain
anon
im your christmas present anon
  no
  disgusting hags
whats with the rei spam dumb whore doesnt even do porn anymore
    apologize  mizuna rei will forever be remembered as one of the best jav stars that shined brighter than your ass from the pain of denial
  how can i find out whats coming
  search dmm or any jav info repository with the 黑人 tag
    i wanted kurea anal debut but this is better  thanks santa
  no the fact that youre spamming the same pics is already bad enough
  youre wrong
  who is this dirty whore
how do i tell what the exact fov is for a vr video so i know what to name the file for littlestar ive got psvr    im assuming its 180 degrees because thats what it looks like but i mean i dont really know
  mental illness
  they are different
  if theres black shit on the sides of the video like in pic related its 360    if theres not and the video fills the whole frame its 180
  bullshit  the ones theyre drinking and make sikky faces while touching reis boob are in pretty much every thread
  the ones theyre drinking and make sikky faces while touching reis boob are in pretty much every thread  good  for once someone with the good taste
poopoo
  ty i assumed wrong it was actually 360
  tomie unlimited she got the titular role in that movie
  that botched plastic surgery face  wtf the female avs guy is miles hotter  still i respect him for stealing money from ai hoshina and the other girls so they keep doing porn
  this is the guy who robbed them of their live savings
getting really tired of all the fake cum in julias wanz movies
  stfu
    damn
how do you like the new thin shorthaired ayano nana
  thin ayano nana  gonna need more friend last time i remember her being brought up it was about how she was getting thicker
     wow fucking ecstasy
  generic asian bimbo style  boring
  code
  she was at maximum thickness before taking hiatus last year now she returned with all the fat gone
im in love with ririka
  one day i will stick my penis in sonoda mion until then i will have to make due with successfully masturbating to her i wish shed get fucked in the stuff she wears in private or posts on social media shit is so hot
   she got thicker after the hiatus only recently she slimmed back down            cute but i wish we had a proper chubby nana title we never did the closest we have is her last title before the hiatus but even in that she never gets fully naked in order to hide it
  uso dayo
  dont know if his story is real but good on him if it was god made him retarded and he turned it around with his looks and got gifted a lambo
  how do i tell what the exact fov is for a vr video so i know what to name the file for littlestar ive got psvr    just going from my experience so far overunder videos dont seem to require anything other than the _ou tag at the end the fov has come out perfect with just that    sidebyside vids have typically been 180 except for ones that look like the what anon posted here   those are labeled 360 the ones that are sort of resemble goggle lenses are 180
    she was really pretty like 5 years ago  now shes fully corrupted with all the anal gangbang blacked enema shit shes too far gone now
fumika x akari lesbian video  no foot fetish involved  shame on them
miae351  holy shit do rui and misa have a feud or something they seem to be compiting to see whos the anal queen
    not everyone has a foot fetish
  something wrong with your brain  its the same brain region as for liking pussy
shoko s1 title was waaay better than the shitty shoko/yua shit
  great performer and nice ass too shed be perfect if her tiddies were a bit more perky
  is she friends with akari mitani i see them both together in a lot of titles and they have good chemistry    anyway both are awesome
  whos misa
  agreed i understand using fake cum for still photos for the cover but using it in the videos is just stupid and ruins the scene
  misa suzumi   i prefer misa suzumi though rui has gotten a bit stale  miae279  and juy611 were the only good ones
  forced to eat cum that her mom snowballed out of her pussy  would you rather fuck an animal or do this imo the animal thing sounds better
  shes cured by yuu
did she retire i just started to like her  what the fuck
  
best ass girl is retiring all the best girls seem to be going recently
  bye whore
  all of my favorites are going away and i havent even found any new ones fuck
  oh no well good for her she is one of my favourites rip in pieces
  i watched an old julia movie yesterday and she really wasnt such a huge cum dodger back then every guy shot it on her face and into her mouth and she didnt even spit it out immediately but kept it in while sucking the dude off
  nooooooooooo this cannot be happening what could she possibly be doing now _
  sad but she gave us many years worth of fapping srly 40 pages in javlibrary in just 5 years of work     whats even sadder is that no swallowing or anal
  salsa
  bban122    its pretty great it features actual directing and acting
  she owns a bar
  do people get to fuck her at the bar
  nah she or her staff just serve them drinks and so on    oh shit i need to go there and order an asahi and when she serves me a drink i wink and say thats not what i meant
post some kino asahi    hnd351
anyone know the actress name who is wearing blue jav library is not bringing up any names
i love watching tight pink pussies getting creampied good in positions other than boring old missionary    fc2 ppv 884956 cum shot echichn good noisy prone bone creampie  fc2 ppv 982016 lawson kashima kos doggy creampie  fc2 ppv 970408 eromanga sensei cosplay doggy creampie  fc2 ppv 985469 eromanga sensei pj cosplay prone bone creampie

best julia movies
  her name please
  mao kurata
  thank you
    who is it
  kind if a wash sure she has the best ass but they didnt seem to notice flav198 last scene is goat tho guess well never get gems like this now
  are you sure its not just a time frame thing instead of an actress thing how old was the video i remember years back facials were more prominent then the creampie craze came and took over and the cum is going inside a censored pussy instead of their face
  who is it
  tadai mahiro now go find her movies and fap furiously to it
any site where i can search/sort girls based on bwh measurements
damn it would be nice if shoko and yua swapped stuidos shokos thighs looked nice never noticed before too bad she isnt very good at sucking dick and fucking lol
  nah she lost a bit of weight now that she returned she was peak fat when she retired though knowing nana shell gain all that fat right back
  are you being sarcastic because they just did
  how do we solve the sakura mana cloning problem
  yea i know but its not permanent
  i find tadai qter than mana ever was still not as good performer but shes just starting    also holy shit maria aine has one of the most beautiful shaven pussies i ever seen in jav
  im becoming enamored with this plastic whore please dont post her for the sake of my wellbeing
  feel free to leave this thread anytime
anyone mention how youtubes tokyo paro paro took down all its content kind of wish i had downloaded a few of their videos
  i read somewhere that kanames channel became tokyo paro paro not sure how that works though
 i dont know
  this is something else
  so hawt
  such a fucking succubus whore i cant wait to see her swallowing and doing anal srly i want to see her drool as they shove dicks in her butthole
  sinderella  rip
  its tokyo paro paro next now    biggest loss would be videos featuring riku seems like she wont appear much or at all for this new channel    theyre all from the same agency tpowers and the agency is likely the one controlling the channels
      ok i think im a pedo i cant stop fapping to her
you will never fuck your waifu  you will never taste her  you will never smell her  you will never talk to her  you wont even have a change to stand next to her  she doesnt even know of your existance    meanwhile shes doing grown up stuff like having sex with real people and moving on with her life while youre still alone in your room replaying the same video and stroking your dick to 480p pixel images being consecutively shown at 29 fps you pretty jacking off to your computer not the girl in your computer and basically youe a loser faggot so how does this feel to make love to your computer faggot
  where to cop
  a change
  i built my computer myself does that mean i masturbate to my daughter 
  i bought a vr headset and stockpiled a bunch of vr videos because i know its the closest im going to get to my javfu
who is she
  dunno man i can barely tell if its momonogi through all those filters
    
  thanks man
considering how small in numbers the male talent in japan is the average av actress probably has taken about the same amount of dicks as the average american college girl
  my personal favorites are ebod506 midd856 mide062 mide301 this one has subtitles going around and it makes it even better mide325 rki121 and xv892
  what if i watch av for the lulz and absurdity those girls have gotten themselves into just for that couple of grands with no personal desire ever to meet them ever since they are just jokers to me
  what is she thinking about
  thingken about all the money the pathetic fans hand over to her
  based and redpilled
ill show her
  are there another girl with top tier hot bodycute face combination like anri okita
  are you blind or something
  thank god no id drop jav entirely if we had more bogfaced abominations like that
  what no  she went on a trip to america for business because the fans crowdfunded her holid  working hol  oh god dont say holiday  uh business trip  serious work stuff
  still bitter that you didnt help fund her and missed out on her photos
  you mean the photos where shes clothed and standing in front of famous american landmarks  as opposed to the moving pictures of her fucking naked on camera
  looking into the future its not that unlikely  1080p is a quality plateau  cant produce the same vanilla stuff with the sameish girls forever
  how come her photobook still hasnt been scanned and uploaded on the internet yet
  her same public sfw photos get posted here all the time  i dont need more
  doesnt understand the concept of entertainers  doesnt know people do this to people for less    how fucking dumb are you just because its porn makes it pathetic fucking sheep
  but all entertainers are pathetic and fake
  entertainers you mean people in general are pathetic and fake
  if you mean by people only japanese its true  
  whatever justifies you pirating your javfus videos and continually wanking to them
  i noticed dancing like in this webm happens a lot at the beginning of javs when they roll the intro credits etc but are there longer videos showing just these sort of dances maybe compilations or anything
  its funny all ive heard in my entire life from successful or people in general is fake it until you make it sound familiar
  two wrongs dont make a right
  lefty loosey righty tighty
  only a few do that and the hoi polloi disdain such behaviour   there are even english idioms to that affect such as dont judge a book by its cover
  k
when somebody offers to pay up to 9 grand for your old clothes you know you had made it
  falling for yakuzas money laundering scheme
its revealed
  its more of a money laundry scheme
  not a womb tattoo  what a waste

  my favs are   mide582  mide553  mide500  mide448  mide430  mide419  mide409  mide379
  she looks disgusting
miku pls  
  do 3d girls ever have womb tattoos ive never seen one in jav
does any kind soul out there have tia111 ive tried downloading from the filesharing site that i found a link to subyshare but it always fails
    this isnt jav is it
  irrumatio goddess isnt jav  
  good suffer
  for what purpose   it seems like a musthave for plump mature lovers like myself
any jav where the actress looks like a closetoreal loli
  yeah lots of stuff from the studio code mum you pedo
  laugh tracks
  are the yakuza even real  i always assumed they were a fabrication of movies  tv kind of like the mafia
  the mafia is absolutely real and so is the yakuza the are just more businessoriented and less about tradition now
tfw no hirose umi gf
   no new hirose umi jav  ftfy
it still amazes me how much porn this little island produces

i miss nana usami
finh073  i have a feeling this reina nagai girl is going to be the breakout star of next year and were going to see a lot of her
  this little island  anon japan main islands spans from portugal to germany
halo where do you download gravure image sets of jav actress that went legit sukebe nyaa doesnt return results

is it true that in japan the yakuza will literally come to your house and beat the shit out of you if you pirate jav

  is she really half poo
    is this girl special the cover makes it seem like shes special
uncensored vr  dont mind if i do    
  watching that blacked jav  its a scene with that fat guy that has a short dick  instant skip
does anybody remember the name of that loli girl who have a weird bump on her back
  my man they have over 120 million people they are like the bollywood of porn they keep pumping out titles
mosaics are getting bigger and bigger  censhorship is everywhere to the point outdoor filming is literally full screen blurr rooms with posters electronic devices etc are also blurr af  rips are getting worse  jav is dying guys
  ydr f2 series are saving the whole industry  ydr fc2 grings back pre 2008 jav vibes    post your fav fc2 videos

ayumi shinoda is the greatest jav artist who ever lived pretty girls get rekt
  what are her best movies
  a few of my favorites the order doesnt mean anything just the order they showed up in my ayumi folder  jux827  warc001  lzdz003  athh003  ssr078  caribpr 081916_002  t28434  heyzo1184  1pondo 052116_303
  i question that you even have a vr hmd  vrbangers repacking jvrporn releases where the scale is totally off everyone is extremely tiny is not newsworthy since they are unwatchable
whats the consensus on her 
is rion/shion utsunomiya really retiring  no announcement or special video or something  she was one of the most popular s1 actress is it normal for a big star to just dissapear like that    her videos are the only porn that i watched since 2015 no seriously    ive translated some 5ch post but it seems they didnt know if shes retiring and why too
  she literally did the same thing transitioning from shion to rion some girls just dont care for social media she fucking ruined herself when she became rion anyways
    fc2 ppv 821825  fc2 ppv 789810  fc2 ppv 767087
  19k members  why tf is 6th yamaguchigumi so powerful
i like jav and all but i dont think i could ever be as into it as you guys are
  i think she is all her social media was wiped and one of the last things i remember seeing on her ig was s1 throwing her a party  shes disappeared plenty of times to then reappear with a different alias pretty sure she did this to be more elusive through all this she never disclosed her real name however she did leak her real or maybe it was just another alias some speculate thats the reason why we are not seeing her now  maybe permanent this time considering she was making enough bank to retire and was too famous to reset her reknown    plenty of people trash her and call her low iq brainrot buts shes the only high class actress that never took a creampie fuck /jp/  always been a fan but even i will admit that her latest videos were a bit boring and her tits were deflating and although thats been the case shes been the last girl ive been eagerly looking for updates depressing to see months go by without one    is it normal for a big star to just dissapear like that  yes      she ruined herself when she fixed her teeth desu
  mosaics are getting bigger and bigger  they really arent    rips are getting worse    stfu dumbass rips are getting better and more accessible even more when  theres plenty of retards sharing videos on their dumb moneizting websites and tube sites    jav is getting to known in teh west that pisses me off    jav is dying guys  no its not its probably just doesnt feel new to you
  thz  fucking chinks rip a bd worth shit
is it just me or is it harder to find seeded torrents for films just 2 years ago these days  what gives
i want a cock this big
  mosaics are getting bigger and bigger  lmao you aint seen old shit before you could literally post some of the worsely afflicted sex scenes on a sfw board and no one would be able to tell what is going on
  im literally watching yua aidas titles right now their mosaics are smaller
  theyve been getting smaller and smaller for a while to the point that they only covered the actual genitals and they were still small enough to make out the details then they started getting bigger again and were at the current point where you should be able actually post dicks and vagina in safe boards since its impossible to understand what they are supposed to be without the context
  a lesbian bar arent those very popular there in tokyo and other areas
  is this girl still around i havent seen any releases from her lately after the cosplay one
  is she really half pooooooooooooooo
  jav is dying guys    lesbian jav is keeping the business alive look at the releases from this year hell lesbian porn is dominating the industry thats no joke
so many torrent sites are moving on to 3 gig  high def uploads only i miss all the standard 12 gb files my hard drive storage situation is getting out of hand and i dont know what to do i already have 2 4tb drives dedicated to porn and am filling up a 3 tb external drive much more quickly than anticipated
  yes shes still satisfying me every month
  fuck lesbian porn sick of this gay shit popping up more and more  girls dont know how to fuck girls they need to get goro in the mix
  is  those data is pretty old and there was a major split in 2015  more members makes you the most powerful  gotogumi prolly controls more of av
  yyou too
  i assume youre not familiar with one release per month schedule of these studio exclusives    find some streaming sites and rip the hd videos from there usually openload or rapidvideos downsize the hd videos into 12 gb range while the quality is still good enough preview them first before ripping though sometimes the downgrade in quality is too noticeable
  numbers isnt a good indicator of power  nigga if the yamagcuhi called the other dudes to meet em after school in the deserted parking lot its clear who the winner will be
  girls dont know how to fuck girls  you havent seen how lesbian amateurs make other girls cum like niagara falls easily also tribadism is an art form and can make a girl satisfied until she wants more
  would that be a gay orgy the yakuza is gay as fuck
you will never be tricking young naive country girls into doing av with your yakuza bros  seems like such a comfy life  promise them a modeling career maybe even a tv/movie star someday with the exposure  drive them out to a remote location for a shoot then show them the fine print they signed that if they dont suck these dicks on film theyll be bankrupt by breach of contract fees  then slowly corrupt her into a full blown av whore as you rake in the profits through lonely virgins
  you thought about splicing the movies so you only watch the scenes
  i for one do not miss 480p buy larger hard drives theyre not that expensive
has futaba yoshika retired 
  i second this but also propose you look into streaming and antihoarding habits  if you have 8tb there is never the case where every single title is indispensable
  she fucking ruined herself when she became rion anyways  why because of gyaru or something      theres a lot of speculation some said because of she told her real name like you said nami if im not mistaken some said her contract is done and shes simply didnt want to make another theres even an unknown jav star that got hiv and they thought what if its rion no one knows  ive read 5ch jp imageboard scanlover akiba online 4chan reddit but no one really know why she retired    shes been the last girl ive been eagerly looking for updates depressing to see months go by without one  yeah me too  actually i never really into porn/jav in general   i dont know why iam a little obsessed ever since i found rion/shion utsunomiya
  every single title is indispensable  its like you dont even care about your javfu   sure the popular stuff will always be around somewhere but for some less popular stuff its already hard to find streams and healthy hd torrents for stuff thats only a few years old
  i think her face is a tad horsey but her videos always make me nut
  shes uggo hot it just makes her more charming she also has great artistic talent and nice expressions
wanz814  theres no indication from the cover but this is nonstop creampies from fat fucks willing to do sloppy seconds
  that bod  nnhhhhggg
  still not a decent rip  even the hd have like 20 of the screeb covered in yellow letters
  fuck lesbian porn sick of this gay shit popping up more and more    this is nothing new lesbian porn will always stand on top no matter what the gays are control of porn industry now
guys lets be real the cutesy acting does not work well for sluts  sluts should just act sexy
  examples  dont say ewwka i just ate
  any good oneechan actress  slutty oneechan works  slutty imouto
i still miss suzu takachico emiri ikeido ozawa kurumi and shuri ayame
any anal older sister that are into it titles ive seen anal younger sister ones but not the former teachers ane mothers will do if theres no other option
  were talking 8tbs here  lets be generous and say youre only keeping 610gb rips all maxed out chances are youre still hoarding  and on top of that if youre committed to these high quality rips then i guess youd be shucking those wd 8tb drives so were beyond economizing for hard drives
  you just need enough space to keep 2 copies of your waifus films i dont think theres any actress that could fill up more than 1tb
  ozawa kurumi  this one hit the hardest because you got to see the tantalising covers and screencaps of all the unreleased stuff
mee so horney
  emiri ikeido  wish she did more than 4 titles especially considering how enthusiastic she got in the latter 2
  all her titles in fact her faces in the debut was amazing
  cute boi big tits
  my friend went to japan and defeated eight yakuza clans and received their badges as a proof of victory    hes now allowed to challenge the four yakuza kings in the region
  that senju mon  naruto is real
i found her uncensored release hehe
what went wrong
  idolshit
the only thing ive seen was the pilot were they performed in school uniforms and flashed panties around so based on that id say there was very little originality considering how late it entered the 2d idolgroup wars and the seiyuu were literal who tier
wugchaaaaaaaaaann
  i heard wug新 did fairly okay for a typical seasonal anime although i guess they were aiming for a full multimedia idol franchise in which case thats not nearly good enough  for my part i tried to watch wug s1 because the premise seemed appealing and dropped it after fifteen minutes    probably yamakan had something to do with it
  who tier  not so much anymore though
  i dropped wug s1 in that episode they performed in a spa/onsen or something full of old fat men
on top of what others what pointed out the bad color palette for the most part didnt help idols are supposed to be uplifting not depressing
wugchan ganbare
  the depressing nature of it could have worked fine if the anime didnt go full yamakan having i1 as the rival group was a good idea but yamakan turned it to 11
  explain further im not into idols/seiyuus
  they didnt drop the main anime and made more wug zoo instead
  thats actually what i really liked about this series there is plenty of uplifting idol stuff already so having something different is appreciated and in general i personally cant stand usual ones too bright to my tastes probably idols genre isnt my type of interest    also i liked the the art style of s1 and movies which they dropped in s2 unfortunately it was somewhat strange but at some point i took a liking to it    anyway its really sad to see that it doesnt get much attention and probably wont even get new series anymore
    its been almost five years since wug started and only two of them yamashita nanami and tanaka minami have enough outside roles to overthrow the number of wug reprises so the majority of them are still nobodies
  wug was a career killing gig
would you give them your popsicle
 ﾟﾛﾟ 
why do they want my popsicle in the first place
  if by popsicle you mean penis then yes  if by popsicle you mean popsicle then no
  why are they in their underwear
  so that the popsicle melts quicker
no but i would put my penis inside a little girls vagina
thought i was on /qa/ nice going jaypee
  anzu took theirs
i dont want to molest a fictional child
  its not molesting if they ask for it
  how can anzu be so greedy
god damn it /jp/ i was browsing this board at my workplace not really worried of gazes from my coworkers because its a blue board when suddenly this thread with that pic in the op appeared just as my boss walked by and he got so flustered and angry that he fired me    what the fuck man
  you have only yourself to blame for browsing 4chan on the job
  i want to tongueclean anzus stinky neet feet
  atsui
  why not get their own
  its hot outside
  i an african american hard working employee am so happy that i got a promotion from this ordeal
  but i only have one do you think they are ok with sharing it
  shes barefoot in most of her free time i doubt they smell bad at all
  nah
  what
  then im sure after a good tonguecleaning with some careful attention to her toes will leave them spotless  id do it every day though just to be sure
  this is too erotic
  im not sure if she would appreciate that all that much the power high might give anzu some satisfaction but actually seeing whats going down in front of her might end up ultimately repulsing her    regardless i too would pay extra attention to the corners of her toenails after im done i would just end up caressing the balls of her feet with my cheek    i suggest a good facial shave beforehand
  what are you talking about  its all just good fun
  a short beard makes a girl tickle
i want to have sumata with both
  weird browsing and just heard some black guy in management got a promotion
  you what
  you heard me
  at the same time
  yes have them do a cunny sandwich around my dick
ami and mami are not for sex
  what are they for
these twin middle schoolers shouldnt be allowed to be so erotic its not right its not moral
happy birthday hibiki
  puffy
their lust for each other is too much
  gay incest is wrong
  why
  because its homosexual and incestual
  that doesnt explain anything
    if lesbian wincest is wrong then i dont want to be right and neither do they
      amiamimiamiamimamiasavemeamianonmiamipleaase        
  shut the fuck up
  what does it say
  the pleasure of being cummed inside
dear /jp/    i am sexually attracted to these idols childlike bodies    thanks  anonymous
  if you dont cum on them gtfo  
  childlike bodies  nonesense perfect breeding age old enough to bleed old enough to breed
  old enough to bleed  fucking smoke you in your apartment you filthy redditor
  would you partake in a threesome with them if they asked
  yes with no condoms
  what if they get pregnant
  i dont see the problem
  would you take responsibility
  ill get them to get abortions so we can do it again
  what about their feelings
  i have them in their feelings
  what are you trying to say
  yes but nakazuri and sumata only
  oh i forgot ashikoki
    what
  why are they so disgusted
  they have yet to experience the pleasure of being cummed inside
these twins are too cute
  what happens after that
  the calmness of the postcoital afterglow followed by either sleep or round 2
i opened this thread and now i can sense a mysterious van outside my house weird
  cunny sandwich  that sounds funny
  is round 2 easier or harder
  are you ok
  both
  its very slippery
  how can that be
why is mami generally preferred over ami
  because shes cuter
  ponytail is better than that little duster hair ami has
      theres also a little more to her character i think    forgive me if im ignorant but i think ami is generally just the same energetic trickster while mami became a little more mature as a result of her trying to become her own person after having been amis double for a while i think this gives her a more personal story with p than it does ami
  this
  why are they giving a yellow card
what is the best position to equally pleasure ami and mami while maintaining comfort for all three people involved
  position for what
  hugs and kisses and all sorts of things of course
  fatherly hugs and kisses
  theyll be calling me daddy for sure
  id gladly be their father if they would have me so    wait are they still 12
  the tokachis are 13 now
  close enough
what did they mean by this
  showcasing their strong points
  flat chest  hips not fully developed  small butt  eh
  the best
  stop i can only get this hard
  perfect
  1 year is a big difference
  true but im not too picky plus they could easily be on the early side of 13
  exactly
  exactly what
  exactly that
  whats that
  that is that is it
  whats happening here
dont forget ami
  too late
  she wanted to say play with fire and youll get burned but she said it wrong
  what a dummy
  but she and her sister are equally my dummies
  only if they promise to fight over it
  i dont think they want it that badly
  me rubbing their legs from under thew table
  only one pair of legs  do i want to ask
  me on the bottom
  me as her bottom
what would you do if they looked at you like this
  why is she sitting like that
  maybe her butt hurts
  from what
  from that
  i want to lick every inch of them
  even there
  especially there
    stop being a fuckin wizard to begin with
  what do you mean
    you know it damn well mamichan
  jesus is mami really 13
    according to this pic nope
  dont care would fuck until i pass out or their vaginal walls detach
  fake news
i want to have sexual relations with ami and make mami watch
    she would probably just sulk and ask nicely to join the party you gotta handle them both if youre a true producer
you think there are any producers out there who dont fuck their idols
  no somebody must take care of them considering they arent allowed to have boyfriends
  is it possible to handle them both
    considered their small weight and size i think its quite possible of course you gotta help yourself with some energy drink/food to keep their pace which seem quite high compared to some shitty idols like chihaya
  thats a bit too much butt cleavage
    to tease or not to tease that is the question
  no such a thing
  how do you tease butt cleavage
  those venus dimples are illegal
  how can they be illegal
  they look highly addictive
  i would give one to one of them and get two more popsicles from the freezer for me and the other remaining person we all need popsicles no need to be stingy
    with your tongue
  what do you mean
    this is a blue board i suggest to ask your mom for further details about the question of to tease the butt with your tongue
  is it safe to ask
  what if they only want yours
happy birthday
  shit they can have it then i would just get myself another one after i give it to them
oy vei this is not advertiserfriendly
  thats an hd pic thank you op
which one would you marry
  both since they come as a set
i forgot i had this thread in my thread watcher  nice to know the best twins have lasted almost two months straight
  but who will be impregnated first
  they flip a coin to see who gets it first
  sure its 10 degrees outside anyway
  who would call heads or tails
  no
  why not
  real degrees or american meme degrees
  the only real measurement system is kelvin and it does not have degrees
  kelvin is a gay ass name
what do you think of their outfits
  theyre still wearing too much
  what article of clothing should they remove
  hair decorations
  you mean hair bands
  i guess
        theyre called scrunchies
  you cant remove those
  thanks
can we make it to two months
  it would be extremely painful
  theyre big girls
  they honestly do seem pretty tall for their age
  easily
  why are they holding hands
thats what girls do
  is that true nano

this pic reminds me of that celeb with no waist cant remember the name though
now im truly ready for miku expo europe
  you best remove that anon
i just walked past the venue on the way to my hotel and theres a bunch of people standing in line already
  which is kinda stupid because as far as i know they have numbered seats    well maybe is to be the first ones to buy merchandising
  that looks like a violation of 184 stgb if you were to wave that tonight  freiheitsstrafe bis zu einem jahr oder mit geldstrafe
  mikus modest breasts are a miracle of the universe and no authority should avert people of enjoying them
  its mostly for the merch i guess im planning to do the same but apparently im too late already ill be mad if the tshirts get sold out too soon
im near the venue eating near the train station but is the merch indoor i have a nonvip ticket do the doors open for me at 1800 if the merch does in fact is indoor than im most likely screwed in getting a glowstick unless some anon wants to buy it for me than ill give you the money for it
  if its like paris they will put a van outside and there will be a man selling glowsticks to the line    but yeah the merchandising on the van will sold out first so might need to wait until you get inside to buy some things specially hapis and jackets
  i only care about the glow sticks so i should be safe  if anyone wants to meet up tell me your location and ill come to you i really dont want to come near the fan meetup degeneracy has its limits
  discord meetups must be worse

previous thread     this thread is for the discussion of untranslated japanese visual novels    what are you playing what are you looking forward to what have you finished you know the drill
im enjoying the new anim game but homestay is better tbqh
christ eushullys servers must be getting hit hard its taking forever to dl this 4mb patch
you can recruit the fat former commander of yours in the eushully game  he demands a cost way too high compared to what he brings since hes really just only useful as cannon fodder    kek
  actually hes the only way you can survive multiple boss aoe bombs if you have a lot of units so you better pay up
  oh how does that work
  finally kicked in for me 8 minutes later it downloaded all at once
  i dont know but there were scenes in madou koukaku so i assume there is  but madou koukaku doesnt have actual prostitution scenes for most of the heroines   most of them are just the mc fucking the heroines in the brothel you dont actually see them fucking customers    this prostitution mechanic in madou koukaku really disappointed me whats the point of sending them to the brothel if all youre getting are the same vanilla shit with the mc
  when youre defending かばう directs all damage to him if an aoe has him as a target and gives him bonus phys def during that hit if you level it up and 防御の極み nullifies crits on him tank through one bomb because this guy is slow as fuck and usually wont make it before the first bomb and the rest wont hurt as hard im killing bosses that are 25 levels over my crew pretty comfortably with this
  when youre defending  when you activate defend on him
  looking through the cgs it seems like the two main heroines dont have prostitution scenes but the rest appear to but its hard to tell when its just a chinpo floating in the air
fuck you guys make me want to pause the thing i have going right now and join in on the grasesta hype
  is the pale tattoo girl not recruitable
  but the rest appear to  i can only see two of them the umbrella girl and the angel 
  same no time to play everything i want to play ill probably have to ignore the thread for a while
and since people are playing now i might as well ask see if you can figure out how to complete guild quest 21 im worried that it might lock out something because its a quest from fleurety basically she asks you to explore this place but its blocked off and you need that noblemans permission but once you get the permission a little later its too late and it fails if someone can figure out how to get past that let me know im just going to ignore it on the first playthrough and hopefully nothing ends up locked    i think shell be recruitable eventually but not where im at right now chapter 5
  i think shell be recruitable eventually but not where im at right now chapter 5  well fuck if grasesta is the usual 810 chapters eushully does i guess we wont have her for long then
spoiler that shit you fucks
patiently waiting for quofs review of grasesta
  he still exists
  pretty sure his initial impressions of it are good
  initial impressions are worthless
i finally get to fuck this cutie
  other men will be fucking her too
  not if you dont sell her out
  not really its the same guy doing the fucking each time just someone different watching them
haruka sora in a eushully title  i really hope shes doing some h
huh not only the elf has a cheap contract price but hers also lasts longer than the other party members this is definitely intended since shes a healer
  haruka sora  she better say ちゃろー or im ending it
does the grasesta crack still work after applying the 101 patch
  there is a rape scene but its not caused by you selling her out though there could be some other one but i highly doubt theyd make more than 5 scenes for her  whoever said you can whore out your teammates is this something that happens really far into the game past chapter 5 or did you misunderstand the madam in 睡蘭街 when she says you can bring in girls you find out in the wild
  take virginity then sell em out
  yes
so does grasesta have any bros like diet
  as far as i am in now your excommander officer who got sold into slavery like you kind of counts
i dont like the protagonist in grasesta so far
  why though
  kys moeshitter
  even better a sly calculating cunt bro
spend my evening playing grasesta  realize i have not gotten past chapter 1 even    hhow long is this game
少女百合都市伝説      sounds like a winning combination to me written by the flowers writer even
  written by the flowers writer even  thats a bad thing
whats the deal with the elf teammates  she teams up with random guys and lures them into raping her so she could kill them and she enjoy the fuck out of it im at the point where the fat guy is trying to tell mc the fact but is too scared to do so  like wtf this is so messed up 
  why
now that i can extract the main files i see that theres a scene with the doll clinging to the protags dick    great
breh when i wake up tomorrow superior entelecheia better be up
  i can only assume that being a hot elf in such circumstances and conditions is probably not going to be fun in the first place and this might be one coping mechanism that developed    she seemed awfully nonplussed over the creepy eyed blonde guy acting perverted towards her among others
  what were are you downloading did they release another patch or something
  he means the 101 patch  its likely theyll keep releasing more patches in the future amayui goes up to 107
  the 101 patch from their site
  this surprises you she was obviously more than a little murderous    the elf and the oni both have gangbang cgs and the narcolepsy mage appears to be similar to mylen getting tagteamed by the protagoinst and a fellow demon and most of her cgs are some kind of demon orgy in general the dark amazon girl also gets tentacle raped by a plant everything else is very obviously the protagonist
    ah gotcha  amayui goes up to 107  yea thats why i thought maybe they released another one
any more eushully games worth playing other than these ones
  soukoku no arterial
  reviews seemed mixed so i avoided it
  the dark amazon girl also gets tentacle raped by a plant  thanks missed this one
  fuck your reviews i spit on them
  what about angelchan voiced by haruka sora tell me she remains pure at least
  ikusa megami  ikusa megami 2  what are you doing anon if you must you want to play ikusa megami zero first then genrin no kishougun 2skip 1 after that play verita and after verita go with ikusa megami memoria    himeragi  mine fukaki  meh  rather than these two you want madou koukaku and soukoku no arterial
  what are you doing anon if you must you want to play ikusa megami zero first then genrin no kishougun 2skip 1 after that play verita and after verita go with ikusa megami memoria    archived for historical purposes since i have the rest of the entries in the im series
  why the fuck would you ever recommend someone to play memoria over the original
play エロゲ on android    please give me a tutorial
  because he wont be playing memoria alone but at the end of the series as it is meant to be played and while it cant compare to the rest of the games in the series he wont be able to get into the originals because they are outdated as hell i wouldnt advise anyone to play the originals instead of the standard  zeroveritamemoria in that order
  probably at least assuming pure means not fucked by anybody but the protagonist who obviously does her repeatedly including a threesome scene with the sick girl    the only maybe not is this cg where shes wearing the same whore costume as the oni is in her gangbang cg im pretty sure thats the protagonist though just his arm is covering up the usual tats on his side also theres a variant of it without the whore costume and its the same plus theres at least a couple cgs explicilty of the protagonist where they outright forgot to draw his tatoos  
  kirikiroid2
  why would you even try to play the original im its outdated and is pretty much retconned out of canon a lot of the details are wrong haisherra isnt even a mashin there shes just a talking knife for example    even im2 has a lot of outdated stuff like lekshumi using a whip and having a completely different personality
  probably nostalgia its not like the series is worth playing for the story anyway so none of this matters if you ask me based on im zero   zero is quite playable so if you wanna start with the series going with that makes sense everything else depends on how much you enjoyed it
  its not like the series is worth playing for the story anyway  you played zero and seriously think this
  well they are worth playing precisely because of the mixture of story character interactions worldbuilding ero and gameplay why would you even recommend the im series for only gameplay not to mention the originals to each their own i guess
  madou koukaku    btw this one had the worst reviews all around not counting kami no rhapsody and sankaiou no yubiwa
  it looks a little difficult for me thanks
  madou is far better than those two just the sheer amount of outcomes from your choices is impressive you can even abandon the main storyline and go full conqueror  not to mention it has the best va work in all of eushully games the rts thing is a hit or miss but together with townbuilding and how it affects the plot i enjoyed it very much    if you go magic route for example you can create spirit monsters that take 1 physical damage and cheese through most of the countries because their main source of damage is physical except ranahaim
so is fairychan the main heroine of grasesta or is there no real main heroine
  shes the main heroine
  i figured as much the opening screen makes it pretty clear
are you guys liking it more or less than amayui
  too easily exploitable by the arena hopefully they patch it to not be so ridiculous
sometimes i wonder how these analogies can sound good in the writers mind
  i was bored with amayui right off the bat this is good so far
  if amayui had been structured more like kamidori i wouldve enjoyed it more but its like three fucking chapters where youre stuck with just notwil and notelftits doing nothing but mundane shit like digging wells and collecting herbs people joke about how kamidori takes 40 hours before you get to the first h scene amayui takes 40 hours before you have a full party and are allowed to do anything besides play in the dirt
  this is cute
  kamidori prologue  recruit yuela  recruit servalwi  recruit emelita  fight reaper    amayui prologue  recruit fia    kamidori chapter 1  explore mins/create aht  exterminate lake monsters/recuit suina  investigate forest monsters/recruit crayl    amayui chapter 1  dig a well
  you didnt like digging a well wtf is wrong with you
  maybe i couldve stomached it had it not been for all the drivel about how it was all your fault and long explanation that moving chunks of mountains has consequences and how the village was utterly hopeless to do fucking anything on their own they were trying to pass off a tier 1 sidequest as a super important main quest
  yet amayui is heaps better than kamidori
  naw
  not that anon but i think amayui has a better lategame compared to kamidori but kamidori has better early game amayui is helped a lot by having only one main heroine kamidoris plot and/or writing doesnt make much sense in the latter parts of some routes
  part of this is because kamidori has a static central hub with an ever expanding list of locations further away that offers some degree of autonomy whereas amayui feels really linear for nearly the entire game
  because its linear but thats not bad linearity is better than poorly done more open games
  its not inherantly good either especially when all youre doing with your linearity is frivolous bullshit
    to be honest unless you really design everything around it multiple routes are shit in rpgs anyway better have it linear with some optional content once in a while
send help im in love
  what happened to her nipple
  its an itty bitty nipple
fuck off eushully what is this hidden wall bullshit made me stuck on a room for 20 god damn minutes
is there an easy way to repeat voice in grasesta without having to open the log
  theres a voice replay option in the tab on the right side of the screen
  i was hoping for a keybind the side menu takes just as long as the log unless you keep it locked open
should i just keep all the lads on my payroll in grasesta its easy hp
just finished totono today what are you guys opinion towards it
  for a game in which every single character is an unlikeable cunt it at least held my interest for long enough to finish it  i still think the ntr was going too far even if i ended up fapping to it
  i already know that scene is going to cause a shitstorm
  once its localized i mean almost everyone has seen that one webm so theyll be expecting shit like that but probably not ntr out of nowhere
  every single character is an unlikeable cunt  even yuutarou
  cool concept not much going on otherwise  the protagonist had a cool name
for anyone else as blind as i am thats looking for the 神硫石 look for these tiny twinkles at the sandwaterfalls one per floor
  jesus christ  im barely in chapter 1 and my autism senses are telling me im missing so much shit stuff like this just confirms it
  same here now im gonna be even more of an autist staring at random shit and hoping to see sparkles
  wow thats pretty bullshit its looking like theres a ton of stuff in this game thats frustrating or abusable that could be fixed with a really simple balance patch that eushully is never going to put out obviously    more and more im convinced that they lost all their talent with the anastasia fiasco and kamidori was either just the last gasp or already well into development when that happened
  also the thing on that screenshot that looks the most disgusting to me is the item slot count    who the fuck thought this inventory system was a good idea
can a moebuta like me play grasesta
  yeah its a moege with prostitutes
  its not a moege    oxymoron
  the anastasia fiasco  what happened
  they tried to spin off a second development studio/team anastasia for making more light hearted games in more than just the one fantasy world they have all of anastasias games were total flops
some of the h in grasesta looks really weird take this for example        whats with the huge bulge between her asscheeks thats supposed to be her vajayjay looks weird to me am i the only one
  mc is fucking her from behind i dont see anything too out of place
  puffy vulva    looks like a pretty standard cg to me
    so what is it can you or can you not prostitute your party members
  i understand that and i realize in that position its easy for the vagina to cling to the dick but it just seems like a bit too much visible flesh to me i guess it could just be the artists style
  i suppose it might be the angle confusing me dont usually see doggystyle with a pov looking straight down
speaking of eushully whats their best game apart from the ikusa megami series and kamidori/amayui i feel like playing some more of their stuff but theres a ton and they are all super long so i dont want to get part way through and find out the games shit
  definitely arterial its my favorite eushully game  i also find it really weird they never chose to rehash the formula like they have with the rest of their catalogue
  they all suck because japanese cant into strategy games
  the earlier eushully games were a bit darker in tone compared to how it is nowadays maybe it had an overall impact on how game development and theme progressed though    i know that himegari and meishoku no reiki had protagonists that are supposed to be outright evilwith varying levels of kindness levels in himegari yet these days your protagonists are either good people or at least not fundamentally jerks
  i wonder if well ever get a non goodytwoshoes as the mc of a meister title doesnt have to be villainous an antihero would be fine too
  uh himegari      i think it was mostly staff getting promoted into management positions kind of similar to the clusterfuck alicesoft threw themselves into around the same time
these stealth action segments crack me up
  uh can you explain about the staff and alicesoft thing
  this game badly needed another qa pass
  alicesoft promoted a bunch of their key writers and programmers to management positions they turned out to be really really shitty at it resulting in about a three year period where they released virtually nothing and existing projects spiraled out of control into huge money sinks that nearly bankrupted the company daiteikoku is the primary offender but vanilla rance quest was a pretty big boondoggle too before magnum came along and added a story and fixed a bunch of gameplay problems
  all the loading screens gets a bit old
  why couldnt they just stick with jment
  aroduc is often more prescient than people give him credit for    
  no kidding i just did the tutorial level and was flabbergasted at how such a small area had multiple loading areas sure each time it loads only takes a second or so but its still annoying
  gonna second arterial really liked the vaguely smtish story
  fuck where is it
surprising to see /jp/ this hyped about something is the moeshit era finally over
  its day one put it back in your pants
  he still exists what actually happened to that baldr sky translation
  doddler posted a few screenshots of the replacement one sekai project is having to do because he didnt let them use his    they were of course full of translation mistakes
  poor eops
  the moeshit days were better than this
  this is a ghost town compared to when kamidori and daiteikoku was first released there were constant backtoback threads on /jp/ for those two games back then same with baldr sky back before dive2 was released
  whens amazing grace getting uploaded
  how sweet the sound
  im pretty sure they deserve it for letting sp get away with their garbage in the first place
  theres actually another localization company with the same acronym now but yeah fuck sekai seeing their contract expire with frontwing hopefully it will be the beginning of the end for them grisaia and nekopara have kept them afloat for far too long
  nah they were planning a kickstarter for baldr sky from the start lying that its for a physical version thatll be more than enough to milk the whales and bootstrap themselves for another couple years of lies and broken promises until they find the next maitetsu or similar to fuck up and repeat the process
  most of the people who pay for sekais shit dont even know how butchered it is unless its straight up unedited and full of typos
    what did sekai do im not following the english translation scene
  aroduc was translating baldr sky sekai found out they took his partial to giga and used it to prove that all the technical problems had been figured out giga lost all their code and it could be localized giga gave them the license sekai didnt tell aroduc any of this before announcing it they then went to him and told him to hand over all his work to them and fuck off he told them no they tried to force him into a draconian contract instead he said no again but the rest of his team ditched him and sided with sekai project while pretty much the entire translation community shit on and blacklisted him for not bending the knee      
  damn eop shiteaters
  theres so much shit theyve done wrong over the years it would be hard to list it all ive been a jop for 3 years now but sekai will forever be on my shitlist     at this point i have to wonder who the fuck even funds their kickstarters anymore i wouldnt be surprised if they fund some of it themselves to try to build hype and get it close to backer thresholds so others will chip in more nothing would surprise me when it comes to sekai nothing
  jesus fucking christ what a mess
    this happened in the middle of maybe precipated by one of dovacs worst tantrums the one where he tweeted that he hated visual novels and that sekai project was never supposed to work on them so the sp fag defense force was out in full force
  theres more to it thats mentioned a little bit in those posts aroduc was against doing a u18 version both because he wasnt sure it could be done and because it would be a ton of extra work sekai was insistent that he had to deliver a fully working one for no extra pay through negotiations eventually they agreed that it would be a separate project then when the contracts came they reneged and the proposed payment was not only less than what they had previously agreed to but that was back in the terms    shit like that is apparently how every email with them went sekai would make an offer or agree to something and then renege or silently change terms in the next email and became hostile when called out on it that shouldnt surprise anybody whos seen how dovac acts and how sp runs their kickstarters though        how much of this shit is still unfinished
am i supposed to believe this thing is anywhere close to getting fat
  how much of this shit is still unfinished  afaik the only thing theyve done since that picture is release koikuma  apparently anything with sayori art gets priority since it hits that all important nekopara crowd that helps keep them alive as for cc hoshimemo and leyline they are still in limbo
  look at those chipmunk cheeks shell be obese any day at this rate
  hoshimemo is out so is leyline 1 hoshimemo was a shitstorm too
i hope im wrong but this feels like foreshadowing
  the first leyline released like a year ago though right those pictures are from 4 months ago
  look at the images dovac posted a bunch of mea culpas for things like how hoshimemo was a complete shitstorm his excuses were im always pretending to be an asshole but im not and i didnt give a shit about these so i didnt do my job
  i want to pet it    hoshimemo was a shitstorm too  haha really poor game never got a chance is it at least better than the meme fantranslation done by djt nerds years ago
  the maitetsu fiasco happened earlier this year too and really soured their relationship with fakku sp was so inept that fans had to fix their mess  iirc it was about allages sprites being used in the 18 version or something along those lines
  
  haha really poor game never got a chance is it at least better than the meme fantranslation done by djt nerds years ago    people say yes but its still garbage        my favorite part they search/replace commas in an entire route and deleted all of them every single comma one route has literally 0 commas
  oh sorry not a route a character one character has no commas ever
  thats the whole point of a company to deliver value to shareholders  wait what i didnt realize sekai was a public company offering stock i couldve swore they were a private company and thus dont have any obligations whatsoever to deliver value to shareholders talk about spewing bullshit out his ass
    i sometimes look at that and remember how people like doddler dxs vvav and moogy all dogpiled aroduc and told him that if he kowtowed to dovacs every demand dovac would stop being such a cunt because he was a fragile manbaby who needed to be coddled what a fucking joke and travesty if people in the translation community had an ounce of integrity baldr sky would have been at least passably translated by now
  by shareholders he means him the point of the company is to give him money fuck all these people telling him he has to put out a quality product take pride in his work or fulfill promises he made in exchange for money the point of sekai project is for people to give him money
why do you guys know so much about the western market
  im xev
  because theyre all former or current eops
  because theyre eops 
  because i started reading vns in english before learning the language like i assume most people here did    if japanese is your first language why the fuck would you be here
  why are you pretending like you dont
  back when i used to read vns in english there wasnt much of a market it was pretty much fan translations only i think jast was around
  ive seen people randomly sperg out about sp a couple of times in the threads for the mobile kusoge i play and i cant look away
  i remember those dark days myself but it took me longer to switch from eop to jop hard to believe its been almost 20 years since i read true love
  i dont
reminder that you cant be jop if jap is not your first language even if you arent actively translating the work to english in your head to understand it the english part of your brain is still remembering what things mean and interpreting them in an english your brain understands it through a gaijin english as a first language eop deep down this still applies whatever your first language is
  funnily enough english is not my first language but i tend to think in english
i should get around to continuing this  i liked the first part a lot but tsukasas a lot less fun to read  there should be more eroge with cute girl protagonists
anyone got more tips/trick for grasesta     i noticed that using the stock option on itemturns like stones/herbs can cause them to upgrade the next time you can use them this might be obvious to others that have played other eushully titles similar to this but its all new to me
  wrong
so to all the anons playing it hows grasestas story so far is it actually good decent
if you guys hate eroge so much why do you play it
  addiction
  because i hate myself
  if youd know what eop actually means english only peasant youd not need that post at all jop is basically impossible to be as japanese people learn english well engrish but still eop is a term you cant really transfer that easily in fact it doesnt even apply to people who know english and another language that isnt japanese its basically just another way of saying dumb murricans apparently you have over 90 of people learn another language in europe while its about 20 in the us   pretty much all comments about why isnt this translated and the really retarded comments about literal vs liberal translation are also often from single language people making them rather annoying to deal with in the community they have literally no idea what it even means to go from one language to another one yet demand this and that eop the real eop    things have warped a bit probably because people just dont care or understand what eop is about but one thing is for sure jop is not a thing youd first need to twist p to mean people to not be half an insult and then basically restrict it in weird ways to mean something like the languages you use to read vns eop and whatever variances of it however are not supposed to be neutral terms so why the fuck would you want to be a jop
    theyre dumb joke names literally no one has or should put as much thought into this as you people
amazin grace is up but still no hello lady
  tsukasas part is really interesting once it delves into his character/plot
  hmm the torrent got deleted for some reason
  love coordination when
  genrin 2 is their best game period including all
  youd first need to twist p to mean people  how new are you while you did get eop right most people consider jop to mean japanese only patrician/player if you cant even get something this basic correct the rest of your rant can be completely ignored as some semantic rambling from somebody a bit too high or drunk which is it   its basically just another way of saying dumb murricans  christ almighty talk about overthinking things
  i wish theyd remake that game they just need to remove karian and its perfect and maybe give the 2nd princess a hscene while theyre at it
we meet again mihiro
play this gem  pretty fun and great art from miito  in the ingame omake a sequel is promised soon aww jeah  except this last product the studio released in 2011    _
僕の日本語はやるじゃないか  どうやったらいい
  stfu
  どうしてかんぁー
  日本語でok
i think i found a very early game source of cash in grasesta i havent seen anyone else mention yet     basically you just keep resetting this area by entering rosas shop or leaving the area and returning and catching the cat over and over since you get a 100g coin each time its not a fast process by any means but every bit helps when you are poor    if youre quick you can grab the cat before it even goes up the stairs but if not youll have to chase it to rosas shop and catch it when it tries to loop around
  cool but find me a source of hello lady superior entelecheia
  heres around where you can grab the cat once you get the hang of it pictured is the coin reward
  white cat is ok too
  oh nice catch    also the first time you catch the cats you dont get a coin only after the first time
  easy cash
  the 2nd guild quest needs you to catch all 4 cats right i guess i am missing one more cat
  i havent even done the 2nd guild quest yet so idk but now that you mentioned it im gonna abuse this trick just in case it somehow vanishes
  either the 2nd or 3rd guild quest you get from townsfolk mentions 4 and cat and i assumed you need to get all 4 cats roaming around so far i found 3
  ones hiding behind the church and another is in the alley near rosas shop
the main heroine appears well sorta
  no ones mentioned it because its a waste of time just play the game youre never really that strapped for money and once the arena gets unlocked money becomes a nonissue even without abusing it killing the big demons whenever you find them also give a bunch of money
  games are also a waste of time yet here we are
amegure has a save already in the zip  nooooooooooooooooo
  just delete it
  its like sloppy seconds right
  hes asserting his dominance over you see all these so called virgin heroines well actually i already dumped my cum in them multiple times have fun
  what color is their attribute  stained white
  hhot
  i love eroge though
superior enchilada when
i found my waifu
  for being a brand new seiyuu she did a pretty good job hell she also got the lead role in amazing grace too so she mustve really impressed both companies to get two leading roles at the same time
  i dont believe you
  say how often is it that an eroge seiyuu eventually lands main roles in the anime industry
  no idea i would think the stain of voicing lewd content would follow them though and make it more difficult especially if theyve been doing it for a while and become typecast i think this is why you usually only see eroge seiyuu voicing anime when that specific eroge gets animated for whatever reason however sometimes youll see anime seiyuu voicing allages eroge
  tell that to kiritani hana  i wish shed go back to doing eroge
  it happens but unless you happen to hit a really really big break usually eroge voice actors dont really go beyond side character type roles for anime    this is probably for a variety of reason possibly unwilling to play the greater corporate politics that come with getting major anime roles agency isnt willing to push them hard they already have an outside career they like and voice acting is more of a side thing  semirelated in my experience most eroge voice actors are pretty ugly and outside of kugyu i cant think of any really popular and well known female voice actors that arent at least decent looking  seriously dont go looking for pictures of your favorite eroge vas
aside from the gangbangs grasesta is pretty good
  you mean specifically because of the gangbangs its good
  what kind of gangbang are we talking about here those with lots of tits or those with lots of dicks
  looking at the cgset i only see two gangbangs are there more
  two is enough
  and one of those gangbangs ends real badly for the dudes
  lolimage too but it involves the protagonist
  why would the mc allow his girl to be gangbanged and even have the audacity to join in
  its the kind thing to do only a selfish prick wouldnt share the things he loves with other people
amazing grace
looking at grasesta cgs i feel some amusement that there is an ending where you seem to become the demon ladys personal servant/boytoy and meanwhile the other one that i saw was where the mc becomes king of gracesta as foreshadowed during the exposition parts
  shes been having constant orgies with demons hes being allowed to join in not the other way around
the mc in grasesta talks big but hes weak as fuck when all the mobs i fight resist him
  hmm i think i may have bugged my game or something i caught all 4 cats before getting guild quest 2/3 and now i cant complete them _
  say that again in ng
  read the quest from the menu right you have catch 4 cats and then find the cat boss however the cat boss doesnt cooperate with you until you hit up the rat king
  fuck yes that first spoiler is exactly what i came here for
  are some at least avoidable or are you forced to go along with them
  forced luckily cant let the moebutas run away from the real deal content
  sure whatever you say  skipped i guess
  good
  i thought you cucks are all about that sharing  you dissapoint me
whats the deal with the onis gangbang scene anyway i assume put herself into massive debt gambling and forced to slavewhore herself out im hoping its something way worse though she kind of pisses me off a lot of time in battle
is everyone and their mother playing grasesta now
  just my mother im too cool to play new eroge
  i bet she likes gangbangs
  only grasesta and amazing grace are the only good releases of this month
  this  i like the new softhousechara game too
  here it is      amazing grace cabbage soft        i will wait your opinion about that game
  i have no mother  i burst out of my fathers testicle
does grasesta have separate routes or is it linear like amayui
  linear kind of wonder a bit why they havent done separate routes like arterial or kamidori but then the last time they made a multiple scenario thing with sankai ou no yubiwa it was a disaster    ps it still shocks me just how dark the chaos/evil endings for sankai ou no yubiwa can be
its strange that this girl gives me an overwhelming urge to uninstall the game  long time a heroine tilted me this much and just with a few dialogues in the prologue
  uguu
  yeah shes shit and her route is bad as well skip her and aois routes
  tsumugi is great man
  you mean uninstall mount the iso uninstall from the launcher
  ao and kamome are the only good ones
  yeah uninstall i deleted the post to correct the typo but that wasnt necessary  thanks
  skip this game
  i really like the artwork of this one while i also think it looks weird for example in this picture the bodies looks so realistic the heads look like they were kind of shopped onto them
  ao  good
  best girl and best route if you dont like her just uninstall
  hot pockets is massively overrated you really arent missing much its basically a little slice of every title key ever made all packed into one game if they had at least included h it couldve smoothed over the god awful nonshiroha routes honestly feels like key is going the way of purplesoft minus the h with regards to how much focus is put on the main heroine and how lackluster the side heroines are    theres also no logical way umi is their child either the way her personality is she either got orphaned in the future or was put up for adoption
  ps it still shocks me just how dark the chaos/evil endings for sankai ou no yubiwa can be  sounds interesting i always like when you have an evil route especially if its not just a short joke route like in aselia
this little gimmick is cute probably wont matter in another 20 minutes but hey can still drop it then
  its not an eroge but you should check out soul nomad and the world eaters its got a very long involved and very dark evil route its a new game deal but thats only so that you get to know everyone and their situations before you do horrible things to them
running through the sewers now and just got a pair of darts for ekthel its nice to see that they gave various weaponry different attack depth or whatever youd call it instead of just giving every weapon type a basic single target attack
  your imagination is almost certainly better than the actual game its set up like heroes of might and magic more than anything where you pick a specific hero to be the protagonist out of a half dozen and then play as them they run the gamut from white knight dude to angel to a couple fat ugly serial rapists its just the latter raping torturing mindbreaking etc the heroines associated with the other routes
fucks sake eushully your engrish is the worst  just call her excel
  for some reason seeing that neko shrine reminds me of that hentai prince anime
  anybody who spends five seconds looking at the insane way almost all japanese companies romanize to english especially eushully and giga and decides that they know what theyre doing is retarded    gracesta is especially bad because theres a shitload of flat out wrong engrish all over the interface
  yeah but especially japanese attempts at westernstyle fantasy names usually come out like theyve got a roomful of monkey on typewriters dictating a drunk with a lisp theres like half a dozen free fantasy name generators out there on the internet too     it wouldnt bug me so much if they didnt have the romanization on everything for some unfathomable reason cool foreign points
  the worst offender imo is main heroines last name リリカルシティーネ becomes lilica rcitine what the fuck is that seriously i suppose it makes a tiny bit of sense of you just sound it out phonetically rcitine but english doesnt work like that
  youre telling me ユズリハルルカナダフニーフィラム isnt a normal perfectly sensible name
  they like it
  more like why did they never make something like madou in terms of routes and choices even some of the side heroines have their own endings there
  and then you realize that mechanic is completely thrown out the window once skill recovery items are abundant and youre just spamming skills that ignore weapon aoe
  hello my name is ユルシュールフルールジャンメール
    those poor girls who have to read out those lines theres no way the writers arent doing this on purpose as some sort of elaborate and slowly escalating prank
  even when they get it right they get it wrong      girls named buddy jeremiah and chad
  yuuruushuuuuruu fuluuuuruuu jeanmeeeruuuu is a beautiful name for a beautiful young lady however
  they should release the outtakes then there is no way there arent any no way
  its arguably worse than that chads last name is never given but shes your mother and your last name is loco    so theres an argument to be made that theres a girl in the game named chad loco     probably not since everyone at the orphanage uses loco as their surname but on the other hand is that any better
  the former started as a character from the polyphonica lns long before she appeared in the vns iirc so i mean theres that
  i figured that would happen those skill recharging feathers are already really strong in ch1 cant imagine later on    i find it highly amusing when they somehow manage to misspell a big citys name its even more ironic in this case because they spent far more time getting the skyline right than anything else
  i honestly dunno if im chad enough to fuck a girl named chad loco
  im old enough to remember when a character named レンレンレンナグサランレンシーアルロオンレンナコラ was a joke about how the name was long and actually a serial number not close to the standard
  how does that even happen its literally トロント
  i mean latter
so when exactly does kamimaho kick into gear just finished the fifth chapter pic related part and im still not feeling it    so far ive only enjoyed the very first chapter somewhat as at least things were fresh back then and i genuinely liked the logic behind mystery solving in that part but every chapter after that is just so droll even the third chapters punch comes literally out of nowhere so theres really no reason to feel anything the protagonist realizes something is up literally in the next scene and then a convenient new character pops up to give clues out of nowhere as well followed by a fucking 1 year time skip followed by more filler feeling chapters because apparently the protagonist loses memory of meeting that character     so not only is the game dangling promises of a proper plot on the players head and then cheaply yanking it away it also conveniently glosses over all the possible drama straight to acceptance without any tonal shift or character development except for maybe nagisa who apparently goes full revenge mode on books despite him not getting many scenes together with kisaki to back it up the drama about him killing books also seems completely silly since were never given any reason to care about the books other than any book lover would dislike destroying books though i wouldnt be surprised if theres a magic book related personality twisting reveal about it and the games whole story later on
  most of the english text in baldr sky was literally run through a machine translator some of it is subtle like mistranslating orchestrator a programming term as conductor some of it like when it translates character names by breaking up the component kanji and translating each one individually is not
  lucle is basically the prophet muhammad in this general for some reason i cant fathom
  massively overrated  by who
  when you dont have any interest anymore just be done with it the writer has a lot of double standard issues going on which even ruins the very ending itself so theres nothing to look forward to in that regard either   its a shame because theres a whole lot of good ideas around but the presentation i dunno deliberately acting as if you write shit but then saying actually i thought this through is only really working if you dont end up writing shit at some point after all there were still fun parts around but its definitely not very polished
  most vn forums vndb egs etc key could publish literal dogshit and thered be a ton of people praising it for subverting expectations and breaking new ground blah blah blah same deal with frontwing too island is a trainwreck at best and yet a lot of people call it kamige
  le my opinion  other peoples opinions  grow up
  hes absurdly melodramatic in a way that somehow appeals to me stuff like being pathologically unable to end a scene without some sort of if only i sighed forlornly into the sunsettype stinger his protagonists overthinking things to the point of paralysis plot twists that seem to exist purely to maximize potential drama etc all the stuff that i can entirely understand people disliking ends up being endearing to me    i started with unmei yohou and loved it despite its roughness i just really like lucles characters and their development also mcs with actual selfawareness    but like i said i can understand not liking his writing its very either it works or it doesnt and christ he desperately needs an editor willing to tell him 15 chapters is too many
  you really showed me
  island is a trainwreck at best and yet a lot of people call it kamige  i was under the impression that was ironic shitposting
  its 85 on egs so there are plenty of retards who genuinely think it is good
  if it was only 4chan praising island i might agree with you
this place has people hating everything anyway as in every game will have at least one person here who hates it and as we all know people who dislike stuff are the loudest gives a more negative opinion than what would be correct    that said id really like to know what people like of the newest key i really cant understand given that is has a ton of objective writing flaws as well
finally find a torrent for serufure that isnt ded    hard to believe its not even 2yrs old
my taste is the greatest
  if i skipped ao/tsumugi i probably wouldnt dislike it as much but since i sat through them i burned out reading the average parts the parts i liked the comedy in the common is extremely funny and on point incredibly solid start to the game and probably the best key has ever put out writing is snappy and the game goes fast shiroha is really really cute kamome route was fun the interactions with original umi were superb kanahana in the pockets route was an amazing performance there needs to be a full game with her as the protag  really the only major problems are the two aforementioned shit routes being required to access the true and the true spending large chunks of time on playing house with a literal toddler that was boring
please use spoiler tags
  the true route would have been better if they didnt make umi retarded
  anyone who really doesnt want to be spoiled wouldnt go into a vn general on 4chan of all places
  people are surprisingly good about spoilers in this thread for the most part
jedal jedal cmon you gotta awaken those crystals
  forgot my image like an idiot
  i wish there was a rape airy eroge because she deserved several gangbangs
  wholeheartedly agree on that count
  who the fuck are you quoting
  is she more likeable than fia of amayui
thats that i guess couldnt really feel any weight or tension in the story since every single long ass speech before a critical moment was followed by like 30 seconds of combat where i just flatten the shit out of whatever boss im fighting except the final boss where it was more like 2 minutes 決死leech is actually a somewhat tough combination  also despite trying to be somewhat meticulous i managed to completely miss the dwarf shopkeepers angels and fleuretys flags most of the sleepy girls flags and a few other events here and there i think most of that is caused by events being triggered by sleeping which is a stupid design since you dont need to sleep at all starting from midgame time to give ng a whirl      nah give me fia any day her voice actress did a great job though considering shes supposedly a newbie dwarf shopkeepknight ladys voices were great too
  whats your playtime
  333526 skipped through most of chapter 1 since i played the trial did a decent amount of 魔王石 hunting though i only ended at 74/105 no long term arena abuse other than grinding out the two 魔王石 in the map outside no real grinding in general which is a great plus for this game i have to say
  what do you use those things for anyway is it worth the effort to hunt them down
  theres a shop at the main guild area where black eushullychan sells you some items and buffs even by the end of ng i could only buy 3 items an absolute fuckton of storage space at your house like 300 an inventory size10 boost and a level cap10 boost that i never hit anyway i assume theres more things in ng but for ng its definitely not worth hunting them down get like 4 to buy the level cap inventory cap and the potion you can sell for 20k and forget about the rest unless theyre not out of your way
  oh and a certain character shows up in the dungeons and asks you to give her one i denied it but maybe shell ask for more if you do give her one youll have to explore that on your own
    alright thanks im finding quite a few just poking around town so maybe i can get by without having to put in the effort to do all those requirement ones
    holy shit i see what you/that earlier anon said about breaking the economy of the game what the hell were they thinking this is more money than ive made so far for an item you couldve picked up in the tutorial mission
  okay she does indeed sell a lot more boosts but no extra items at the start of ng included in it is the ability to unlock higher skill level caps for things like 盗作怪力 etc which was confusing to me because its capped at 5 in ng and theres things that require more than 5 i still wouldnt say its super necessary to go looking for them but grab the easy ones wherever you can
  thats good to know fuck i do enjoy games like this with a lot of hidden/unlockable content but the other autistic half of my brain gets driven up the wall by the thought of missing stuff
fuck still no superior entelecheia
  do the unvoiced heroine lines continue through to the end really makes it feel cheap when their voice suddenly cuts during some convos
  rosalind heffaweffawfufh is a cute dorf
  i hope this is the start of a great career for her   dwarf shopkeepknight ladys voices were great too  both first time newbies along with rcitine
  rcitine  that sounds like a pharmaceutical or some kind of acid not a surname
  shit urist mcnekomimi is a newbie could have fooled me shes amazing her voice and accent are super cute
  pretty small tits for a haeffer
im gonna be pretty mad if when she ends up losing to the dick and going all submissive because this is prime hatefuck material
  i think i read from her own dialogue that the ears are fake      i think she ends up more cordial to you than your own excuseforagarrison commander
does anything cool happen if you let the injured girl suck you off
  you simply get a blowjob scene thats it
  heisei 30  lel who r u quoting  i thought /jp/ had evolved beyond that shitty meme
  you dont get to hire her later on she doesnt give you any items if you do it enough times none of that imagine being a character that exists solely for the purpose of giving one blowjob
  honestly all first routes arent much different in terms of quality if you liked one more than the others its more you yourself they all kinda have the same twist as well although sometimes handled a little differently also short they are fucking short one girl wasnt even there for a big part of her route which was probably the worst of them all she literally didnt matter for anything in general and didnt even have much screentime at all id not be surprised if her total voiceacting doesnt even reach one hour as a main heroine yikes ive got to come to know certain side characters of other novels better    the true route then being essentially the same fucking thing as shirohas is also a problem i was wondering when i was playing shirohas route something is missing something is off yeah well sure was   i also loved the flashback to scenes you didnt have to have the bugs in gameflow how the game was incapable of remembering your first choice in prologue if you skip it saving bugs in general the game was just so unpolished in literally every aspect and then you see people praising the living shit out of it i just dont understand that sure the comedy was good common was fun and all the minigames are really bad though especially the shimamon thingy but common is also short
this annoys me more than it should
anyone tried the 空に刻んだパラレログラム trial what were your impressions with it i need something to cope with that aokana will never get a sequel
  i need to finish istoria first ive only read up to like chapter 6
  thats the same for all the prostitute characters
where the fuck is the rat 親玉 is it from the guy that sells rats
  yeah you got it buy out his stock then dick around for a while until you can talk to him again
  i havent read it myself but from what ive heard its very typical sportsmanga style apparently its similar to aokanas common route although obviously its a lot worse visually and the actual sports matches arent as interesting also theyre 3v3 not 1v1   i really liked istoria and kamimaho though so im still going to read it obviously it wont be as good as aokana because nothing is but it should still be good
  aokana is shit though
  aokana is not hard to top i would be surprised if its worse also visually i like the art style and girls of this a lot better too
if someone played through amazing grace id be happy for some opinion about it at that point its still too early to rely on egs ratings but ive already read that its supposedly taking forever to get actually good so im not sure im not continuing it for now given how damn christmasish the music is all the damn time and how generic it seems at the beginning
would you guys classify ekthel as haraguro
  how the hell is the game generic
  amnesia guy wakes up in another world next to random girl how the fuck would it not be honestly had i not forgotten about the amnesia protag trope being in this i wouldve never touched it amnesia is basically never handled well and just an excuse for lazy writing
the append for grasesta is in the disc with the angel stuff right having a lot of trouble trying to mount it properly keeps showing up as a blank cdrom _
  use wincdemu
hmmmm
havent played it yet but all i see is people talking about either gameplay or porn does that mean the story is as awful and nonexistent as in all other modern eushully titles
  thanks a bunch for some reason vcd wasnt working
  i mean so far the plot as far as i can tell is that you a former slave and your commander and higher commanderwhose premature surrender caused this got sold into slavery as prisoners of war in order to fight against demons along the way you meet other slaves a demon lady who is both interested in you and also trying to bring forth the demon king and also a noblei think shes a fairy who decides to sponsor you everything else felt straightforward so far
  well if you only look at those tropes instead of literally everything else then yeah i dont know how you can say that the setting/world isnt unique though ive been having a good time with it so far i like the focus on art/christianity im curious the direction itll take this stuff
  im not super far in but the setting and circumstances are rather interesting i kinda wish lilica didnt exist or was only a side character though she softens a lot of the atmosphere in a way thats sort of lame would be better to see jeds claw his way up to the top without the huge leg up she gives him    i mean shes cute and all and her voice is great but every side heroine is more interesting and likeable than her so far at least she has heals
  at least the premise sounds interesting
  its one of those this seems really cool i wonder how theyll drop the ball later things for me right now who knows maybe they wont     its a damn sight more interesting than kamidori at least
  i was initially thinking that its a bit of a pattern in eushully games but then cinnamon roll main heroine that contrasts the mc only happened previously most recently in amayuiat least i hear that avaro of amayui is a bit of a shady figure then again you are able to do some really shady stuff in amayui
  i am at least not sure how is he going to get out of one situation where he is accused of being demon ladys thrall if lilica wasnt there to defend him and prove his innocence at least
  you could easily not have that situation happen at all its a hell of a stretch in the first place it only happens because of an improbably combination of fat aristocrat asking exactly the right question out of nowhere and judas deciding for some reason that being perfectly honest is a great idea itd make it more interesting to have jaffar alone know that hes got demon stuff fermenting inside of him maybe itd give him more of an excuse to be the cool tortured loner he very much wants to be
  i like it still at the begining but its very straightforward so far the nation to which the mc is affiliated with as a mercenary is attacked by its neighbor a war near the border which happens periodically between the two this time the reason being some kind of religious festival/anniversary having been besieged and and outnumbered mcss bro character or rather somebody who is only using mc at that point and is at the same time a 100 man commander if i remember that right sneaks out right before being surrounded and attacks the enemy while they are busy advancing on the fortress to crush the enemy supply wagons which will render them unable to continue the siege     to cut it short and omit the details everything went perfectly except for the fact that when they return to the fortress to meet up with the rest of the forces apparently it had already fallen or rather its commander couldnt hold in the stress to save himself and just outright surrendered then they enter negotiations with the enemy commanderone of the heroines where again the mcs bro manages to convince her to rather than execute thembecause their country obviously wont pay for ransom for a mercenary and somebody who has no court rank given their results to sell them as slaves to gracesta where apparently she was headed after the expedition the main factor why she agreed being the mc who killed her second in command and almost alone wiped out his whole unit
  i kind of worry or wonder a bit if yutore/eutre has some really shady ulterior motives that will eventually cause us to fight him later though right now i am mildly surprised that hes actually stronger than everyone else in the first time hes a guest character in your party then again i suppose hes the crutch in that particular scenario
  the main factor why she agreed being the mc who killed her second in command and almost alone wiped out his whole unit  she even tells lily about the mc in ch1 so her opinion of judar changes quite a bit after that tutorial area
  i kind of wondered why was she looking really predatory at judal during negotiations aside from that shes not supposed to be a bad person no and why did she even tell lilica about judal anyway    also was it only judal yutore and the formerbaron who got sold into slavery
  i kind of worry or wonder a bit if yutore/eutre has some really shady ulterior motives that will eventually cause us to fight him later  is eushully going to have the bro character betray you this game y/n  i think the odds are good that hell turn at some point likely out of jealousy
  are the hints of jealousy already there though
  theres a bunch of soldiers from yutores squad around town you can recognize them by their armor which apparently they were allowed to keep theres at least a bluehaired dude and a pink ponytail girl probably a couple others     and youll see what the knight woman is like soon enough still cant believe they gave a main character the name dolphin fishnets though
  aside from that shes not supposed to be a bad person no and why did she even tell lilica about judal anyway  if youve seen her talk with lily it should be obvious shes not a bad person as for why she told her about jude maybe she knew lily was looking for strong people and was testing him i dunno im still really early in as well  also was it only judal yutore and the formerbaron who got sold into slavery  as far as im concerned if they dont have a sprite they dont exist
  well the mc kept mentioning in his inner monologue how he probably wouldve been discarded had he no use for yutore and the guy himself also mentions how he would be troubled if jedal diedmost likely because he has further plans to use him  but i dont know i feel like they wont turn on each other i think he kinda likes the mc in his own way    i see i guess she wont be seeing him as some kind of beast anymore
  are the hints of jealousy already there though  i just had a hunch after reading their moonlight talk right before you meet lily
  also was it only judal yutore and the formerbaron who got sold into slavery  i cant remember but im pretty sure only yutores 100 man squad got sold into slavery because he mentioned to her that every one of his memebers were elite and proof being the mc so they worth more as slaves than on the chopping block
uh anybody know where are the rat boss and cat boss for guild quest 2 are      i get a feeling that its also all part of the plan because given that belgarad treats them like shit anyway going to gracesta cant be that worse or it can be better even
  i keep thinking hes gonna show some hints of turning on jedders because its a eushully game and his character design just screams betrayer but every scene hes in hes got your back and his plots are wholesome in ends if not the means hes a bit obsequious and drifts into questionably gay territory but so far has been pure bro
  but i dont know i feel like they wont turn on each other i think he kinda likes the mc in his own way  eutre says it himself hes the brains of the outfit and jude is his favorite muscle thats the kind of attitude that can cause betrayal eventually  imo eutre has the same kind of attitude as wils friend in kamidori forgot his name he silently watches his muscle get all the rewards and girls while he tirelessly works to just keep up stress building as the danger of the job takes its toll eventually succumbs to an offer to have moar powah yadda yadda yadda
  cat boss is in the main guild hall but you need to have found all 4 cats first rat boss you have to buy a half dozen or so rats from the rat seller down one level then after a bit hell give you the rat boss
save  fuck the 3000 gold whore  fuck the other whore  reload
  isnt that only in one route though and arent both of them both brains and brawn since you need to be both as an alchemist      i guess time will tell
new    
  you need to keep buying mice/rats until you get a special one
  you gotta fuck both like 5 times to unlock the madams scenes
  thanks anon
  the first scene with the painting is kinda nice then the protag wakes up and some voice tells him a lot of shit like youre gonna enroll as a 2nd year student and youre gonna have a helluva time this shit is awful i only played up till when they start exploring town but i dont feel compelled to read on

i wish the clown was my daughterwife
why are fairy bellies so sexual
      delete these
  i like pictures of little fairies where you can tell they dont have pants or underwear but the juicy bits remain just slightly offscreen    is that weird
  is that weird  no that just means youre a normal human male
clown tum tum is for cum cum
lewding clownpiece is wrong  wrong
why is /jp/ 90 lolicon
    because lolis are cute and sexy
  lewding clownpiece is right and everyone should do it
  all adult males are secretly lolicons
  all adult males are secretly loli
  please sit on my face cirno
  i want that puffy pussy on my face  suck the cunny nectar through her clothing
  fat cunny
  thats the purpose of their existence to be used as onaholes
  dont let them know
  nice try i know for a fact thats a hdoujin cover
  clownpieces forehead i want to kiss it
  delete your post and your whole existence
  well shes a fairy  we know where this thread is gonna go
  based
  i want to see that fat cunny being knoted by dogs
      should i know what this thing is and be angry at it
  more undertale shit
  what happened with that anyway i remember when it came out everyone was creaming themselves over some spider chick in it now everyone hates it why
  upset that a pretty good game got such a huge following that its fanbase became a mass of undesirables that often inject it into other things people like more generally though hating popular things
having a tummy like that is a sign of fatness
having a tummy like that is a sign of flatness
    both are correct
  thats the sign of her being pregnant from taking in my semen
i want to ____ the clown
  i want the clown to rub my dick with her feet
  hug and protect  fuck these degenerates
  rape violently
  bad grammar
  rape violently  
clownpiece has body painted leggings
  good that means i can swiftly rape her whenever she is without having to waste time taking her clothes off
  i want to lick the paint off
  that might damage you
i wanna squeeze her thick juicy nipples
  how does one make these images
i wrote a song for clownpiece    shes such a lovely fairy  such a tiptop bloke  if it werent for clownpiece our lives would be a joke  we all shout her name when she walks into town  hooray here comes clownpiece cant keep up your frown  she wouldnt hurt your mom or dad wont hurt you or me  the mention of her very name fills us all with glee  its kurapi were happy  its kurapi yay    i hope she likes it
  people realized that it was shit and moved to other things while the core fanbase became ponytier
why is she america
  
  thanks
clown tummy
i hope that sexy 8 year old child takes off her costume and we can watch videos of older men pounding her little cunny
  and fill her kiddy womb with lots and lots of virgin neet seed and let her raise the bastard child alone 
  no way  i wouldnt want to ruin a little middle schoolers body by getting her pregnant  its perfectly fine for the little ones to use plan b in my experience  you just gotta hang around them for an hour and a half afterwards to make sure she doesnt vomit
  wtf
      its clown piece not cow piece
  666_p0  demon fairy  the power of christ compels you
  clown cunny is so thick
  why her navel
  more like why not
  so she does get pregnant
    explain further and more detail
  give that fairy a sammich
is clownpiece the most sexual character to the date
  i need the rest
cum inside the clown anons
  thats what i intend to do at least three times without pulling out
  no you dont trust me in this
  unless its scat/guro/shota yes i do
based
  clappy rhymes with bitchi
  now this this is cursed and chaotic image  you may now delete it
  theres something very wrong with her ass  cute feet tho
too sexual
  shes fully aware
i want to squeeze her nipples
  get down with
how soft is her tummy
do you think she would keep her eyes open while you are penetrating her or look away or close them hard like most kids her age      id like to think she would remain cheerful or at least be cognizant of whats going on and give the signs in their face with each movement if its right or not  sometimes with kids her age there are pain receptors that havent expanded out and the vaginal canal hasnt hardened up enough to shield the sensive areas  thats why most guides and common knowledge is to elevate them level with the angle of insertion at first and let her do the movements until your bodies naturally get a feel of what is good and bad      thats the reason why for me eye contact is so important and when they look away or close their eyes its just making it worse for them
i just want to pat her head hug her and give her a good fatherly kiss on her forehead but you guys insist that i should fuck her instead this is not good not good at all
warm  wet  clown  ____ny
  but thats wrong i insist that you dont to anything lewd to her and let me fuck her tight cunny
noo stop it
  kids her age  old as hell
  oh thats funny because clownpi is literally as old as hell since shes a fairy pretty clever
sex is the greatest physical expression of love and should be promoted towards little kids  to not love a little girl is in many ways neglectful
  yes and i also think its important to point out that it should be a fathers duty to make sure their daughters are fully introduced to the sex    any girls first time should always have been with their fathers
its a new era of 4channel    can threads like this last
  i hope to god so
  this isnt 4ch  also how so
clownpiece will become the hokage one day
      get out reddit falseflaggers
  fuck off
  they better last or its not advertiser friendly shitposting time
imagine the smelle
  those feet looks smelly
its sad to know that we cant post clown lewds anymore
  or can we
clown cunny
  i want to come so hard into that little cunny    ooooh how i wish 
    these are not advertiser friendly delete
ice pops are the lewdest
  so puffy
i want to use the clown tummy as a platter for all my meals lick her navel clean every time
  i want to give her a whip cream on her tummy named cum
dozo
  is clownpiece cute and funny
  the cutest and funniest the cunniest
  how jealous i want to go around touching fairies cunnies as well   i also want to rape them hard
  i also want to rape them  thats what they want you to do anon say no to fairy pussy
  them wanting to be raped just makes it much better  i want to spend the rest of my days living among fairies and using their delicious little bodies to please myself and never go back to human civilization
  why would i say no to fairy pussy
  indeed
  imagine the clown riding sideways on your shoulders with one of her thighs pressing hard against your face    haha
  imagine her riding backwards on your shoulders with her crotch pressing hard against your face
  i always knew reimu was a pervert
    both posts are fine
shes pregnant with my baby
  she lied to you anon thats just baby fat
thread is too lewd
  here anon have a completely safe cute nonlewd image of the clappers
  if its nonlewd why do i have the urge to put her on my lap and rub my bulge against her privates while licking that armpit
  youre a pervert theres nothing sexy about armpits
  hairless loli armpit
  yeah i may be a freak for wanting to rub my rock hard cock on her hot and delicious armpits making it all messy sticky and slimy with my precum
  i thought i was a lolicon but im actually   a  toddlercon afterall
  this is how the title of the best ln to exist came to be
    what would this ln be about
  mc  thought mc was a lolicon but mc was actually a toddlercon afterall
in all honesty i think sexual relations with children that appear her age should be celebrated and promoted instead of being ostracized
  pthc  you dont deserve calling yourself a lolicon
  i like lolitas of all types  no need to judge or throw around needless insults
  im just saying namefag thats a very bad acronym to flaunt around
  oh i dont really think so  i dont think you believe so either
  rygold  thats just as bad
  just as good you mean  different but should still be able to be enjoyed  dont limit yourselves to strictly fantasy  the world is a pretty big real place  i would hate you to miss out on some experiences      i like the anime images  they can be aesthetically pleasing and a good substitute at times    cheer up my friend and carry on  
  leave this board
  why the passiveaggressiveness    why cant we just be friends and appreciate lewd pictures of little 2d girls in harmony
  cool falseflag reddit
is it true is clownpiece truly the lewdest fairy
  no  luna is
  i can agree with that
  this clappy is the secondmost lewdest
  my daughteronaholewife luna isnt lewd in public
  could someone dump all the edits this image has  this is important
i wish for a clownpiece doujinshi from include
  i want to whip clownpi with that towel
  i want to whip the clown with my dick
  i want to whip el clappo with my peeza
  star likes it up the ass
  gross
what is clownpieces question
  how many times can a man cum inside a fairy until his health is at risk
  hey ding dong
i want to fireman carry the clown and slap her ass for being naughty
  not if you give her a proper enema beforehand
  obyaa would be ok as well
  i want a cirno doujin by obyaa
is tummy advertiser friendly
  i want a lolimate clownpiece doujinshi with an emphasis on her cute little fairy tummy squishy little fairy thighs and her flat little chest hugging tightly to her sweatdrenched shirt
post photographs and videos you or others have taken around japan  modern or traditional urban or rural landscape or macro anything is good    previous thread    previouser threads      try to keep pictures natural looking if possible  if you know the location a photo was taken it is useful to post it with the image
entsuin temple matsushima
egg
you like daikon right anon
i loved kyoto felt way better than osaka
  osaka has too many chinese for me even kyoto has a lot more than it did first few times i went
  matsushima
  yes
can you share links to japans photo sites  also do you have 80s photos not ad or magazines town architecture and etc
  photozou is good and so is 
  would love to see it without the bogo filter
    what is the purpose of this filter
  twilight
  lmao i went to osaka because i was living in china and my chinese friends recommended it over tokyo got to practice my chinese a lot in namba
japanese maple in aomori park
im going to dump a lot of these didnt come out all that great but i think youll appreciate the content first few are from sendai
tanigawadake
couldnt stop taking pictures of these guys
satta touge the location of this livestream  
not a clear day it rained pretty heavily as i was returning to the station
yokosuka most of these are from where i believe to be the reallife site of a chapter of yokohama kaidashi kikou called ヨコスカ巡航 yokosuka cruise
a few from kamakura a miserable day weatherwise
yunokami onsen
inside of the little hut behind the live camera
  sendai is pretty close to my haunt what were you doing around these parts  also would you happen to be using a film camera
  wait a sec are you that guy who recently visited yunokamionsen station
those prefixed with c are actually from the roll after these with b my first one looking up at the camera got fucked oops preserved for historical purposes      i took a trip up north to hokkaido recently i used a minolta x700 most are with iso 800 some are with 400 not too good with it and not a huge fan of how the grain looks with the 800    yep
    yea i am not a big fan of venus  it works better if you overexpose it but that defeats the purpose of a high iso film
aizuwakamatsu
cant really tell here but this girl was really cute
takaosan
  these are beautiful thank you for taking the time to post them all
    i love this picture    new screensaver
      i want to go to happy hand 
  these are amazing anon my thread watcher popped up with 168 new posts and surprisingly theyre not spam    thanks for sharing
  this guys got a bunch of videos from around that time    
  thanks for the photodump  are those film pictures developed by yourself
  nice pictures thank you
these are amazing    what camera and what specific film did you use thanks
therere lots of great beaches in kyushu this one was taken in iojima right outside nagasaki a strange thing about japan or at least the area i was in was that the japanese people wont even attempt to go to the beack until mid to late july because of the rainy season but it was definitely warm enough throughout june and may and even a little in april when this was taken
  default 4chan has a thread watcher i was using 4chan x for so long i forgot how to get it working
  oi noah that you
  yea it does haha bottom right of the page should have settings click that then monitoring then check the thread watcher box
  awesome thanks im just waiting hopefully for a 4channel x type extension
  i believe there was an addon for 4chan x for that or something along the lines of it saw it on /qa/ may have just been a troll or something though not sure
  4chanx works on 4channel pretty sure it got released very shortly after the domain change i just have autoupdates on because im a lazy fuck
    just refreshed my browser and it looks like its working thanks lads
  no i got it done here in tokyo      minolta x700 and fujifilm superia venus 800
  さった峠から谷川岳会津仙台までだいぶ行きましたね  your photos really make me smile  thank you for sharing 
is film photography still pretty big in japan   i see a lot of analogue photos posted but in my country at least places to buy and develop film are very rare now
    lemme guess you got them scanned by the photo lab  looks like it a noritsu i assume    they are more than good enough for web uploads but if you want to get prints done it maybe best to invest in a better scanner  a plustek 8200 is one of the better options on the market now  pricey and slow to scan but unbeatable without spending a fortune  cuts development costs quite a bit too since you dont have to pay for scanning  mine paid for itself in a year
  would love to see snowy tokyo for myself someday
  511 vs 60
aomori is white right now
  i got all this locally the film was like 6000 the camera i got off ebay for around 300
  i want to visit the north in winter some time
  we missed out on the snow here on the coast in miyagi  looks like next weekend its gonna catch us though kinda late this year if the last two years are anything to go by
anyone got pictures of urban parks with those big/tall chain link fences around them
  you mean batting/golf centers
why are these norms on jp
  why is it purple seems like its iluminated
  it was
  come up to aomori bro
  aomori is top of the list for my next visit with hokkaido as a second im a train enthusiast and want to check out the local lines up there ideally in winter because they look stunning in photos
  i keep trying to work aomori /hokkaido into my travel plans for next year but its just too far away for the time we have the far north really deserves its own trip i think
kawasaki city
  aomori is nice place to visit
tsugaru railway  aomori
mthakkoda  aomori
aomori
  breathtaking
  the far north really deserves its own trip i think  you could say the same for a lot of areas as i mentioned i love local lines so i try to do as many as possible within an area on each holiday  i visited tochigi ibaraki and parts of gunma and fukushima last year and nagano toyama and parts of gifu followed by saga and nagasaki via the sanyo main line its nice when you can give an area enough time although of course you always miss things  planning on aomori and hokkaido in winter next year if i can get the time          beautiful this is just my kind of thing theres especially nothing like small remote train stations
  damn thats nice
jr east gono line  aomori
hakodate hokkaido
kanda tokyo
  blade runner
  nice yujiro
  fukui fukui fukui
  lmao thats my closest station        hit me up if you guys come to aomori ive got a subaru legacy so i can zoom you guys around on the weekends if im not away

its 6c  winter is here
sweet cold
  my wife and daughter
  the cold sucks please make way for lily white already
i love you /jp/  have a nice winter
  thanks you too
i wanna fill lettys womb with my cum
  why does she wear warm clothing when shes supposed to thrive in the cold
  because it would be silly otherwise
  maybe her body temperature is still significantly lower than the average temperature even during the winter so her clothes are there to insulate her rather than keep her warm
  that just raises even more questions
  the alternative is its magic i aint gotta explain shit
fuck being late for a couple of days or better weeks wouldnt hurt anyone letty
  what is yuugi even doing up there
  probably sisters hired her to stop letty from coming but she failed miserably
napping on lettys cute warm belly
  no thanks i like my pillow cold
shes fat
  6  thats late spring come back when its  30
  its 6c  its 6f here and itll only get worse
cold
  shes a youkai of cold and warm clothing is associated with cold  devoid of context it seems almost paradoxical but it makes sense when you think about it    anyways do you think a human would be able to survive in lettys summer hiding spot
  sexyonna
  sex with letty
can i get a close hug from her to warm me up a bit
  but letty is cold
too cold fuck off letty
  i dont believe that someone so big and soft looking could be cold
  6f  how much is that in non meme units
  me on the left
  i hate slushy snow letty save me
taking care of a sleepy letty
why is it still hot please bring nice cold air to texas please letty
is it weird that i like to think of letty as some sort of mother figure for cirno
  letty will conduct cirnos abortion procedure after im done with mating press and creampie 
i cant believe letty is fucking dead
why does japan love keeping their games and stuff in their country only
yes
because they have basic understanding of risks and rewards
because fuck them gaijin whitou piggus
  the weeb market used to not be big enough to justify scouring their then barren landscape for translators  and now it barely is
not everything gets popular enough to get dubbed
  this and dubs/translations cost much more money for companies than youd probably expect
its a good thing anyway    the international community would shower them with criticism and pcness on things like gender sexualisation loli etc  theyd have to compromise and would probably lose their domestic market in the process    that said they have actually been trying to break into international markets a lot more already than in the past and with pretty reasonable success too see steam increasing populatiry of anime related vids and memes on yt and normie communities
  because the people in charge of stuff are old farts who think watching a full length pv on youtube equals stealing a physical dvd copy younger people and independent artists are more in tune with the times but even signing with a major label can mean a full wipe of internet fancams overnight    as for shit like games and printed media its even harder due to  and rampant piracy that makes the companies think is it even worth it        trust me the average japanese person also thinks most otaku media is depraved borderline pedophilic shit as any sound person would do just because no one translates their posts and articles it doesnt mean its not a thing the recent pixiv purge is an example of this
  the recent pixiv purge is an example of this  you talking about that literally who artist who had all his loli art tagged with 小学生 his art was shit anyways
its so us filthy gaijin will move over as were more culturally enriched with japan and speak more japanese than the average white man they want us to come over and breed with their womenthey get wet at the size of us
  i dont think japanese publishers gamedevs and other media creators really feel that way these days theyve seen the success of smash dragonball naruto pokemon and recently devilman crybaby in the west nge will soon have its first legal digital release on netflix a western platform in the 90s plenty of console games with anime artstyles were released in japan but most never made their way to the west because japanese developers thought that westerners either werent capable of grasping the appeal of that artstyle or would dislike it based on the fact that most western nerd media was hypermasculine and the women in those media properties were meant to look traditionally sexy rather than cute and innocent these days the western stigma against depictions of cute girls in media targeting an adult male audience has gradually begun to erode and the irrational cultlike fear of anything that can be misconstrued as pedophilic is also vanishing
the three cardinal rules of japanese interaction with the rest of the world    1 leave us alone  2 go fuck yourself  3 take your gaijin money and cram it up your assl
  any purge of pixiv probably has more to do with app store style shit than the people who run pixiv being massive prudes      if you work hard to give it to them theyll take it
    i thought the pixiv purge was because of the olympics
  because you dont pay for them
  because of habbo raids
  there was no pixiv purge
pixiv purge  the whatnow what happened
  these days the western stigma against depictions of cute girls in media targeting an adult male audience has gradually begun to erode and the irrational cultlike fear of anything that can be misconstrued as pedophilic is also vanishing  are you sure about that especially the fear of pedo misunderstandings bit i want to believe but
  because they know us americans will ruin it like they did with anime
  what happened  fearmongering
  americans and euros are the worst
  nobody likes eops
  im sure the rapelay fiasco made japanese devs less likely to try the international market well at least for eroge but with nowadays climate even just vns would get many complains
reimu is kind she has youkai friends so she will be okay with my appearance
ゆるさん  nicoms/sm34223303
why is reimu so shit at youkai extermination  95 of them just return back to life so whats the point  not even touching the subject of her being wrecked by some mountain kappas
  i just wanted to be your friend
  why is reimu so shit at youkai extermination  because touhou is badly written
  shit at youkai extermination  in most cases its a euphemism if youkai didnt have human enemies theyd lack a reason to exist so she usually just beats them up until they promise to stop whatever it is they were doing and youkai are bound by their word far more than humans are if the only way to stop an enemy from causing trouble is to solve the enemys personal problems then reimu will grumble a lot but shes willing to do that if it means peace    the only time she switches tactics is when she thinks her enemy is truly incapable of changing its ways theres a lot of nonsapient or insane youkai that shes killed or sealed away instead of beating up heck even marisa killed a youkai in fs and that was before the fortuneteller showed up
  because shes not a youkai exterminator  have you read fs
  said the youkai
shhhh shes finally taking a break
cute tiny eiki shoes

  you dont wanna its gonna be very long
  i dont mind
    絶対
in fan art she is sometimes depicted as short or even a baby compared to komachi but shes actually in the height range of komachis when seen in the ending of phantasmagoria of flower view    who else prefers tall eiki because it makes her more intimidating
  nyaaaaooooooooo
  tall eiki is really good but i think tiny eiki is simply way more iconic

why do living umbrellas have big long tongues anyway
theyre called karakasa/kasaobake they have long tongues because thats just a common feature of japanese spirits they use their tongues to lick you in order to surprise you think of haunter from pokémon for example
  why dont scary long black haired white robe clad  female ghosts have long tongues and lick you
there was a spider here      its gone now
  those legs scare me
yamame have two threads i guess that cool  
  ive fapped to that image more times than i thought i could really wish i was paruchan there
    this is the official yamame thread endorsed by the idol herself
  her dick is inside
i wonder if yamame is like other spiders where they disappear once you reach for something to kill them will she disappear if i  wipe my dick out
parsee is shit yamame is best girl in sa
cute
hug the spider
  what happened to the spider
  she moved in with me
  i love silent hill 2 its one of the best piece of media ever created
  she got two threads
kurodani yamame has two threads
  it really is    
  
  dont destroy your penis you only get one
  girlfriends
  nice
  i dont think ive ever killed a spider they are cool and eat annoying bugs and aside from some australian species they tend to be very friendly
    lol you eat several spiders a year never mind the hundreds you kill while cleaning
  yamames a boy
i want to do lewd things with her
  use an insecticide spray
  i want to grab a handful of spider
  2sexy
  spiders shouldnt be this curvy
  so it is true that she poisons humans to eat them
  she describes it as seasoning where various afflictions would have different flavors
  kissing the yamame
  akyuu says that mental illnesses can spice up the taste of human flesh for youkai byakuren says that yamame claimed the humans at myourenji looked delicious which might have been a thinly veiled insult however akyuu admits that those who have met her found her reasonable and zun states plainly in her official profile her power makes everyone she meets hate her however she herself wouldnt inflict disease on someone without reason shes a bright funloving youkai if you get to know her    so while shes still unmistakeably a youkai she is most likely one of the nicest most reasonable ones in gensokyo
  is yamame mary or maria
  typhoid mary
  please do
  those breasts are obscene
soft pliable yamams
saving this thread
a cute
    what does a spider need those funbags for
  feeding her babies
  to give great hugs with
  my wife
  my paizuri slave
the best boobs in the underworld yuugis may be bigger but yamames are softer and more comfortable
head pats for the spider
  yuugis may be bigger  they might not be oni are muscular and might not have too high body fat percentages meaning most of yuugiss chest is muscle while her actual boobs are small and only look big okuu on the other hand may present a real challenge for the title of the best boobs in the underworld
  okuu has that huge lump between her boobs not comfortable at all
  true yamame wins
  no need to mention the ugly one in the presence of yamame
  stacked spider
does yamame enjoy bondage
  as long as she is the one doing it
  im ok with this
  yamame is the kind of girl who would ask you to hold her down while youre having sex or to tie her arms behind her back with her own shirt before you start thrusting but at the same time she would want to be able to hug you when you finish    its a bit of a pickle with yamame
  stop killing spiders you monster they are cool harmless and eat the bugs that could actually do something bad to you
drunk spider
  dont spill it all over your gorgeous cleavage yamame
well /jp/ how does she do it
2cute
  i want to push my face into her soft cleavage and breathe deep

not a single progress update from any of the companies thats good  also its been one month yesterday since sp said they would do monthly updates for chrono clocks kikestarter including the progress on their new editing pass for the game guess what theres no update
  hoshi ori  commonmarika route patch released 100 of misas route translated overall 3636 translated    trip is a god damn beast
sakura sakura flopped
  nobody gives a shit about that game either way
  xeviax does i wonder if he will give up if their next one flops too
  sp failing to keep a promise im in utter shock and amazement
  i thought it would take them at least 2 months to fuck up
  they are probably completely lost on the new editing pass after all they got a lot of negative feedback online but on the kickstarter they get no feedback to talk about    it seems like the kickstarter people are mainly people whining about not having their physical goods or that love sekai so the original translation was already amazing i suspect most people just do with the fan patch instead and sekais new pass will just be worse than it in almost all cases anyway
  would suck if it did but there is no real way of knowing because we dont know how much they paid for it and all the other details you can tell there was actually a lot of effort put in from what ive seen theres probably hundreds of images that were all translated and although they couldnt release it without mosaics they did go out of their way to make them much less intrusive  before   after     anyway lets not carry on this shitposting from the other thread if you want to discuss salesfaggotry then at least put in some effort to your posts like people used to do
stop reading titles in english
  stop thinking you know japanese
  only 3 reviews usually a title that does well would have a lot more then that also its burred a few page down if you look at vn top sellers
  it actually has 8 i still wouldnt call it a flop check sorcery jokers koropokkur daresora or something like 2236 ad if you want to see what a flop looks like
  if you look at the forum most of the fools think this is a high cost winged cloud release so it is just to be expected that it sells poorly only people into vns buy it
  also while their store is not up yet i doubt it would be a success there either for their store to be successfully they would need they would need to get at last some titles from the other publishers after what they did to nekonyan i dont see them working together and mg and jast would want to push their own stores so i doubt we see them their either i can only see sekai going for it and maybe some evn developers
  after what they did to nekonyan i dont see them working together  chuee isnt nekonyan
  it was akerou dream project too
  not really im pretty sure he likes favorite games but i dont think it was his dream project like it was for chuee
  but akerou was hurt just as much when iroseka got picked up by sol press its just that hes more levelheaded read not a literal manchild so he didnt throw a tantrum on twitter  actually on perspective that same maturity would allow him to get past that and sell on sol press store      it was actually their fantl group was literally named shinku translations after the main heroine of iroseka
in the end what was even the point of this has anyone read it
  how does something raise 40k but only peak at 5 players at launch
  planned back when sales were higher on steam and it was far enough along that it was too late to cancel it
    realistically the mature thing to do would be to accept what happened and move on like a professional as in the long run losing one dream project isnt worth acting petulant  they should assess what happened to lose out on the license and use the knowledge for the future    that said this is under the assumption they even have interest in being part of hyourin in the first place
  mg and jast might give some low tier stuff to hyorin it is a store with a client after all i wouldnt expect rance or saya no uta but any titles that theyve already let nutaku or fakku sell are fair game
  oh they did the minori thing with reduced censorship at least kinda curious if trinoline is going to be reduced mosaic like the old games or exactly the same as in japan seeing how its not as great as before i think havent seen trinolines censorship to be able to tell      kinda depressing that its probably the most competent kickstarter so far correct me if im wrong game was released on time and physical goods are all done if they are already selling it on the store
literally untranslatable
  nah you just have to make stuff up translation is so easy even someone who dont know japanese can do it
bless those brave souls still working on gore screaming show i have hopes that my non kikongo speaking children may be able to play it long after i have shed this mortal coil
  bbut cartel said you never need honorifics in a tl
  no because i had no clue what kind of game it was felt like an otome
a3 when
from last weeks discussion there was the idea that 3rdeye was dead due to inactivity but they recently posted again on their twitter teasing their 5th title looks like they just focused everything on their site renewal and getting their 5th game ready
  yeah thats what i assumed it was sorcery jokers actually seemed to do pretty decently in japan
its going to be another december without angels isnt it /jp/     _
  tl note cartel can eat shit
  well it just entered beta  maybe if the beta testers put on some serious effort and hurry some well get it by the end of december or early next year    im more bummed about the fact that mangagamer still hasnt put hapymaher on steam even though it is an underrated gem that deserved more sales  no seriously go play it its legitimately good i started reading the fd with my shitty nip so i dont need a tl anymore but want to preach to steam users how good of a vn it is
how the fuck do i translate アルバイト into english  its obviously parttime job but the whole sentence is about how character a thinks character b doesnt seem like the kind of person who would use that kind of word which makes no sense in english    i cant even rewrite it to a word that would make sense because the next scene takes place at bs job
  post the whole scene dumbass
  shut up
  please dont say that youll make doddler sad
  it has garbage tl theres your reason
  it doesnt but lets suppose it does there hasnt been a single release which suffered more than a very minor loss of sales due to its tl outside of outright mtl
  the opposite holds water though  evenicle grisaia sanoba all big hits with a sound translation
  dont put that sanoba shitfest together with evenicle and grisaia
  alright now its obvious that youre trolling since youre implying two things one that they have good english writing and two that the writing means its a good translation as opposed to a rewrite even though two of them had parts which were complete shit evenicle mostly because of spite and sanoba because of ignorance sanoba at least has 90 of its shit fixed now i cant talk about grisaia since i read it as a fantl  anyway lets again suppose that you are correct instead of saying out loud that you are a dumb discord retard there hasnt been a single release which got more than a very minor gain of sales due to its tl
  evenicle  sound translation  other than the translator completely rewriting a heroines speech style rewriting her dialogue to say something completely different than what she originally said to the point it completely ruined her character and making a few questionable localization choices for specific oneoff events it was pretty good
      good translation / literal weeb translation  evenicle has the best tl since years
  completely rewriting a characters entire quirk that could have easily been translated into english but was instead removed because translator is shit  weeb translation  still not following you here anon
    wahhhhh my dick didnt get as hard as it should have because i didnt see the oniichans from grgr  lol
  good post isnt porn writing a part of the games writing since its a fucking porn game buddy
  im more concerned about the fact that the way she addressed and conversed with the other heroines once they become a part of the family was completely removed and never mentioned but hey god forbid the translator actually make even an attempt at conveying a characters unique quirks when translating stuff might as well remove all references to ramius that mentions how shes not smart because its not important after all
kns 2 on steam
  why is this a big deal deadly premonition had the exact same plot and content and has been on steam for a while now
when will vn on steam die again
  exploit children  where exactly
  why do you lie
what are legit reasons to fantranslate because the way i see it fantranslators make companies lose on potential earnings
  why should an individual give a fuck about companies especially ones as shitty as we have
  the legit reason would be picking a company that all the official ones ignore
  no seriously go play it its legitimately good   its honestly really not  i bought and read the whole thing and didnt think it was particularly good
  if a company goes bankrupt then theres little chance that any titles of theirs will be picked up legally
  the reason being you enjoy something and want to share it with the world    not to mention a lot of shit will straight up never get offical releases i bet i could start a translation of say mahoyo or tokyo necro right now take 5 fucking years to complete it and still not get cucked by a professional company    if i started translating baldr sky when sekai made the announcement id be fucking done by now
  
  but tokyo necro did have a team that translated the demo did they get jastd 
kimi to kanojo to kanojo no koi  100 translated and edited    but i cant find it anywhere
  if you check his blog the last update was over 2 years ago i might be thinking of a different guy with this but im also pretty sure he has his twitter account linked on the blog and has been doing nothing with it other than retweeting anime tiddies    pretty sure he just lost interest
  mangagamer probably funded it themselves with extra accounts now they can boast they have a successful kickstarter when they negotiate for licenses    alternatively the casuals have developed a herd like mentality for mangagamer they supported it not because they were interested but because it was mangagamer
    bara title you cant fuck on an empty stomach is getting an english release
  old news
  mg currently has 45 fanbases rance and alicesoft fans aka the hannies the bl and otome fujoshi y/u/ri loversirl tumblr dykes and the nukige fans which is their oldest fanbase theres the moebuta too but they moved on to nn and solp    this game appealed to neither of them so of course it got a bad reception and flopped  even the usual shills i hang out with didnt want to help fund it but still managed to convince two to do so
  the nukige fanbase has left them for various other companies since mg has only released 3 nukige this year worth mentioning
    i dont like nor hate them but damn any other kickstarter for any of their visual novel licenses would have been better  for example people have been begging for a shin koihime kickstarter here for quite some time now even supipara could be kickstarted just so they can release the chapters fast and end that trash series
  where did they leave literally nobody actually release nukige unless you count kagura games or jasts 2014 nukige announcements
  frontwing had good ones kaguragames had a few okay titles even sekai project has had stronger nukige titles than mg other than the usual funbag imopara and kuroinu which had its own personal sets of problems due to it being episodic only 3 nukige titles worth reading is pretty fucking sad when it used to be anywhere from 612 good titles a year
      the fujoshi seem to have also moved on since jast announced the nc lineup the announcement killed any hype they had for hashihime    meanwhile they dont seem to have taken to luckydog1 since it was discovered that mangagamer licensed the inferior version also the quality of the translation has been called into question numerous times
    all i want is some clock up nukige mako hunter ero manga ero goods esex shikorsky or kenzen  not even hyped for maggot baits cant fap to that guro shit
  whats that anon you want more ammolite shovelware you got it
hopefully someone gets the eushully license and even the gameplay fags leave mangagamer  generally i hope that jast and mangagamer go bankrupt and get replaced by some decent localization companies who dont license pre 2013 trash titles  sol press and nekonyan are a nice start
  and even the gameplay fags leave mangagamer  why would they leave if they still have rance
  youre acting as if eushully is some bastion of great gameplay let me tell you that most of their games are extremely disappointing not only in content but quality they had to basically copy kamidori this past year in order to put out a title that satisfied customers because the one before that was 100 garbage and sold horribly their most recent title thats being released soon doesnt look great either fucking hell they havent even updated their website in like a month eushully is overhyped in the western fanbase because they dont have the context for all of eushullys garbage surrounding kamidori hell eveb kamidori was a huge mess and still is in the japanese release  tons of grammatical issues incomplete sentences or item descriptions and some pretty awful inconsistent writing which makes no sense ironically the english audience got a better product because aroduc bothered to fix all that crap whether or not he had any right to do so is another discussion entirely    meanwhile while rance 8  9 have their failings as gameplay titles the script is still fairly enjoyable and 10 is probably one of the best games ever made period     people have also suggested to grab softhousechara but honestly outside of bb i havent liked too many of their titles their writers are generally decent at making charming enjoyable casts but even bbs gameplay wasnt that great
  one of the best games ever made period  i mean its good but dont get ahead of yourself
  ikusa megami zero and verita are great too though one is untranslated and the other is google translated or something
  it really boils down to your preference in games i believe kichikuou is one of the best games ever made despite being 20 yrs old but if you dont like the way it plays youll think its awful not to say kichikuou is perfect because it surely isnt but i like its gameplay more than x at least
  eh theres nothing to indicate mg funded it themselves its not like there was anything as blatant as sekai project and the influx of funds that during the tokyo chronos ks     alternatively the casuals have developed a herd like mentality for mangagamer they supported it not because they were interested but because it was mangagamer    probably this though itarufags being willing enough to back just because of itaru is another similar factor      if the gameplay fags can support evenicle and all of the cheap hrpgs kagura games puts out at the same time i doubt another company getting eushully would affect mgs sales of alicesoft games that much maybe if the games released in the same month but both the alicesoft and eushully games should have long enough tails that it doesnt really matter in the long run in many cases it might just be a matter of someone deciding to buy one game right away and the other few months after rather than just buying one and not buying the other      eushully is considered the biggest eroge gameplay focused company outside of alicesoft and i think softhouse chara is third thats the main reason why people suggest them
  i think at core it isnt about if eushully is good or not eops just want the most popular stuff and eushully is certainly one of the most popular gameplay developers its the same kind of people who want and vote for fate/stay white album 2 and muramasa
  kr is great fuck that save system though as for rance x i actually really like it the interface is kind of shitty looking but it feels like they took the battle system from quest and improved on it most of the annoyances that arise from gachastyle gameplay are minimized too since all of the characters you need for a successful first playthrough are characters you can get without relying on chance im speaking as someone who cant really stay addicted to gacha for long maybe a month or so at most before getting bored i dont play them anymore not even f/go or whatever
  i thought it was because they have less focus on rape like every single gameplay vn ever made so people just want a normal gameplay title among the list of niche titles
  most likely and sad thing is that it wont come out until 2020 at least
  you can be happy if you get sumaga and django by end of 2020 tokyo necro isnt happening in the next 35 years    some of them have bad end rape not all though like the latest one
  alternatively the casuals have developed a herd like mentality for mangagamer they supported it not because they were interested but because it was mangagamer  there is no one else as good as mangagamer currently solpress could have the chance to do really well if they continue on what they are doing and come through on translations
    i think most of you are confused  saying that casuals like mangagamer is like saying that hardcore visual novel fans like sekai project
  lets be real anyone who isnt a casual would be reading in jap
  saying that casuals like mangagamer is like saying that hardcore visual novel fans like sekai project  its not at all sp gets shit on even on casual forums while mg gets praised by casuals who dont see the bad things about their releases which people point out here
  itarufags  no such thing
yume creations has banned from steam due to their recent release considered to be loli
  which is not loli at all steam guy is either too incompetent for his job or he lied
  id say its just standard normalfag logic thinking anything and everything anime is loli this is why eroge on steam will never work
  this is the first result when you google yume creations  maybe its because of this
  this im sick of retards bringing up eushully shovelware garbage as some desirable never evers
  thats it im sick of all this alicesoft kamige bullshit thats going on in the on /jp/ right now eushully deserve much better than that much much better than that  i should know what im talking about i myself imported a genuine kamidori dvd for 6000 yen thats about 53 and have been playing it for almost 2 years now i can even cut slabs of solid steel with my yuela  eushully spend years working on single geme and quality check it up to a million times to produce the finest eroge known to mankind  kamidori are thrice as long as european rpg and thrice as hard for that matter too anything alicesoft can make eushully can make better im pretty sure yuela could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple 白刃流しⅰ  ever wonder why western rpg never  conquered japan thats right they were unable to compete with the japanese programmers and their kamiges even in western fantl scene english localisators targeted baldr sky fantl project first because their kamige power was feared and respected   so what am i saying kamidori are simply the best eroge that the world has ever seen and thus require better reputation on /jp/
  is this bait
  clearly from the second paragraph onward
  3  hapymaher is fucking trash play real games you waste of skin
  yumecreations has the worst website i have ever seen i am sure google doesnt index this shit    
im surprised none of these companies have really ventured into rpgmaker games yet like kaguragames have done they seem to be such easy money
  
  wtf i love eushully now
  dont worry next year half of the localization companies will have rpgmaker announcements or at least some gameplay titles or just more bl titles like jast
it was chuee of course
yume creations just got unbanned
  theres the moebuta too but they moved on to nn and solp  they come back whenever mg releases a new title  who else would shill hapymaher this much
  xev said sol press would be soon
  those are h heavy so i really doubt it
  they havent even announced them yet also are you trying to say kaguragames rpgmaker title arent
  why would moebuta shill plotge
  i mean sol press doesnt want to focus on h heavy stuff
  they announced onikiss and nukitashi anon  heres him talking about them    
  hope it flops then
  why are you so adamant about this
  because they are more more scammy then sekai
  how so
  newton was shit desu
  because its purplesoft  also its not really plotge or moege in my opinion
  id love to hear your reasoning for this  and please for the love of god tell me it doesnt involve mosaics
  hi mosaic anon here sol press hasnt done anything wrong in that department yet the only censored titles theyve released so far had the original art assets destroyed in the horrific tsunami that happened quite a few years ago but they were able to use their internal dev release which had reduced mosaics nekonyan on the other hand are the scumlords because theyre intentionally leaving their products censored because they dont like how the genitals look under the mosaics so they decided to just leave the mosaics in instead of offering a decensor patch
how could you fucking leak our kamige
  youre not funny by the way
im playing trample on schatten right now did anyone forget about this title
  cool
  i really didnt like it its one of the worst chuunige ive read i even ended up reading ayakashibito and a bit of chou dengeki stryker again just to forget it
  youd think they could just make a minimal mosaic version and claim they tried instead of just stating that they personally dont want to remove it so they will keep it
with all the shit posting im surprised nobody posted this  you have to do it like dovac you cant even talk to him yet alone work for sekai project until you sign an nda
  
  white theme
  i had a great time with it ran me about 12 hours to 100 and no part was ever painfully slow which is something that usually frustrates me about chuunige
  arent these the guys navel ditched mangagamer for
    what was the leak
  learn to read
  ill rephrase that what were the specific titles that were leaked it hasnt been mentioned here
  and ill repeat myself learn to read
  thats a pretty roundabout way of saying i dont know either retard anon
    
  i almost forgot that frontwing announced a rpg maker game in ax i think it was lilitales      thats interesting maybe its a short game that they didnt have the license to back in kumoricon i dont see why they would refrain from announcing it otherwise its probably some bottom of the barrel dlsite game but their ln acquisitions arent exactly high tier either i think the way xev words his post implies that they have more than one rpg maker translation announcement       thats a different company youre thinking yumehaven
    let me spell it out for you retardkun  this was a textbook example of corporate espionage only the other publisher knows said titles so of course theyre not about to leak them themselves as theyre using that info to upstage and/or sabotage sol press in fact they did lose some of their licenses    
  so since it was before ax my guess would be aokana
  i doubt it was aokana unless sol press was planning to team up with hikari field
  or maybe nekonyan teamed up with hikari field so they could outbid sol press on the license
  and they were vn licenses to boot    ill go out of my way and say it was that fag kiriyaaoi that was the leaker
  could be xev said that the rival company offered a shitload of money more than sol press  we know from past posts that dovac likes to overpay for licenses which dont turn out profitable for them  gsenjou no maou didnt turn a profit wagamama high spec made 15 of the license cost maitetsu and baldr sky are most likely overpaid too
  yumehaven  oh that was it kind of sad they didnt really output anything new
  yumehaven is atrocious its a good thing that they didnt go for more licenses  even if you look past that shuffle steam version was a cash grab where they took the all ages console version instead of shuffle essence which has the most amount of content and additional routes the translation was bad  yumehaven is on the same level as moenovel
  gsenjou was probably overpaid because it was so hyped by the vn community due to its fan translation wagamama high spec was licensed before it was released in japan so it was definitely overpaid maitetsu might have been overpaid perhaps because lose has been overhyped by lolifags as for baldr sky the answer is obvious im pretty sure it used to be the most hyped vn at the time before sekai managed to kill all of the hype
  yumehaven is on the same level as moenovel  alright then it was a good thing its a shame that navel burned bridges for that partnership to happen maybe another group can work with them if they still have any interest in the western market at this point but i guess its hopeless to see anymore games from them considering coco just disappeared off the face of the earth
  they didnt burn all bridges you can still buy really really and tick tack on mangagamers site    navel just saw the nekopara sales and wanted a piece of that cake themselves so they waited until the shuffle contract with mangagamer expired without renewing it and hired yumehaven for the steam version  afaik soul link was discontinued too
evenicle hit 109 concurrent users this past weekend thanks to a 15 sale during the steam fall sale its highest total since october 29th and it is up from a peak of 73 concurrent users the previous weekend  seeing a meaningful boost in concurrent players during the first sale is some additional evidence that it is being set up to be a long term seller for mg    some other titles to see a boost from the steam sale compared to the weekend before the sale based on daily peak concurrent users  clannad 2553 65 off  fashoning little miss lonesome 319 50 off  umineko questions arc 4362  50 off  fata morgana 1530 50 off  higurashi ch 1 1324 75 off  ozmafia 1139 50 off  eden 1218 60 off  the fruit of grisaia 55 off  nekopara vol 1 70128 50 off  loves sweet garnish 1521 15 off  karakara 1015 75 off  muv luv 1834 40 off  muv luv alternative 2741 40 off  sonicomi 513 50 off  eiyuusenki 614 35 off  if my heart had wings 3538 75 off  a sky full of stars 1014 45 off  fureraba 1115 30 off      it is worth pointing out though most of the titles to see an impressive boost from already decent daily numbers are titles that were already selling well in the long term  much of mgs and sekais library for example look like da capo 3 r which had a peak of 4 concurrent users both of these weekends despite a 40 sale or himawari  sorcery jokers which both also remained below 5 concurrent users with respective sales of 55 and 40      separate from the steam sale island had its chinese release go live on november 13th and after having daily peaks in the 713 range the week before it shot up to a postpatch peak of 61 and has maintained strong numbers since  that said it remained below its all time peak of 80 near its launch although that initial peak was also fueled by asian markets
  offers a crazy amount of money and/or terms that are crazy just so we dont get an additional license    so with the info we have thus far  akerou said he had to take a big loan for the aokana license  they also went out of their way to team with hikari field to offer sprite a chinese tl  well after his meltdown chuee said that he feared that someone else would get iroseka for months suggesting that he knew tried their best to steal it but got outbid anyways    but also    dovac is know for overpaying for licenses  when we talk about unethical companies sekike project comes to mind almost immediately and with good reason    so it could be either of them  kiriyaaoi was definitely the leaker however      this may or may not be implying sp
  it wouldnt be a surprise though to see another navel title get released through yumehaven  they are ran by the same group within agm that runs moenovel and moenovel at least has considerably boosted its output of titles in the past couple years
  jast is also a possibility since they can just stay afloat even if they never release anything
  jast has the most amount of money out of all publishers thanks to jlist
  kiriyaaoi doesnt work for jast
  this  then again  and  just points to sp
  i legitimately believe that jast will eventually release anything they license even if itll take a few decades i cant say the same of sekai sekai so far is the only vn localization company that seems scummy enough to buy a license just so the other person cant have it well maybe nekonyan too but they havent done anything crazy yet     though in the end it might be obvious by which major company doesnt give any titles to hyorin
fantranslation group quarrels look professional next to these kids  also fuck jast in the ass for hijacking nitro
  fuck jast in the ass for hijacking nitro  amen also add empress and alcot since the head fantranslator confirmed that they are negotiating for clover days and sekai project is not involved
  i sure love being the punchingbag how would i even know possible sol press titles i dont work for them i do work for nekonyan  also let me just say i love dealing with being upset over the dog i had for 14 years being put down as we speak and someone pings me about apparently im now a leaker  come on guys
  i wish the dog had to put you down instead
    admit it
im so happy we have some new drama its so much better than argueing about honorifics
  i came here to laugh at you you fucking shill piece of shit    no matter if you did this or not you still deserve to be smeared at every opportunity for constantly riding sekais dick and willingly being a total retard about it
  thats not true no matter how much you dislike someone when you stop caring about facts you are no better than the crazed feminazis and sjws i hate the guy too but you have no proof that hes done anything
  when did i claim he had done it
  translate 
  but i want honorifics to stay anon theyre fetish fuel
  could be nutaku too they have money to waste and they certainly dont care about selling games
  how does it feel to literally be shilling for free basically getting nothing from it and end up looking like a complete joke and/or asshole depending on context out of all of it
  with such a long tail of sales evenicle alone has probably covered a chunk of mgs other flops this year
  wasnt evenicle and futa morgana fandisc the only successful titles for them this year anyway
  magical marriage lunatics was also likely successful enough for them or at least broke even though not to the extent of previous moonstone titles
  would be quite funny if imopara 2 ends up higher this year than mml on their yearly chart  the power of incest
is that    will meru be allowed to get some rest someday and finish translating flowers
  thats not a surprise at all considering how well the first imopara sold 50/50 chance of it ending up higher due to the endofyear spilt
  dont forget that technically all of the kagura games that are sold on the mg store give some money to mg      they were the only huge successes but most of their other titles this year probably broke even or above     huge success  evenicle for obvious reasons  fata fandisc probably pales in comparison to the originals sales but thats still a shit ton by mg standards    probable success  retarnia it isnt very good but it has gameplay  funbag fantasy sideboob story it didnt get a physical announced yet but come on its funbag  magical marriage lunatics worst selling moonstone game still probably means that it was way above breaking even  higurashi even if sales of chapters are going down i doubt it is at risk of going below breaking even  ammolite vns cheap and sell half decently consistently i think bitter exclusion sold worse but i doubt either flopped  sisterly bliss pretty good preorder sales and good sales for the first couple of months iirc    maybe breaking even but likely enough to be a flop  sorcery jokers its done better than the propeller titles but that isnt saying much at all it might have done okay enough on steam to break even maybe  maidens of michael its preorder period wasnt noteworthy but maybe being on gog was enough to make it break even  hapymaher despite a good preorder period sales past that havent been the greatest    definite flop  supipara unfinished forever all ages episodic game  kuroinu fuck episodic games it doesnt help that it isnt the definitive edition  koropukkur not a huge flop since ks probably mitigated the damage but i doubt it gained enough traction on steam to break even with the ks paying for half of the cost or so      suki suki has been doing pretty well in the preorders so it should more than break even it will probably be a success
everyone is shitting on loca love for being episodic and fw didnt even try to defend it it is not at all episodic in the sense people are thinking they are just selling each route separately but the route is not ended abruptly or anything its a complete experience and its good ichaicha
  nobody is shitting on localove for being episodic theyre shitting on it for being horribly overpriced given the content inside its 20 for a 35 hour route that is just one heroine with no interaction of anything of the other heroines past 5 minutes into the title its good but not 20 good and as a result it feels like a waste to purchase it as a result nobody really talks about and probably wont talk about it until a complete package is released at a more affordable price it also doesnt do a single unique thing its a heroine weve seen tons of times before with a plot weve seen numerous times before theres no interesting gimmick or character/plot development to make it even worth the time other than more mindless fluff which weve had an overabundance of in these past 2 years     at least momoiro closet was longer with two different routes containing different relationship development it also had dual perspective for several hscenes which is a very uncommon thing and is a nice change of pace the h also had a lot of variety with different scenarios and toys
  dumb plotfriend
  there cant ever be an overabundance of fluffy love
  sure im lying when i say i want moe in my moege
    my only issue with momoiro closet is that it had all these super cute girls i couldnt fuck  blueballing seems to be a bit of a theme with front wing recently
  in your disdain for sp you let something slip by    the krauts you fool    have you forgotten that hata broke nda once already or the whole venusblood kikestarter fiasco  hell the dates match too   the leak was before ax  hata broke newrin nda in august  meaning that he was already working for solpress before then    most likely he or another one of the krauts that works as qa for solpress went into his own discord server and started talking about sols licenses not knowing the was a guy from another company watching the chat
  early review embargo is not the same as working as qa you dumb retard
  all these super cute girls i couldnt fuck  pretty much this in the end i would have liked that each heroine got like 23 hscenes instead of 1 heroine all scenes  so much wasted potential especially with inos wonderful art it was a bit overpriced too
  even if it is complete people wont buy a vn for a single girl unless they liked her that is why the standard forever was 5 girls so you could sell your games to as many people as possible    right now i just feel like i dont have to buy any episode of loca love until they have the twintail loli and if there isnt one i dont have to buy it at all
  this is not a loli
  its a scam and people are paying for something that may never be finished since frontwing said it will be expanded/continued depending on how it sells same goes for momoiro closet   is right youre paying 20 per heroine/route  if theres the standard lets say 45 heroines thats 80100 for everything instead of the 3545 full fledged complete release in one    with kickstarter and 20 per route frontwing is milking the visual novel fans really hard
  just realized that youre talking about momoiro closet not loca love youre confused  but 1 heroine games have been a thing for a really long time     and there are some really good ones like aikagi
  you got me bro
  i broke the files of the game open and it seems like the additional routes will get added as dlc means localove is the groundwork and the other routes are like 510 bucks more per heroine still more than the usual prices but not as much a ripoff as you might think
  yes there are single heroine vns last i bought was sweet sweat but ive also had zero interest in just about all other single girl vns released since it is a massive waste of time to produce those vns as you will only sell to the people who the girl appeals to
i wonder why the localization companies dont notice the obvious cashcow honorifics as dlc    doddler get onto it
  everyone should just try to reach the widest audience possible stop being an idiot
  it is a massive waste of time to produce those vns  its really not even if they only appeal to a certain number of people theyre cheap as fuck to license because of seiyuu costs and its pretty much guaranteed profit
the leaker is yet unknown
  youre still not funny
  gacha style visual novels where characters routes and events are sold in lootboxes and each roll costs 35
  xev implied that he knows who it was
  that is not what i am saying im saying dont try and reach the smallest audience possible
the nora to oujo to noraneko heart project may potentially be alive again or at least some type of overseas release of the vn was mentioned in todays announcement of a new anime series for the franchise
  link the same thing was also mentioned in their moe game awards post earlier this year
      looks to be the announcement this time around but yes it was also previously mentioned earlier this year as well
  nukitashi  heavy h  anon i have some bad news
  please do share what i have missed when playing the game myself
  i havent played it i just remember everyone in the eroge thread bitching about the relatively small amount of actual h there was in the game if this was a lie id be happy to be told im wrong
  theyre probably retards who cant read japanese that thought it was a nukige because it says nukige in the title i think it has around 30 hscenes so i dont really see why anyone would be complaining about a lack of them its also pretty hard to not call it h heavy when theres stuff like this as background art 
  cant wait for it to be an engrish/censored release
  i sure love being the punchingbag  you make it so easy
less than a day left before the venusblood frontier preorder store closes if anyone want something other than the game itself it is now or never
    overseas makes it sound like it will be in more than one language so im guessing its another hikari field/nekonyan release
  literally all japanese refer to english versions as overseas dumb fag
  calm down there friend i only said that because two years ago at ax and one year ago on twitter  they specifically called it an english release
  tweet written in english says english  oh wow
  do you think japs just dont know the word for english or something  
  almost all of them say overseas instead in japanese jop wannabe
  i really dont get why youre getting so angry over pure speculation but well see when its announced
  angry  you can go speculate back in your discord if you want a hugbox
  nowhere did i say i want a hugbox youre just irrationally angry for some reason
  hes angry because jops will lose another kamige
  not him but the first noratoto isnt great the sequel is pretty good though
   nora 2 was indeed far better than 1 but my main problem is that it had too many heroines and just like with majikoi s a good chunk of the heroines dont get enough screen time
  i was just happy that yuu and nobuchi got routes iris was a nice surprise too noel got shafted though
  noel got shafted though  my excitement decreases she has my favorite design
princess evangile
  if someone buys 2 copies thats probably enough for the game to show up on the chart
  im happy that good old games still sell good but at the same time im disappointed so many new games flop like mml or hapymaher
  im still sitting here waiting for a koihime musou sequel
  mml is bad and mg was super lazy when localizing it it got more sales than it deserves
  or actual flops like sorcery jokers
  i completely forgot about it
  everyone did except a single dork the entire time i was reading it i found myself just wishing i was reading ayakashibito instead
  its honestly not that bad we have past data to show that it takes a little more than that to show up the chart even in 5th place
  pretty sure mml didnt flop
  nothing too amazing but at least it was in the chart for a couple of months
  it was in the chart for a couple of months  nothing too amazing  flops like sj or hapymaher couldnt stay even 2 weeks in the chart
  mg just released a new random rpgmaker game now pe is out of the chart
why da hell my baldr force stopped starting it was fine all this time  more than half the game finished
  it might just be claire yukino didnt sell quite as well but acerola games seem to be doing really well for kagura games celianna has been on top for two weeks straight on a side note i plan on buying sister travel the art looks really neat    considering how well their games have been doing well and the 950 or so monthly patreon payments i wouldnt be too surprised if they tried going for some larger titles soon the main factor is if the creators of larger titles are willing to negotiate though theres always the vague possibility kagura games gets one of alicesofts lesser known titles i doubt mg made alicesoft write an exclusivity deal or something like that
  kagura games has an almost infinite amount of cheap to license doujin rpg tier games  going and paying for bigger titles would be risky and straight up dumb  sticking to the stuff that they know until it doesnt sell anymore would be the smartest option  but i do expect that almost all localization companies announce some rpg maker game next year sol press for example is already working on one
  yukino did better on jast
    the publishing rights to the grisaia titles have reverted back to frontwing although sekai is still distributing them on the denpa storefront i imagine because frontwing doesnt have an r18 storefront although i wouldnt be surprised to see them end up on jast as well like everything else of frontwing    sekai also put up r18 pages for i walk among zombies the nekopara paid patches and the relord paid patch although they oddly arent releasing those until the 17th
  the publishing rights to the grisaia titles have reverted back to frontwing  good thing i waited i will be buying all the rest now on the next sale and playing through them
  but i do expect that almost all localization companies announce some rpg maker game next year sol press for example is already working on one  i always wanted to make my own jrpg about surviving sp translations
  out of curiosity did sekai ever finish the physicals for that ks project i lose track of which projects they have actually finished    i wonder if this means that himawaris rights will eventually go back to frontwing too then again that title isnt exactly a big seller
  im kind of curious as to how short term nekonyans and sol presss contracts are it could explain why they were able to license notable titles recently its not unusual for a contract to need renewing assuming that shuffle is representative of their deals with any nonoverdrive games the same goes with mg but there could be consumer trust issues if you regularly lose any notable title you license in 5 years or so
  its not like they lose access to the game when the contract expires or at least thats not how it works on steam not sure about mg can the people who bought shuffle on their store still download it there
  i walk among zombies is getting unmosiaced too
    also valve is now lowering the amount it takes from developers its now 20 instead of 30
  not exactly relevant since no vn is earning anything close to 10m in the first place
  the reduced revenue only applies to specific titles which have made 10 million in revenue drops to 25 or 50 million in revenue drops to 20 so it is generally no change for niche vn developers but is instead aimed at trying to keep larger developers from leaving the platform
  how come himawari didnt sell i loved it
  allages release esl tl ntr
    more tax breaks for the rich typical
  i didnt bother because they only brought over the allages release and not the 18 release why would i want to read a vn with notable amounts of sexual tension that doesnt lead anywhere other than to the text and then they fucked i could just watch any ecchi anime and have an equal or greater experience as a result if youre not going to have ero in a title dont bother adding ero elements yeah
  unknown titles where the plot is the main draw and the title itself is lacking in some immediately obvious appeal have often struggle in the west  its a title you would have to explain why it is worth playing to an audience that wont hear you a title without any real existing reputation at launch not being quite good enough to build an audience with time like fata morgana no obvious appeal to bring in impulse buyers and being released late enough it missed the steam craze making it a success would have been no small task      one can also point out that it was purely an all ages release which may have turned away some potential customers but even if an r18 version might have helped boosted sales a bit it was likely still destined to flop especially when it likely had a high break even point it was a big pickup from frontwing and was announced at the height of the steam craze at roughly the same time as the propeller titles
  id be more curious about how common it is for the rights to the english translation to be acquired by the japanese company upon the expiration of the contract without that mechanism in place it would generally be in both companys interest to generally renew when the license period comes up provided the localization company is still around aside from a situation like navel where a mainstream company agm had put in a competing offer to put their title onto a more profitable platform
  probably not common at all and only a thing if the original company had setup a western division since the english translation would be developed entirely by the western publisher the western publisher would have to willingly agree to hand it over entirely to the original developer at the end of contract which is a really pointless thing to 90 of japanese developers
  95 of the time theres no reason not to renew your contract with a western localization company for another 5 years its literally free money for them without doing anything  of course as people mentioned theres the shuffle version but that was navel wanting the nekopara steam sales and cutting mangagamer out of the deal     you can still download titles that arent being sold on their site shuffle included
  keeping big names on the platform benefits the smaller devs on the platform too no one on steam is helped if big devs create their own platform and pulls away some of the mainstream audience from there
  oi vei i am envious of others success and dont want them to get any benefits
  no one on steam is helped if big devs create their own platform and pulls away some of the mainstream audience from there  while true having competition is also beneficial the fact they are doing this in the first place is a sign that valve is slightly worried about the big publishers putting things on their own platform and has pressured them into tweaking revenue splits it took valve so long to put in a refund policy while origin had a decent one for many years before that
  valve put only a refund policy thanks to euroland due to the new laws including the privacy changes thanks to the gdpr
  when it comes to sales there isnt that much rhyme or reason to it high sales is usually the product of luck or other elements besides the vn itself anime adaptions right place at the right time or being streamed by some ecelebs  himawari is well liked but theres no particular reason why it would be a great seller
    the esl tl that conjpoo put out for himawari was actually embarrassing i still cringe at that oniichan scene
  while anime adaptations being on steam and such are definitely huge factors dont forget that what genre a vn is has a major role too gameplay titles get the highest numbers consistently and nukige in general are about as consistent selling though they cant usually go on steam moege arent that far behind when it comes to consistency and numbers sometimes exceeding nukige when they go on steam you do see a few flops here or there though bl/otome/yuri seem to sell somewhat consistently especially on steam though thats mostly just because the demographic is starved rather than because of the size of said demographic then theres everything else where himawari is
    backers only  i want to know what it says
  does this mean the vita release is dead how does that work for kickstarter backers
    it mostly says that they got mixed feedback and need longer time to figure out which crowd to listen to    mostly centered around adding random japanese to dd and buster because some people think it is awesome memes and others think a translation should be the original script but in english
  no screenshot
  need longer time to figure out which crowd to listen to  so they havent even started is it too hard for them to have a toggle or even a separate exe and script it loads if it is unworkable with the engine between a less localised version and the version they already have if they are struggling so hard if they are spending so much time worrying over it they may as well use it on trying something like that of course even then it wont please everyone but it should cover most of the two camps
  they just like to waste time over dumb reasoning
  misa patch out  4 weeks trips a monster indeed      posts about ntranons trapge  doesnt report the release of misa patch  fag pls
  who are you quoting
extractor for the pc98 version of beyond kurodaishou ni mirareteru  take a look at the mes files ie the files that contain translatable text  its some kind of unholy abomination that probably uses some sort of lookup or hash table
  is this the legendary nip programming
  is this the legendary nip programming  i dont know what that means
i really hope sekai project goes bankrupt in 2019 so a real company can pick up the licenses theyve been sitting on for years now for pennies on the dollar it would be karma for all the shit theyve pulled and fantls theyve sniped    the loss of their frontwing contract will hopefully start a downward spiral which they will never recover from
  i mean i dont think they were making much money from grisaia anymore after so long
    announce balrd sky  zero updates in 3 years  now the project page has been scrubbed of the generic steam publisher page  i dared hope  never again
  any one got links for dive1 torrent
  zero updates in 3 years  has it really been 3 years already
  yes so abandon all hope ye who enter here etc etc
      expecting a baldr project to ever get translated
  i hope thats the case but i really doubt it they still have a fan base that seems willing to fund any kickstarter they put out nekopara and if all else fails bundles they are definitely on the decline if their ax announcements are any indication but i wouldnt count them out yet visual arts did give them rewrite which might sell decently because anime      if they never release it ill be glad sekai wasted their money at least       to be fair force got translated out of nowhere
  to be fair force got translated out of nowhere  wait what  for real
  the all ages version but better than nothing i suppose
  you know for a second there you got me all excited but then i remembered this is real life and there is no god
  apparently the all ages version was easier to hack than the 18 version so thats the main reason why the fan translator did that version
  get me a download of the raw all ages version 18 version and the patch and ill shit all over their reasoning
  dang its not uncommon for games to deduplicate text but ive never seen a game that used partial text references worse is that inline with the game code gross actually my best guess is that it loads the first string into memory in its entirety and then overwrites the first 4 bytes if its the load button thats selected if its pc98 i guess stupid tricks to save space were probably common back then although i doubt this even comes out positive
  sp got rewrite  welp ill pirate it i guess
  although i doubt this even comes out positive  from a pure memory usage point of view it doesnt
  visual arts did give them rewrite  why would visual arts give a shitty company like sekai their license instead of just localizing it themselves if anyone could do it themselves va could surely va would be aware of sekais reputation i would think
  they still have a fan base that seems willing to fund any kickstarter they put out  theres a sucker born every minute i guess i imagine nekopara alone probably keeps them afloat i wonder when that contract will expire
    doesnt matter since force is pretty fucking mediocre now my excitement for sky is basically gone
  theyd have been dumb not to try for exclusivity after jast nicked flowers from right under them
  its been over 2 years since they announced angel beats and theres been no visible progress i doubt they have an in house localization team
  thread up with the status updates for this week
  fuck man it felt only 2 years or a year and a half ago everything is going so quickly
i remember browsing this thread five years ago    just learn moon my friends  if you focus 100 on reading you can get there in two years
  can we ban this faggot
this thread is for sharing things youve recently been interested in that dont have their own thread or even that do have their own thread but you think should be shared with a wider audience all subjects welcome as long as theyre /jp/related from entire games and series to oneoff images you found in your feed    long and autistic essays about why the recent thing was so great are encouraged if said thing was particularly niche and you think more people would appreciate it or even nonrecent things youre a fan of and havent found a place to discuss up until now
i was going to plug ims radio because i wasnt sure if anyone remembered it existed but it turns out that its a permanent fixture of /vg/ // threads which i didnt know about because i dont visit /vg/ for reasons so now i feel sort of silly    still those of you once and future ims fans who also dont visit // for whatever reason should check out the radio at shijoumoe at least once if you havent already
bought galgun 2 for the switch the other day
  where did you buy those doujin from
  op here they arent mine see 
where does /jp/ go to get their manga and ln raws it feels like its easier to find scanlations than raw mangas  /djt/s manga library is missing an awful ton of stuff
  usually i just google for the title with a zip attached to it mangazipnet for example has most of the stuff i searched so far  but i also sometimes just buy what i want if i cant find it
  seikai novels up to the fifth senki volume  the new mangas five volumes  the three most recent issues of comic ryu  you have done me a solid thank you  im not confident enoung in my japanese to buy raws yet this will be good for building up confidence
  search in japanese
  this game makes me wonder what inticreates was smoking when they made it
anyone beat this yet did you get both endings     desu though i was only able to figure out how to get the 2nd ending from a chinese streaming site since there are no translations or a wiki    all in all i liked it  it was neat seeing some of the cast in 3d    compared to the other games in the series i felt it was shorter than say ghost93 or 94 but it was a bit dialogue heavy towards the end
i like this thread    going to japan for 35 weeks a little over a month from now gonna have to start really thinking about what to do there specifically soon  picked up maplestory 2 fun game my character looks really cute  making progress in umineko reading part 4 now absolutely loved part 3 turned on the original sprites i like them better i was kind of disappointed with the answer arcs in higurashi i hope the umineko ones are better
im a big fan of japanese low budget zombie splatter horror and any other odd genres that can be considered adult entertainment a lot of these bmovies have unexpected moments and can be very creative im fascinated by what they can do with so little resources  now the other day i found this trailer of まいちゃんの日常 and it actually looks more interesting than the manga i am looking forward to it a lot im glad i checked out the channel because it has plenty of trailers for obscure and lesser known movies i saved like 10 trailers to my backlog   notable trailers that made an impression on me are             finding this content is fairly difficult there are a few popular producers of the scene like nishimura because his works made it to dvd releases in the west so im very pleased with my recent finds and look forward to see them
  you should watch カメラを止めるな
i made this webm of a clip from some pv ages ago and never really did anything with it i dont recall seeing any other gifs or webms of this being posted so if you can mind the quality ill put it here  i cant remember anything about where i saw the video but if i remember right it had yuuhei satellites 色は匂へど散りぬるを in the background the only results reverse image search give me now though are some chinese websites with dead links
  is this rotoscoped
  it actually looks more interesting than the manga  not possible without having a live action baby in a blender scene    a lot of these bmovies have unexpected moments and can be very creative  reminds me of when i watched jigoku japanese hell or whatever it was called about the aum cult that someone mentioned in the last thread or some other place and there was this part at the end where this samurai came to hell and beat the shit out of the oni then fucked off back to life
  not sure but this blog seems to think that its partly 3dcg    looking at it again i get the same impression especially at the part where youmu draws hakurouken
  havent heard about this one yet thanks      not possible without having a live action baby in a blender scene    the cute girls will make up for it
the link to   was a highlight of the previous thread
i dont like tomoki tomonoris art the underwear they draw are cute and i love mary jane style shoes but they always draw the same kind of underwear shoes and faces its not even like hotpants lovingnoise where its always hot i also think the way they draw feet is weird chibi feet dont work on non chibi characters and it just looks lazy im sick of people posting that stupid fairy comic too     at the same time though i wonder what sort of fucking drugs they are taking and why they like alice in wonderland so muchother than probably being a stoner   
  wasnt the whole egl thing influenced by alice in wonderland alice is simply big in japan not really surprising since she is  one of the bestknown  fictional characters created in the west
  wasnt the whole egl thing influenced by alice in wonderland   iunno i know it was popularized because of malice mizer i dont know if it originated with them though alice is a popular story but this person seems obsessed with it touhou alice their own alice in wonderland version and other things related to alice     you also could be thinking of rozenmaiden which has a gothloli theme alongside alice in wonderland theme alice isnt really gothic or elegant though egl is probably just more influenced by bisque dolls than anything
  i dont have the time to research it now but wikipedia supports the idea that alice was an influence on egl   ill write a more detailed post if i get to it
  i can just read wikipedia if all youre going to do is write a post based on a wiki search but feel free to do whatever make sure to ask /cgl/s opinion for your report
  i can just read wikipedia if all youre going to do is write a post based on a wiki search  no shit if i do it ill at least go through the source wikipedia cites
  why are you so invested in this all of a sudden anyway
  i remember it being the case and you got rude with  i can just read wikipedia if all youre going to do is write a post based on a wiki search but feel free to do whatever  so i kind of want to prove you wrong
sometimes i think that /jp/ is more /prog/ than /g/ is
  i still need those comifuro pics show me your indonesian doujins
  id like to see them too im curious what asian doujinshi from outside of japan are like
i cant believe that /jp/s thread cycle time has gone down to eight hours from a whole day or whatever it was before    what exactly happened
  people are just spamming like retards right now itll probably get worse over the holidays and then go back again even over a week there are times when shitposters make shit threads all day and time where threads last on page 9 after not having replies for 1 day and 3 hours     then theres this wave of shitposters that just found out warosu exists and spam outdated posts like they can be part of the past or something alongside the usual good old days shitposters that want /jp/ to be nothing but spam like 20102012 this results in people also bumping their threads so shit threads go to the bottom and thus makes it look like the posting time is short you should spend some time reporting low quality and off topic threads so they can be deleted faster
  when 4chan gets the official vtuber do you think her threads are going to be here or on /qa/ i foresee a corrosive influence if they are going to be here
  /jp/ is not for western things
  youd hope so but since hiroyuki owns the website and the vtuber is his idea he could allow it by decree
  go check /qa/ sometimes they cant even fucking figure out what to do with it
  i am not surprised
  kuronashicom
  this is cool
  the quality of scans is more of a problem for me translated versions have better scans most of the time which is stupid
  maybe its because scanlation is a team effort so there is more quality control
  just batch convert the raws with rota/clean script they arent too hard to make and will save your eyes in the long run
  every time i listen to this and a yukiho 10 song comes up i get sad all over again
we should have more threads of these i dont have any new prints so making the thread myself would mean id just repost older things
  its ok most threads consists on  reposting old and already discussed stuff like most idolshit threads
the final solution to the lewdposting question has started hopefully the /e/ and /d/ threads will be banned for good
  beautiful for those curious its 
  wow this is some historical shit what advertisers can do to a man
what music does /jp /listen to
  what /d/ threads
  he ought to bring back text boards
  are we gonna die i dont want to die _
  i like tom waits is there a japanese tom waits
  random fat/feet/diaper/giant 2hu threads and the monster girl general
  wow this is some historical shit  remember when 4chan was net
  it was before my time im a 2006 newfag
  its not like 4channel is new or anything lets see if round 2 goes any better
  what text boards had activity besides /prog/
  maybe we can have world4ch back
  touhou circles and i like monstercat/tokyo machine
  i wish
  sadly our crippling autist doesnt let us make anything worth with that
  does anyone there unironically believe on this
  i do remember reading a page on exblog deranged enough that the author likely wasnt trolling just like a rat infestation if you see one theres likely 20 more also the japanese arent any more immune to being fantastically retarded than the rest of the world look up begali jesus and other places christ totally expired/ascended/returned
    and people wonder why japanese art is popular worldwide
jagmo will be performing some touhou orchestral music on december 7th at the tokyo opera city concert hall takemitsu memorial        if you are in the area you should definitely grab yourself a ticket and attend you will not be disappointed  also earlier this year when they performed touhou music it was streamed on niconico and some anons were able to watch it thanks to some other helpful anons mirroring the stream to get around nicos streaming limit nonsense thank you for that      i am not sure if this will be too since there isnt anything that says it will be but if there is i will make a thread about it        they will be selling new touhou arrangement cds as well some samples       
  thank you i really enjoy orchestral music and will check this out
  i wont be in the area but i look forward to hearing the recordings if they release any
  i doubt it there will be anything released that will show the full performance once its over they streamed it last time on nico and you were able to watch the entirety of it for a limited time using time shift but not anymore i think there are no uploads of it on anywhere else either
whenever i find a /jp/sies youtube channel im often shocked by their liked videos
i went to 芸か１７ on the weekend it was my first doujin event of any kind and it was fun the organisers even kept lining up at the start interesting by playing janken to split the queues up randomly    i wasnt prepared for how busy it was though a few things were on my list to get first because i expected them to be popular but even with getting there in the first 10 minutes some had already sold out i think some artists just didnt print many copies    i cant even imagine how busy comiket is because this was just a small event
  dont leave us hanging give examples you dont need to disclose anyone identity for that
is there a vocaloid rendition of elos twilight i am  surprised  i couldnt find find one  the almost inhumanly smooth vocals of that song beg to remake it with a digital voice  i did find this pretty cool mmd of miku as the bunny girl in a parody of daicon  iv  
  poor quality content made by popular people fad crap things like that  its just the kinda stuff i find unbecoming of /jp/ posters if you know what i mean
  what do you expect from people that have youtube channels its the same as having a tumblr twitter or facebook people who feel the need to interact over social sites are trash themselves
  what do you expect from people that have youtube channels  interesting fan content youtube is western ニコニコ
  nico is japanese cancer of the highest order though
  youtube couldnt be further from nicodo intrusive as fuck ads flagging bots with no concept of fair use a related videos queue that pilfers results from an inhumane pool of sponsored content no discrete tags no discrete searches no documentation no systems for attributation no fine channel privacy control etc fuck even youtubes subscription system is somehow worse than the xml feed they already provide      this is also true but up until 2013 or so it was more of a malignant tumor even now id compare it to breast cancer whereas youtube is more of a multiple myeloma    in the spirit of the thread i learned of the ラクガキ王国 series wish they made more than 2 games though
  theres people who didnt know about graffiti kingdom and magic pengel in 2018 can you draw anything good in it i own graffiti kingdom but i couldnt even make anything even on the level of reimu cameo in it going online later and seeing what others had made discouraged me so much
  i had seen it but had never arsed myself to actually check what it was till now once i get the game ill let you know what i can make in it speaking of reimu cameo wwwyoutubecom/watchvppgijil67o
bump above all these shitty off topic /e/ and /d/ threads
  thats a good reimu there is  a special charm to extensive character customization on a console
i wanted to share this cute video with jaypee but this is the only thread i can    
i watched some aika recently to see what it was about apparently its not just the epic pantyshotondeath action series i thought it was but some weird mix of action and scifi with constant panty shots at every possible moment and also there are actually dudes in it also a lot of nudity for some reason i didnt expect there to be as much nudity as there was since i thought it was a panty fetish anime it takes itself fairly seriously too which makes me wonder if eiken is a parody show or takes itself seriously     i watched the more recent one too and it was just a bunch of dykes sodomizing each other but amusing for the main character actually being deeply bothered by the gayness of basically everyone around them reminded me of pic related     all in all even though the 2009 one is more modern fanservicy vs the older fanservicy of the 90s series its somehow still less explicit than something like queens blade or sekion no quasar they dont even go into as much detail of the panties as they do in average modern anime with only moderate fanservice it actually seems like more of a butt guy anime than panty fetish anime even with nudity lesbos panties and sodomy i still dont feel right calling it an ecchi anime in 2018 at the same time it probably had more sexual stuff than most ecchi anime nowadays since they usually seem to do everything but imply the characters in modern anime have sex
  i know that yukari ascension cd i was in a convention in 2016 and ask if that was for sale nah it was a prize for maimai competition
can somebody tell me about kor in the days of its peak of popularity
  korea knights of the old republic
ill bump with this grotesque image from a doll thread
  imagine an ant of that size relative to your size in your mouth
  what like a carpenter ant that doll probably isnt that small they tend to be like a foot or a foot an a half or so i believe so its not unreasonable to think its like maybe 1/4th my size the ant isnt particularly large relative to it
  thanks this is comfy and sweet
  kimagure orange road
  apparently made by a chinese artist called ddf     fast forward to 135
  good find anon i suggest not actually fast forwarding to 135 because the cowboy short at the beginning is pretty good is this guy a pro
  trains
  i doubt there are many anons in their mid40s here
god i dont even care that this cost me 200 dollars this was the best thing ive ever spent money on i love meiya so much
  id definitely call it an ecchi anime but its one that has more going for it than just ecchi  going in i expected it to be shallow and full of panty shots but what i got was an interesting premise and setting good characters and a very likeable protagonist

usahoris reitaisai animation now available      more in the video description the full feature can be either had digitally or in physical form    also remainder that english subs for episodes 2 and 3 of his previous work are still unfinished or need approval one comes straight from google translate apparently so it needs deeper corrections links if you want to continue them   ep2    ep3 
anyone ever have any trouble with ordering doujins off amazon jp i wanna order hizuki akiras original comic  but im worried about canadian customs confiscating it
  its nice of him to include english subs
    congratulations i got a daki a few years ago and it really helps me sleep i wish there was a warmer or something you could get for them though
anyone play 最悪なる災厄人間に捧ぐ i was thinking of getting it on switch but wasnt sure if it was worth the 3000yen price
  looks pretty interesting is it a horror vn with puzzles is there any chance it might be officially translated
im sorry
  whats with the quint clones
  im not sure as i havent played it yet it seems to be pretty unknown at the moment it could be possible as more games on switch have had english versions but its hard to say      from what i could tell from the website summary the main heroine changes based on the type of food the mc gives her at the start of the story
i miss mmorpgs no new ones have come out in ages and the ones that have come out relatively recently are all trash mabinogi is still the only fun mmo to me i hate that theres nothing else i can go be cute and fish and fuck around in but also has decent combat and characters that arent so horribly proportioned i hate sd avatars superrealistic avatars and weird porportions like whatever blade and soul and tera were going for    i wish mabinogi could have a new graphical engine and slightly better looking characters also that they would stop making waists higher with newer clothes because fuck that long leg short torso look it fucks up the arm porportions at least mabi is still fairly popular so itll last a few more years but this game really needs a successor however i know that lineage and ff are probably the only mmos that managed to have relatively successful sequel mmos  even a wow 2 would probably crash and burn to ashes     also fuck the auction house fuck auction houses and market boards in general

i was listening to a kancolle image song from 2014 earlier and wanted to share it with someone  those of you who couldnt care less about kancolle might have fun with it anyway because its because its one of those songs that involves a va handing lines off to her self     艦これ華の二水戦 ライブ風      ft jintsuu sakura ayane breathy mode sendai sakura ayane power mode and naka sakura ayane shrill mode    if anyone knows any other good selfduets outside of the numerous kancolle i voiced like twelve sisters image songs id like to know about them  in the meantime im just listening to them all
  the nichijou ops are kinda like that
  i am not familiar with kancolle but  a va handing lines off to her self  is something i enjoy thanks anon post more songs like this when you find them
  just finished ep 2 please check it some parts were not translated literally in order to make the flow in english natural however the meaning is all there
anyone know if the ar tonelico series is worth playing i keep putting it off because i hear its terrible but i heard the same thing about yoko taros games and i love those
  ar tonelico is great especially the ps2 ones whoever said theyre terrible is sorely mistaken there used to be at threads with all the stuff you needed to get started so check the archives if one isnt up
  thank you very much this looks good to me the only thing remaining is the title at the end 3362 to 3391 and they will be ready for approval
yuyushikis 10th anniversary event is going on right now at the at the akiba co gallery and im sitting here overseas f5ing on the internet    life truly is a struggle
has anybody here ever been to one of these cosplayer/idol photo shooting events i really wonder what they are like why do people go to these paying a lot of money to make photos of somebody sounds kind of weird
  there are events seperate from just taking pictures of cosplayers at conventions
  yes for example this one

what recurring threads would like to see removed from /jp/  what recurring threads would like to see established on /jp/
  i dont want anything to be removed if people have fun so be it  i would like to see more regular doujin stuff on /jp/ somewhere where i can talk about music somewhere where i could talk about artists etc
  what recurring threads would like to see removed from /jp/  this one for starters    what recurring threads would like to see established on /jp/  who the fuck cares why dont you fuck off to some phpbb forum where you can all have post counts and fifty different levels of admin and in the general  site discussion  administrative planning subforum you can have a stickied thread titled what threads should we sticky next
  which threads do you like anon
  nevermind a チェキ is like a polaroid i gather       what recurring threads would like to see removed from /jp/  all except the oc thread   i dont care if people make threads about the same thing but they dont need to be one eternal thread no outsiders or dissenting discussion allowed type deals     what recurring threads would like to see established on /jp/  none assuming you mean general threads that feel the need to live on as a hangout when they dont have any content to discuss currently and shitty forced memes from a decade ago  i want to see people come up with new content or at least try to do something other than make shitty low effort threads when theyre upset with /jp/ this was mildly amusing though      actually that image illustrates one of my peeves my problem with japanese bird/flanfly/hoopdog is that no one ever tries to deviate from it you can just post the image and be done its basically just image spam like the black guy sucking a candy cane or the cat paw at least with das it mane or something they would make the effort to make different types of posts one of the funnier things was that slaps your ___s ass post because it kept mutating to really really stupid board specific things and you could use different images or the post thepost the((()))do you even lift oneone /fit/ import meme even more because it was in response to a different use of the image really i want copy paste culture to come back its still usually just used for spam but its funny reading different variants on a theme instead of the same tired posts in this repost culture where the poster is basically just reblogging some ancient image without generating any content themselves      also i want a template thread option in the report queue like in /a/ they all might as well say my post is flamebaiting bullshit
  チェキ is like a polaroid  yes tiny instax cameras were a hipster thing for a while
  /jp/s shitposting is closer to our brand which is quite close to 2005 era /b/ while /a/s is closer to the new age imagereddit shitposting common to the rest of the main imageboards    what that basically means is that /a/ shitposts by having a deluge of completely worthless shit but isnt interesting in the slightest or simple garbage that gets repeated simply because it is annoying example implying image macros and other shit that would have been funny in middle school /prog/s and to a lesser much extent /jp/s shitposting consist of having a few different shitpost methods with at least some thought put into their creation for example the how are breasts attractive thread which is completely off topic and ridiculous but is well written and somewhat interesting nonetheless ideas are formed on a questionable premise then expanded upon until it reaches its absurd logical conclusion it may also take the form of making a huge deal over a minor detail or assuming things that are false and writing a long critique based upon that or making provably impossible demands contrary to standard 4chan shitpost model s4sm where the intent is to annoy the intent of our shitposting is to entertain provoke discussion or simply as an exercise in writing    since the fall of usenet w4c style shitposting is currently considered some of the best in the world even the great usenet trolls have migrated to /prog/ to bask in the glory of our shitposting the un is currently trying to classify /prog/ as a world heritage site but their action may come too late w4c shitposting is currently an endangered species due to invasion by the imagereddits a dwindling population caused by suicide and incarceration and moderator action some have speculated that moot is trying to kill all forms of shitposting that do not conform to project canvas so far the best defense available is to derail stupid imagereddit threads with kopipe and jews as well as giving harmful advice to homework threads it is considered rude to call a w4c style shitpost in conformance with board standards bad    it is thought by leading scholars that the reason for the shitposting schism was the rapid growth of /b/ due to the media exposure of chanology when an influx of underage digg users caused 4chan to explode others claim that the shift happened even before that during the first influx newfags during 2006 this school of thought holds that the first influx gave rise to the loutish behavior of raiding and other bullshit which was a direct cause of the second major wave once /b/ was populated almost completely with underage children the shitposting culture changed to its modern form where it is a competition on who can be the most annoying the cancerous population then colonized nearly every other board on 4chan that could possibly appeal to its socially welladjusted population mentifex an expert in the field built the artificial unintellegence andru to model the thought process of the imageredditors despite a few setbacks the project has largely been a major success    since world4ch was not linked to on most boards and since the average imageredditor ignores anything that isnt a reaction image anyway the area was left mostly unharmed by the change of shitposting it remained much more subtle and resembled machine generated spam less than the imageboard brand since /jp/ was at one point full of autistic sexually deviants a natural pairing for /prog/riders and were far more computer literate than boards such as /g/ or /b/ they were naturally drawn to programming /prog/ and /lounge/ which had a shitposting style slightly different than /prog/ until two retarded children took over the board was an obvious destination since it still wasnt enough of a secret club they moved off site to places like 4ch for a few days before returning to /jp/ with a more cultured outlook on shitposting
  alternatively we could just not shitpost    anyway back on topic i found out zip2ch/2 is almost an exact mirror of our own /tv/ they really hate the koreans especially australia which i earned is full of koreas
  funny as heck but seriously why can we still not delete opening posts the days of blaming it on moderation are long over
  maybe try asking on /qa/
i learned otaku isekai spider comic is actually a series of books and i dont know enough japanese to read it fuck    the manga spider is cuter though
are there still isekai where the mcs arent overpowered i know its usually ones with female protagonists like inuyasha and escaflowne but something where a guy is the  protagonist and hes just a member of a party or something like that and not the most powerful ever in the whole world not the other way where hes hopelessly weak either
  based ayaneru
  based on what
  people who feel the need to interact over social sites are trash themselves  4channel included
  ah it cant be helped
  not the other way where hes hopelessly weak  are there any like this  somewhat related there is a  classic short story titled  the man who came early its  a good counterpoint to stories about modern people improving/ruling the past with their future knowledge
  4channel is an antisocial medium
thankfully
  thats a wont play for me
  of course you wont you dont even pay taxes jamal
what is your number
  
  ive had 120 hidden one time but it always hangs around 100
  are you one of the people who come to /jp/ for the nonotaku topics like tea and random people on the street
  there really isnt anyone whos interested in more than a third of /jp/ with any level of depth  i dont hide threads but i do scroll past dozens of threads i dont care about every day
  no
  you are a /jp/sie of patrician taste mabinogi is the only mmo that still feels like it did in the old days and makes me feel nostalgic whenever i play it its hard to describe but its genuinely fun and people actually talk to you unlike most other mmos    giants best girls
dont get caught in materialism   its a slippery slope
  true  now its all phones   the smaller the camera didnt mean higher quality     i still prefer using cameras as opposed to the phone but with sd cards

can we have a discussion about the 2011 tohoku earthquake and how it affected you
  jps poisoned the pacific ocean and they refuse to apologise for it
  it caused the cancellation of the kodomo no jikan bluray box
delayed muhdoka
it killed at least 3 artists i really like and caused a number of others to go missing so it can only be assumed they died
  thats a tsunami energy map not radiation or anything if you think that
it was weird    i was in japan right before it happened more precisely i was on the airplane flying from tokyo to switzerland during the earthquake took off 34 before it happened thats how right before it was  i didnt go north but still feels so surreal to have traveled there just fine and knowing 1 flight later back means i wouldve been stuck in tokyo for 3 or 4 more days
which tuhu would u fug during an earthquake
  me on the bottom
  who
  daichan    she would carry me away to safety and in return i would inseminate her
   which 2hu would u make love to during an earthquake  yuukarin but id do that like any time

i also wanted to post ごとーs art for レシオps song since its extremely cute
why is it impossible to find art of miku getting fucked by sonico theyre both sexy mascots and they do crossover occasionally why is there next to nothing of my crack ship c
  for skinnyfat pairings miku and luka are more than enough
  but luka isnt fat anon
  its okay miku likes meaty girls kinda odd for a vegetarian to like meat but no one gets hurt eating that meat
  can you please post a better pic/scan of astronaught kaito im dying here
  vegetarian
  canon miku is vegetarian if your head canon miku eats corpses is up to you
  canon miku
  wow thats the first time i heard of an illustrator starting to do music and its pretty nice  tfw yunip will never make a new album  his stuff was so good
  miku is an android she doesnt eat anything
  eats corpses  using emotionallyloaded terms to cover mediocre reasoning by adding unnecessary drama into the post
  
  its amazing not only i have access to r18 versions of his safe pictures they also have much more resolution 10 mb/picture had to reencode pic related to make it fit the 4 mb limit of 4chan
  now share the private goodies with us
  i might upload a zip someday but i dont know have you been a good boy this year
  10mbpng over 250kbjpg will not fix his absolutely garbage affinity for colors and same face syndrome though  id like to think hes been drawing with a terrible monitor and thats the reason he cant into colors but surely after all of this time he wouldve realized already
  absolutely garbage affinity for colors  he is using the same washedout color pallet for god knows how long already the color selection is fine
  bitch ill eat your corpse
  whats wrong with the colors
why is there so much shilling for this saika guy in this thread he kinda sucks i might half understand if there wasnt such a vast wealth of vocaloid porn but come on
  i think the colors are okay ive said before that his style just looks really boring its not like objectively bad really it just really seems soulless
  i have been a good boy this year 
  i dont mind the colors and somewhat enjoy his vanilla stuff but his proportions are weird
  i cant explain it but somehow i look at something like this and even though its really simple the style just looks like i can feel its aura or something and saika doesnt have an aura at all
  saikas art just looks like someone that bought a how to draw anime book
another new masa  
  very high contrast mixed with an unappealing color palette his latest one with luka is a good example also the way he conveys lights and shadows is borderline pillow shading at times    to each their own ultimately though
  i was gonna go to bat for this pic because i didnt see anything too super awful about it and the colors look ok to me theres not a whole lot to complain about because its pretty basic and safe art nothing too bold or experimental its just passable and not egregious the thing that turned me against it was how fucking thick mikus waist and torso are what the fuck happened there
  now i cant unsee it she doesnt eat that many bacon wrapped  hotdogs
  hey anon does that site support paypal asking for a friend said friend wants to support a different artist
  tell your friend its ok to be a degenerate and to like saika
  saika doesnt make mmd videos with lewd models so my friend will pass on that
  if the artist does r18 they will only accept debit/credit card dont know why
  snow miku 2019 module what
  its against paypals rules

      oops  ive been out of the loop for this stuff forgive me
  
  this explains why her website was down for that brief period lol
  synthv  vocaloid
  cute pic do you have a llink to the original definitely wallpaperworthy material right there
  
  stop spoonfeeding
  me
  thanks thats really high quality      who hurt you
  always down to spread the len love
    it doesnt sound like her utau voicebank at all i dont see the point
why
  shes beautiful
  that luka
  how do you do fellow kids
  i really want a green smoothie now      this song is really nice but the vocals get overshadowed by the beat
  dont get rioted
  going right now
i heard that theyre ging to stream the show in paris is that right
  if you can watch through the smoke good for you
  yeah from what i heard but i dont see any link to it
  
anyone in the line in paris 
are they selling merch inside the venue in paris im going to the london concert but probably wont arrive before noon
  yeah not inside but in front of the entrance
  v
  thank you  but you have to sign up right
  the stream will start later or how do you access it
  they are selling inside i got a jacket that got sold out outside
opinions on this album
  it is full of yanderes i love it
anyone have the playlist of the live 
  not yet
  guess ill discover it as it goes on thanks
  december 9  shit no expo until next week
anybody in the paris concert wants to meet up for drinks
  sorry need to catch my train or i will be stuck in paris
  anyway were waiting near the security tent just outside yellow jacket guy
  how many anon that went there anyway    also kek to the guys that got interviewed by quotidien
fucking 10/10 concert the song list the light effects the everything holy shit maybe im exaggerating but i think it was better than magical mirai 2017 the last one i saw
  any stand out songs
  the sound mixing was shit and you couldnt hear the vocals at all
  miku expo is more a best hits whilst magical mirai is more new songs so the setlist is usually better at least    i fully imagine the london venue is going to suck ass though its not built for concerts
  you wanted bass for the gigap song right there have your fucking bass
anyone got pic  or you were too busy to enjoy the concert to take pic
  taking photos  this is why one of the reasons why miku concerts outside japan suck no one wants to spend the whole concert seeing a crowd of phones
victory
  it was pretty tame for a western crowd but yeah not as fun as in japan pull you out of the concert
  any costume changes
  yes quite a few ones including music like magic that was new i recall watching changes in tell your world world is mine satisfaxtion the intense voice and kigamure mercy
  oh and world end dancehall and of course the new song of gigap
vip access is 3 hours before concert  fucking hell
  is that or 3 hours in a line in order to get a good spot at least inside is warm and you can buy merch before is sold out
haha confetti get
  mfw we didnt get vip access
  doors open 3 hours before for vip and theres a separate queue for vip waiting for 3 hours seems like a chore though i tried that shit back at animelo when we waited a couple hours for the concert to start
  london was incompetent as fuck and released the tickets at 11 gmt instead of 11 bst/gmt1 so i got my ticket before they shut it down
which one of you fuckers wore the ahegao tshirt and spent a quarter of the concert filming it
  pretty sure i know who that is did the shirt happen to have a censor bar over the eyes
  quarter of the concert  what a faggot  couldnt even do proper job of filming the whole thing
  not on the back at the very least also correction if there are two known ahegao tshirts this one wasnt so extreme as the other one who was that flavor of the month/season with a trap manga 12 years ago
  theres fakku bootleg version which was done without permission and presumably something like a chink/jlist made bootleg version
  literally every japanese concert ive been to in the west has assholes with their phones out recording the performance as if its not bad enough being stuck behind tall people you cant even see past the crowd of phones
  not that many tall people on my side of the hall the french are manlets but when they hold their phones above their heads thats when they do annoy me    not this one maybe  but i didnt see his front side
  for me it was worse the people raising their arms all the way up and leaving them there come on you only do that at the end of the songs
music like magic module very lady gaga
  at least london has 1st floor gallery so im hoping ill get a good picture this time although based on my knowledge of the venue that gallery is going to be located massively far away or to the side
    tell your world last song of the concert     the video does not justice though you had to see the background simulating stars live to appreciate how amazing it was
  im so glad i didnt go to and wasnt forced to stand around you shitty ironic weeaboos all day
  cool i can more or less see where i was
  go to miku expo for the music go to magical mirai for the experience is my viewpoint i sometimes see the photos on twitter of the people going to miku expo and theyre like the most stereotypical weebs ever
    i guess it is paris after all
  hopefully in a month or so theyll finally leave and go back to their shitty discord or whatever hole they crawled out of
  more like go to expo because you dont have any choice its better than nothing
  every fan should make the effort to go to magical mirai whilst its still decent
  almost no one who uses discord still comes here i believe theres only a couple who still frequent here and a small amount more who lurk occasionally once you join the discord theres no point in really also posting here
it was great too bad we didnt get a rin solo though
  my brother three duos wasnt too bad tho hoping well get a rin solo in cologne or london
  whilst its still decent  wwhat are you implying will happen
miku expo table cloth got stolen  now this is france
  what really  do you have a link or it happened when you were nearby   either case sasuga france
      for anyone who went to miku expo in france was the miku expo store the only thing they had there gsc europe is even based in france so i would have figured theyd attend like they do for america
  i only saw miku expo merch
my ears is still ringing from the concert  what merch did you get guys 
  the green tshirt
only central europe gets to have nice things    god damnit
  dont you mean western europe
  iberians get nothing
  yeah miku should go to ukraine next year
  the ringing is a sign your ears are damaged from the loud noise
  i honestly thought someone was going to crack the projection screen at this point
  fuck not this shit again kill yourself babyeared shit
  i know thats why i dont usualy go to concert or at least going far from the speaker
  i bought some sound dampening earplugs which reduce the volume but you can still hear the music which work pretty well for preventing damage i didnt have the muffled hearing the day after like i did before
  blows my mind that people would wear ear plugs to a concert do you put sunglasses on in the movies
this fucking setlist  snow na mirai china is this one the best of the year
  wow theyre finally letting an otetsu song in there for luka good job crypton how about not picking a 2009 song next
  still like snow the best but it was my first live miku concert of my life so it has a special place for me
  slightly sad theres no mitchiem here also surprised that melt isnt on there
  melt is there you overlooked it
  unknown mother goose  didnt recognise it by its english name but holy shit didnt think theyd play this at a miku concert  roki  bring it on  thats a fast turnaround given these only debuted at the start of the year    overall i think the setlist is better than magical mirai 2017 which is the one i attended      so i did fuck
20344764  20344790  haha epic xd
  no kagamine solo    automatically the worst no exception
  link the discord
  found the autist
  rettou jouttou again instead of the objectively better hello dystopia
  not me but his butthurt is pretty hilarious i hope its that same spammer who hates miku blindly
you should always wear earplugs at a concert hearing damage concerns aside it blocks out shitty crowd noise but hardy affects the music allowing a purer listening experience
  to be fair the la expo had a solo for each twin alongside the 3 duets  though id rather have the paris setlist over the la setlist
oh nanashi is using vflower too now im glad    new 蜂屋ななし featuring vflower    new すりぃ featuring len    new 雨の介 featuring miku    new guiano featuring vflower    new loony featuring vflower    new ive featuring miku    new a_ii featuring teto    new 霧島 featuring yukari    new yono featuring yukari    new dis featuring miku    new canone featuring sasara        first aircup featuring miku    new あらたまいこ featuring una    new emon featuring rin  
    i know a guy who was following the miku expo song contest really closely hoping that kaito rin luka or len would win a song like that would ever happen and when cant make a song won he bitched and bitched like he was genuinely upset    you have to be delusional to think anything other than a miku song was gonna win that contest honestly
one one one one one one one one neeneenee
  he was setting himself up to be disappointed    it literally says it right in the name miku expo
one one one one one one one one neeneenee
  there were quite a few spaniards in the concert though including me    paris is so close
  oh btw japanese went all in
  i cant tell if its my eyes but does that say tronto
  yep toronto is now officially renamed tronto thanks to miku
looks like he did end up uploading it to youtube  
one one one one one one one one neeneenee
    what i think is paris was a success if cologne and london goes well too i can totally see barcelona added to the tour in 2020
one nee nee nee nee nee one nee nee nee nee
you know how on windows there were those apps that could let little mini characters walk on and climb on your screen i mainly saw the miku/fate/touhou ones is there anything like that for android like an interactive wallpaper that climbs on your icons
  that is a pretty solid set list alien alien and the mm18 songs are all really good
  as far as i know i dont think theres shimeji for android iirc shimeji is desktop only

  lol maybe he should go to len expo instead
  len expo  now that timeline would be awesome
definitely 3d armpits are not the same
  im not complaining though
  why not id wife the dayo desu
  interesting do you also watch movies with a blindfold on
  yes and i also wear condoms when i jack off
looks like people liked the french module
  she was pretty cute
  its a nice module
also miku can into french now    
  i wear socks when swimming
  mitts when i eat
  its a really pretty module and apparently it was designed by a legit french fashion designer
im really excited to go to miku expo in cologone this tuesday any of you guys going too
  i am surprise that fashion brand didnt do a collab with her yet i mean if louis vuitton use lightning as model why not miku 
  you dont want to associate with the people going to miku expo
  the people who post here dont like vocaloid enough to go to concerts
since im going to the miku in cologn concerti mean first row vip tickets are seated right so going early wouldnt really help right  are there any stands with merchandise or something i guess what im asking how expo is this miku expo i like to go to concert relatively fresh and clean hence why going late would be better if there is nothing else there
  if you show up late youre going to be behind everyone else who got vip tickets too   i cant understand not wanting to have the best spot i usually get in line about 10 hours before the doors open
  wtf    but the tickets are numbered with row and seat number
  i mean first row vip tickets are seated right  no both vip and normal tickets are standing freeforall so its like a normal concert where either you queue up massively early or you get stuck behind those who turned up early ive got a 1st floor london vip ticket but i honestly dont know if i can be bothered to queue up early before the doors open given the doors open 25 hours before the concert anyways    the only merchandise store theyll have there is the miku expo one selling miku expo themed goods its not like america where they had a bunch of other stands as well
  i guess maybe the germany venue actually has seats both the france and uk ones were standing only
  if thats true then no it doesnt matter in contrast to the expo shows i dont show up the venue at mirai until like 30 minutes before the show starts
  i dont know about uk but in france there definitely were seats behind the standing crowd
  that was a raised gallery i guess i meant more the arena area would be standing    id be interested to hear how people who went to france with vip tickets found the queuing
  are they really that cancerous ive never been to such concert or event before so i have no idea what to expect the reason is that i generally find weebs obnoxious so id rather not interact with them i just bought a ticket for the experience i may like it or not well see    tickets are numbered by row and seat so you should have your own seat
      nice thanks was getting a bit scared here standing around for 10 hours is doable but makes me loath the 23 hour drive back and the concert will be less comfy especially a concert without much croud movement
  they just cant compete
  magical mirai has seats but during the concert everyone stands up i imagine germany will probably be the same unless they pull a shanghai and force everyone to sit
  where are you driving from if you live in the netherlands than i might be able to pick you up driving by yourself is boring
  imagine being forced to seat through a nonclassical concert
  shanghai miku concert was a shitfest they literally brought riot police to enforce it
  what is the deal with the concentration of vocaloid fans in the netherlands what draws you dutch to miku
  driving from around frankfurt with a friend of mine so pretty much the opposite direction    but thanks for the offer  i recommend the brauhaus type restaurants in cologne as a pretty nice although sometimes touristy restaurants with mostly included own brewery btw not sure how old and restauranty you are
  escape from a reality of muds and fat women
  dunno i can only speak for myself    no problem wanna meet up prior to the concert for some food and drink
  depends on my sperk friend desu will post here with a rin once i know
  are they really that cancerous  western weebs are cringey as fuck they all tend to talk like children and about how rin/len/miku/etc are all so cute or whatever its really uncomfortable being in a conversation with them    also they may or may not smell
  they all tend to talk like children and about how rin/len/miku/etc are all so cute or whatever  yeah thats my impression as well they behave like adult children i think vocaloids are cute af too who doesnt but i dont talk about them like they do if you know what im saying  also they may or may not smell  ive been through hell and back sitting in an airplane for 12 hours next to a chinese elderly with rotten teeth sweat is the least of my concern
new 23exe is finally on their bandcamp  anyone have it
  there was no vip for france even tho day 1 tickets were named such for the standing gallery     i queued up about 5mins before the entry time and the line was huge about half of the audience was already there maybe a bit less as i was entering the building the line was a bit straightened but longer than when i queued up  only expo merch inside i missed the placeyourselfinthemap and found myself about halfway in the middle of the standing gallery decent spot if id have to say it all depends how many tall pricks are in the way sweat started to smell within minutes people got inside tolerable
  i guess that paris is slightly different looking on the website theres no explicit vip entry time for paris whereas germany and uk both do which suggests maybe paris didnt differentiate between the two vip has its own entry time and queue apparently so maybe there wont be a hugeass queue for them in the other two venues
  i hope so also wishing the seats are numbered im nonvip in cologne but a good spot otherwise
  false equivalence a movie is not bright enough that you could see it through a blindfold just fine and there shouldnt be anything you need to block from your vision while watching
  yeah nicolas buffe to be more precise    it is on the concerts guide book
  the dude is a true french weeb living the dream in japan
my daughter and my granddaughter are so cute
  maybe it was the way the 3d version was made but im liking this designer miku more and more
whats the appeal of hikkiep
  thanks for the heads up ordered a physical copy  its unrealistic but if no one uploads i will but i probably wont receive it for another month or so
first クズ魔界レコーズ featuring rin    new お母さん featuring sasara    new ケロ featuring miku    new ちのぞーツイッター featuring miku    new ハタケン featuring teto      first みにくいくにみ featuring vflower    new 猫アレルギー featuring una    new 茸きのこ featuring one        i find the contrast between the cute vocals and dark/distorted music appealing
anyone here have miku dollfies
  no one here is that rich
    if i had one of those it would be really really crusty
  im fascinated by the people that owns a dollfie it looks like they took seriously that their doll is their daughter its kinda cute
  i couldnt wait any longer and bought it   it isnt as good as call my name which is one of my favorite albums but is still okay
to those who have been at the paris event  any recommendations what absolutely not to miss and what to miss at all cost      i recommend the brauhaus type restaurants in cologne  the one near the main station isnt bad
  what do you mean 
  anything on site that one absolutely needs to go to  like decent shopping opportunities food anything    although at the point where the glowsticks are 35 euro i dont think it will be decent shopping
anyone here still remember suzumu  i found that he is active again with another name right now     theres a lot rumor about him when he retired like kouhei said that suzumu is reason of kemu voxx disbanded and he stole song from kemu but i think thats not true at all  he even collaborated on pv with kemu for konomi suzuki song under his new name    so i think theres a lot misleading about him like he cant compose music or something he still active until now so that is a proof he can compose music
  yes ive heard that but i hadnt looked into it as for the rumors i only know that he undoubtedly stole from mafumafu its not an issue of whether or not he can compose music its the fact that he was dishonest about the songs that he didnt compose
heres my vocaloid figure collection i own a lot more vocaloid merch but i wanted to post figures only im a neet right now but i bought all these when i was employed the pride of my collection is 1/4 miku
  nice dont know if you noticed it yet but there seems to be a teto mixed in with your mikus
new harryp  
  new
  those boobs
  in paris  fucking nothing lol just stay safe because of the riots  the merchs selled at the event  glowstick is the only thing you really need tees are cool tho just save your money for the bluray
  the riot is only on saturday so dont visit paris around saturday do we know who is gonna release the bluray 
  glowstick is the only thing you really need  do you look like a retard if you show up without glowsticks
  theres something like half of the crowd without glowstick so no but i for one will judge you
  the riot is only on saturday  its the whole weekend actually but shit happens in weekdays too  today highschoolers blocked some roads ambulance drivers too cops teargassed both we dont know when theyll release them      no but glowsticks are a big part of the fun
  cant really call a riot what happened in weekday blocking road is tame and wont really endanger tourist or people in general its in saturday that they gather around and chimp out
  true but it looks like fed up cops are attacking pacifist people so id still be careful
  i think its more complicated than just cop beating poor peaceful protester its more like the true rioter who are among the mass attacked the cop and in response the cop charge or gas the blob of people  just dont go to where protester are and you should be fine   anyway its not a french new thread and lets talk miku concert
   riot is only on saturday  theyve been rioting for 2 weeks anon and its slowly escalating
  no one cares if youre lucky someone near you might be giving out free chemical glow sticks part of the whole japanese concert experience is waving glowsticks in time with the music and chanting along
im not an active fan but i got a vip ticket for cologne because i wanted to experience it im sorry to whoever didnt get a ticket because of me
  there is a difference between rioting and protesting the riot only happened on saturday but i do agree thing seem to escalate no matter what the gov do or say people are out for blood next saturday not that it will stop me from going to the tokyo manga expo thing heard it had vocaloid goodies    as long as you know some vocaloid song and appreciate it its fine enjoy yourself and have fun
   japanese people have a lottery since supply cant meet demand   every other capitalist society just gives the best tickets to the highest payers    works for me because ill pay for vip every time youre front on the floor right dont get too close or miku will look wonky also every vip will have a glow stick you better bring one
  the lottery system is better since everyone has an equal chance if you fail you just go to one of the ticket resellers    i paid 25k yen for a ticket since i missed the lottery
  i absolutely love suzumu its like kemu and gigap had a baby musicwise and he uses gumi and len which are my favorites i got his physical album too i was very surprised when he retired especially since he seemed so involved in the community and regularly collaborated with big name producers and stuff whats his new name
  the end is near
      ill bend over for the slant eyed jew and get myself a glow stick this time hopefully theyll not be sold out
  get two
  those things are 35 euro each i already pay a fortune in fuel and the tickets werent exactly cheap either so one will do
new thread

  these pictures are so wholesome you almost forget that sanaes a slutty prostitute
  you are human filth
  just like the men sanae has sex with
  why do you post such things  do you just want to ruin the character for people
  why does a snek needs those huge phat funbags for
  how do you think sanae grew up so big and strong    lots of snekmilk
  sexy suwako
  i want to drink the snekmilk too
why does a snake have such big tits
one of matarajins okina aspects daikokuten is the father of takeminakata kanako
  i didnt know okina was a grandma
  okina can be my grandma
snake paizuri
she raised sanae very well
  what does a reptile need those huge mammary glands for
  paizuri obviously
  to steal sanaes boyfriends
  i also want to release my seed inside kanako
  for okinas grandkids

  a smol snek is cute as well
  if i had a touhou image top ten this would be in it
massive power
big guns
  i pray to suwa for more lewds of this snek
crossing the street with kanako make sure to hold her hand while doing so
  why cant the elderly cross the street by themselves
  shes not holding your hand for her sake anon
  then why does she want to hold my hand
  so you wouldnt run away like a goofball and get hit by a car dum dum
  scary tongue
  why a donut
  she was a police officer
was a goddess of war ya know could have gone pro if i hadnt gone back to school to get my mba
  dont call kanako scary when she isnt trying to be
  i dont like this kanakp she seems very menacing
  overly cute snek
  goddess of war winds sky jack of all trades  master of none
  enjoy your paralysis
  but she can get you good trades because of sanae and her faith
  spoopy snek
  sanae mustve been a real burden on kanako and suwako
  why her tits are so huge

  i dont like these kanakps
  but reptiles dont lactate
behead those who post yohane
  yohane is impure and wrong
  reptiles also shouldnt have breasts like that
  left kanakp   right kanakp
  but theyre both kanakp
  wait is this a continuation of the sanae x kanako doujin or just another one

  ive seen other japanese people do it before  shes trying to make the other persons knee buckle and fall/almost fall
  i believe so
  whats the story with  this song is it going to be released as a single or something
  what the fuck is wrong with her leg
  tfw no imouto/kohai to make them fall and do lewd things when theyre defenseless on the ground     i was thinking about them lately wish they would do more things together more lives and 2shots they have the same manager after all idk what are they waiting for   i personally would love if they release limited units mayama/mizuha ayaka/mippi mirei/sora hinata/mecchi pochan/riju rittan/moa
  unfortunately
  i think it is a limited single available exclusively from japan rail east mall    
momoiro clover z flower collaboration with some flower company i forgot i saw it on their twitter      spend a bunch of money on this bouquet

  shachis green looks like she loves anal
wow mcz is going on international tour again     they are doing concerts in taipei and shanghai in january no ticket info yet the venues are kind of small like 10001500 people    also the theme of their christmas concert is the diamond philharmonic which sounds glamorous    i didnt really like electric christmas cause i though it was kind of sterile  i really hate those spandex superhero princess outfits not that i actually went i just watch youtube clips
  seems like they hate the new girl
  tfw europe is not world  but i can understand it here in europe finding someone interested in anime is a borderline impossible let alone japanese idols we only got kpop fags
she is still green i want to see her turn into a great idol someday
  meant to reply to     also i like how they have to earn their solo songs but wish hitoka didnt win this time
  just posted it in fun anon
  trying to turn pure pochan into a lewd girl is not fun
  i know im sorry here have a pure picture to make up for it
no other idol group can come even close to their sheer natural beauty
  i want to say ebichu but i think you might be right there anon every member is top tier level beautiful
sakitti kawaiiiiiiiii
    the purple one is the most beautiful and her ears are cute
  seta is the best member for a reason
since the last one died i think were doing a better job at keeping it alive
her
lol
do they search a replacement for izuka in momokurochan
  they asked the fans for names how would you name it
  bum head
  oshiritan  lol
guys i think i want to adopt hana as a daughter

lol where did this arin hater come from
  i agree although not surprise because shes the best anyways  in lunas case i think the 5 second instrumental loop that plays in mugen mv fits better than what they used in the full song it sounds different

previous thread 
the other members of lantica went to watch karins show    also whatever happened to mikibot man he really did help us didnt he
  whatever happened to mikibot  apparently shitposters targeted him by reportbombing his endofthread longfred posts as spam and now hes waiting out a 30day ban that i guess he hasnt been able to get appealed
  he deserved it to be honest
  he really didnt
  spamming is against the rules if i have to suffer for it so does he
  if i have to suffer for it so does he  so you reportbombed him got it
  tbh posts like those at the end of dying threads are not really spam and this was obviously done with spite and malicious intent you may not like him personally but you cant deny he does a service to the threads by compiling the news
  so that gives him a right to be above the law no thanks
where is this from  
  never did i say or imply that
you were supposed to let this thread die theres not even the template
  make a new one with the update template

    karin is leaving her agency due to contract expiration
  its so weird to see this happen to an sc va she hasnt even been with ims for a year whats she gonna do from here
  and chisa just got mamimis ssrp true end        she seems to be getting work from many places so shes probably going to be alright even if she goes freelancing though she might go to another agency
  move agencies or keep working as a freelancer  itd be nice if she had better management and got more roles though

this is a japanese language learning thread for those interested in traditional otaku media such as anime manga light novels and japanese video games    if you have no interest in the above or want to request a translation this is not the thread for you    read the guide before asking questions     legacy      previous thread 
hihi
this isnt what i meant
  this kills the gook
fail the card on anki or barely catch it and feel insecure about it  understand the same word easily when reading  the fuck is going on
    韓国芥を殺します
  context
ive been keeping up with vocab not as much grammar as i should be doing and going bit by bit each day i finally feel like that this is far more possible than i made it out to be at first even if im only a few months in
i didnt want to start a thread about it but how is this a sfw board
hey this is gonna sound real gay but do we have a minecraft server
  ive made huge progress too  im already able to read basic stuff and it feels good to hear dialogue i can completely understand now  im not doing any particular learming strategy just trying to do the things that seem to help being persistant and coming at it the way a kid would learn cuppled with my experience and willpower as an adult  the 11th marks my 5 month mark
  epic cringe
i did rtk and it seems to help with vocabulary acquisition although its only because i know to look for radicals   if i were to do it all again i would only memorize the radicals and how to guess the meaning and pronunciation from a kanji/compound  then id have have only spent a week learning about kanji before learning japanese instead of like 3 months while also making me hate it and believing that i was learning japanese when i wasnt and getting frustrated that i couldnt see any results even though i was spending hours every day studying japanese haha
seriously if you ever wanna gatekeep japanese just tell the unworthy weeb that its important to do kanji first and while youre at it give them bad grammar explanations too
as a chinese speaker i can say that knowing kanji and chinese vocabulary helps with acquisition of japanese because you start mostly add new readings to a vocabulary knowledge base which makes bootstrapping into japanese itself very easy
i keep reading but i havent read about grammar in a while oops
what does it mean when こと is at the beginning of a sentence like this i dont even know how to begin to look this up    こと戦闘において主導権を握ることはこれほどまでに重要である    context is some warriors took the initiative and succeeding in a sneak attack against some monsters
  2055  nice work op    previous thread   you had one fucking job 
四苦四苦八苦    えいごでなんていったらつうじますか    たぶんbuddhismようごなんだけど
  quick look up simply defines it as being in dire distress but that doesnt really do it justice
  was there really anything in the previous thread worth preserving
でもよ誰かに話すだけでも気が楽になるってこともあるぜほら落穂拾ひにもあったろうなにかの役に立つといふことを抜きにして僕達がお互ひに必要とし合ふ間柄になれたならどんなにいゝことだらうってな甘ったるいけど胸に染みる言葉じゃねえか　胸にたまってることがあるなら俺はなんでも聞くぜ    i dont know how to read that archaic quote in the middle hes reciting it to a girl whose present was refused by the guy she likes she told him talking to him about it wouldnt help but then he says that can anyone help me with that archaic shit i cant make head or tails of it for the most part
  where is this from im not sure if the adv same as/similar fits perfectly and koto could also mean things like ancient city word that musical instrument
  ぐーぐるせんせいが    direst distressじゃあありませんかって    いってくる    いいかたいろいろあるのかな
  its from goblin slayer volume 5 page 90 i think it just means something similar to the in this context but i really have no clue you know for a light novel theres a lot of esoteric grammatical bullshit in here the lizard and dwarf especially are hard to follow
  なにかの役に立つということを抜きにして僕達がお互いに必要とし合う間柄なれたならどんないいことだろう
  the only こと grammar i know of that comes first has ば following it
  ゴブスレよりゴブドワ
  when something appears that looks like esoteric bullshit i try to check a 古文 dictionary but i got nothing for you on this one
  looks like a typo desu
kanji is gay    hiragana and katakana seems sufficient why bother learning fucking chinese autist glyphs
and yet whenever imouto posts people lose their shit because its an unreadable slurry of kana
  no problem i appreciate that you tried to help even if i ignore it i can still grasp whats happening and the overall meaning of the sentence thankfully      ゴブドワよりゴブエルフ      word for word from the book itself i did find an actual typo though  ゴブリン共の攻撃は恐るるに足りず
  so all those ひs and ふs are basically just いs and うs i thought that was what was going on but i didnt bother replacing them so word lookup wasnt working properly kind of stupid and lazy of me in retrospect thanks    i still dont super understand what hes meaning but its a little clearer now
is there any group of language learners more hostile and dysfunctional on average than japanese language learners its because of the autistic socially inept weebs isnt it
  im three weeks in and im understanding this retarded alphabet system less when is 家 うち and when is it いえ
  when is it け when is it ち when is it んち when is it か when is it へ when is it や
  the secret is that it doesnt matter and core2k is making you think that it does theres a difference but it doesnt matter yet
    that answer probably wasnt satisfying so here  while a character might say いえ or うち its written 家 either way いえ refers to a physical place and うち is more emotional i live here vs this is my home type of thing it hasnt been relevant in anything ive ever read but there you go
ie house  uchi home
  thats more concise thanks

  japanese is so retarded
  i think it very frustrating that many kanji have different readings and meanings one argument to learn kanji is exactly to have less problems with homophones but i think it only makes matters worse because it adds another layer of confusion also so far i dont really think that homophones in spoken language are that much of a problem often the meanings are kinda similar like with ちかく to me near and soon are similar enough others that diverge more are mostly pronounced differently or are completely silly like jappari the only difficulty is the learning strategy for this when using a premade anki deck this leads to quite some false positives until you finally get whats going on but having all meanings directly on the card is a bit challenging as well
i started learning japanese about a year ago i was learning kanji and vocabulary through my japanese textbooks but very little stuck memorizing the kanji felt like an impossible task and i was close to giving up then i started wanikani which made learning kanji simple and actually fun the srs and leveling structure made sure i never accidentally overwhelmed myself the mnemonics ensured that every kanji and vocabulary would stick in my memory after a year i can now read over 1000 kanji i can navigate japanese websites with comfort i can read some of my favorite manga and actually enjoy it most importantly at least in my opinion i can put more focus into trying to learn japanese grammar knowing that wanikani has me covered when it comes to kanji
this promotion was gladly sponsored by wanikani
  is it actually good though im doing vncore 12k from here and i hate that it doesnt have audio
  vncore into reading should be enough by itself
  just make a mining deck idiot
  no u
its my third week and i still cant read japanese
離れる  放れる  離す  放す
  
  cuz u suck lol
  what point are you trying to make
  so its just for emphasis weird but interesting
  it was updated with audio in the cor  im pretty sure it wont upgrade inplace so dont bother just pointing out that its a thing
its my second day and i average 68 of hiragana memorized
takeaway from a botched attempt to communicate with a party in ffxiv its not a good idea to omit information just because you would omit it in english they wont necessarily fill in the blanks as youd expect you should be very specific until you know for sure that its normal to abbreviate a little in that particular case
  did they make fun of you
    no they just didnt understand what i was talking about    they problem was fixed before i had a chance to elaborate
reminder that manga vns lns and novels are not reading
will i start being able to hear my own accent and correct my pronunciation or am i going to be blind forever
  is there a word for 発音痴
今夜は何の方法で妹を汚そうかな
  you have to do passive listening for 18 hours a day and make flash cards with color codes for pitch accent while reading as little as possible to build up a correct model of what japanese sounds like if you want to be ichiban tsuyoi
  sounds like the only way to do that would be to live abroad in japan for a while
    id say thats wrong if you want to git gud at production the only way is to do lots of production    focus on being able to speak first then focus on being able to speak well then work on your accent
  彼の 妹と 私は良い 友達になるだろう
i want my brain to learn faster god dammit
  彼の  あの  wtf
  手を凌辱的に繋いでば
  i was just making fun of matt     anecdotal evidence tells me that forcing early production is a bad idea although im not sure the damage is necessarily permanent so i actually kind of agree with him there    reading early crippling your japanese is really fucking retarded though
  エッチすぎる
kanji makes recognising words so much easier lol i cant fucking tell what a long string of hiragana is
  yeah its good if you know the kanji  which you dont most of the time
思い出す/jp/が日本語を習えない
    kanji is like the boss that ends the first arc in a three arc game youll know 95 of the kanji that you run across ages before you complete your vocabulary
思い出せない  故に漢字はクソ
  how long did it take you
  what
  i read it as かれの
    my whole learning process has been filled with gaps where my japanese deteriorates so im probably not the best person to give time in any regard however if your study is centered around reading you definitely master kanji long before vocabulary
  give your time anyway
i ended up with only 20 new words after reading a ln im ready
how much does listening benefit learning when combined with reading
  obviously a lot because you get used to hear and speak some expressions  if you focus only on reading you could fail understanding a very simple spoken sentence
reminder that singing helps significantly with your pronunciation sing along with those weeb songs you listen to whenever you can
  of course listening specific things are going to be improved by listening my question was more about whether combining the two in your study routine improves comprehension in general including when reading
  this  my kanji knowledge has skyrocketed when i started reading for real  when you actually get out there and start learning the language you realize that knowing a kanjis meaning is basically useless more than 95 of the time rare kanji are an exception but as a beginner you shouldnt really be paying too much attention to those at all
quiz time bois  translate each line in our head no cheating    小型　こがた     ハンディ     マッサージ　     キーホルダー    ボタン     電池　電池　     ボタン電池     疲れる　つかれる    カラダ　体　    あっち　あちら     こっち　こちら    あっちこっち    そっち　そちら    ポケット    サイズ　    一家　いっか     笑　わらう     コードレス　    手　て　    ひら　平　    手のひら　    キーチェーン　      付き　つき　
  not really  the listening/speaking part is fundamentally different than reading/typing  you have to do both to better understand a language overall but they are different things
it doesnt explicitly say that so this answer is wrong  the right answer is also just implied  id fail these things even in my native language
  no you wouldnt just accept that you need to study more and get to it
  
  your tendies are ready jamal oh and dont forget to change your diaper and check that report queue okay honey
  i couldnt do it without you
btw i dont use a diaper i like most of you just use the thread    its like the fecal river in india or w/e
just found this     wouldnt this be more fun than actually doing rtk if you have to distinguish the correct kanji from a list of similar looking ones isnt that what beginners have trouble with and why they do stuff like rtk at the beginning of their studies i think it would train your eye without making you want to kill yourself but idk maybe try it out
except you can do retarded things like remember the kanji for what it isnt which is really gonna permanently cripple your nihongo for real
  for what it isnt which is really gonna permanently cripple your nihongo for real  theres probably no shortage of japanese people who remember obscure kanji which look like common kanji this way
  this is definitely different because youre not still learning japanese and youre definitely not doing it with some weirdos deck from ankiweb    what i mean is in that scenario youre making good associations or disassociations as it were
  stop looking to solve problems that dont exist when you actually start reading japanese
クランペットって    なにあじが    ふつうなの
  why are you here
パンはパンだ
  spaces in nip  what the fuck are you doing anon
  not him but japanese is as retarded as it is fascinating like those ugly dogs that are kind of cute in a way
  此の其の彼の何の  斯う然うああ如何
  i know the reason i posted that is because it looks exactly like 彼の かれの  thats fucked
  someone post that nukechan video
what are you reading  me pic related also why the fuck is the art so shitty
  good point i just thought it might decrease some suffering for some people who are going to do isolated kanji study no matter what
  if you think the covers bad you should see whats on the pages
  like i said im reading it i know how shitty the art is
  because it was published in 2003 so its 15 years old     it was just the art skill level of that tine
  im a few pages into this
  going to do isolated kanji study no matter what  if they deliberately want to suffer why would you want to decrease their suffering
  no i dont mean the pictures
  i dont think they want to suffer but that they think they have to suffer
  what do you mean then the text the story
  absolutely that
  the early aughts were noizi itos artistic peak you brainlet zoomer if only ln art these days had a tenth of the soul of old haruhi sashie things would be much better
  knee blush is trash eat shit retard
    literal soul vs soulless
  it still links to the previous thread
im learning 30 kanji a day i will be done on february 6th
no youre already done
  should starts with 60 new kanji per day and do one less new card every day  it balances out in the end well with the reviews
or just you know learn the kanji organically
  i dont know i need help
  the japs should unironically adopt spaces in their language
you should 
i laugh when people say they failed n4 twice but im taking it sunday and now im scared ill eat my words
  subscribed
  dont worry dude if i can do it you can do it
  its easy just watch some anime until sunday
reading was a mistake i cant hear the pitch accent difference between 雨 and 飴 now ill never sound native grats djt telling newfriends to immediately start reading without telling them the consequences
  who cares if you arent japanese
  this is a shitpost
  anime definitely fixes this one quite easily    alternatively 
  i tried to warn you young sprout  you should only be doing audio supplemented vocab right now and watching anime like a baby  then when you have formed he patterns of how the pitch and language actually work you can graduate to reading lns
why are you learning japanese    i want to get a job in japan as a 少女雑誌研究者
just for the lulz
  originally i wanted to read mayo  now i just like how it sounds
  勉強してるってなに  もう身につけたよ
i want to practice japanese but im too sleepy
  mostly just to connect with my japanese girlfriend better and interact with her family and stuff
  just to flex    i dont really care for japanese media
  to fuck japanese bitches and also i love their video games music anime kino movies jdramas and their books arent bad either
you dont need to do a nerd thing like learn languages to fuck bitches    when you meet eyes with a ho down to fuck you know its on from the getgo with no words
  ive fucked many women brother and even dated two japanese girls but i want to move to japan and fuck them exclusively  i also said i love their content for a reason  its good
be careful with all that fuckin japans behind the times when it comes to sex ed and specifically aids awareness    would hate to see a veteran fucker like yourself get the aids bad end
  you know how you can do a japanese accent to english words just do the same thing to your japanese it feels like youre mocking whomever youre talking to but it works its just a guess ive never ever done it and probably wont
  i just want a cute little 5 foot tsundere to sit on my face  if i find the right one and the right job im going to settle down and just do japanese stuff till im old and gray  plus theyre way ahead of the aids stuff you wont get laid their without a condom
  yeah idk about that i dont want to offend anyone plus i cant even do like a brittish accent so i cant imagine doing a japanese one in a non bastardizing way
  the binding on my copy of konosuba is godawful pages are falling out left and right which is surprising because the printing and binding quality of the manga ive bought is far superior
is this turning into /int/
  i retract my veteran fucker assessment
  cause culture shock is the only thing in life  worth experiencing     also im an イラストレーター  so i can go wherever i want as long as it has good wifi    波に乗る
i knew so much japanese that by the time i went to japan it wasnt even a culture shock it was like i went home for the first time in my entire life
  i heard sorting your garbage is really complicated
  you just put the right thing in the right bin
  to rekindle my friendship with the japanese penpal i had as a kid but who is now seeking revenge on me for a betrayal i did not commit
when youre the worst representative of westerners with a dull and pointless life so theres no reason to reach out to and communicate with japs
  my parents worked there and i got to live in japan till i was almost 9  it was a pretty big culture shock coming to the states  id never seen people with bad manners really  the girls all acted like boys and stuff  the tech in the states looked all inefficient and bloated  cars were all huge and you can smell smog everywhere  americans get more personal and close up when they first meet you though  i apreciate both
  the itazuraneko site looks like garbage compared to the djtguide site fix your shit
    
  nobody expects the japanese inquisition
  haha i have a matching picture for you
  why are they mostly 外来語  and why are they all so babylevel  theres no value in a quiz that easy    no if that were true it would have been done already
  hmm i havent done the jcat in a long time  i think ill have a go at it later on today
  im more interested in specific experiences than general advice
  broken down from random japanese street signage into some ez mode terms    i could make them harder
  暇だし日本語をすきだから
lol 
i wish i could be the guy who invented memorize kanji twice
  wheres that from so i can call him a retard
  nvm found it on his plebbit account
  filename    also its it all finally starting to crumble for our boy
hey dudes what grammar shall i read about today
something to keep in mind the jcat will no longer be free to take as of april 2020  make good use of it while you can
  imagine thinking that you came up with something people had been telling you to tell people for several months and that people had been doing in groups for several years
can someone reg me an account on reddit i actually just wanna call out matt in that thread but since i have to register an account its severely making it difficult for me to do so

you gotta understand i maintain strict adherence to my morals and making a reddit account is very much against my morals    however i realized there is a loophole where if i had access to an account i would actually have no moral dilemma with posting on reddit since i have always just said and i quote youd have a better chance of pigs flying than me ever signing up on reddit
morals are a spook    just make the account and shit on mtt till you get shadowbanned or something

  who is this cunt she sounds like a faggot tranny  shes saying 実食 which doesnt really have an english translation but means to like actually eat x  example  time to truly/actually/etc eat x
the muramasa vid lmao
  meant for  and in general who keeps not quoting posts
how do i tell when で is locational or by means of as opposed to and
  never ambiguous
give us something where you think you cant tell and ill tell you    watch out for the 引用できるよ guy tho hes not trustworthy
  i only know 100 words so it is for me
  how about ほんとに      like you do in english understand by context  if there is nihon obviously its a place  if there is nihongo obviously its by means of
  just consume more japanese until its not a problem anymore  the rules arent comprehensible unless you already understand enough japanese to know on your own
  ill search for an example and post it later since the last time i encountered it was yesterday thanks
  i have no idea its from the wsg idol thread
also 彼氏は引用していて退屈
  stop trying to translate things in english thats not how any language works you will never understand things if you just try to put everything in the mindset of english just forget and never reference english when using japanese otherwise you will never get above baka gaijin level
  quoting takes like 1 second mate
no one has introduced immersion based learning in a way that appeals to a broad audience and that is why almost nobody understands it the power is in the presentation which is going to be the crux of mia  see you fucking retards he never claims to have invented the input hypothesis hes acknowledging that hes just trying to popularize it kaufmann tries to do the same thing and kaufmann has done a pretty decent job of it but the input hypothesis still isnt very popular all things considered just look at /r/learnjapanese shilling genki and bragging about memorizing n5 vocab after 2 years
i quote people when i acknowledge their existence      agreed with this    but if you wanna translate everything one piece at a time to english i can give you a battle you can never win    translate 始めまっしょい
  the input hypothesis is the only viewpoint that is remotely accepted among actual linguists the people who think its wrong or unsubstantiated are cranks armchair linguists and people with vested interests in the current zeitgeist of academic language instruction
  how about ほんとに  not sure what you mean here in the context of a meaning for 実食 no its not accurate 本当 means like in fact/reality in actuality seriously and used a lot in casual sensse for many expressions but 本当に食べます would have the nuance like im seriously going to eat x like someone is doubting you would eat it or something not really correct here    実際に食べます  this is a more accurate synonymous expression to 実食 lots of times on stupid vlog youtube shit they will say often 実際に食べてみます when showcasing new food ettc
  tell that to most people
  most people dont know anything but what the system tells them or what their peers figured out on their own
lingo steven didnt watch anime or read hentai games and look at how good his japanese is 
  im seriously going to eat x like someone is doubting you would eat it or something  i thought thats what you wanted to say my bad
  he as a really terrible american accent though and you can tell he doesnt use japanese much because he uses expressions a native would not use in some cases and it sounds unnatural im not at all impressed with his japanese hes probably in the middle of b2c1 level
本当に食べるわよ
食べに食べるわよホントに
  didnt he work as a diplomat for like 10 years pretty sure he would pass c2
  my japanese is not good yet but  i will eat eating really
うんこ食べますか   はい   ぜひ
  as you pointed out your japanese is not good
why do professional footballs players spend time in the gym lifting weights when they could just use that time to practice more football meditation allows you to fundamentally increase the power of your concentration which allows you to take more away from each minute you spend with japanese the hour a day you spend meditating instead of spending more time with japanese will lead to faster improvements in the long term
  it isnt what does tabe ni taberu mean
meditation is like lifting weights    for your brain    lol seisyun is beautiful
  yes which is why after 10 years i would expect him to be better at it since he claims to be fluent in so many languages       im sure back in the day when he was living/working there he had a better handle on the language and just lost some of it  c2 is essentially nativelevel fluency by the way which i would not say he is yes he is fluent though
  just make one retard 4channel is anonymous
wait i figured out why matt is all about meditating    it was from his experience at japanese high school doing toilet 禊
  anon you are talking to somebody who refuses to quote people he doesnt aknowledge  and uses わ as topic particle instead of は
  not worth it to bump a month old thread with some mad shade even tho itd be funny
where did anyone in this entire thread use わ where は shoulda been
ごめん俺わつかった
  because they cant speak japanese
relax and read slowly before you let your fingers fly
  i quote people when i acknowledge their existence  the most primitive and powerful form of the you
  ボクノチンチンヲナメてチョーダイ
do your reps and dont fall for the meditation troll
but dont you want to become professional footballs player
if you dont become a certified tibetan monk prior to even thinking about attempting to meditate youll cripple your meditation ability permanently honto ni
how long have you been learning japanese and how much of this do you understand    then click the cc button for subs and tell me how much more japanese you understand    
ive now perfectly memorized every hiragana and katakana dakuten and combinations both sound and writing    and now you expect me to learn 2000 kanji characters    fuck my ass
i started yesterday and got nothing
  8 days  i am not even going to attempt reading anything outside tk until i am not fully done with it
poppin a bean like a senzu
  if hiragana and katakana were a problem for you i have bad news
  can i get a quick rundown on when to use わ and when to use は it seems so random and they practically mean the same sentences why is this language so fucking autistic    lets invent a third writing system just for foreign words and names lma000
  は is the topic particle usually but you read it wa  わ is used for the wa sound outside said particle
  it wasnt a problem at all    i just hit a roadblock because suddenly i need to learn another 2000 or 1200 autist glyphs to beat an elementary kid in japanese
  can you give an example
  sure thing here you go 
  わたしは  watashi wa
  learn vocab not kanji  youll pick up the kanji recognition anyway  if you for some reason need to handwrite kanji then do rtk
  nigga read tae kim  its free
  im not your personal tutor
learning to write is the absolute best way to remember kanji you dont want to be illiterate right /djt/
  i actually want to make progress in my lifetime
writing without adult supervision is just going to make you write like a retard instead of in japanese
  you will be fine if you stick strictly to the stroke order
  same goes for speaking japanese    writing is simple just mimic the picture and stroke order
my point exactly
  takes maybe a minute or two to learn readings meaning stroke order and practice writing a few times  rather review flash cards for hours on end unable to remember reading or the differences between kanji like 人 or 入  which one was a waste of time again
also guys just post the letter we done here
  he might be autistic enough for it to work though    i personally has to write every single sentence or kana down on paper just to have a chance of remembering any of it    but its very satisfying to write it aswell
  fucking zoomers this is what they listen to
  i write the loops on my あs backwards am i ngmi
zoomers ftw
  i personally has to write every single sentence or kana down on paper just to have a chance of remembering any of it    same look listen write repeat has been the best method for me
  ive loosely memorized the hiragana completely halfassed the katakana and have thus far about halfassed the kanji im slowly improving all of them its more fun that way
  if you know you do why dont you fix it
  left handed its much smother for me to make the loops from right to left and drag my pen instead of left to right and push my pen they just come out looking better if i do it backwards
   maybe a minute or two to learn readings meaning stroke order and practice writing a few times  unfortunately thats not how it works youd know if you werent an eop
  人 or 入  how can you mix those up  if you werent a dekinai youd have chosen   緑  線  or something but you havent gotten to those words yet have you lol
fuck mistaking kanji i still cant tell the difference between は and か
  my iq is too high to understand any of that
  no worries no one can
  stick to romaji and its no probs
  if i use romaji then i start mixing up ha and wa
  except thats exactly how i do it and have done it for a long time  put kanji into jisho  learn kun and on  look at example words  write it a few times  put it all together  on to the next one  takes 13 minutes per depending on how familiar i am with it already      just an example those are the simplest ones to visualize my claim to the widest audience
i still have a hard time with ツ and　シ side by side theyre easy but with different fonts it can be hard to tell at a quick glance same with ン and　ソ but they are often easier to tell apart and it ン the majority of time
  ほ は is much harder to tell apart than は か the latter look nothing alike
  シ smiley that looks up little lines are on top of eachother  ツ smiley that looks to the side little lines are next to eachother    thats how i remember it
  i always mistake さ and ち
  fast forwards 3 days  youve forgotten two thirds of what youve learned
    at least ジ has lil mouth wrinkles      さ き is kinda bad too
  i dont have a hard time with those that extra vertical line on ほ き sets them apart instantly for me its just kanas thats practically the same but mirrored     however i do mistake ほ ま for some reason i can tell the difference between vertical lines very easily but horizontal are a different story
  im still pretty new to memorizing this stuff so i always know the names of both but dont know which is which and have to sound it out in my head
  consistent reading  real usage of learned words  forgetting
  i got some rest im going to learn nihongo now
  just because it works doesnt mean it isnt a huge waste of time
i cant stand seafood will i be okay in japan
  im allergic to seafood and nuts will japan kill me
  as long as you stay away from the pussy
if your reasoning for not eating seafood is i dont like it or we never really had fish back home then you may as well starve
people mistaking hiragana and katakana characters   sasuga djt
fuck me ive been singing jamals stupid you dont know nihongo like i know nihongo song to myself all week
  theres no food you just never developed the palette for because you didnt eat it a lot ever     a lot of my familt has shellfish allergies so we never had it in the house then when i had the chance to try it i was worried i might be allergic since i had never tried it now im an adult and i dont like seafood     shocking i know    i know you can change your palette by eating stuff over and over but japans cuisine is extremely different from an italian family in na it might take a while 
what the fuck does かける mean help
what the fuck does かける mean help  please make it stop
  goes back to the original point   the method itself is also tried and true learning in different forms and making connections through usage is much more efficient and youll retain more information usable as knowledge as compared to something like flash cards which relies on repetition and memorization which is mainly meant to help in the short term nothing wrong with doing both but if you had to choose one its very clear which has more benefits also complaining about time consumed when learning a language is silly seeing as it takes an eternity anyways especially japanese for native english speakers
  lol this rules

good mix of ok and retarded
  which characters should i work on ill be a good bitch and write them fitty times in my notebook
  you not knowing japanese
  just write em all anyway    you need it
  i can read it    it doesnt look good but i can read it
  an ugly and wrong せ
いえこせねほ
  work on this
rate my scribbles instead
  when you sacrifice comprehension for the sake of it being pretty    i wish people would stop making their own original kanas
  remember that sa is sad because it has one less line
  go to some jap joints i went to one when i was a teen because a girl dragged me there i was there thinking i wouldnt like it but it was some of the best food ive tasted now im a regular and order something different every time
  you couldnt even bother flipping the picture
  the purpose of the graph paper is to fit the characters in the boxes you can use four squares as one if you need to
  first i had to figure out how to lower the quality now you want me to flip it
  its not made up kana just because it doesnt look like your computer font
  sorry ive only been at this for two years ill get better if i keep practicing bob ross told me so
  absolutely terrible really reminds me of my own writing
im so fucking tired of  wasting time i want to learn japanese before its too late  tell me where or how to start only know hiragana in a general way have trouble remembering in realtime some of them
write all the hiragana a buncha times and watch 10000 hours of eng subbed anime and stuff wont be so bad
  yeah its awful its a mix of writing characters from my head and being mildly succesful at it and writing new words/words i had never written before      pick up a vn or anything of your choice open jisho or any dictionary of your choice and dojg or any grammar ressource of your choice start reading and anytime theres something you dont know you look it up
can i write my own 手紙 now
  vn  visual novel never touched one  what i do is listen to music and follow seiyuus idols and stuff like that  although i was thinking of trying that one doki doki literature club the other day just for leisure reasons
  yes  your choices will be limited but you wont starve  it will help if youre ok with fish broth
  someone from here wrote this right reads awkwardly

今年大学を卒業して会社に入った社員の最初の給料は平均で１か月２０万６７００円でした  去年より６００円割合では０３上がって３年続けて今までで最も高くなりました    i was able to understand the general idea of these nhk babby sentences on the first read through without checking yomichan first time thats happened this shit feels good

  a letter from my friend
  
どこから突っ込んで欲しいんだ    so does this mean something like from where do you want to get started as in a is indirectly asking b if theres something he/she wants to explain
  japanese
first day of study in 2 months learned 30 words read for an hour and a half and did my 800 piled up review i forgot that this was fun kept procrastinating starting back up because i was dreading studying for some reason i might not make it
  did my 800 piled up review  oof how long did that take
i like this thread a bit more than the pretentious cocksuckers over at 
  this thread sucks ass compared to every thread on this site
i heard we were posting our handwriting
  as in are they
  i think your kawa is wrong
  like an hour and 15 minutes wasnt too bad i was liberal with the again button for the cards i remembered but took like 1520 seconds since pressing hard or good pushed them back 38 months
  only you have the context to know what 突っ込む means but im guessing you said/did a bunch of ボケ shit where do i even get started with the ツッコミ
  yeah not that guy but without context that sentence sounds dirty as fuck like what hole do you want me to ram or what angle do you want me to fuck you from
  script reading fag is still a fag
  youre right i wrote かば instead of かわ i dont even know how i did that
day 26
  its perfectly comprehensible if you know japanese
does it matter if i use あんまり instead of あまり its easier for me to say the former

wtf are you doing posting random reddit posts like that
because im not creative enough to come up with my own witty rebuttals so i bait /djt/ into doing my work for me  glad to see im not the only /r/learnjapanese shitter though
jlpts tomorrow i cant learn japanese guys  what do i do
learning japanese has perhaps been the most important thing that has happened to me i am 19 year old i began learning japanese around 7 months ago my first 4 months of my studies i dedicated around 6 hours a day to it since i had so much free time these past few months i have been dedicating atleast 3 hours a day because of school and my full time job the reason japanese has changed my life is because it taught me how important persistence is it helped me plan my life and actually prioritize whats important rather than laying down and wasting time doing nothing i learned self discipline by learning japanese and with that self discipline i forced my self to lose weight and goto the gym i am so happy that i have started learning this beautiful language and i am glad i came across this subreddit i will be taking my n3 exam in july thank you all for reading
wtf are you doing posting random reddit posts like that

  participating in group events is fun
like bukkake
  learning japanese has perhaps been the worst thing that has happened to me i am 29 year old i began learning japanese around 7 years ago my first 4 weeks of my studies i dedicated around 6 hours a day to it since i had so much free time these past few months i have been dedicating barely 30 minutes a day because i resent it the reason japanese has ruined my life is because ive spent so much time on something i am too introverted to make proper use of i learned i have limited self discipline and learning japanese used up much of that self discipline that i stopped caring about losing weight and going to the gym i should never have started learning this language nor started coming to 4channel i will be taking my n2 exam in july again thank you all for reading

whats a good android keyboard for japanese input
こいつはほんとにばかクソやろう
  you can post this but you cant post an innocent maru
using the kana keyboard is the only way to make the っ to select つ from the た section then click the button that says 小 thats really goddamn cumbersome ill stick to the romaji keyboard thank you very much
                who the fuck are you quoting
  using the kana keyboard is the only way to make the っ  being this new  type xtsu
  i really think you need some kind of photographic memory for that otherwise it will be a cancer marathon
still havent signed in to anki website to make that popup go away
  ehhh    im not sure id derive much benefit from this
  use the default keyboard its fine
  default keyboard has like 10 different arabic squiggles and 3 chinese options but no japanese
djt im a buyfag needing help with some translation will djt help me in my buyfaggotry
  so you regret studying for a few weeks of your life seven years ago do you also regret consuming media you enjoy have you been keeping your studies going just to pass the jlpt at this point you should either have fun reading or watching jp media or just cut your losses and take up a new more fulfilling hobby
  you obviously havent even enabled japanese in the android language settings
  i literally have my phone set to japanese and the default keyboard doesnt have a japanese option
  check under languages  input virtual keyboard i have only gboard there touch this and you have languages again you can then add keyboard there if you have english and japanese installed in gboard a globe icon shows up at the bottom left of the keyboard that lets you flip back and forth its pretty nice
  if you pay sure
  not all android phones have the same software i assume gboard is a google keyboard that came as default for your phone mine has samsung keyboard as the default and theres no japanese there
    there is still hope

he asked for understanding assistance not parenthesis that do not provide anything
now its ところ   who can stop this mad woman/tranny from intuitively explaining all the grammar
someone should make transcripts of all the curedolly videos and compile them into a grammar guide thats actually good
wouldnt work
  her videos are just a summary of gone fishin

  youre just jealous
  you are right  mokou x sumireko is superior
  dorkmireko deserves no love
  kids with tism deserve more love

who keep giving mokou cigarette
  shes buying them herself
  from who
  probably kourindou unless eientei or the human village sells them
  sumireko brings her cigarettes from outside the barrier
  mokou is flat
  so youre saying mokou forces sumi to bring her cigarettes in like a high school delinquent situation
  more like beating mokou on the touge
  sanae is an irresponsible driver
  probably because her stds got to her brain
  poor sanae

  sorry you cant handle the truth
  how the heck do i get mokouchan to visit me on my dreams
  why is she so small  i sense a pedo artist
  theres no way keine would do any sort of lewd acts with small mokou would she
  isnt mokou pretty short in the fightans
  cute not pedo
    im into nofap november no idea if it got any correlation can mokuuchan be huntin for my precious seed
  then explain this
  compared to everyone else no  that picture makes her look like a tenshitier womanlet
  get back to work and stop posting on /jp/ mokou
  its pretty much the most official ship there is
  mokou went to a sleepover at eientei but kaguya got mad when mokou beat her on street fighter by mashing all the buttons kaguya is a sore loser
  sumireko    mokou already moved on to fucking reisen shes trying to keep pace with marisa after all
  great art criminal breasts

tfw you will never be this comfy
     checked          what is it with those reaction images for the lack of a better word ive seen a lot of them but never found out what those are and/or why exactly they always feature mokou beside the fact that she is best 2hu obviously    what ive only recently gotten into touhou
imagine
  imagine what
  its chinese phrases and jokes illustrated with moko  
  its made by a chinese touhou fan who likes mokou and wanted to just make funny images of her with chinese sayings and jokes    
  this    keine is for self inserts only
weeeeed
  alright buddy explain this one
  thats clearly a lie if they were actually married they would be kissing or holding hands
  a joke that they were in on

  hold on something is strange this /sci/ thread is somehow giving off a very different feeling

  space is 99 space and 1 mass
white/red aesthetic  fire powers  phoenix symbolism  immortal recklessnes  morally neutral  tsundere in fanon only  tomboyish clothing    why is mokou so perfect  no seriously its like she was specifically designed to appeal to me
  wow i completely agree
  lesbians are hot
  mokou and kaguya and eirin and change are all gonna have to learn to get along since theyll all theyll have left a couple billion years from now    i keep thinking of keine for some reason
maid mokous is so cute please post more of it
  girly mokou is fucking disgusting and unacceptable
  those are population statistics for the us actually
  all mokous are fucking cute and acceptable except fat mokous
  even curry mokous
you died
  continue    no
  just tone it down a little bit
mokou is the worst touhou a bum and a murderer this piece of shit somehow thinks shes on the same league as a moon princess of extraordinary beauty    power over fire is literally cirnotier meanwhile kaguya has power over the eternal and the instantaneous this white haired bitch makes me sick the only black spot on eirins career is having left an unguarded dose of the hourai elixir so that now the universe is stuck with an immortal literal piece of shit until the end
  t neet
  kaguya should just fuck mokou already holding a grudge for a couple thousand years cant be healthy let alone for a couple billion more
  power over fire is literally cirnotier meanwhile kaguya has power over the eternal and the instantaneous  yet mokou can still stand up to her power over eternity with just fire which is entirely selftaught no less
  how did mokou teach herself how to handle fire did she somehow make it to the main continent travel to the middle east/india and learn from pyromancers or djinni the art of fire manipulation
  yes 
  doesnt she burst into flames every time she dies in in i thought that had something to do with the fact she took the elixir in a god damn volcano and with her subsequent acquiring of fire based powers
  kaguyas hair stinks
    fujiwarahime is cute
mokou and kaguya are very close friends
mokou is so fucking cute
  i want to cut mokou open and eat her liver
  fucking mokou is so cute
  would she permit it if the person asking her was really desperate
  probably not she wouldnt want to subjugate the person she loves to the torture that is inevitability
what the hell why is /jp/ going so fast
  there is a big event going on i am sure you heard of it
  i didnt  which event
  i think hes referring to an event where certain person decided to split the site in two so he could get more ad revenue
  just like americas racial composition
mokous perfect math class
  more like mokous perfect flat ass amirite
mokou dont like new technology
  whats wrong with keines eyes
  nothing senseis eyes are beautiful
  mokou respects buddhism
hourglass immortals
  reminder that mokou was a 10th century rural japanese girl so she is porbably 47 and not at all taller than anyone
  then why is she normal height in all of the fighting games shes appeared in  take your loli fanfiction back to the fairy threads
  fuck off
    those are some smug 2hus
  so ive been looking for the video of this for like 2 years now  any pointers greatly appreciated
  look in the tags for that picture its pretty easy to find
mokou can be a bit scary
  she cant be a necromorph she cant be
regenerative hymen
  as if mokou was a virgin when she took the elixir
  mokou was is and forever will be a virgin
  lies  mokou a slut
  rural  you might wanna go look up that family name of hers country bumpkins aint quite it
fujiwara buttcano
  slut
  theres nothing slutty about doing it with the person you love
if someone was drying of hunger far from civilization would mokou be willing to give some of her flash to save that person
  bunnies cant love
  hed just throw them off a cliff
  there is when you love at least three different girls
  mokou has enough love to share with everyone and its not just sx but real love
  how many girls has mokou loved
  shes a serial lover matched only by marisa herself
  how many shotas have been reported missing in the bamboo forest
  shotas arent girls
  shotafags pretend they are so they dont have to admit how gay shotacons are
  i fucking hate shota so much every time i look for doujins for mokou and i see those stupid fucking shota ones my blood fucking boils imagine being so much of a manchild that you self insert as a literal fucking child its actually astounding that a fetish even manages to approach the shittiness of mind control but shotacon manages
  this doujin is so fucking good
  link it weeb
  no
  link it please
  anon its not that hard to find
  doujin is hanging out more and more k nekoneko
  learning to cook with mokou
stealing her panties
  you cant just steal the panties of a girl
  yes you can you just gotta be very careful
  but its wrong
  as if mokou wears panties
  when a man want to steal panties he gonna steal panties no matter what morals be damn
  i dont think mokou would appreciate that
  the background here is really fuckin cool
  smol mokou
  you forgot her most important charm point  mokou
smelling mokou
bathing with mokou
  see 
  just replace galaxy with democrat voters and it somehow fits
  
so lewd
fishing with mokou
i notice that mokou thread always last longer than kaguya thread i found that funny
  eternal fishing
  me too
fluffy tails
  mokou is naturally more slutty while kaguya is refined so mokou attracts more people
  im so jealous of mokou getting to touch senseis body whenever she wants
  mokou can touch her as much as she wants to but dont get the wrong idea theyre not a couple or anything like that theyre just two close friends
does she actually take you back to the past
  yes  why must you ask such a question
  you bet your asss
why do nips have such a cult following for avgn i know things like it happen but it doesnt feel usual
  a foreigner getting pissed off and swearing all the time is novel to them
  to play the shitty games that suck ass
  i think niconico comments that fly across the screen are suited particularly well to avgn videos
do you think kaguya have bald spot like james
  why do westernersers have such a cult following for gccx   because it offers a view into another gaming culture lots of things are different but lots of things are the same your guide isnt the greatest player by any scale but their love for games is real and they know how to be entertaining in front of camera
  eirin is doing her job correctly
  they like waito piggu doing stupid shit
sukuna s secret castle more like sukunas shitty asshole looks like it could have been a good place but instead the inchlings were just fucking jerking off
this spellcard sucks monkey fuck
what were they thinking
its mononobe no fuckin futo
i love the miracle mallet its so bad and i mean bad this thing is bad why need a hammer to danmaku whats wrong with this grabs the regular purification rod huh i dont know i thought this was okay using it you know with a ofuda so if anything the miracle mallet its an interesting experiment in youkai technology but too bad they were just fuckin jerkin off like why does it suck so bad well i have one complaint one fuckin complaint about this mallet it doesnt work now whats the most important aspect about any tool well being able to fuckin use it
  hes relatable to nips because hes mousey bespectacled and unassuming    also his humor is based on how blunt he tries to be and nips think its funny when you dont talk in fucking riddles with subtexts under subtexts under subtexts

  pickle hina please leave the monster girl threads alone
i want hina to take away my misfortune that is my virginity
  you wont become a billionaire after losing it
  this fucking thread is getting me dizzy
there are so many taboos concerning this goddess that i dont even want to write about them    the countless taboos related to her are things like even if you see her pretend you didnt dont walk on the same road as her or dont bring her up in a conversation to violate any of these may cause disaster to strike if this happens the only thing you can do is cross your fingers and pray    because humans rarely come into contact with her her actual personality remains unclear however according to the unfortunate humans who have broken the taboos and made contact with her she seems cheerful and sociable    she is considered extremely dangerous even if you catch sight of her do not attempt to come into contact with her at all    disaster cannot be resisted injury disease bankruptcy divorce it can affect anything at all    however if you pull a fortune that has terrible luck on it it may become a good conversation starter
  i just want to fill her womb with steamy hot semen and she can do the abortion herself if she considers it a misfortune    or raise it like a loving mother
  that second option sounds great
hina has never been the same to me since i read that doujin about her on her period with the used tampon on the cover
  please give me a link to that i want my image of hinachan ruined forever
pregnant hina
  i also like that option very much
  that time again
hina spun out

  aina hashimoto from the recently disbanded ciao bella cinquetti/the possible
  recently
  holy fuck what a semen demon
  just look at it made my dick hard bro
  disbanded  every fucking time why are all good idols dying
  august this year is fairly recent in my books
    hopefully takechan will be like this in a few years
  youve shit books
  can you imagine how heavy and warm her dick is
  a fair number of mid/low level groups have broken up or lost a lot of members in the past couple years    instability is normal for smaller groups but ive read some saying that were nearing the end of the supposed idol sengoku jidai
    
  cute
  smaller groups have usually more consistent lineups actually you just posted a link showing how the akimoto groups are the ones losing and eventually gaining the most girls and how most of the groups disbanding had been going on for close to a decade also 3b junior units barely count as groups
  they arent all that hard to find on youtube though to be honest i dont think it would take much effort to be better then the average 48 girl       
  posting singing lessons  now post a video of how good maria actually does in concerts
  so you do not believe that the current era of idol is coming upon its autumn years then
  current era of idol  what exactly do you mean what is the current past or future era in this context
  the supposed idol sengoku jidai
  teaching girls that have been idols for years basic shit  this company never fails to amaze me how the fuck did moe at that point still not know how to count the rhythm
  the supposed idol sengoku jidai is a fucking meme tower records came up to promote idols under their label idol groups are still being created left and right even hp just came up with new ones dude
  okay dude is there anything else youd like to share
  yes next time simply ask instead of acting like a smartass newfag
  ask what
  to know what your favourite matome says
  why are all good idols dying
  yes
  glad we can agree things sure were different back in the day before the idol sengoku jidai
  you had 12 years to find them

dudes has sayumin email for fans or something like that she answers on letters i want to write her about my feelings and tell about us and our thread
  1  she doesnt speak spanish  2 you dont speak japanese  3 erotic spanish fan fiction is automatically filtered out and she would never see it
  no but fc members are allowed to pay to send her actual letters for special occasions
looking at 5ch girlschannel and twitter reactions i see ppl being annoyed with ise reira being in angerme and people saying theyre losing interest in themi hope this isnt an s/m 2ki situation
  they arent nearly ugly enough for a 2nd gen repeat
   1 she doesnt speak spanish  im not spanish bro   she would never see it  im not pervert and i want sayumin know about my attitude towards her     to pay  what price
  butthurt kirarafags are shitting on everything again
the reaction to reira is giving me serious aika flashbacks comments on news sites about the new members have casuals and nonfans saying mean things about her and the wota are mad about ufa letting doi rena who both mm and angerme fans wanted go and picking reira to debut instead even though both events could be unrelated well heres hoping reira is tough because its not going well so far
  the wota all wanted my favourite instead  sure thing buddy

dudes i very often thinking about relationships beetween girls in mm theyre large female team what do you think idols often quarrel among themselves i dont know why but i guess that makino and reina are conflicts
more miki itt
  this probably wont do you much good because you cant get out of the favela but when i was at the hp shop in july they had a book that you could write a message in for sayumis birthday
  everyone is jealous of morito so they bully her
  nobody is really close to mizuki so she hangs out with who shes working at the moment erina might hang out with her in her freetime  erina is a total bitch to girls her age so shes only close to mizuki and ayumi those who can live with it / give her the same shes nice to youngsters though because she also struggled a lot when she just joined after they found their place in the group she lets go of them though  haruna is usually nice but some girls just think shes boring she was probably the closest to haruka in the group   ayumi can be pretty tough and competitive so shes really pissy with those that arent giving it their all probably thought so about sakura when she was still new and thought she could live off her good singing   most people try not to become too close to masaki because shes exhausting she can be a lot of fun but when shes in her depressive mood shes unbearable see haruka who pretty much cut all ties with her   sakura is like mizuki shes close to those shes currently working with   miki is the weirdo and everybody knows it theres a reason why shes constantly in the us nobody wants to hang out with her   maria can be very exhausting just like masaki but she has no ups and downs just sugarly sweet and crybaby not hyper vs depressed like masaki she doesnt have many close friends but shes not completely isolated  akane is the socializer she reaches out to those that are a bit lonely miki maria chisaki and has friends all over hp  kaede is in a pretty fucked up situation and she acts it she is pretty shy but you can see shes pissed off to be a junior to 12th gen and a lot of other hp girls despite being a senior kenshuusei good thing reina wasnt in the kss for too long they seem to get along  reina has no problems with anyone i guess there are people who dont care for her but shes decently popular with the girls  yeah chisaki is the problemchild shes super shy her best friend is still ozeki shes gotten pretty close to masaki and akane but the relationship with masaki might bite her in the ass wouldnt be surprised to see her go once that friendship turns sour also i bet she gets bullied simply because shes been promoted to semiace in mm for nothing
where do i start  get to know the current girls first bro    if you like airy mannered girl with body that is soft plumpy and has big bobs mm own leader and sexiest gravure idol  fukumura mizuki    you like a cool athletic girl who can play golf  ikuta erina    if youre more into alternative looking fashionable girl then you should follow  ikubo haruna    how about a dorky cute and small jumping bean who got sharp dance move bro  ishida ayumi    eccentric weird and impulsive girl with a hint of bratty spoiled little sister feel you got it  sato masaki    maybe you like your idol more chocolate or should i say milk chocolate hehehe she has a very good voice by idol standard too  oda sakura    ponytail check girly and cutesy attitude check baseball girl check gravures double check just prepare your lube and socks you feel me  makino maria    japanese girl with american southern charm wut i know right buckle your seat belt and have a rootin tootin good time with our own sweet home alabamaraised cajun idol  nonaka miki    are you more into the girl with pale white skin shes a snow princess who can actually dance on the ice  ogata haruna    mild mannered little sister who you absolutely want to hug because  1 shes cute 2 she has a soft marshmallow body  haga akane    youre more into stern looking girl huh full of determination since she was just a trainee  kaga kaede    okay hold on calm down get close to me listen japanese loli damn uhoh very cute fun and youthful look man im not judging you or anything but if youre into the loli thing  yokoyama reina      i know i know you just want to follow a girl with classical archetype of japanese idol pretty girly giggly and cutesy very comfy you could never go wrong with her  dorito chisaki

  guys on here are going to jack off when they see mos mouth
now explain the dynamics and personalities of cute
  okai has a complex about her chest so i think it was perhaps maimai who first suggested they all take off their clothes    they were probably first talking about swimsuits when someone said they admired maimis long legs then the conversation took a turn towards everyone being amazed by how big okais breasts are followed with maimai starting to insist okai show them to everyone okai probably didnt want any part of it but since everyone kept pestering her about it she said fine but only if you all go first surprisingly maimi was probably all for it smugly saying sure no problem but remember you have to take off your clothes then too chissaa    nakajima asked something along the lines of okay so wholl take their clothes off first and okai said naturally itll have to be maichan since shes the one who started this whole thing    maimai  despite resisting at first  grinned turned around and said dont look as she took off her clothes with her back turned towards the members    oh god this is so embarrassing dont look someone hurry up and take off your clothes too    maimis whole face was steaming as she said okay maichan did it so ill go next quickly took off her clothes and standing dauntingly in front of everyone while stark naked asked whos next    nakajima made a lousy excuse about how shed have to strip next since everyones so bored of seeing airi naked already she turned to face away from everyone and started taking off her clothes seeing nakajimas flawless proportions maimai involuntarily muttered wow your bodys so beautiful nacky    nakajima while hiding her private areas with both her hands said okay i did it so hurry up your turn airi airi started joking around by humming a song as she took off her clothes when she was finished she did an overly unnatural nnnooo dont look gesture in an attempt to hide her body     once everyone had finished taking off their clothes maimi said okay chissaa were all done now its your turn    okai sulkily said alright alright already fine she hesitantly took off her clothes all the while muttering complaints under her breath immediately upon seeing okais breasts maimai once again reacted involuntarily    wow chisato youre huge those are seriously huge    and thats pretty much how it played in my head its all nothing but my wild ideas obviously
this is the first time ive seen wota angry and not happy about the members chosen since sakura won the audition s whatever as long as it doesnt affect angermes sales i dont care what they think
      buy my unsourced narrative
ruru is slaying in her performances and visuals and i am so happy for her i supported her back when she was just a trainee with a good voice but not pretty enough and its just so great to hear that okaistyle visual appeal and vocals didnt just disappear from hp after we were spoiled with having chisa around for so long

dudes what kind of music do you usually listen in daily life im asking about genre
  speed garage uk garage
  i love listen to various kind of music desu from seth macfarlane to flying lotus bill evans to fkj im a semiprofessional arrangercomposer in fact
    im asking because my irl familiars dont understand how i can like jpop or some other pop music and it became interesting to me what kind of music listeninh dudes itt  by the way i dont listening only pop music
  try and learn some proper english will you most people dont give a shit about music beyond it being just a building block for their identity and a means of bonding with other people if youre not the trendsetter or man of discernment of your social group youre practically asking to be shamed if you express nonconformist tastes
  my heart is on rock  metal focus on 80s but everything goes
   try and learn some proper english   i do my best   youre practically asking to be shamed if you express nonconformist tastes  like here when i write in bad english i understood youre right    and whyre following for hp cuties its absolutely not your genre
  this is isnt a forum to talk about yourself discuss idols or go away
  idol music is great in that there are many genres mixed in there was also the fan remix scene where you got some guys doing rock remixes about a decade ago  all in all i have a soft spot for anything upbeat/genki to the point of being cheesy so its not such a different world this idol one
  nobody cares
  we need to fap in mos mouth
   youve been visited by post police  nice joke bro i mostly talking about hp cuties     the fan remix scene where you got some guys doing rock remixes  wow i didnt know that i heard only dubstep remixes or something like that   all in all i have a soft spot for anything upbeat/genki to the point of being cheesy  the same im sure most of fans like idols for this reason
it can be exhausting being so cute all the time
  mostly  so you see the problem its not that hard to stay on topic
  sad barf
   its not that hard to stay on topic  bro do you feel lonely want to talk about it
  idols  fuck off  you can only choose one anon

  why are we supposed to hate murota
  because she has a shovel face
eyes
  i disagree with your assessment
  mojito in a dance show  in the cold  good idea manager san i had a good laugh
a hp with a lot of money and a credible acting career
  seriously shes actually surprisingly really good at acting
  i wonder whats the equivalent of mano in the west in terms of acting career
  i was always under the impression she was like a dlister but her engagement was all over the news this summer even during all of that flooding they were having
    nah man shes like soon to be a list    i think shes a main role in this movie
anyways her acting from what i watched in bleach was soooo good im gonna watch some of her other stuff shes still not gakky though not yet
momo with short hair is like her idol self where we can see what shes up to momo with long hair looks like she grew up became an angel and flown away where we can never see her again momo was one of the first hp idols i seen when i was 11 i miss her so much and i wish we can at least see her in a classroom with her students
  dat manopiano at 028
  i wish we can at least see her in a classroom with her students  she was already paranoid about her private life in her idol days so i have a big doubt about that
  i wonder how it looks like without the bikini
    airi is prettier
  too bad she talks like a retard
how was this
  iiukubo is center  oda has to carry the entire performance    ive never really understood this song
    shes actually not rich and works at a konbini for 8 dollars an hour  source
  theyre all like this without filters sorry to break it to ya
  no shes just particularly horrendously ugly  literally a bull dog face
  she was extremely photogenic some years ago but theres a reason no ones going after her to be an actress
  good to see she seems to be doing ok

how do we stop okada
  why contain it
  losers are the best
  give her a boat
  why stop her okadas the best
  yuuri
stu wotas are going hard for this event spending so much money on gifts perhaps this will be much more difficult than i thought saw some guy drop over 400 on the first stream for some literal who and he wasnt the only one i guess this is actually kind of important for them
berin cunny
  getting  ftfy
  i dont even think its gonna be lewd gravure tho they are just desperate to get anything for their girls because they are getting nothing from management
  i wish they could donate directly to the idol instead of a middle man getting a cut selling 100 dollar emojis
    imagine her cunt sludge
  cute
  happy birthday idiot
i saw a girl who looked like jurina wearing one of those masks she looked like a vampire
  lucky
  pretty much i unironically like jurina
  who asked who to take a pic
  god that nose is big
    rare yonkis
  me why
it aint easy
how famous is sayanee in japan  does random person on the street know of her
    spanish showroom
  i fucking love you rinrin
  why are none of the comments in spanish
  mexicans only know instagram
  stop her  the world doesnt need something so horrible to happen
i had a joke about macharins face and it wasnt chinky face it was actually clever but i forget what it was
  its friday night all spics are out partying
  shes an expert
  completely offtopic i know but is this guy rich yet
  i didnt know he was still at it
  yes miru
  did he not have enough for the full tom cruise package
    the whores group always delivers
    dat last one
    she may be kind of cute but that singing tho
  nice
  you see that suit sometimes you just gotta fake it til you make it
is 65 the cutest ske auditioning
  i wanna see yamada juna doing this on arai yuki
  safety shorts should be illegal
  thought this was hori in the thumbnail
  i think theres a few cuties but not enough body shots to confirm yet
  the face is the most important part tho
  then ske is doomed
  would need a ladder
  just push marina properly and they will be safe also they need to stop focusing on jurina so damn much its time to start thinking ahead
  jurinas never leaving ske so whats there to think about
general manager seems like a shit job why would someone accept it
  jurinas got a good 9 more years in her
  i think theyre stuck im sure they want jurina to keep winning ssk but if ske dont give her attention maybe wotas get mad
  gm  madam
  why is she so sickly pale now
  put your faith in keyholdersan
  the whiter the better
  last time i was in japan the trains all had ads with her
    now this is a proper good girl whos this barefoot goddess
  shouldve been manami tbs
  nojima kano
  cute
  what the heck is that haircut though
  if theres a merciful god in this cruel world please hear my prayers  give us an av collab between shiina and naachan
  mental health issues
  cho kawaii
  its acknowledging that youre extremely competent so i can see how itd be an honor the only ones who go atound saying that they actually want it though are fatheaded social climbing attention whores and mion so its probably safe to say that its not most girls dream
   yokoyui can even act normal 
  what time does the singing competition come on and on what channel wasnt it on tbs
  19
poor hama  you can tell she was sad
  whose the white one on the left
playing pocket monsters with hanachan
  shes one of the most famous nowadays but its not as big as the heydey or sasshi
  lol
  white  must be ego
  ultimate idols
  who is that
    jesus she is perfect but nobody give a f 
there must be so many faggots in my local area i hate having to post without a wifi connection it keeps saying im banned for posts i didnt do in boards ive never gone to getting real sick of this shit
singing competition 2nd day preliminaries  1800 to 2300    order akb48 team ak  akb48 kks  ske48  akb48team b4  akb48 team 8
  nice info 
  source 
  they recognize her and they like her
  living around trump tower in nyc
  in alaska people up here obviously dont have shit to do
  perfection
  can you see russia from where you are
  kawaii
  skes new owners
  stop using free vpns faggot
  did ur house shake
  i use h20 wireless and this happens to me
  yeah it was pretty crazy
ive just watched the music station performance  waaay too crowded  that last row was completely unnecesary
  goddess kurenyan
  you tell me
  her body is perfect
  sasuga interestellar beauty
  she didnt have a single fan during that entire thing management shouldve picked one that wanted her just to be fair
  management  fair
  lovely
  i wish the aftershocks would stop im still on edge
  she doesnt have fans
  those 4 hours of commuting and management being to cheap to fly her to tokyo are the only things keeping her from becoming a perma senbatsu
  shes my favourite
  it will be over in a few days
  flying is often cheaper than the rail journey so its not management being cheap fukui doesnt have an airport and its likely her home is far enough away from the nearest airport that rail is the easiest way to get to tokyo
  that distance is seriously too short for a flight
  the cost to the earth and climate is far greater with air travel
  isnt she moving to tokyo next year hopefully she will stay in the group at least until her 20s
  aks doesnt give a shit about the environment or else theyd sell hs tickets with digital downloads instead of shipping fans dozens of copies of the same cd that they throw away without even opening
  im her fan
  killing a person with a knife isnt okay just because he has aids anyway
  that has nothing to do with aks total disregard for anything that isnt profitable for them
who is the best izone
  i never said they care
  its those damn rvers
  i live out in north pole so it wasnt so bad woke me up tho my whole house was swaying back and forth
  is she trying to tell us she likes to put black dicks in her mouth
  cho making clothes lewder than intended again
  unf

  camera flash not enough fps
  her face is maturing
alo salut sunt eu un haiduc
  i love this picture  i just wish it was in higher quality  the brown ones ass is a thing of perfection
  or 60
  or 33
  literally big one girl
    a beautiful alien creature
  thanks for reminding me to check on secureteam
  kano is so hot
when are the peak viewer hours for sr
the singing contest has started
  you forgot the stage fighter special performance starting right now
  oops it starts at 1830
  like 9pm to 12 midnight in japan i think
  i wonder if orin can do it
based korean training
erii
so this is the results of korean training lol
erii isnt even trying
lmao erii is a joke
was there not a rap option
eeriiwhy some people pick songs that clearly dont suit them
  yena
lmao
  careers
  this erii should be doing gravure instead
mion not picking cielito lindo
is mion wearing the same red shirt as the girl yesterday except she has a undershirt to block cleavage
based gm salvaging the team
  yeah mion was alright
  mion is light years behind yuihan
based mommy showing these losers how its done
  i dont think i can wait to watch her
so this is the power of the mutou sisters
ok orin cant doit
fucking hell
so eriis chara is parurus one
chiba has been tainted itll never be the same
tomus head is huge like 18 times the size it should be
lmao kami 7
only yuihan really a danger for taking the top spot
japans most sophisticated show    akb is truly a trainwreck they should be ashamed after this and lower stages tickets prices
i feel like satomina is really trying to push the korean training
  rina and maho i hope they do well
produce48 was a mistake
  illegal av
damnit already missed rina
  probably for the best  it wasnt great
  aww but still
i liked that produce 48 that looked a bit like a huge miru
im pinning all my hopes on moeka in this block  kks were a mistake
can you rewatch the stream after its done
why would someone purposely devaluate its own product
  only good gen 16th girls got promoted
an opportunity to promote yourself on this scale close to a senbatsu wasnt a thing in the past the girls were unprepared because of this there wasnt a chance like this unless they frequent karaoke or had previous vocal training im just glad management created this to give non popular girls a chance to promote themselves i anticipate the girls will practice more since this might be a yearly thing from now on    btw fuck padchan has a stable voice who would have thought
nice one
oh so moeka isnt just a girl with big boobs
moeka wasnt half bad
absolute ace
  psh implying id like someone just because they can sing decently
did noone else watch the nemousu training camp episodes  moeka is a good singer
her boobs are big but she looks fat i dont want another mion
  its just an excuse to promote the girls ofcourse the girls would want to do atleast a half decent performance so pardon the lack of practice they havent done this mass audition thing in the past
  that would be a great excuse if they didnt sing for a job
  she has stubby legs it makes her look shorter than she is
homma mai
come on i want to see at least one crying
sasuga the ace we deserve
so yuiri gave up on this girl huh
  i was surprised to learn that they dont provide any vocal training at all all the good ones must go and seek it out themselves i guess
oh poor girl
jesus christ
she even didnt remember the na na nanana
imagine if you learnt they got two takes at the performance and this was her best one
at least now erii wasnt the worst one
  these are idols not musical artists
  but the main promoting activity they do is singing and dancing they should do some training in that regard
here comes the challenger to hkt dominance
the one girl from love on right now is a qt i spend too much time on showroom now
  their main promoting activity is variety and handshaking    singing and dancing is a sideline
ssk should be replaced with a contests like this one
kano  aiai
wonder why tani isnt participating shes a decent singer  looking at the amount of ske participants its probably because the organization didnt want to pay for train tickets isnt it
  not all members appear in tv shows all members perform at the theatre
  i should have subbed to her mobame for lewds but its probably too late now
  sorry i didnt mean variety i meant showroom
  that would be too embarassing
   its probably because the organization didnt want to pay for train tickets isnt it  i was just wondering why at least all 8th gen and d3 wouldnt want to do it just for the exposure but i bet that is the reason
  imagine a senbatsu full of busu oh wait
  fans will vote for the winner
korean training
  sasshi cant sing
  id say 1 month around release date is still a safe bet so go for it
  dont worry aks will probably do a beauty contest next aka bikini show following the three traits the exemplify idols namely singing/dancing cute/sexy appeal and people charisma
rara is cute
  now that would be a good idea
  people charisma  thats just another way of saying cute/sexy
  aks will probably do a beauty contest next aka bikini show  25 only
at least she isnt screaming like that time
did you guys forget moekas mushi no ballad solo we knew that shes a good singer
  yuihan wins then
  i only watched the silent webms for them thighs
gamer girl can sing after all
one of the hosts looks like noepi
  yeah ill probably still do it shes so cute that its worth it even if she doesnt post lewds
  is there a stream up for the contest right now
i miss saito yuri
  no were all just guessing whats happening
all this contest was just a facade to broadcast as many times as possible this jurina advertisement
  based
  that one ru site that always forget the url of
  check op links
    soon
  whats that song right at the end of the commercial
i hate this contest none of my girls are good singers so why should i care tell me that one management
money on yuihan being top
what is iwata hinas problem does she not want a chance at winning
  so dont watch it problem solved
  orin must have cried the rest of the day after forgetting the lyrics to secret base like the most unprepared dumbass
good job pads
4 yuihan
kanotamu
11 miion  wtf
akb is done
are we done already
  train tickets  they recorded in like three different parts of the country maybe they wouldnt have had to travel much the lack of skes smells like a new management thing like they knew aks would let them get through
  the real contest has only just begun
  nice fuckin ears
  my girl cant sing either but its fun watching other girls sing well or badly
eitos perform last they will dominate this
  oops
  satopii choosing arigatou  why do they do this to themselves
  you just need a piano and a camera i dont understand why traveling at all
oh coconas friend having a crack at it i hope satones friend is watching her
  shes watching from heaven
  wait till you hear yokochan sing flavor of life
  her head is really small actually the rest of her is just even smaller
kubo deaftone
  indeed angels live in heaven
  u15 only
  please refrain from flaming my girl when its her time   thanks
  i knew she was still pure
  she is not pure she has tasted dick in every hole
juri is trying too hard
  she has the look of someone whos thinking im fucking nailing this
simply awful
  good for kano she really deserves more recognition
  talking about big heads
  i need to pay more attention to this moeka girl
  8sato minami  this contest is an absolute joke
  her head is just big because it has to contain that ego
watching these girls embarrassing themselves and knowing that she will do even worse
weird i remember chiyori is better than this maybe its the song choice
  they were intimidated by her korean training
wtf
now to see how japanese vocal training compares
seichan is weird looking
well this is aesthetic the singing too kinda
i should apologize seichan
  do they even have vocal training
  seichans been having lots of ボイトレ
  only four good girls  what a waste of time
crushed skullchan
  ボーイフレンド
why their voices sound so frail
  which four
  shes just frail in general
  theres actually slightly more than four but the ratio is still quite bad
but will yokoyui dance like that blonde bitch from pd48
  why would we want to know what he thinks
  wwhy does one of them have a recorder
finally the real event
  team8 the tryhard team its like they are always compensating for something
time for the winner
future champion singing right now
  yes yes no no no no  yes yes yes yes yes  yes yes no no no no  yes yes yes yes yes  yes yes no no no no
she should have stayed home
    where is usachan from she cant be from japan with that english
  24  50  24  50  24  anon
                                 
  she should have stayed home
  hongkong
tfw kiichan solo single
  iamokwiththis
  naachan was stunning just then holy shit
kawagoe saaya playing guitar  
  lmao not even best yokoyama yui not even first yokoyama yui center all that goripush for nothing
  shion seems quite gf material
does she know what shes saying
macharins stupid accent
its ok macharin you get extra points for being cute
im fukkii and im finging
spending your life at theater and still not being good enough how sad
why didnt yuiri participate
  because she runs away from everything
its a good thing zukkii can dance
juri are you serious this is ridiculous
juri was shit
  she didnt pass the cut
team shit next  back to sleep it is
  something about 苦ってないように i didnt understand the rest
team best next  time to wake the fuck up
why even bother with the rest naachan is the clear winner
  i still want to hear miu regardless of who wins
piss girl
tomu wont win because judge is not a fan of hers
about 20 literal whos next
is yokoyui on a bar stage
those boots  yokochan pls im already spent
so lewd
lmfao those expressions
shows off while dancing  shows off while singing  if only shed show off in a bikini too
  i just want to see discord damage control regardless who wins this
whyd anyone choose to sing flavor of life this is too hard
  you can leave now wlerin
  too hard  yes
  im not him but i do just so happen to live in the same timezone as him
  that wasnt me though still 6 good girls to go
oh nonononoono
lol at you people even watching this
time to mute until berin
nanamin is like me when i try to sound like a girl
  we just enjoy discord meltdown
  why are you even here
  you sound pretty cute anon
  i know
this is not good
should have stuck to track
  tennis
  shitposting and triggering
  i still find funny to know that there are people who like 48g though i think is ironically
  or that whatever    jock things
aacchan
  im watching while listening to my boy thundercat in the background
  tomu wont win because just like juri she sang from the most obscure and weird place of her throat and her voice was so forced to sound different to her usual that any sane person would notice shed crumble singing anywhere above that tone
  because if you nail it you get 1
  yup that sounds like tomus singing will still probably replay her part a few dozen times
yokochan went crazy on the padding
  akip hates her
  she sucks
my ears
  no i meant she tried to hard and in the long run she fucked up
meanwhile berin was pretty good not so much this legal loli
  its management fault
is it just me or team 8 has a lot of tonedeafs
  it is their fault for not giving most of them proper vocal training thats true
  she sucks
aho should stop singing
a little too breathy but not unpleasant to listen to
  legal loli  20 years old  i feel less bad for the thoughts i just had
  shes too good to win
yuiyui
fish
  even without formal vocal training theres plenty you can do by yourself its hardly a decent excuse if youve been doing this for long
akip fixed her throat
top technology they said
as expected of the 20000 year idol
its not as bad as i expected
  that one clip was after like 20 songs  dancing its still not fantastic though
  i watched the whole concert
  you poor thing
  im so sorry
yuiyui again
wtf
  this ones an upgraded version
i didnt expect hattsu to be good
  look at me im stupid
is she schizophrenic
  id rather not youre pretty ugly too
as expected of someone with the name utada
what was the point of the recorder
hattsu could be singing the main themes of studio ghiblis movies
  its like a safety blanket
  either for good luck or she used it to get a reference tone into her ear before the performance
enka is shit
ok strip now
oh its that ugly eito
they keep singing ikimonogakari like they were robots
    they excite me
  this one is uglier but at least she can sing
  tfw no rikati wife
its like an handshake event 1s
  i know this feel _
  shes next to a piano
    fuck off jo
why do we need other teams
  honyonyo
  someone has to clean the toilets
  to begin with for visuals
  thats a robustlooking nose
  imagine being this guy
ecco now strip
  visual appeal  we dont use the term visuals  for japs kpop immigrant
  yes we do tribalist retard also ive never set foot in that cesspool
team 8 is the filler arc
  we need more than just onishi and miu
  lets debut
  visuals alone is a kpop thing you just started seeing it in 48 communities since pd48
  maybe because 48g doesnt have many visuals ive seen it plenty on the sakamichi side
i dont approve of hama trying to look like an adult
kek at onishis hoodie making a pun in spanish with love bitch
  it was used plenty in this thread long before the kpop crap started youre just only noticing it now because it triggers you
wtf
  yes its not a korean appropriated thing at all i stan 48  we are army
  visuals    figuratively kill yourself please
they sound like me and thats bad
  using figuratively when literally is both shorter and more impactful  ah another misguided prescriptivist
  listen to yourself as you sing youll improve real quick
95 of the eitos were better than juri
  ill still oshi you
tomu keeping the kids of tokyo safe
where are their dance practice videos
  i love rikarin
  not a single good girl
our girl
why is it that the newest girls are better than the ones whove been in for ages does 48g actively make you worse
  yuiri is the goodest girl
  listen she used to be an idol
  woah so manami and naanya still fucks on the regular neat
  they get together like once a month you didnt know
oh yes
  ywn make frogs eyes cross in ecstasy
5 years
yabai
  hey idk how relationships work dont ask me
  just make her win ssk
  so ahegao
  the future is flat
brace for jurina ad
omg
  more like inoue blatant push ruka ad
  never have i ever hit the mute button so fast in my life
matsui jurina the movie
  and tall 168cm/14 years old 
      megu the best 
  drama movie for sure
  certainly fiction
  its someone else fault if they are bad  can i use this excuse for my oshis or is only for your manfaces
yuiyui made it    shocking noone
fish got 14
just post the rankings
  she is za future after all
  i girl i dont like made itrigged
whats the point in the same posts here and on discord
  existential horror
yokochan
yokoyui  yuihan
  manfaces  not sure where you got the idea i liked jurina or annin
2nd day is such an advantage
okada nana  oda erina  rissen airi  the rest
  r18
totally no bias or anything
  id be ok with either naachan or odaeri winning the whole thing
  melting down already
sasuga naachan
  based naachan
1okada nana   who  would  have  thought
  most of our girls did well
  just merely posting facts
hattsu was better than okada
  presumably anyone who sat through the last several hours
  cant wait for finals
  not by a long shot  hattsu was only decent
i remember when the okadaclique spam was ironic shitposting this general has fallen so far
so what are the final rankings of the prelims from all groups
  you only thought it was ironic
  imagine being this mad because a girl you dont like is a good singer
  why do we even allow these people to vote
  melting down this early  wait till she wins
summary of day 1 you actually didnt had to watch it   i am such a fool
itll be funny if the cunt ranks above okada
  thats my naachan
  either of them would be good although i think i liked akis singing the most from hkt
  erotan did better anyway
  muff  shaved after all
  so did a bunch who ranked lower
  he thinks those corny posts about loving princess naachan tenderly and looking after her are ironic
  the only thing that bugs me is takeda tomoka so high
  ironic  is that what you told yourself so you could sleep at night
  whoa meant for   im going back to bed
  i hope you dont wake up
  the only thing that bugs is that fish ranked at all  which of the judges did she blow
  ill be sure and post a cute naachan pic just for you when i do
  stay salty itll go well with my victory fries
  sweet dreams
shit i forgot noepii made it yesterday
  does it matter she wont make it anyway
  rigged for goripush  who would have guessed
  i watched only to justify my disgust for her even further but she actually did pretty decent considering the overall level of the contestants
poor akashi the only thing left for her is trashy gravure
  okama did better on akip bed anyway
  yeah she was actually pretty average no idea why they ranked her that high
mommy yuihan is out  at least churi is still in
was tomoka really that good
its yamasaki amiru you idiot
ears
sasuga our naachan queen reign of akb talents
eretan 4th
  yamazaki
290  291  292  kek
definitely not rigged just like that test thing that mion won
  山崎 亜美瑠やまさき あみる2001年7月21日
i wont say its rigged but if she were a who it wouldnt be so easy for her to rank first
  やまざき
okada nana can sing dance and rank high in ssk truly our perfect idol
  yes it would be she was just the best
there is still hope after all
  
what are they announcing now
i dont know the kanji after 推
  staff
   崎
  i dont know i closed the stream after making sure our girl won
salty anons saying its rigged  she was on the verge of not being number 1  judges saying it wouldnt be hard for current 2nd or 3rd to win if they get better than her  they cannot make it that easy you know she could not win since according to the producer the point of this contest is to find a good singer other than her
  kun さき さい みさき
  judges recommendations
  so these girls still have a chance
  the cunt ranked 1st on first day and shes a who
  in other words managements choices
  why did they call that gook trainer for this
  1 nmb   lmao
please enjoy this shimizu  
  didnt even pick one ngt  the absolute state
  three actually 
ive never seen an idol with a more pessimistic attitude than okada rina
  out of a bunch of whos that they dont give a damn about not to mention that shes been pushed as a singer for a while
  hello newfriend
  management hates nmb and favors akb and hkt nothing new
0 ngt  lmao
produce48 sure introduced a lot of people to this general
  it was rigged guys  hahhahahahahahahah   okada antis seething
  rika is her role model what the hell did you expect
why is ngt so bad
  sso hattsus in
  rika didnt participate
  they all use padding
im very happy for her
  noepii was the highest ranked ngt
  male rissen airi
  yup  the finals with be singing live with live music
  well the cuter nose made it to the finals
why did he keep mentioning their quirks
i have a hard time believing okama score cunt za true center
  not for oda erina they wont
  fuck off rei
  is there an eito concert or something that day thats a really crappy situation
  didnt mean to quote
7k
  i didnt mean that i didnt like it
  will they prerecord her part
  now this is a real talent
    im glad mirurun slept her way to the finals
time for some female idol content sorry discord
  is the final a public vote because its probably for the best that ngt didnt get anyone in
  implying discord doesnt like miru
  they wouldnt be able to use their thousands of fan club accounts to vote anyway
  it is my life goal to date all the shiroma sisters
i should have had more faith
traditional is better
  let the poor deluded sod have his memes
  wakacute
nana in jean shorts  can i get an unf
  nice goo hara cosplay
  unf
  they need to be way tighter to reach unf level
imagine thinking this kind of contest is relevant without sayanee yikes      the only talent that matters
seeing people spend 1000 on towers is really something else
  unf    more like enuf    lol
  no tight enough
  judges recommendations  none of them picks okama  they should be more subtle with things like this if they want to make it legit yep miru za true center
idol can not be allowed to get along with a man  2005    idol is a virgin and it is natural    safe if boyfriend before joining  2010    even if you have a boyfriend after joining safe if you break up already    even if you have a boyfriend doing idol activities properly is safe  2015    because you are not pregnant safe  2020
  not short or ripped enough
  onishitters will defend this
  before joining  safe
  we need a photoshoot with an unobstructed view of her in these shorts asap
  what ass
  now this is unf
  who is 2015 referring to
  contest announced literally the day after she graduated  why do you think they did that
  2015 is a year it is currently 2018
  only ugly fucks like onishit are safe because no one cares anyway good bodies like phatomina should remain pure
  perfect knee waki
aikawa honoka as vito corleone
  nothing to see her goyim
  idol can not be allowed to get along with a man
  thanks
tfw no dkye contest
suzu things
  look at that smile   she really is /ourgirl/
nmbigot mad again
  naachan would have destroy sayakek and you know it
  i love this noass so much
  is she taking a picture or is she livestreaming her own stage
  the sad thing is that tumblrs actually think this
  just a coincidence
  neither her or the sane faction of her fans believe that
      q they also said that your singing skill is better than sayanee what do you think about that    naachan there is no way i can catch up with her 
  the latest
  graduates are irrelevant she will disappear soon like all the other graduates did before her
  time waits for no one
  dont trigger the sayacuck
  graduates are irrelevant  yeah just like kawaei rina oh wait
  who
  still cant believe maho got 19 fuckin assholes
  the sole exception
  i like idols i dont like nonidols
  literally who
bigots cant even damage control
  still the best 48g singer except for akip
yo
  mion finally got arrested at the border
  did you pick up this shit from some 5ch copypasta and thought it fit to post a bad translation of it here
le only good for gravure meme guitar gurl
  the samefag uploading the same pic in every thread
  she should be deported straight to my bed
  hahahaha post so accurate it hit a vpn nerve good job anon
    our girl is so humble and honest

  accurate/10
  momoka loves her daddy
  imagine the smell
  yukos back from her international travels now too
  hahaha  the fag fag went silent xd  must be busy reporting and changing his ip adress to report again xd
  okada fans getting triggered by the success of another girl they like  why would that ever happen
  it happens in his mind just let it be
  his mind is a very bizarre and disturbing place
  just like okada nanas stage forum
  based
  where did she rank in the singing contest
  i want to hear yuiris kaeru impression
el sayano sensores ajkajjakakakajaja
  fuck off anita
  she graduated because she knew naachan is better
  kek
  go to other girls theyre way worse the problem is not the idol but the regular posters in that cesspool forum which are the same faggots who shitpost here because they dont have papa cris or sccrrrllaa coming in with a baseball bat warning them about breaking their legs if they disturb their own narrative
  theyre way worse  i dont know how one post every 3 months is worse
  this
team s      team kii      team e  
  hayasakas thread has/had a 1 to 5 fan/anti ratio yuihans main poster is an idiot and theres that eito fan who only shitposts or dumps all fucking pics and links almost every day in the most     retarded     of formats
  how about you ask them      
  with two solo albums i can only wish our girl can have that one day if its what she really wants
faglerin fuming again  lol
can you feel the hybrid rainbow    
  okay anon i get it now all posters over the net are retarded the idols have nothing to do with their fanbase   thank you for your enlightenment but that wont change the fact that okadafags are nuts
  are you lewdy
  sasuga nobunaga
  i take offense to this
  of course its only non okadafags the enlightened beings on earth who are also not nuts have a good night fellow connoisseur of idol fanbases
  im glad you understand
  them  one guy
  not the stepdad
play it once sam   
q what did you talk with naachan during yuuhi wo miteiruka at stage fighter performance today     ayanan its a secret
  it was about yuiri refusing to put out
  too fat insta closed
comment naachan ranked 1st in singing competition     yumirin well thats of course for me nana san is no1 in the world at everything shes the best singer in the world shes the best dancer in the world and shes the cutest in the world
  easy fuckboy
double cutes
  she probably posts here
  wow how can one person be so wrong shes cuter than okada is
youre weird
  her ass was weird
  what a cutie
  good slut
  imagine rubbing oil on her
  rip
  i dont have to
  are you telling me that momotarou was the son of god jesus christ
  damn wakapon is cute
  i love shion
suzu is the worst
  i love her horis
any of these girls resemble squirtle
okada spam ignored again    based akbg
  mine mina 2012
  dropping some wakabombs on that peach
  yunana
  kawaii
  miichan postscandal
post photos that go along with this
  she just smells like a sweet peach
making penis sound by riding hchan
im beginning to think that you hate so much everyone from this thread and stage because you wanted to be like them but youre completely ignored
  this he loves names so much because he wants his to be known
  truly a delicatessen
  without being disrespectful to mommy god what a tongue bath id give this woman as shes soaking wet from sweat id take special care of her waki and groin stubble
  trying to make sense of the average twitter stan
  best thread
  he tries so hard because this is all he has in life poor soul
probably the last time with best center      
  i dream of smelling yan every night
  damn this really got him projecting like crazy    10/10 post
  not only that but hes also a wimp a terrible excuse of a man when you dont like something about someone you tell that person straight away but what he does is to go to an anonymous board to release his frustrations on people that have nothing to do with it and didnt ask him a thing people that just want to talk and shitpost about idols hes a rat man it up the irony of all this is that he complains that others do certain things when hes many times worse than them  there are times of the day when this thread is just offtopic about thread and stage personalities for hours how can you criticize anyone when this is your life we didnt split from sakamichi for this
  they were better on utacon and best artist
  not to mention that hes stupid as fuck
  at best we can expect him to asume his faults and off himself from idols or his own life
  yeah he is melting down now best timeline ever
tomiyoshi
its time for you to go to a mental asylum wlerin
  daddy is gone and he is not coming home ever again
  thread ignores him so often that he went mad now poor fag 
  tfw he turns up the vibrator
  this
  probably just an error on his npc code
  where can i download that
  god hkt is fat
  really the best group
  yet still not as deliciously fat as nmbs
  i want to rub her tummy then sniff it while its still warm
  are you still living in 2014
  good because nmbs arent delicious at all
  id gladly go down on shion
  their bloated faces because of makeup make them seem thiccer than they are and the memory of fat ruririn lives vividly in my mind and harddrive
  ruririn  my bad i wont reply to you anymore
  spit on me
  hot af
i wish i had some
  that is a new one for my collection
    she looks like eto misa and that jav actress
  who dont   
  wrong thread
  stop posting
  shut up gaijin
      dont cry lool
when is kaotan graduating
  right is actually more eroi
  saepii looks better with her clothes on
based cult
  oh youre finally awake
  she pulled a miyamae so whenever she feels like it
lmao
  she stole a bike
  warning yokoyui
  she seems to have anger issues
  she is full of testosterone
  no she graduated almost without showing the goods
  miyamaes gravure was worth the long wait
  worse than a virus
  i bet there are active idols who have inserted their ssk trophy in their ass
  tani has just for fun
  imagine oda meeting maiha  long time no see
  going down on saepii
  in other words her body is uninteresting
worldaidsday
  just for fun  are there other reasons to do it
  to test how far she can launch it
  imagine teasing out a mahjong tile shes hidden up her cooch with your tongue
      glass_jar_breaks_into_guys_assmpeg
  they should start making biologically compatible trophies with the right shape and material
  the better the rank the bigger the trophy of course
  wakapon is the good d3 after all
  nice wakabounce
  her voice isnt bad how high did she rank on that singing competition
  did they fire her for this
  cute
  no they gave her a solo stage for it  
  good management knows whats important
  thats literally the same idiot falseflagging like he usually does
  and yuiri is cuter than them both put together but let her have her delusions
  at least they didnt cut the stream
  
  nattsu is completely ng and they had to do something about that stream  its ok when wakapon does it though
  i can see the bermuda point
  well wakapon is wearing a bra must be that
if some kind soul can upload this morning odaeris song i would be eternally grateful i dont want to download 17gb for just our tomboy

mayuyu
  good grief onishi
  truly such a beautiful girl      her performance was good enough for me  seeing the others she wasnt even one of the bad ones  i have hopes for this girl
  onishis eyes are dead and berin looks terrified
    i love girls that like pokemon      starting to like this girl as much as she likes eevee
  which song which concert
  she will always be part of me
  which song  hmmmm
  are we in the 90s again
  you sure are old man
  i want to to show her my pokeballs

  im glad she gets the pink song
  how else would you get that porygon
  i want to go to a pool in japan

  jabaja
  the sound is what made this one so good
  rinrin fucking perfect
did rara sing in english did ears prove anon wrong
  onishis midriff is so fucking hot
  shame about everything above it her dad was right
  all that delicious meat
stinky idol feet
  new gen eito clapping  sasuga japan senpaikouhai system
  i thought she was 14  boy was i fooled
    well who is it
  shed be such a great mom
you guys got over mikana fast
  shinzawa nao
  amimaru just had to strip
  you guys  you sure are naive
  20  what the hell
  its been a while since she appeared on a show or in a magazine
  i dont have to post about her daily im not that guy
  this there was too much of her being reposted
  everything about her was being reposted
whats her favorite metallica song
  refuse/resist
  thats what im saying
  3rd anniversary  song fiy
  weve jumped to the next train which is the sasaki train
  and her legs and her upper body and her face
haasa is the good d3 now
  sexing fuuko
  why do you like cardboard so much
  its an innovative chara
    the things id do to nao
  her last sns post was in september  is she at that harrupi farm too
  nao is a sex goddess
  shes at the marriage farm
  lets see how far can she push it
  shes a great girl but too busu to make it
  i hope she found her own shawn carter
  oneechan is not very cute
  not the brapp farm
  thats a awful picture
she is clearly on the spectrum
  she spent a year in california thats probably why
  she should watch her face
fat sakae butts
  thats prostitution
  hes gonna give her  that cock
  if i live in mexico and see a cute asian i do the same
  sabor para llevar  kek
  thats what im talking about son
  she hasnt had sx yet rright
  haha yeah definitely not
  she only watches netflix
  why should i care she  was tainted by a saw
  in 5 hours
  but when will they cancel this rubbish and bring yattandei tuesday back
  were the previous ones being streamed on youtube as well
  if anything i miss the miscellaneous segment of yattandei
  i dont know i found it while searching 明石奈津子 on yt
kanakp
kanakp
useless virgin hag
kaiakr
  certified prime kanakp
  impossible theres no way for a woman that old to be a virgin
    go be rude somewhere else
  eirin is about a trillion years old and hasnt had sex yet
  kayaker
the kanakp
  kanakp declare
kanakp pushes you to the ground and says worship me little man     wat do
    kanako would never push around anyone she is a merciful god
marisa probably smells pretty bad     in the omaketxt file that comes with the games it says that she wears black clothing because its harder to notice dirt and other stuff in the fabric    therefore she probably reeks of shit just thought you should know
awesome i dont wear white for the same reason
she spends all day digging poison mushrooms out of the ground
  cant really blame her its fun
  she is a crackhead afterall
marisa probably smells of dirt and mushrooms and forest  alice smells like gunpowder because of the whole explosive dolls thing  patchouli smells like patchouli
of course shit reeks of shit
  patchouli smells like piss and old furniture
2hus probably dont bathe  they probably smell like medieval woman
  id probably say more of the old furniture and less of the pissssss
guess who smells of rotten fruits and fish
  anon
  aloce she also smells of manure and loneliness
  dont forget the poisonous stuff she uses for spells
  alice
do they have toilet paper in gensokyo
who do you reckon is the nicest smelling touhou /jp/ its gotta be minoriko right
  probably tenshi or reimu cant reimus orb make whatever nice scent she wants
  you already know the answer to that
imagine drinking marisas bathwater after she washes off the grime from a day of scavenging haha just think about it
  is that dare i say eggs i smell
i think the most pleasant smelling touhou is probably remilia and maybe flan they have access to bathing and exquisite perfumes    sanae and reimu smells the worst because of the prostitution and the only bath they get is when the customer wants to do a golden shower
  they have baby wipes
  ahaha thats so funny anon
  lol vampires cant bathe
  that didnt stop the french its why they made parfume in fact
  flowing water nigga calm water is unhurtful for vampires
the smelliest touhou is yoshika because shes a corpse who eats anything seiga made sure she wont decompose but that just preserves how nasty she was originally
     yukari     she probably loots a lot of perfume whenever she visits normie world
  this is so wrong the whole sdm probably smells like rotting flesh dust old furniture and piss
  marisa broth      geriatric smell
        patchouli smells like patchouli not mint i love perfume and can tell you that patchouli is very distinctive it smells strong and dirty though a bit like body odour or urine but flowery at the same time a lot of perfume fans hate patchouli and complain if theres a lot in it every patchy fan should smell patch perfume oil eventually so they know how dirty and sexy she smells   quote 
  i wonder what it smells like inside marisas hat haha
  like greasy marisa hair probably
  perfume does not smell nice it fucking reeks of concentrated chemicals and extract shit
  marisa is noted to enjoy taking baths    the thing is she does get dirty often because she gathers materials often shes also unironically very girlish so it makes sense that shed rather hide stains and dirt while still looking cute
  patchy is also a character we know who bathes its noted her books are waterproof for that explicit purpose
  its not chireiden dude
  alice
  imagine her smell
meiling has to smell really strongly of sweat since shes guarding the gate and doing martial arts all day
  that makes me want to fuck her even more
  why are meiling fans such horndogs
  its not nice to generalize
marisachan smells great
  meiling slept in late and didnt have time to take a shower before starting work
  a tragic tale which we can all relate to
so what nationality was her mother    with her hair colour and style id go english or french
  japanese/gensokyo or makai residency    with her hair colour and style id go english or french  nada
  tenshi any high class youkai marisa for sure alice the scarlet sisters sakuya    not including vfis fairies probably dont bathe theyre fairies they play prank people and sleep and do nothing more
  alice smells like gunpowder  cute
hey its my wifea birthday say happy birthday to her
okinas birthday is today
  it is now
how do you know its her birthday
  shes my wife so naturally we celebrate it every year together
  then why are she and satono at my place right now
okina have two threads  
okina lost her balance
  arara i didnt know it was your birthday too kinachan
  yukari is a halfbaked has been sags okina is the new hotness all hail okina the new supreme sage of gensokyo
  soulless
  lifts skirt
praise be to the birthday girl happy belated birthday
give up okina will never be lady yukarisama i dont even need to prove yukaris greatness to okinacucks they know okina is inferior to yukari but wont accept it yukaribros dont need to worry because they know yukarins naturally perfect and has nothing to envy from okina
  yukari herself gloats about daikokutens power while getting fucked by lunarians
  go to sleep yukarin we all know its you and thats the only thing youre good for nowadays let an actual sage of gensokyo handle things from now on
  what does a rifter have to do with my mother
  never stop this rivalry
duuude
okina have three threads    
  four you forgot her new daughter marisa announcement that she got a new mom
      good she deserves all the threads since shes that amazing and good and not bad
keener
  okinig
      more like oking the king of gensokyo
  gensoking
hello
  hi
    hasnt even defeated a knowledge god    sage of the short bus
  hey anon who are you quoting
  the inner voice of the person posting these unbacked praises
  tewi says that okinas medicine is better than eirins
  where
  in ssib but tewi is also heavily biased here so who knows
okina is for sucking clawk talons
    large thonk  okina wasnt around in ssib
  do you know who daikokuten is
wtf its not junkos birthday yet
  thats because it was 13 days ago silly
  okinas own servants have more fanart than her in fact the only th16 characters with less art than her are narumi and eternity
  fan art  popularity    if only there was a list or poll that showed overall popularity of certain characters from the touhou series maybe then wed know who is popular and who isnt _ツ_/
  okina is very popular and gets more threads on /jp/ than any hu
  okina definitely gets more art than nemuno as well not to mention that a good chunk of dancer art also has okina in them as well
what do you think zuns plan with okina was is he trying to softreboot the series and replace yukaris big brother like character with someone new is he trying to move onto a new arc like the religion arc or do you think hes gonna forget about okina in the next game and just keep making new characters    i mean judging from her presence and general fuckery of the vd incident which seemed more like doremys thing whos to say okina wont keep showing up more and more later
  shes a sage yukari appears frequently and kasen has her own manga shes basically a main character forever now shes pretty much guaranteed to be in the next fighter too
  what are you basing this on the only th16 character with more art than her on pixiv is aunn and etarnity isnt even at the bottom she has as many pictures as satono nemuno has the least art of that games cast
  /jp/japan
  okina gets plenty of fanworks in japan
  i wonder what shes gonna do next i have a theory that she had a hand in the aocf incident since yukari actually got off her ass and dealt with the sisters herself and she didnt even do that for the recent lunarian incident
  shes pretty much guaranteed to be in the next fighter too  if they dont change the engine again she practically know half of the cast  i want to see her interactions with kokoro or miko or to see if she mentions the white rabbit of inaba against reisen
  she smells godly
  post proofs
keener
  
  i really really like this watercolor
okina has 20 threads
  this is a really bad attempt at a falseflag please exit the thread
lady okina is beautiful
matara

okisama
buoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
yua å shit
  you had one job anon but ill still take it
based and buoooooooooooooooooopilled
  previous thread  
is there an archive of that kizuna connect poll somewhere  i missed it
  i was going to make a sana op but this is the next best thing thanks based buooooooooposter
every single post in this thread so far is awful
  does that include yours
  excellent thread blessed by kirbuooooooooooooohime herself
  literally who  why didnt you put one of the new 4 kings on the op
  based high effort 3d chuuba op
arent all the chuubas technically 2d since they exclusively upload 2d videos of themselves
  im glad traplover and buoooooo are friends
  i was thinking of making a sana op earlier but came across op pic and went for that instead
man what a shit thread  cant we start over or something
  all of them except kite moscow and a handful of other vrchatters since theyve used 360 degrees videos and streams before
  two years too late
shes rich or something
is saikido anon here  i missed the tv live did they upload it on bilibili
i would say op invited the shitposters with this one but i guess they would have shitposted in one direction or the other no matter who it was it was guaranteed to be either based 3d/higheffort or disgusing 2d/loweffort/literally who with 150k subs
someone should put buooooooooooooo on a kanikamapudding
  she is married
  what makes you think so
  maybe if you keep memeing this it will become real
  360 degrees videos are not 3d though i was referring to that redblue anaglyph thingie
look its even better when they cry in 3d you know it i know it  
  any proof you may need is a google search away anon go for it
  i have actually seen one of those types of videos before some sub500 chuuba months ago
i approve of this op
  alright i got like 5 seconds into that and couldnt anymore they really are all graduating arent they
please dont use our goddess to shitpost
  dear god no
  they will make a big announcement in their next stream  probably graduation
  holy shit so thats what that other anon meant by 
  we will all graduate someday
    kannas group is going to join azulim was this cyberagents plan since the beginning hire cute girls just to mercilessly crush them later
  hire cute girls just to mercilessly crush them later  but bullying girls is so much fun
  the previous thread autism was getting out of control so we needed an equal amount of autism to defuse the situation
  mozzarella buooooooo  
  they arent cyberagent
  ask you you shall receive
  sounds like you just want an excuse to shitpost
  im kinda lost then i thought azulim and kannas group shared company
  married life plus having a gaijin who showers her with money
  now that i look at it i fucked up making it transparent but whatever it took me 2 minutes
  probably  but hey it worked
very blessed thread
  i wanna eat that pancake shes stepping on
            woooow such high effort epic memes sasuga 3d low effort 2d cant even compare
dont think ive seen a thread as good as this since before the miracle
  oh wait they are nevermind
  not cute  not funny  shit voice  shit model  elementary school tier jokes  seriously who the fuck likes her
  please do not sully the name of nobuhime with your low effort shitposting
and look that as well those 3 girls can play piano guitar and video games learned to sing with coaches have different costumes for every situation get english subtitles and support for livestreams  this is the kind of high effort production we 3d lovers make people realize that its fucking totally worthless because vtubers is about personalities and how theyre having fun with total freedom of their activities take that 2d shitters
  dont shitpost using my lord thank you
ai cant sing so its not like you need to be good to be successful
kao dekai warota
its heartbreaking yet strangely arousing to see girls cry i know its bad but my penis disagrees and you know what they say about the undefeated d
  yyeah
  posts future cumdumpsters
  inb4 she gets the aya hiranod
  you know what they say about the undefeated d  what do they say about it
  whats the relationship between tama and that pianotuber
  noriomama knows a lot of people
  you cant win against it
  the crotch line is too low that almost looks like a diaper  on a serious note i hope they get recruited by someone else once they graduate and dont end up like azulim
  haruto
  3404 dollars over 75 years does not make you rich
  thats kind of low if anything
  gifts bundles and sales over 7 and a half years doesnt make this account expensive as  said thats actually kind of low im pretty sure mine would spit out a number twice that easily and most of my library is games from bundles or gifts
  chotto
  chotto
  gif  what the fuck do you think we are cavemen
  my account is 12 years old and its currently this theres such a difference between low and high that its kind of useless
  learned to sing with coaches  thats exactly where their management fucked up beyond repair
whats the deal with himehina do ads really boost your subs that much why isnt everyone doing it
  because you actually need good content for the ads to work in that way
  their fans are well adjusted individuals with proper jobs and high end paying salaries way above the rest of the plebs in this fad i know some faggot will take this seriously so i will make it clear its a joke
  do ads really boost your subs that much  yes just look at kanna no one does it because the payoff is shit you pay copious amounts to get ads which just increase your subs but not your views
  hinatas case may be a trainwreck but even entum did better job at her than how they treated kanna
cyberagent owns cyberz who own cyberv openrec and run ultragames channel on abema with cyberv site being dead winter rage without vtubers azulim and hoshizoragakuen graduating i assume theyre pulling out of vtuber business
  pretty much this if you dont have a fanbase youre not going to get the views thats why only 2 kings were in the top 10
  sorry i never bothered with making weebums
  it wasnt making them a profit and their handling of chuubas was shit this is almost strictly a good thing i say almost because the girls involved are not having a fun time if any of them want to get back into the scene they can though
  muh events though
  yeah fair point not as good of a thing since less events for bigger chuubas to go to well someone will fill the hole one way or another
  i already knew you were a falseflagger but thanks for confirming
rks
  falseflagger  its become a meaningless buzzword everyone you disagree with is a falseflagger now
  its an unfair comparison hinatas va has a cutesy voice and can sing to some degree meanwhile kanna is a fucking disaster when she tries to sing i feel bad for her
didnt see this coming must be because of kaemito
  run ultragames channel on abema  they own the whole abema
    shes a natural
  sauce
  my flamer f1 cat dragon
  deron 024  pure
  speaking of her  
  cyberagent owns 55 of abematv shares cyberz is a subsidiary of ca
was pino the only one to stream artifact
  i think so and i hope it stays that way with pino being the only one to play that shitty game
  there was this dude before  
  there was some others but dota is not as popular as league over there far as i know card games arent either
  how is it
  everyone else is probably too poor to play
  card games arent either  kuso gachage can be called a derivative of card games i guessalso hearthstone seems prettty popular there too
mitochan
hmm
  shiro 011  woah shes pretty pure for a psychotic killer
    only the most ero artists can push through siros propensity for death and reach an out of character lewdness
  more streams like this please
25 is live  
fbk the box spider and roboko was a very cute collab roboko plays off of her better than id expect
  gacha kusoges are the digital grandson of gashapon machines
is there an archive of ais event
do you guys think mea is already over the intense trolling and bullying of the last few days
himehina hastag was trending on twitter people are suspicious about them not making it into top 70 i didnt think much of it at first but what if upd8 legit took them out of the poll
  you mean her tv special no not yet that i know
  yeah they probably tried to buy their way into the rankings and were disqualified
  im sure shes burying it deep inside until she hits another breaking point
  dunno not getting the same end result here
  all shitposting aside they are popular enough to easily make it into top 10 even without asking their fans to vote for them like other tubers
i do find it odd that a top 10 channel didnt make a top 70 fan vote but i cant imagine it was foul play there could have been a mistake or it could somehow be that they just legit didnt get enough votes it would be nice if they released the full set of results doing what they can to be sensitive to those who didnt get many like setting a cutoff point and listing everyone who falls under it in alphabetical order just something to show that they were there but of course they have literally zero incentive to do that or reason to unless shit hits the fan over this and they need to run damage control
  i wish siro raped me with that look on her face
my guess is that a chinese group tried to cheat and rig the poll and got caught and most votes for himehina werent counted because of this  always doubt the chinese
what about gamebu didnt they rank rather low for how crazy popular they are looking at their average daily views
  hh probably ranked higher than ai so they removed both of them from the ranking
  2ch anons are shitposting about aichan being jelly of their video viewcount
  maybe going from single to multiple chuubas per channel disqualifies you in the poll
  actually plausible
  its probably not ai but upd8 suits imagine if hh were actually in top 5 upd8 wouldnt want to give them more free publicity     japs are complaining about gamebu akari and hinata ranking so low and hh not ranking at all
  shitposters are the same no matter where you go
still arguing about results from an obviously biased voting system  wew
  serve them right for watching vtuber play pokemon lets go to the polls too much
clearly best of cute doesnt like shitters who buy their popularity its not that hard to understand
  how was the poll even conducted
  you okay there anon
  moooooooooooooods
  is ais pyoko an erotic zone
  its her brain
  name 3 vtubers you support give reason enter
  dont worry anon i appreciated the joke
  i posted it back then you picked 3 vtubers the reason you recommend them and that was it it was simple
  why is that hanc brown
sending the antiai force  
who did you vote by the way i voted for mito kaede and shiro didnt vore for rin because i thought she would do well anyway i regret my decision
  looks like ai will have to remove some cats from upd8 now
  that cat just wants to prpr aichan can you blame it
  cat goes straight for the pyoko
ohebidesu  
hebi has 27 views  i thought you guys loved her
  more interracial garbage is it a meme with japs or are her fans actual cucks
  she looks like shes about to throw up
  she is looking at you can you blame her
    24 watching  how did this happen
  yes
  its a very very tanned nip if you look at the source
  i voted siro mito and kaiji
  this artist is clearly a pyokopyoko connoisseur
  i dont know the artists comment mentions something about licking her shoe
hibiki ao didnt even make it to the listhow do we make her more popular
  shes dead isnt she
  please dont lick ais dogshit encrusted shoes
coffee maid overslept today so i missed her stream but here it is anyways  
  delet
  hiatus is a virtual suicide
  pretty much she is way too far from the 1m views goal for her mv  probably will end up as the first javtuber
  23 videos  mating press  verified amateurs
  ruri is cute
  it really is people dont mention it much over here but a big weakness of streaming as a main platform is that if you ever stop or slow down youll quickly get left behind
  end up  she debuted as javtuber  
how does eilene have 1 million yen to give away
  thats like 10 dollars
  you can cancel before the billing
  she got it from the video sponsor the candy crush dev which is a subsidiary of activision / blizzard    will eilene have to start shilling diablo immortal
  many real life streamers have said they have to choose between burningout or risk losing viewership if they take a break
man eilene must make a shit ton of money are other vy channels even trying
  kizuna played candy crush once too i let you imagine the money
  having connections to the yakuza really helps
  can eilenes yakuza connections bring yuuchubas back from the dead
walnut
3d eilene has unironically become a top 5 vtuber
  thats one cute criminal
  in my headcanon enep and tenkaip had sex irl
god dammit i didnt get to see camomis stream anything interesting happen the thumbnail showed she was going to talk about her ranking in the voting      yeah it was a full hour late almost on the dot very cute that she spent the first five minutes of it apologizing
what did eilene mean to yomemi by this
  enes art has really improved
  cute mom
the starving artist girl is uploading vids once again    
  am i interrupting something
  those pyokos are far too large
  if nijisanji were to disappear tomorrow you would go after everyone else talking about things you dont like just to piss them off  nah its just you projecting nijisanji is not going anywhere and theres nobody like them
  its not her money candy crush gave her the money as a stunt
  yes you are pray your death is either long or swift depending on your preference
  iwara  virtual soapland
  perfect for mating press
  high intellect
    why do you think shes been eating grass all this time
aqua starting over in minecraft      i havent had a chance to properly watch her stream yesterday can anyone explain what happened
anons fat wife
  god i wish that were me
  a combined 180 iq  ray has 120
my fat wife is live  
   cleaire making the most pious roast beef
  cooking streams are always comfy no matter how tame or fucked up the result is
  stop the idolshit go back to frequent uploads and quirky videos
ken has been on for a while  
my imouto is live teaching us how to edit audio     
god im sitting through ruris watermelon asmr right now and i dont know that anything will ever be the same after this
  will eilene have to start shilling diablo immortal  you can bet moemis life support on that
  thats not ruri
  it was her birthday so she decided to start anew
debunked hh was not participating in the kizunas show  
  they asked to be excluded from the poll
akunetty undertale  
    so activ8 sent their hired goons to make them quit and dont put kizuna to shame
    but why
  you are too large
  nah they just want to avoid petty wars just see how anal mitofans become after seeing she wasnt  1
  just see how anal mitofans become after seeing she wasnt 1  i missed that what happened
  thats what she said
  cant say ive seen any of that
  nothing hes making shit up
      just see last thread 2dhater this 2dhater that
31  
  
before the show few people gave a shit about the votes now that the results are out people suddenly care about it
  announcing shes pregnant with my baby
  2dhater and mitofans are its not my fault mito is so contentious for them
  everyone is working hard so everyone is number one    truly a princess
  just skimmed over the previous thread  2dhater is a special individual but mitofags always taking his bait are something else
  17000 people is not a few
  perfect for mating press
    
  meant for    i want to mating press hime so bad
  there is one guy who keep trying to bring up viewers to shit on ai who is a bit annoying but hes easy to ignore since he always uses the same terms  its usually him and that 2dhater that keep extending arguments into a shitheap
mea needs to be raped
  i meant not a lot about the vote was mentioned in these threads before the show
  mea needs to be loved tenderly
  her best general and personal bodyguard hina protects her from mating presses
  mea needs to be loved protected and monetized
   best general and personal bodyguard hina    so thats why hina wears a military outfit     himehina actually have a lore
  their lore is almost as deep as their sex appeal
buichuppa  
  i will mating press hina first and then ill mating press hime
why does beilene have videos spread over like 4 channels
  relying on her general too much could cause a revolt hina will storm himes gates and make her the hinas concubine
  hina is princess tanakas personal bodyguard
  beilene is a chaotic entity
  i need to be raped by mea
  should watch this before she deletes it like she does with most of her tweets
  patrician
  god i havent seen this in forever
  true  back when azulim threads were popular they used to shitpost about her feet her smell wanting to drink her piss and her diabetes
  i wont fault you for this perfectly good idea but i still think mea is the kind of person you pair up with to tagteam other chuubas
  based and tekokipilled
  its like a dog spraying piss to mark their territory
4 bunny   
the history of tenkai tsukasa  
  they are both already my concubines
  she does a lot of videos that have jav tier filming style in them
very unsexy sisters
is this meaning what i think it means people sperging about the results of the ranking  
what about nobuhime how come she didnt make it into the rankings
why aoi retweeted this  
  the legend
  she didnt want to take first place so easily
  she made moe say such dirty things
  kurumi
  ha ha i would never have lewd thoughts about them ha ha
  but eilene didnt make moe say  anata no kao ni shoubensuru made atashi no waremechan wo nametekudasai
  looks like she replied to all of the ranking chuubas
  oh nevermind just a handful of them so far
    thats cute  seeing her reply to ago is so surreal tho hes a big boy now

  i still dont understand why nekomasu did what he did its not like youre forced to make videos that much but selling your channel to some random guy is just i hope at the very least it worked for his own personal needs i guess
 seedsgyaru
guys you gotta come watch derons stream shes showing off her 3d model and the tracking is very good and precise its very lifelike
 gongon    i missed grabbing a screenshot but she also has one more joint in her finger then she should unless im seeing things
the fingers need more work though
  they need to do something about fingers
  her face is really expressive ago said he can also use 3d like deron but he will not use it right now for some reason
  i see
seriously this eye tracking is so god tier youre absolutely missing out if youre not watching yet
the new luna hand claws right here
  didnt some other 3d vtuber have this almost exact same problem with their fingers before  i remember seeing this exact same problem some where before
  to be fair most 3d models have problems with fingers bending backwards due to tracking even ai from what i remember its something weird to do with how motion is captured and translated to a model or something
    ah  thats where i saw it lunas hand    and yeah the eye tracking is really good
  yeah its super good nijisan really picked up the slack huh
  i remember gongons fingers looked pretty awkward
results are in     kizuna btfo     sana rules supreme
  just saw something im sure you all saw it too mocap stuttered and froze a bit for her main body when she moved her hands a lot
finally info about the live  cute art
more results
    youre late by almost an entire 24 hours we had our fill of shitposting about it already go read the last thread instead some guy was freaking out pretty bad was fun seeing the entire thread  bully him
deron throwing a right hook  im in lovethe boundary between 2d and 3d blurs more everydaybut this is an unrequited love since i know her heart and body belongs to mito

when an english speaking virtual youtuber gets r18g content on pixiv
  i wonder if people type shit like this with a straight face
whats the point of such a poll other than causing drama
  would you rather moe get it or someone like rhythm
in case you missed the announcement of the hall
lmao      well im mostly shitposting
the name of the band is something    whenever people idolfag always assume its a shitpost until they keep doing it like that aoiposter
    my daughters new biohazard video
live mapledancer im so fucking excited i love that song
  oh im quite happy its moe she has a better model than the rest that and i can picture her reactions thanks to her free speak making it more realistic
  who are you quoting
  i inly saw her stream once but shes wasting her time being a vtuber she speaks four languages fluently there must be a better job for her out there
  someone needs to draw me licking her cunny until she pisses on my face
  youre not allowed to post that meme anymore because the crossboarders said so anon
  a bit disappointing there wasnt anyone with that brassy instrument trumpet but doesnt sound like it heres hoping theres an actual member to play it
    why does klab sound team sound familiar my mind is bringing up touhou for some reason
  yeah that part bothered me a bit too but im mostly just excited to see the song live first and foremost
  wish my japanese was better for this nekomasu talking a lot of history himself and others
  luna btfo
  kwaves lab not sure if theres a relation
  i believe theyre also audio engineers for hire on top of being a band but not entirely sure
  i assume this is whatever setup shell use for her concert not the nijisanji app did she say anything about it at the start
why is she so smug
  the nijisan app only tracks the upper body definitely doesnt capture legs probably the same setup as the reality streams
ok which one of you did this
  this is the nijisanji app supposedly its their niji3d project
  
  its app
  turked
  i think it was a sound decision he would slowly slip into irrelevancy by just maintaining channel right now he seems to have a cozy position in this scene
    thats it thank you
  what can be better than being vtuber
  pink hair high heelsking    akihito  
  whats he even been up to since
  considering how little she streams she definitely has a proper job we just never see it
and website link for the event hope itll be streamed or recorded in some way excited to see kaede up on a big stage
  itll be streamed but you have to pay to watch it
    who are you talking about moe or rhythm i think rhythm only knows 3 languages
  few programs here and there mainly vr chat  also that sw vr promo with va
  how the hell he got to be with horo irl and ivr ill never understand im mad jelly but proud of him for making it but man am i jealous
  its payperview but expect it to show up on bilibili or somewhere
  rhythm dont know anything about moe probably her too though who knows      thanks ill keep an eye out for it on bilibili thenor if tickets are cheap ill just buy one
    hopefully itll be the whole thing and not just a portion like the yomiuriland event
  hopefully itll be the whole thing and not just a portion like the yomiuriland event  god i fucking hope not but usually with concerts theyve got an audio crew recording or streaming the thing set up all over the place so it should be fine
  what
shiinas guillotine lucksack  
very old aoi videos getting subs
  remove furries
  sorry i must have worded that weirdly what i meant is usually when bands do a concert theres a dedicated tech team recording it or streaming it

  i swear ive seen a chuuba with that hair before charo maybe
  shes a bit bothered by it but not enough to be really upset by it it sucks though if it was up to rank 100 shed have been on there easily
eli isnt modded in sharus chat weird couldva sworn she noticed it and modded her in an earlier stream
  better have fat tiddies
  its sad  shes my favorite of the hnst members but shes also the least popular
  is this the rumored hololive mens
  well she has a pretty dedicated fanbase and shes pretty happy with that and among the honeystraps shes also watched a lot remember how she got a fuckton of art during that draw honeystrap in 60 minutes tag thing
  its up
  tenmakunin
  kita
first charlotte is uncomfortable with gaijins public displays of affection and now a cambodian came up and just kissed her
  not kissed she said the wrong word
  should probably clarify think it was some guy asking for 寄付 which she accidentally said as キス she gave the dude 500 yen and left pretty much i missed a part of what she said though

tomorrow
i love my daughter aoi
  there isnt a poll for a sub rank70 to beat the 3 best chuuba tomorrow though
  yeah tomorrow get some glasses and learn math to see theres still gonna be a 10000 subs difference between them
  yeah  
  math is hard
 fairys   riri   mama from 30 minutes ago not that many streams happening now though it makes sense i guess
  yeah i messed up i was thinking of the buoooo moe one mito still has 5 days left
  oh no
so how many people watched ai chans show last night i know it was a hit among vtuber fans but how about normal japanese at home was it considered a success
  i was thinking of the buoooo moe one  no you werent thinking of that one because if you were youd have posted it you just dug deeper into the list so you could try and save yourself embarrassment while instead you just look even more retarded try a bit harder with your shitposts anon
  eilene is buying subs for moe shes been irrelevant since she debuted and yet somehow still keeps growing
  i saw a number floating around of 55k people watching it not sure how true that is it not or if its an underestimate or something i just know i saw that number floating around in a ton of chats
  youre probably thinking of tweets for the hashtag
  nigga what check out my previous post  from yesteday
  probably but if theres 55k people talking about the show id assume a majority of those were watching as well as close to viewer numbers as wed get without them outright coming out from the studios/channels i guess
  thats 55k tweets not people  each person mightve made 5 tweets
  no one has any idea what point youre trying to make at least other autistic shitposters in these threads have a clear albeit retarded point
  no i specifically saw the term 55000人 floating around in a bunch of chats check hanerus stream chat from yesterday if you dont believe me it was mentioned countless times there
  that and only a fraction of people use twitter werent her nobangumi shows getting upwards of 150k or 250k viewers usually
  i took the screenshot to follow up my post from yesterday i scrolled down to check the remaining list stopped at nobumoe duo and made the post while they were on my screen thus messing up  its idiotic from me to explain this shit since you clearly made up your mind already
  i believe 55k tweets was their goal for the hashtag
  not him but his point is pretty clear i think youre the only retard here
  not him i also dont understand your point
  this cant be happening mitobros
didnt think kanae would get so addicted to minecraft mods when
 been a while since one of these tamakin singing stream
the inconsistencies in kanaes texture pack upset me
  someone introduce him to tekkit or whatever big mod is popular nowadays
  thats it this is definitely one of the best dola fanarts out there whoever made this is a fucking hero
  
 trucker rin
  theres no point i messed up by literally looking at nobuhime and moe while writing the post about mito and himehina  then here comes anon with his silly conspiracy theories
  virtual liver
  let him be is the anon obssesed with 2dhater aka 3dhater
  tekkit  were you in a coma or something   most big mods dont have a japanese translation unfortunately we will probably never see them going through the twilight forest
  i havent cared about minecraft mods since tekkit was the big thing everyone was playing gimme a break
  comfy outfit
  yeah unforunately the best well get is maybe a few plugin minigames or adventure maps like the ones rion and debi did a while back  then again with some mods im not really sure if you need a proper translation stuff like tinkers you can mostly figure out just by putting stuff together id assume
rin drives like a grandma
  drives like a grandma anon i dont know how to break it to you but
  i want to sit on rins lap while shes driving
  like
  kiki hahahahhahahahahahhahahah
  is this the same place that played ai songs that someone posted before
  しぃしぃ
  they wouldnt figure out shit with tinkers since they cant read the book
  so russian one is dead huh
  i dont know but i am a big fan of wildparty
  very cute 親分 and 組長
  they seem to be big fans of vtubers in general thats cool
  cow
  im excited to see if hell play maple dancer and whatnot during the next mogra event the djs there are always playing hello morning mixes but thats about it

kuromus gap moe ハァハァ
suddenly 32k viewers did someone promo her
  probably she just lucked out and there arent too many others bigger than her streaming right now
    vtuber of peace and gaijin doing karaoke next week
  she also got 26k subs and its a stream thats not being archived so i guess 2ch picked up on it the viewers been steadily going up 34k now proud of this spaghettiinari
  get that slut away from usagi
  literally just posted not even 3 pages up
  
inari saikyou maji manji
she shouldnt have allowed dvr if she isnt going to archive this because its easy to download from the beginning of the stream to the end this way
  those feet were made to step on dicks
  even if she didnt allow it someone would still find a way to record it
  if they know a way then they should tell me because im fucked if there isnt a way to watch the dvr when its still live
    chat started a chorus of recording when she confirmed no archive
  people would be recording from the start or the second she mentioned it wasnt going to be saved or when she started singing since karaoke streams are usually ng that or some youtubedl thing that i know next to nothing about
  she hit 4 consecutive guillotines before she guillotined her own connection with a hit rate of 30 she was absurdly lucky
  homoraibu
  theyd just have to be there in the moment there is no way to record a stream like that in neither youtubedl or streamlink   luckily this is the kind of stream thats very easy to grab
  you can record this by playing the stream through vlc  vlc  and clicking on the record button  i archived a few karte streams like that in the past
  the functionality might exist in youtubedl somewhere buried in the documentation and forum posts but not from what little research ive done has turned up  the idiotsure method is just to record from the beginning yeah    or wait till its finished and grab the last 2 hours of a stream which will be immediately available about 2030 seconds after the stream ends until about 1020 seconds after that    seeing as dvr mode is on she doesnt have it set to noarchive mode immediately afterwards and will probably just private it  that little lag in processing time on the server lets you use youtubedl to trick their video manager into delivering the archive to you even after its deleted
  can you record a stream from the beginning when youre only catching it midstream
 debirion dbd   hinako
  great tiny hats think alike
  oh i dont think so
  papa is fucking hot
  fujo proportions are creepy as fuck
  its okay roboco was very butthurt but her cute pet weasel massaged the pain away
  still amazed by this its like the stars aligned to show to the 190k viewers a true クズtuber
  19k
kuromus singing all those old meme songs wow as expected of the hundreds years old oinari
  i died of shock when absolute angle showed up
  shes on the title screen
  wasnt she on the title
  where
  hopefully her fan still visits this thread  im still here waiting on one of her archives from last night to go up theres always a big delay of multiple hours for line
  me too i also stood up and clapped
i love her so much
  i use the latest version but it shows me an error
  im glad someone can love her even with her crabs
  it only works on the first part if you put in the p2 url it just downloads the first part
  i was just about to post the same thing i want a gf like aoi so much is it so much to ask
  how i can not love her even with that    with some hope
imagine getting killed by rin running her truck into your car
  dream come true
      you wouldve never cared about her in the first place if she didnt put on some makeup
  he wouldva never cared we know he didnt care because he didnt even show up until after her first guerilla stream his dicks just hard because a cute girl was tiredly talking on stream and that spurred his tism into maximum overdrive
  25 working on art 1 26 and notemama hanging out in chat
  was fun seeing the entire thread bully him  not really it was mitofans saying muh 2dhater over and over
  i saw her first a long time ago
i was never in favor of splitting the thread when the 3d/2d falseflagging started but this legit idolfaggotry is making me think a schism wouldnt hurt
  oh so this was your plan all along aoidolfag i never called this out especially not in the thread you started this shitposting in oh man what a surprise
its shit like this that makes me wish that aoi remained ugly
  not me i actually like the chuubas i like regardless of shitposters aoi deserves the fame she got
  if she got 100k and still stayed ugly she wouldnt exist anymore
kuromu you cant yell at people for staying up and being neets when youre the one who consistantly stays up past midnight
  mitofans  its just nijisanjishill samefaggin as usual
  i miss her old model because i enjoyed how goofy it looked
 stop shitposting and watch this cute ojiisan
        elis the best
  its great to see her otaku side coming out after the ichika stream
  because that could be her swindling people at least she delivered what she promised and even her debut album with universal music will be given first to the people who donated to her
  so theres no way to download the photoshoot
   debirion dbd  proud of them for the quick back and forth they had with atelier memes uni taru rions taste is generally pretty awful and i dont know much about debis but atelier is always good
kuromus genki voice is cute cute
  she actually got 200k and then her company wanted 250k more for costumes and shit
          part 2      also pet
  do you have part one as well
  many thanks
  based heteroarchiveanon
  no ill pet sonico instead
  yes
  the first part should be in the archives from last week
kuromus a cuter singer then i expected
  shes worse than ai though
  part 1      though there is a torrent and zippyshare download for last weeks ep
  many thanks again
  imagine if akane came back with an oddly deep voice
  cant clear stage 3
  i would love it if he became one of the ninjas and absolutely no one talked about how weird it was
incomprehensible cat kuroi 
  oh yes youre right now zzz can convert the sonico episode to mp4 and upload the torrent
why we call hh unsexy when this exist
  fuck off with your furry shit
  there is precisely one r18 entry under the おめシス tag but its just a compilation and the picture of them thats in it isnt lewd
  ill upload it as is if vod doesnt appears tomorrow any modern player should be able to handle flvs
airi is adapting to the harsh competition by providing a quick recap of her latest stream  
  mitofans  s
deep web underground
theyre in    
  looks like yua desu
  only a paedophile would find a child sexy
  well someone posted part 2 already but you could always use screen recording if everything else fails
  i was talking of converting it for the sake of consistency having all of them in the same format but anyways please do what you think is appropriate i really appreciate your efforts thank you
  shes back
  youre talking about 70 of hiyoko fandom on twitter you know
  you mean saezawa natori
  no i mean yua
  beauty filters were a mistake
  this i dont mind the cat ears and stuff but that mess physical appearance i dont think i ever saw a photo of her or hina without the beautifier shit
  its yaezawa    yua  who is she ranked
  its the eyes that get me the eyes
  she looks fucking creepy as shit
  netty has nothing on this alien
  im into extraterrestrial girls so beauty filters are a blessing
  念願のツーショット撮ってもらった  ツーショット  what did she mean by this
  who is she ranked  shes 49 on the userlocal ranking
  yeah nips being obsessed with magnifying their eyes just looks creepy we dont live in the anime unfortunately for fucks sake
  
what the hell is this  
  its chink
  the next heavenly king
nobody archived kuromus stream right i wanted to hear her singing old anime songs
  the pioneer of chuubas

  fuck me daba
how do you guys feel about vtubers killing anime i noticed something was wrong a few months ago but now we have more or less solid evidence that 2018 is the worst year for tv anime bd sales in the last decade at the every least by my rough count the revenue from bd sales is 824236 million yen in 2018 vs 174253 million in 2017 a 50 drop in sales theres still the ongoing fall season but going by the current stalker estimates its unlikely to add more than 15 billion yen in sales the only thing that has changed between 2017 and 2018 is that in 2018 you had a new industry pop up out of nowhere targeting the same anime watching audience and otakus in general
  get out daba
  about time
  good anime is really stale
  meh stopped caring about anime ten years ago
  dont you need a 2d/3d avatr to be a chuuba
  based chuubas putting the final nail into animes coffin
  not anymore
  how will /a/ ever recover
  they just have to get vtubers to star in anime
  the anime industry has a been a total shitshow for a long time if anything this is a good thing
  damn i wont say he got everybody in but he did get a lot of them    is there a way to download this i feel like it deserves to be archived properly
  the paradigm has shifted the era of living anime has begun
  bd shit costs too much much cheaper to support a couple of your favorite chuubas
    holy shit rin is fucking based
nobuhime exposed will have to live with small apparition in the next young animal  
  anime has been bad and too expensive for too long though i feel bad for the occasional good anime that pops out once in a while and other stuff like jojo i hope we still get more jojo anime
  kek based grandma
  based and redpilled
  well if they thought that selling the same formulaic harem scifi anime with lots of fanservice over and over again could be sustainable in the future they were wrong and fresh ideas will be ditched because of censorship the vtuber fad will met the same fate if they keep trying the imitation of the top vtubers instead of being creative and innovative
  they need to move on digital distribution like video game industry
  using bd sales as a measure of anime success is stupid and archaic as fuck    so perfect for japan
  until now they are trying to pitch the anime to netflix the problem is that netflix is pozzed and they eventually destroy the anime with sjw live adaptations
  eventually
  miss bushido
  itd be great if anime has a steamlike platform
  yes eventually they ruined death note and they are destroying cowboy bebop
  that just happens not every year is like 2017
  careful now if youve ever actually watched anime on steam you dont want that ask for something better
  there is crunchyroll
  i sincerely hope youre saying that just to illustrate an example and not because youre recommending it
むぎむぎむぎ
  hmmmm is the current season considered 2018 all of the anime will end in 2019  in any case depending on how this one goes anon may be right although bd sales seem to have been declining already prior to vtubers showing up
  むぎむぎ
this dog knows you masturbate to her  
  dont forget about the rise of gacha games which have been a substantial source of otaku leeching
  is it me or are video and audio desynched here

  alice will be a rough time because shes insistant on playing a character but mikoto will be endless giggling
  this but with mea
  theres also quality of animes the increase in piracy less reason to buy blurays and increased amounts of cheap goods that probably isnt included in this but honestly if this post makes /a/ mad its all worth it
shes teaching her about sex
  my secret crash may be an ex av actress but i doubt she has anything to teach this 35 y/o single mother
  no bully mea has a hard life

of the 3 million yen ruri won a few days ago 1 is for herself and the other 2 million should be used as sponsorship     why do they mean by sponsorship are they going to use that money to buy gear editing computers or ads for the ninja channel
   what do they mean
the dolls just hit 30k subs     and to think a month ago their channel was in serious danger with only 3k subs after almost 4 monhs
      ninja channel and the dolls channel are both outside the danger zone everything seems right with the world
can eilene be defeated
  only beilene can defeat eilene
  beilene could try
  they better buy akane back
  ruri won 3 million eilene got a million from candy crush just to make a joke video     are vtubers going to start getting showered in money by big corps and ad agencies soon
  watching those streams was so amazing yet painful to watch  i still remember the screaming
  its a one million prize plus a sponsorship program worth two million for a year     in return for offering whatever kind of support or promotion they may require within that two million range the sponsors want one advertisement video or stream a month so you can likely expect a bunch of sega games to be played by the winners
wtf im gay now
    whos dumber himawari or moruru
  i dont even know who she was
  look at the gamers academic test results again
  expected really considering how long she had been gone
  this one too  
    kagayaki starts is changing its name to react and dropping idol activities i wonder what she means by multitalent activities
    they still have two girls in the idol category multitalent is probably generic title for people without focus on gaming or music
  there are more responses to this retirement announcement in just a few hours than ayamina games after a week

  its just two bros who sleep together at eachothers  houses after playing video games whats weird about that
  because theyre really good friends that like to fuck
retard new outfit today
  im glad she still has her mama
debis impression of rion is just moaning kiritos name and talking about mikotomama
  long haired hima just feels wrong
  this is the winter one and theres still another one right
  yes
    aoi is going to do her best
  midori and shiishii are going to get on amazingly well riri probably too not sure how alice will work with them though
  why shes definitely not doing it for free and is definitely glad to do it for her kids
  this will be fun i dont know how theyre going to top the kuzuha soundboard tho
i think im in love anons
  were those eyepatches/bandages ever explained i remember how nijisans were randomly getting those
  that and shes also only drawing the designs not working on the facerig at all making designs for what are essentially your living breathing ocs is one of the many joys of being an artist
  they look cool
  they were just halloween accessories for those that didnt have halloween ouftits
  with who
debi making camera shutter sounds while rion is giving an interview on the 40 minutes of technical difficulties these two are a better duo then i ever could have imagined
  maybe thats why hes using his emoticon too to try to fool others
  hes taller though
  kaede collab when
yua can have her thread tomorrow but we really should support the small chuubas like sana or shiro who literally no one knows of
rin new outfit also today  
  literally who cares about what the rest of the board thinks /jp/ is pathetic and were better then flanposters
  i like how they recognized kaede slowburning imagedumps are cancer
  well this board was solely created to contain touhou imagedumps on /a/
  midori and shiishii are going to get on amazingly well  i cant imagine that happening the only thing they have in common is their love for pandas
  and it had actual discussions back then
  if zun stopped being a lazy faggot and dumped more stuff probably anons could have something else to discuss instead of which toehoe would they fug
  i blame years of autistic shitposting and tripfag worship chasing away people that actually wanted to discuss vns and touhou then theres general loss of interest in the english speaking community as people moved to fresher memes

latest chapter      volume 6c full text      6c epub temp       last thread prematurely died but now that index nt21 is fully translated its time to get this back
  now that index nt21 is fully translated its time to get this back  wasnt there supposed to be a new blood sign volume as well at some point soonish
  let me be hopeful that well get a chapter between index and blood sign please
  last thread prematurely died but now that index nt21 is fully translated its time to get this back  it died because there will be no update until end of november or early december since blood sing is coming out     also stop spamming threads for no reason anyone knows that threads should be made when we get updates or new vols coming out or are you new here
  1160 pages
  7 pages more than 2b  this is the thickest book yet
  do we know whos on the cover yet    its obviously going to be horizon but is there a chance of anyone else like 
  the only sensible thing to do would be to have horizon on the front and toori on the back
  nah should be kawakami wearing trollface and riding satoyasu
  thatll be in the inside back of the sleeve
  thanks for the 6c epubs are there any for 5b to 6b
  in the usual place you should know that by know
  the bitches mediafire folder only goes up to 5a take pity on this poor foolish anon
  ive also only been able to find the post 5a epubs by links in the thread if theres a folder link too i would appreciate that
  thanks
    wait are the mega files gone what the fuck
  ill throw them in a folder when i get home later
  or maybe ill do it now the mega app works surprisingly well  
should i read this series the books are so massive
  well we got new info an a new chapter translated seems like the thread was made in a timely manner
  yes by all means but id say start with owari no chronicle which is finished dont let the size of the books make you afraid they are actually quite easy to read and never feel too dense by the time youve read onc and whats translated of horizon youll probably have at least 7a more if youre a slow reader or dont have much time to read
  nice
  i had been meaning to put the ones i had downloaded into there but havent gotten around to it  its mostly because people stopped dropping stuff into the folder and i guess where they were dropping them eventually got baleted
  great thanks a ton
  much appreciated anon
  its going to be a group photo every significant character gets a pixel each
  well know soon enough    
can somebody please explain to me what is the fucking deal with 11b on amazon     usually there was no problem with getting two a couple of months after release but this one is worse than third volume of first season that one with asama    am i to think that id better order the last goddamn book the moment it releases or risk not getting it at all
  sold out but its getting a reprint as far as i understood it
  why are they still not doing digital releases
  im expecting them soonish honestly      i have my copies of everything volume 11 last on preorder so no need to get two for scanning in case we dont get digital anytime soon after all
  its more of a closure thing to have it all in physical form
  yeah the same thing happened with 11a actually it was gone for a while so i decided to order the others day one
  with digital kimitoasamade coming with the bdbox i wouldnt be surprised if they offer the whole series as ebooks once 11c is out
for those who arent following js06s twitter    i finally started reading kawakamis stories on kakuyomu and heres a quick description of the first 4    1 kawakami and his friends discussing love with nonhuman fantasy races and inanimate objects  2 fictional college students telling the story of the time one of them wrote a speech on analytics for another to give and due to a misspelling had her give a speech on anal sticks instead  3 the story of a girl who can read minds falling in love for the first time  4 toori and naruze from horizon trying to tell the story of the crane wife and ending it on a really bad pun
  huh i didnt even know js06 had a twitter    ending it on a really bad pun    now all we need is for masazumi to pop out with an even worse one
    kawakami please stop let satoyasu do his job instead of this youre going too far
  there are no brakes on this crazy train
  the crotch parts of the uniform have gone from conservatively convering the girls crotch to daring to take her viginity with every step with how deep they dig in
  ohoooo
  nice
wolf ass
  thanks
  thanks    this is just amazing the artist 
    has somewhat of a sameface problem going on though

    thats one hell of a transition in style theyre all now thiccer
  looking more and more like kawakamis drawings instead of the usual style i fell in love with
  its dem times  or maybe there never was a satoyasu in the first place
    be careful who you call ugly in middle school    in all seriousness while i dont like the direction the proportions and such are going you can really tell his lighting and colouring skills have improved drastically kimitoasamade was his peak tho
    why is that bag looking so familiar     any oldfag can point out if you remember what is that bag
  why im getting some ill leave everyone and travel around the world vibes
  holy shit  protect that smile
  its not a bag per se it is a mounted commander in feudal japan thing easier to see in battle    knowing kawakami though toori may well be inside it
  looks like a green wrapping cloth with a karakusa pattern thieves usually have them in jrpgs and such for some reason
    commander horizon coming through
  now im wondering if they do commander on deck thing on musashi
  the head is good that body is fugly though
i question the usability of this box
  the horizon box
preview when
  in a month like always
  i guess its helpful if you dont have any more shelf space
  i miss the clean lines and smooth curves of satoyasus earlier work lumpy just doesnt appeal to me
  everyone does but i dunno this is kinda fishy i mean why the fuck is kawakami changing the illustrations by himself and not satoyasu or maybe is satoyasu the one whos willingly changing them
  its a shame too since everything has gotten better except the body proportions the lighting the coloring the poses the faces and the backgrounds are all improved
  posting best girl
  awesome thanks
  new cm
  that box is looking sweet
ded
  i cant remember  why they got 2 weapons  is this because those defensive
  nope you will learn later why they have 2 of them
  this is naomasas little sister right
i dont get it
  is this a reference to some 80s mecha or something
  pretty sure its a braves reference the thing on tooris head reminds me of guys headpiece in gaogaigar
  that thumbnail looks like shes stroking two big cocks
  face looks very guren lagann to me
  the pose is just a gainax pose that comes from gunbuster and referenced later in guren lagann
can we start betting on what kawakami focuses on next since horizon is finishing up      i dont want it to end ive been a horizonfag since 2012 or some shit
  my heart says edge but my brain says obstacle
    doubt it will be obstacle hexennacht was already obstacle so i doubt hell do it so soon im betting on edge since it still has nothing and its the only missing part
      just wait until the last volume just like hexennacht were probably gonna get an annoucement on the afterword
      it is a shame that we lost a big part of this aesthetic from satoyasu everything else is great but holy fuck dude is kawamami reading too many doujins or what lmao    there are newfags defending these abominations on as   lmao
  there are newfags defending these abominations on as   really its been a long ass time since i went there is really that bad
    ah yeah i saw that but i cant post there because the sperglord of an admin there banned me for posting a summary in a light novel thread   i saw 3 guys that looks like they lurk here talking about the designs and a horde of retards who dont even know when the art changed trying rto fit in there
  colorwise i prefer the current style but designwise it got too overboard    i mean as much as i like meaty girls they werent as meaty originally and im pretty sure its not due to fucking toori im fine if he wants to make new characters to be that meaty but keep the proportions of the existing characters the same
  exactly we have girls like kimi or asama or mary that are meaty as fuck but they still looks good the same girls now got ridiculous bodies and we all know thats thanks to kawakami    what is impressive is how there is people that doesnt even read horizon and have the balls to defend that when even the elevens mentioned that
  please dont make me sad
dont die
  as  thats a name ive not heard in long time long time
  
  preview and cover for the bonus novel is up
  jesus christ that disgusting design what the fuck is wrong with you kawakami
  because you thought it was fine before
  thats the same novel but with an alt cover in the bandai store
  what confuses me the most is how much the eyes in this and the 11c cover resemble kawakamis style youd think that under normal circumstances giving the illustrator a general outline of what you want would be enough but he seems to be rather deeply involved in things he has no business messing with
  are you retarded or just a newfag this is happening since a few volumes back around 9
since index got a season 3 and getting other animations does horizon have a chance to get a season 3
  its ending so no chance
  that was discussed already and no not a chance
  clearly he plans on cornering the doujin market himself
  if anything something like an edge anime original would probably be more likely at this point  i say more likely but more likely than pretty much 0 is still not a lot
  i want asama with big realistic sized honkers back
  i miss this design so much she was meaty and big on every place but still a good kind of big now is too fucking much and doesnt even look good
  we dont really have any proof the style change is due to kawakami meddling satoyasus style has been changing with every series since he started illustrating  i think its possible that kawakamis draft illustrations have gotten better to the point where they leave less room to the illustrators imagination though
its back up
  other one still 10k more expensive solely for an ebook pretty shitty
    it just dawned on me that this is probably what the zbrush model he posted recently was for
  10000 jap dollars for a fucking ebook   what is their end game here
  all other stores have that prices as well they come with physical bonus goods though but none of these are worth 10k either  the real question is why theyre selling the bonusless one at a 25 discount
it annoys me that they released a preview for the sidestory and the bit of the new song they also showed during the stream but not the extended version of preview 1
  he sometimes posts his illustration roughs on twitter  
we usually praise kawakami for his world building conflicts and general madness but has anyone else noticed how masazumi has changed since 1a    she absolutely didnt associate with the class and didnt play along with their jokes but shes changed slowly to the point in volume 6 that shes playing along with them and its never really pointed out by kawakami in the writing it just kinda happens    like thats development that fiction with a way smaller cast usually fails to accomplish
  topknot
  kawakami was always good with character progression and the overall group dinamic it just in horizon its more noticable because of length of the story
  i dont know if i found the character development in onc all that remarkable though disregarding sayama and shinjous relationship on the other hand it has been quite some time since i finished it so i might be overlooking some stuff
  its pretty remarkable how much masazumi changes she starts at a bewildered distance from the rest of 3plum unable to follow along with the craziness but by the time they get to oushuu shes fit in enough that its now up to yoshy and ookubo to show confusion at 3plums antics    kawakami did something great
  with onc characters got one arc and then more or less matured so theres less of the constant progression that we see in horizon
anyone has azw3 or edited pdf that works good on a kindle for horizon 4 and 5  whenever i use calibre i fuck up everything
  uh i only have epubs dunno if anyone made pdf of them
just now realized toori played cupid to get marga and margot together
  toori does a lot of things that somehow work out really well his entire shtick is that sometimes hes actually being retarded and sometimes hes just pretending
  i thought the shtick was that it was all pretend
  i can upload mine later
  thank you
  added a subfolder to the mega  
  not really you cant read this yet but toori is like 20 a real idiot and 80 someone who hides everything the weight of other peoples desires and pain and his own problems kimi understand that perfectly same for horizon asama and nate did it during the progress of the ln but other than that everything reached a peak when he died thats the real toori
  okay that folder is even better than i expected  downloading everything thank you so much anon
  wait i thought he told horizon to make him sad so hed die for some history recreation thing
  nigga what are you smoking    after musashi died while taking down azuchi toori and everyone else went back to the place they used to put all the people on musashi before the battle horizon told him that in a world where she can be happy having toori endure all of this and not be allowed to cry is a nono and that is okay for him to cry toori then finally released everything inside him and thats the reason  why his contracts punishment activated dying in the process     after that asama managed to keep him on a plane that exist before the afterlife and there you have everything about izanagi and izanamis stuff to bring toori back to life
spoiler text guys come on
  spoiler   on a ln thread  how new are you
sip
  envy
  it would have been nice to have put spoiler tags on untranslated novel spoilers like is the usual courtesy in these threads
is js06 busy with blood sign right
        her boobs looking fucking gross now wish kawakami would back off and let sato do his job
  yes
  thats awesome
  makes me wonder if hes gonna do ho16 or 11c first since both release on the same day
  ho
  ho16 is probably getting a digital release and 11c probably isnt so ill have a few days to read ho16 before my copy of 11c arrives
  there may be some christmas miracle and we get everything horizon digitally i hope they finally do it
  i doubt it most likely they want everyone to buy the final physical copies before announcing a digital collection in order to sell everything again
ded
gonna be totally honest     i cant tell if when a chat handle pops up if that means the characters are talking via text or by visual sign frame    like im sure ive seen tons of times that have mentioned expression or audio when the dialogue changes to that style    can someone clarify for me
  why do you post like that
  sign frames support both chat and videoconferencing the chat handles mean theyre using text but since theyll use chat even when physically in the same location or using video it can seem like theres both audio and video    plus if you look at the chat sign frames they come with chibiform expressions on each line
  does futurepast twitter issue bans in the name of diversity and where is masazumis blue checkmark
  its shintooperated so you just have to put censor bars and mosaics everywhere    and rather than twitter this is more like futurepast irc
if they value erotica highly in futurepast how come futayo still doesnt know what sex is why didnt toori lent futayo some of his doujin stash to help her understand better
  because its more amusing this way toori values entertainment more than anything
  futayo is retarded shes only good at fighting so leave it at that
deeddd
  they mention several times that its funnier to keep the gag going      dont be mean futayo understands that battle sex and food are all thats important in life the troublesome thinking can be left to masazumi
what will masazumi do after matsudaira conquers the far east there arent any wars after the tokugawa shogunate is established
  institute a tax policy or something i guess  or start a new non historical war
  the reason she doesnt to begin with is because of her parents  her father was a warrior and nothing else barely even a father  her mother was a robot that was probably as stone cold when she was properly alive    as for why she still doesnt know even after being on the highest concentration of perverts in their world for so long is because the only people that have the gall to teach her find it too amusing to ruin and the people that have the heart to correct her dont have the gall to sit down this bombshell cavewoman and tell her about the futurepast birds and the futurepast bees  the only people i think could actually do the task are turenne or sakai ones in france most of the time and the other is lazy so good luck with either of them
  sakai is not lazy in this case hes afraid she will know the meaning of that ass grab
  still hed probably have two or three of the musashi captains nearby to explain poses  natemama would probably do the poses herself or try to at least
  seems nice but i dont even want to imagine importing that
  well dengeki just added their december releases to bookwalker including new bundles and theres nothing kawakami
  whats the material
fuck me the sanada braves hit me too damn hard    just got done crying my eyes out over kakeis death what the fuck kawakami
  i honestly found them annoying when they were introduced all the way back in volume 3 but they really grew on me over time
just asking blood sign tl is done or still ongoing just to know when we can get more of v7
  too lazy to check yourself
not to be rude to js06 but do we actually know how accurate his translations are    im not doubting hes a good translator but im curious if were dealing with a 90 accuracy rate or a 99 one
  abuse the length of time between sekigahara and the establishment of the tokugawa bakufu and the siege of osaka castle to still use war use any small armed uprising to its fullest or ignore/twist the testament history to serve the needs of the far east
  he has n1 level you know what that means
  i dont know the specifics but its the highest level of tested proficiency    again i know hes good and dont doubt hes a good translator but like i said are we looking at a 90 or 99 accuracy rating
the uneeded are literally the unluckiest people they deserved better    work entire life to inherit name  get name stolen by time travelers you had no chance of beating   lose everything you worked for  time travelers fight musashi for best way to save everyone from the apocalypse  get killed no matter what in the process   never get to make it to the peaceful world promised by toori
  theyre very good he even does a good job of transferring some of the japanese puns and humor into english that wouldnt make sense if you just went literally  thats not to say there arent some editing errors but in terms of the translations theyre top tier
  never get to make it to the peaceful world promised by toori  wrong there are uneeded that are actually very important right now and they are able to see the future musashi is building up right now
  i find them very relatable
    while js06 is busy i started reading onc again man so many fucking memories and nostalgia still love this ln after all this time
  theres also a whole world out there to conquer even though the tokugawa regime was isolationist you can always get around that with interpretations
  onc was great the first time i read it and kept being great every time i reread it sayama is still the best mc
js06 i want to ask you something but i almost know the answer already  when you end horizon or so will you translate the encyclopedia
  wont the world be destroyed or whatever happens at the end of a era we gotta set up obstacle yeah
  the end of the era doesnt necessarily need to coincide with the end of this series or the history recreation or anything
  its kinda looking like thatll happen though doesnt it with destiny and all somethings gotta happen when it goes away
  teach children obviously
  destiny isnt dying the way to fix the problem is simple just let the world go back to normal and keep trying to create the world that wont go to shit thats the function of obstacle and thats why on city they managed to create the final world
  right teach them to love war
  every year masazumisenseis class tries to conquer the school and theyre just elementary schoolers
dont die yet
  what exactly is it about the world that keeps causing problems in the horizon world its destiny but it seems to have taken countless attempts to finally reach the stable world in city is it some consequence of contradiction allowance
masazumi masazumi never changes
  youre not going to understand this if you havent read anything aside from horizon    basically the foundation world was destroyed and the people who used to live there tried to recreate that world but it always ends up being destroyed one way or another
  to the extent i understood the solution reached a the end of onc wasnt final so some tens of thousand years later the destruction is approaching again i think detroit or some other novel in the city series explain the world better
ded
you know realize the upcoming edge series will be stuck with these terrible proportions from the beginning
  sfx sudden anger
  i was trying really hard not to think about that
  its less painful if its like that from the start the real shock will be seeing what the current art develops into over another 10 years
  proper proportions with even more improved shading and coloring skills we wish
  fuck
  i dont know if it is a hot take or whatever but i dont think the weird proportions is that bad i mean knowing kawakami this would have happened sooner or later yes i prefer the onc and city styles but i guess they are a bit old to jap readers i dont know lol
  lol
11c preview when
  last time it was one day prior release
  masazumi is so cute
dead
i wish wed get some mouse povs tsukinowas would be cute michizanes unbearably chuuni and hanamis super lewd i bet
  we get one of ohiroshikis mouse instead
masazumi is good  good is masazumi
its actually finally happening  you can expect day 1 illustrations on its digital release        seems like only the last volume for now though
  now thats unexpected
  配信日 2018/12/21 金 0000  so the digital release is on the 21st
  nice   that means there hope for other volumes too
  and the listing is down again
  guess someone there made a mistake and put it up too early
  i wont have to take shitty photos then  that takes half the fun out of it but okay
  the digital release is two weeks late so your photos are still very much appreciated and always great
  you can always take pics of your pants and post them here
      those shitty photos are a tradition at this point
  i hope theyve learned their lessonc from hex and resolution is high right away
  pants  nails
  2048px is default now only issue will be the colored spreads because they limit them to width but i can always scan them from the physical copy
    fuck were close
make your bets for the final artwork for horizon at the last chapter of 11c
  tomama getting hed no happy family photos more talking heads and some tearful farewells
  good
  awesome thanks
  what is with those arms  point allocation small animals    the chapter image looked rather grand for all of three seconds before i noticed horizons arms
master muneshige master muneshige you dont have to add a muneshige ranking for each weapon on your site     im looking forward to how extended this gag will get
is it just me or does marga get a decent more involvement in the plot than margot
  looks great
slightly bigger textless
god fucking bless
  my body is ready
  how much it cost the box in burger money
  330 without taxes and shipping
  thats for the special edition though right  the one on amazon without the bonus novel is 31k which should be 270ish
  yeah the special edition is 38000 remember that you dont need to pay jap tax if you purchase from amazon  and the normal one is around 28618 which is 252 usd
is anyone getting collectors boxes or will the promo novels and art be lost to the ages
  i want to but i have no money
  dont worry
  does any of the stores apart from amazon even do international shipping without a proxy
  im getting the gamers edition
  if you can please focus on scanning the booklets no need to debind ill get rips of the ebooks and save us a lot of time
  im debinding and scanning it so no need for bitches to press it against a scanner and damage the book
  i think he means booklets that arent even bound so dont need debinding  but either way theres no particular hurry better to have the people who usually do the work handle it
  with all due respect to your work until now with access to ebooks you will be free of that extra labour ripping the books and setting up fully editable tl docs in a worksheet will take a fraction of the time the energy can be used for something else although it is true that proper paperback scans of illustrations are by far better than ebook rips
  better to have the people who usually do the work handle it  this    for so many years the usual group of people have worked on this others trying to help is nice and all that but let the experienced ones do the job theyve done a great work for years and there is no need to change that    dont fix what is not broken
so the scene being shown in the special ova is when musashi loses at the end of 10c right
  im just saying itd be more efficient and a way to free up resources who can work on unscanned projects in the backlog
  oh my bad i also meant only the physical bonus from the whole set like the bonus novel  i ordered the special edition from amazon so the idea was to post that exclusive store ebook and scan everything thats not getting an ebook if he is also getting the se and is willing to share a proper rip of the kfx its gonna save me some cash  and the next step was to get the animate store bonus via yahoo    i guess we could discuss this via mail or something so it wont spam the thread
  see above my new mail since im replacing the old one  muton1protonmailcom    well have to get ivan into the conversation as well
  ivan you mean sparhawk
  who no i mean ivan
  nope is the opposite read the summaries
  ahh i see where you came from another tourist from animesuki first amtro trying to capitalize on ivan/muton/bitches work and now another one     also sparhawk only buys/provide volumes he wants not the ones you request and he has never read anything from kawakami so please stay on animesuki amtro or whoever is behind this post
  ap24 is that you
  i am well aware of how sparhawk does things  and thats not what i meant you all get the volume and save tens of hours of work thats it i want nothing in return nothing other than to free up resources so the scan backlog gets cleared faster
  is known that you come from as who are you because if youre amtro you can get the fuck out
  i have no dealings with you whatever ill just drop the chapter the day the ebook comes out and let you all figure out what to do with it  not interested in some petty argument
  so yeah youre amtro seriously why trying again to get in the business of bitchesmuton and ivan when they already told you long ago that they dont need you    also your reputation is pretty bad especially because you work with the scum of the translation community you and your friends asking retarded prices for barely 1 chapter if a 3xx ln bringing that drama to as and get other people involved when you get exposed then going back to plebbit and keep the drama going just because you cant handle that fantranslations exist for free     this is advice for bitches and the res of the people stay away from this piece of shit this guy will bring nothing but problems to you he already did with mahouka shinmai and other titles we dont need this here
  you can stop spreading lies now  our reputation you know nothing about cbcs affairs if anything hes taking on a loss to get the novels translated dont tell me you honestly thought 10 dollars for full lifetime access would be enough to cover the translation fees for 45 full length novels the 400 page range all of which will be getting retranslated by an industry veteran alist translator and a vn fan tl on top of it all he doesnt flaunt it because hes actually nice and very humble some scam were running when were operating in the fucking red  now stop pushing your shitty vendetta everywhere you go i dont know what your issue is with me  he already did with mahouka  im sorry what
  the affairs of you and your group are very well known on 4chan plebbit jcafe and animesuki everyone knows that the quality of the translations you offer for retarded amounts of money are subpar i dunno why are you sucking your friends cock so hard but hes not even average when it comes to translations even people like nomn or zxzxzx can do a better job alist my ass you can always stop lying about your business when the 10 bucks to access are just for that getting access your friend already stated that he randomly increased the prices for their average work on translations because he wanted to screw on the people exposing them nice and humble you say yeah sure thats why he even went to /e/ to cry about how everyone was exposing his ass and he even got mad at zxzxzx for doing the same job for free     is quite funny to see you amtro defendinf your friends so much when all of you are the cancer of the translation community even worse than aereus or prozess reaching the point of scamming retards who are desperate to read something and claiming that youre good when people like js06 who are the best of the best dont even ask for a dime for their job     how fucking desperate are you to try getting into muton/bitches/ivan/js06 work to get credit from what theyve been doing for years like holy shit get some selfrespect get on your little head that they dont need you    quite sad that they dont know much about you but a little research will show them the cancer you and your friends are go back to translate shitty light novels instead of trying to steal the work the guys are doing with kawakamis light novels you subhuman piece of shit
  amtro  i remember that anon from months ago getting mad for some drama and stuff like that after he was told to not get into this   well here we go again it seems bitches  whores/8sg can you lend a hand here please
    im just getting baited here so long viper
  viper   literally who after getting exposed again youre just resorting to call this bait and bringing a random boogeyman     jesus amtro youre again showing everyone that you got caught
rip thread thank god this is the last volume
  eehhhhh not so sure buddy remember that we have no idea if edge or more obstacle is on the way probably the afterword will show something for the future    second ahead please please
  lesbian magical girls   jobbers everywhere   below average writing   no thanks hexennacht is nowhere near the level of owari or horizon not even close to city which is old as fuck and with a better execution when it comes to interconnected stories leading to the ending
  lesbian magical girls  bad    why are you gay
  lesbian magical girls  class 3plum has two of these
    sorry that was a bad explanation from my part     unlike malga and naruze which is something that feels natural on hexennacht we get something that feels forced sure go ahead and slap the common lesbian magical girl cliche but at least give it proper execution     thats the problem with kagami and notasamas relationship
  welp i only read hexen for hunter and fleur but she was so poor developed as character  it was a fun trip but underwhelming compared with horizon owari and city
    hexen feels like a secondary project because that was exactly what it was
  yeah but even if its a secondary project it feels so rushed
    even more than rushed it feels like kawakami was thinking should i do this should i add this what can i do with x character    it wasnt bad compared to your standard light novel but for kawakamis standards it was almost below average what pissed me off the most was how every single fight was overhyped and we ended with every single one of them being jobbers
  i must say hexen as an anime must be epic as fuck with those battles
  are you for real adversaries launching their shit around half the planet is the antithesis of jobberism      this
  nope you dont understand     usually when it comes to kawakami and battles what you get and this comes from all his previous titles is a buildup a preparation then the fight where you dont know if the protagonist or his friends are going to win and then the outcome you can cleary see this on owari no chronicle on city and horizon not a single fight on any of those titles included a jobber in fact there is a strong reason behind any character that is extremely powerful to lose a fight on purpose    what do you have in hexenacht is a buildup for the fight an incredibly huge hype for these fights especially because on every volume kawakami took a lot of time doing this then the fight and the most cliche and obvious outcome kagami winning against the most powerful beings in the planet because shes mary sue rinse and repeat    thats not quality writing thats just a fanfiction
    what the fuck kawakami
  constraints of the format and genre      he is just going off trippy drugs produced in his brain nothing unusual move along
  constraints of the format and genre  so you havent read anything i see is not even about format and genre because if that was the reason for what happened with hexe then why city was so good despite its obvious flaws     as i said hexennacht isnt bad if you compare it to the normal 300400 pages light novel but is nowhere near the standards of kawakami and it shows
  i wonder whos behind the post you quoted 
  mfw were getting these designs on everything in the future
  city  good  usual generalized maximalist screeching
  thank you for confirming that youre pulling shit out of your ass without even reading anything from kawakami it looks like youre evading your ban again buddy try again
  called
  unf do horizons have priestess as classes    i think i havent seen one in the psp game and the mobage but it would be a nice too see his image of futurepast nun like asama mary kimi nate and futayo wearing it would be nice
  shinto isnt very strict but i cant imagine going catholic on the musashi would go terribly well
  the nearest thing like a priestess in horizon is something like margas job
  wouldnt a witch be the absolute opposite of a nun
speaking of commissions is maryanon still planning on getting art of futayo right    also sharing an hd version of an old futayo commission the artist no longer makes threads on /i/ and his tumblr is soon to be kill thanks to the changes on tumblr    
  did i make that promise sorry
  actually fuck it can you give me a ref collage or imgur album of futayo    also any ideas youd like to see with her
  vanilla sex and anal is always nice im also in the mood for erotic massage like   i just cant get enough of her flustered/confused expressions    i think she also needs more art wearing her comfy sleepwear  im happy with anything if my ideas not good im cool with yours     another hq stuff from funk
  damn you got a funk comm nice     ill probably go for a doggystyle or a full nelson in that case
  it wasnt a comm were friends in /v/ drawthread and decided to ask one day thats before he made a patreon i guess    ill probably go for a doggystyle or a full nelson in that case  full nelson is great     this ones from sca hes great at drawing feet not sure if his rates still 25
  scas is floating closer to the 50 range now has been since at least 2016    im on his patreon just to commission him though so ill try to get some futayo feet at some point
  im already happy with what ive got from him but im looking forward to it     also realized that g138s tumblr is also dead i guess theres no harm in sharing this private art i got from him 
  well i like feet so its inevitable    i just sent in a request to  i hope you like paizuris
      i think i know who your favourite character is
  oh ho is it pov or straight shota with glasses      i think youre on to something anon
  i went with a nude futayo ss if he does pov itll be up to him
    this is offtopic but try all nsfw artist are getting purged from tumblr and other pages for retarded regulations you can only check them on twitter but almost all of them are on hold while dealing with the new regulations try to check nat the lich because she gave the new page where her works scas and others are now posting
        let this one die is already bad enough remember to report and ignore you know who so mods can deal with him like they did before keep things civil
  uhhh a little early anon but yeah thanks to amtro this thread went down the toilet
  christmas came early thank you    also share some what youve gotten from him if thats fine i dont see any mary posts in his pixiv
  its really rare for me to commission japanese artists so this futayo would be the first in a while    maybe with this skeb thing it should become much easier
  going to sleep hope next thread is chill and comfy    also kawakami needs to reveal the birthdays of the cast
  its verizons which owns the company which owns tumblr fault see more here

  as a kid i didnt know that cartoons were drawings i thought people got in cartoon costumes looks like i was right
  yes i always attend kigurumi wasshoi
  how is it  is it worth going all the way to kawasaki to see a bunch of kigurumisan
  you already know the answer to that     oh and it seems that my presence has been officially requested at rins fest so looks like im going after all _
  do a lot of nonjapanese people attend these sorts of events  what is there to do other than look and take photos of kigurumisan
  there are some attendees from neighboring asian countries but majority is local japanese    there are some side activities like games stage performances meeting mask makers and mask sales however its mainly an event for super fansso attendees are either a kigurumi photographer super fan or a kigurumi cosplayer
  there are a loooot of taiwanese/chinese kigs that attend funnily enough a lot of the japanese kigs are jealous of them and of nonjapanese kigs in general i think it is kind of amusing that you see the opposite happen in the west
put in my deposit for a new mask base is hikarinaka  same style but going with a diff expression/hair to avoid elsa comparisons i cant wait to be slutty
  heres the inspo    lockable followme eyes just realized i forgot to ask for the water delivery system but shouldnt be far enough along that i cant ask
    i dont know how to feel about these
  i dont think its bad per se but i have a strong preference for the more anime styled masks
  this mask is quite impressive for its accuracy to the character im curious enough to consider even getting like that myself if possible would be cool to get mask a of her sister as well
  do elaborate    the mask should fit my body type better anyways im super slender and my old mask looked real weird from the side plus i can actually see out of the eyes was never a fan of slits
anyone else deeply ashamed to be male and into kigurumi    im not the only guy here right
  you are and that makes you a faggot
  shit if any disgusting males did this id quit
  love this kig post more of her
everyone is a guy   we are all faggots
  ive wanted to get into this stuff since i found out about it when i was 15 never had enough money though
ive been thinking about it a lot recently and ive decided that im going to get started with kigurumi
    k
  good  you know what you want or just that you want in
  i dont know what kig i want specifically just that i want a kig im going to think about it and do a lot for research over the next few weeks and then place an order
  do you know who youre going to order from    there are a few japanese makers that people dont realize sell overseas i could help you order from one of them if youre interested
  whatever you order in the end please post pics
    how do you know all of this      how old are you now        good luck
  thanks a lot anon is there any reason why i should order from these japanese makers instead of more local ones       will do      thank you
  japanese makers tend to be better on average of course i dont know what local is for you and there are certainly good makers outside of japan but a lot of people who want to order from japanese makers due to misconceptions or language barriers think that they cannot    at the end of the day its your judgment on the maker you go with and its worth considering factors like cost future maintenance and relationship with the maker in addition to purely the aesthetics and attributes of the masks they make some makers have gotten involved in controversies so its worth doing some research on their customer feedback and history too
so i was looking through the archives at threads earlier this year and they seemed quite a bit more alive than this thread what happened
  the discord happened
can a tall fuck like me even do kigu stuff  i kind of want to be a loli but my 62 masculine stature probably wouldnt work for the loli character type anyway right  can you even go for cute characters being tall and all  what type of character types would work best
  talking kig
  by virtue of being a mask kig heads tend to be very large so being tall can actually help with proportions  as long as youre not a fatass it can make you look slimmer than you actually are
    dang not bad at all  i guess the worst case scenario is you looking like a slightly older version of the character  still looks cute though even if theres an indication of the person being pretty tall
  this is the worst thing about it i found out about kigu by accident two months ago now i have budget and save money to buy mask and cute outfits
how come wyu is suddenly making decent masks
  the 2b mask is based off a 3d print so the sculpting should be near perfect to the game model
watching kigu videos on youtube  go to comment section  see an obvious kid with a minecraft profile picture asking how he can get started with this stuff  instant flashback to when i was 13 and doing the same    its a really weird feel
someone mentioned a messy blue hair kig last thread    is this her
  the discord that killed the /kcs/ board has a pretty complete list of makers id go through them and see if you like one especially well  
  those are really annoying  i get quite a lot of people who think they can get into kigging with like 30 bucks
  kek the comment in particular that made me write this post was on one of your vids actually
whats approximate female to male ratio in kigurumi
  as i understand it most stage performers are female  as for hobbyists its usually dudes who wear these
  every 10 performers is 5 female 4 male 1 apache helicopter
  ha nice xd  most annoying yt comments are the questions that have been asked a million times and the ones begging for a specific video tho
  its the same person or persons trolling the thread just ignore
  huh how am i trolling the thread or do you mean the kids in the youtube comment section
  think anon means the people in my yt comments  and sadly i dont think so i honestly think people are just that clueless
  in all seriousness since were probably talking about hobbyists here and not stage performers take a look at this graph    女性  female  男性  male    the data is only one year old and while the japanese community is probably slightly more maledominated than the community as a whole its more or less the same story everywhere
  the writers of those annoying comments are not what you call clueless when the same phrased question appears every time exactly word for word with the exact same followup reply in every thread
  ah and yeah i agree in the case of kiddos asking how to get started although tbf the people who constantly beg for face reveals might be malicious
  id agree but it isnt the same person nor is it the exact same words i really dont get the feeling of getting trolled lol    such as the guy who actively threatened me with doxxing me and bashing my head in should i not do a face reveal
  lol wtf
  i dont think we are talking about the same thing im specifically referring to a specific phrase that gets asked and repeated in almost every thread a pattern like that is trolling fortunately i havent seen that show up much anymore since people are just ignoring it or the posters has moved on to discord for their kicks
  are you actually this mad about wait isnt it usually dudes who wear these
  being in japan has its advantages
  its not what i call mad its what i call trolling or wasting board space take your pick     remember this is a kigurumi reddit page most readers dont come here by accident
  
  remember this is a kigurumi reddit page
  i really dont know what you want to achieve people will just move on if its too distasteful in here
  its 4chan  do you look at anything else on this site or do you only go here
  are you a performer or just a fan
any good kig deals for black friday
  buy 1 sakib get a million fake account reports free
    most kigus are female
  those hands look very feminine
  what about the dick
  also very feminine
  i have the same hairstyle as the one on the right
  please  b r u s h t h e h a i r
  when you get out of bed
  i was more talking about the giant bald spot
eat a daki mouse
  very cute
in case anybody knows how does one transport a mask overseas  if i had one id be nervous as hell letting airport staff handle it  dont know if its safe to bring it with you in the cabin either
  you can carryon if you can put in your luggage
  my biggest concern is the size of it  judging from what ive seen the smallest dimension of a mask is around 9 inches/23 cm  most airlines only allow carryon luggage with the smallest dimension being around 9 inches/23 cm  you could probably get away with the size limit by carrying it in a cloth bag but that pretty much guarantees it to some sort of damage  all the cool performers ive seen always carry them around in cases like these which most likely wont be allowed for carryon
  mail it to yourself
  i put it an rv box locked it checked it in and i got it back safely without damage
  i just packed all the soft things around the mask and put it into a hardshell luggage never had any trouble
  how do they muster up courage to get out like that in public
  exhibitionism fetish
  sugoi
for anybody who has ordered and wears a hadatai should you measure yourself while wearing all the padding and shapewear youll be wearing underneath it  my gut is telling me that its the sensible option but the manufacturer ayame in this case says on their measurement guide that you should measure yourself without any padding on  what should i do
  you should still measure yourself with padding that you plan to wear underneath  but not breast inserts because those have their own little pocket    if you are with your friends its super cool to do things together   at some point you stop caring what the normal people think and at least here most people find it interesting anyway
  so just hip  butt padding  i dont plan on wearing anything for my waist so i dont have to worry about that  im not sure how much ayames hadatai can stretch so i dont want to risk getting one that fits me without any padding but doesnt fit with padding on
  strength in numbers
  measure with anything you plan to wear under the hada the warning about no padding is more for breast forms than anything else
  mine stretches pretty well better than the mfw ones  the material is a bit thicker but super comfy to wear   i wish the legs on mine werent ill fitting _ 
post an image where the mask is partially broken and you can see one of the wearers real eyes underneath i want to know if that is really as unsettling as it sounds
    holy fucking shit thats hard to read learn to screenshot things
  had to shrink it was that or holy shit page filling size
kigurumi fucking in pornhub  any of you did this
  a decent amount of it is stolen but some of it is uploaded by the actual person inside the kig  quality varies a lot
    thanks for the help  what does one usually wear underneath padding  how many layers of stockings/spats do you need to wear over the padding to smooth it out      when it comes to breast forms what size should i get if im aiming for a certain bust size  for example if my actual circumference is 85cm and i want a 90cm over bust what sort of form should i get
not original anon but is there a good general guide to hip/butt padding for someone whos never done this type of thing before
lets take a moment to appreciate one of the cutest girls
no one cares about cave alice
parasee is very cute and need more love  
  indeed

fubuki is cute
so when are we going to get the 3rd zara sunk during cape matapan
anyone able to read this  i suspect it could be the old war ensign of the nagato she is holding since it was preserved and eventually returned to a museum in japan
where were you when tumblr committed suicide
  just check danbooru for tl
  way to kill at least 50 of your main content
  go back there
  fuck off
  dont tell me you go to tumblr for kancolle art
  tl is on danbooru anon  but uh yeah shes happy she got her flag back
  nagatos flag is in yamatos museum  apparently somebody bought it for 10million yen and donated it
  to whom
  can you read
  donated to the museum
  i thought he meant that someone bought it from the museum and donated to someone
  really i thought it was donated by one of the guys who originally captured her
  no the plaque and comic says 石坂 浩二
    my mistake it was her admiral flag and it was to pearl harbor
  before iowa was added to the game we had people here who were certain that iowa would have some stupid line about the flag because some seamen from her took it  i was bit sad that they didnt comment about their delusions afterwards
  its really nice to have at least some parts of those ships preserved its a bit of history after all  saw one of prinz eugens propellers around a year ago
  theres a gun and rudder of mutsu outside the museum
  i dont remember that ever happening
  because there are some fags that take a random shitpost and spin it to the point as if there were a whole bunch of retards sperging over shit only he and a few of his pals actually cared about
  iowa and her crew were also put in charge of nagato for most of her remaining life  im still a little disappointed iowa didnt at least mention nagato
  iowa never saw yamato as someone worth remembering
  yeah a shame iowa doesnt have nor will nagato get any voicelines about them being bathbuddies
  considering they never met id assume so
  it was a nice place made a few good buddies in there a shame it goes out in blazes get woke go broke strikes again
post abyssals
    kc has always been pretty weak when it comes to voice lines referencing boats from other nations it is always same old  foreigner gushes over how cool yamato is   or   random encounter with bongos  rather than references to past events between boats
  a shit
  cool  its never cool its always about how pretty she is
  getting the duck treatment
  fucking mysterious temptress
  i want to be that cigarette
left or right
  i like both but more for the left
name a bigger myth than kitakami
  both
    left right and the seaport
  thank you based ktkm
  the young mistress
  how it doesnt surprise me that somebody doesnt remember such small thing from almost 3 years ago you might have as well missed it though i saw it in 2 or 3 threads  if i dont remember wrong she was the first foreign boat who had actually met some japanese ships so having some lines about them wasnt really far fetched instead we got random hotel lines
  dont you like just about every foreign ships and few few nip ships always gushing over yamato  dont you like constantly being told that yamato is pretty dont you like repeatedly being told that yamato is strong
  basic abyssal bitch vs goddess of lewdness from the deep sea    gee i wonder
  yamato actually sank because the americans came so much on her  she was designed to only take the about 3 times the japanese loads
  goddess of lewdness from the deep sea  that describes both accurately desu
  examples
  the tastiest duck
  bb hime looks like she can gently fuck you to death the other abyssal looks like a crazy girl youd stay away from
  both look absolutely delicious
    talked like a true newfag that wasnt around for ibs
  bb hime dominates you on bed and long hoppou is for dominating theyre both amazingly delicious in their own way
  the other abyssal looks like a crazy girl youd stay away from  wrong henderson is a crazy masochistic that youd fuck roughly till your dick falls
  okay big guy tell me what did i miss out
  those two look like crazy girls wont stay away from them though
  so she likes spanking
  yes
  would play on her bongos
  
  airfield looks crazy but also cuddly somehow
  literally begging for anal
  i checked every gaijin and the only ones that mention yamatoclass are bismarck iowa warspite richie nelson and intrepid mostly just bb wank
  this basically
  airfield is too adorable to be scary she can make all the crazy faces in the world but she will always look as if she had a permanent pet me sign on her forehead
  i am a masochist myself i need a bb hime in my life
mark my words this event is going to be as easy as operation kon
  i would be happy even with a smaller abyssal being bullied by any of them would already be a bliss
  what about her and her sister at the same time
  small abyssals are for headpats no exceptions      my brain will melt and leak through my ears if these two would ever team up on me
    good stuff
  long hoppou is for dominating    she is for headpats and cuddles you fiend
  she acts evil but you dominate her with the power of the headpats and cuddling
  is this supposed to be nisshin or some weird looking shouhou or ashigara
  phoenixes dont have fangs
  is the lonely wolf
how smol is too smol
  her hair looks really dark there then
  a smol shit
  are they sitting out in the rain
  bob in charge of keeping her hair color the same through the years
  2019 will be wolf surrounded by bottles of dye and a magazine on how to attract a man
  so many smudges its like shitbafu drew this
  thought she was littorio for a second there
  its almost as if its a relatively common art style outside of anime where clarity is easier to put in motion consistently
  yeah and it looks shit
  zaras look like baby colorados
  but a lot uglier and not at all
  bitch is dyeing it isnt she
ktkm  messi  ooi  torres  abukuma  robben  yukikaze  ronaldo
  nobody cares about divegrass ttk
  fuck off
  a shit
  messi  fatnaldo/tsuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu  worth mentioning  out of here
  and then who is pogba fubuki
  kante is akashi
  that horn scares me
  based fuckofffag showing his anger at what he doesnt like
  i thought lycoris was henderson
  she is
  no one calls lycoris hendersonchan airfield hime got the nickname since 2013
  theyre both the same air field but at different times
  henderson is henderson  lycoris is henderson mark 2
i guess im going another event without zara
  zara is still not craftable going to be 2019 soon
  i know next to nothing about football but do those guys choke at the time people need them the most
  yess
3 days left and no kai ni hint kill me
  you just got makigumo and you want another already
  its gonna be mutsu with a heavy coat like nagato
  mutsu    would unironically love to see the succubus getting k2 by now
  whats the point if she doesnt look sexy
the best girl in the entire game
  same reason nagato went from slightly intimidating to silly
  thats a weird looking picture of asashio
  she is craftable i just failed like 16 times
  where i only see bongou
  maybe shell drop in the event
  she already doesnt
  yeah those k2 are somewhat boring
  its mutsu it will look sexy on her because of her succubus powers
  nah dude itll look like shit on her itll be up to fanart to make her look halfway decent
  mutsu can make anything look hot on her desu
  this
  it should
  cute cactus princess
  i hate this ill reserve judgment until the day i see it but i hate this
  what the coat or me saying shell have the coat
  the coat
  oh yeah the coat is dumb it would be dumb on mutsu and its dumb on nagato
  i would have farmed her last time but i thought it would take less resources to try to build her than it would to sortie i didnt know it was 4500 ammo and steel per try
so who should be leveled for the event  murasame for now
  all of your dds
a tug on your sleeve  see this    what do
  wasnt this posted earlier
  yes and the answer now is the same as it was then  remove glasses
im excited ive been waiting for a dd event
  kiss and then grope her butt or press my boner into her
i have a smug secretary
it feels like theres never enough time to farm back up from nothing between events
  ive been at max for a couple weeks now
i want to suck a shipgirls unwashed dick
  i want to suck and a dds clit until she pisses herself out of pleasure but i guess were both degenerates in out own rights
  how about a de instead
  i want to feed a de to my wife
  that too is another thing id love to do to a dd like yamakaze but dicks look more interesting
sneaking up on zui
  is having a towel wrapped around you a thing in japan
  would prolapse
parsleys taste in vidya is quite normalish considering he bought fallout 76
  and jiji mentioned something about artifacts
  isnt that game getting absolutely trashed by reviewers
  you should never believe reviewers nowadays
  more like its being trashed by everyone
  yup    in this case is a reviewer telling you shit tastes bad even if theyre reviewers theyre not wrong about the games quality
  you should never believe reviewers nowadays  the game is really shit and every reviewer and youtuber just following the hate train for clicks
  i meant real people reviewers not game journalist reviewers dont know how to say it
  best burgerboat 
  bad reviews are usually trustworthy its only the good ones you have to be skeptical of
  not even in top 10  pathetic
the cutest dd
    a shit
  disgusting slut
  dont forget everyone being booty bothered over a nylon bag
  fallout is not normalfag in japan its like a westerner playing dragon quest
its ok for your reliable daughter to rely on you as well
  thats really neat to think about
  thats not my daughter its my mommyyounger
  my only purpose is to rely on her for everything just to see her fail everytime and then cheer her up with hugs and headpats
    id spoil mine im on the fence on whether or not id dick them
does that compare list maker still exist
how come 72 resets again what the fuck tanaka
  not showing underwear  slut
    i want to gently raise the thunder brothers into fine young ladies then marry them
  72 resets every month
i want to fuck a destroyer
  i want them all
  ducks shouldnt be that tiny
  i want to rape kamikazes tiny body
this kaga is super adorable

    i want to mating press kamikaze until she break
  same hair as the idolmaster trap
  i already soak with who evers my secretary when im doing paper work

the reason i would use condoms is because i would fuck so many dds through out the day i will eventually chafe thats how you spread yeast infections
  but i want to soak only kamikaze in my seeds
  yes potato 02
  she was born to be a sex toilet
  i would destroy those destroyers
  any sub  neymar
  japanese are not woke when it comes to game company scumminess they enjoyed new simcity they eat up the latest battlefield they dont care as long as theyre having fun    i dunno if thats for the good or not
  this
  the good is only on the individual case as if you dont care about that shit you dont see the problem and enjoy it for the good thing  but id say its bad overall because it promotes the scummy practice of they will eat all our shit regardless which results in average game quality dropping and fucking lootbox/pachinko kinds of franchise trashing
  what a slut
  its not japan its asia in general look at the chinese and korean markets and youll see ripoffs and pay to win everywhere
  shes my slut
  why wont the japanese wake up to that realization
  well asia also has a bigger competitive market particularly in rpg kind of games and tries to improve on the current game trends which usually ends up as a repackaged version of something already done but with a new wrapper to hide it so its a bit harder to call it out
  how is it any different than western gamers    bethesda screw up obsidian on payment and royalties  bethesda is a scummy company fuck them  fallout76 is going to release  oh man i cant wait to play it on the first day  fallout 76 happened  theyre money grubbing fuckers fuck bethesda  few weeks later elder scrolls 6 new trailer came out  oh shit hype cant wait to play it    gamers are the most gullible being on the planet
  shes everyones slut

  bras on crooked just like 75 of all these poses
  i like okina threads
this is how i want to die
  noble
  this is too arousing and without using nudity
  cute
go back
maybe ask  or  instead
  please leave /jp/
confident kasen the physically fittest sage
be sure to stimulate her hair buns
physically fitest because she uses sex as a workout
  kasen is the machoest sage
physically tittiest you mean
  i wish /jp/ were nicer to kasen  when i get to gensokyo i will be sure to tell her all about /jp/ and how mean /jp/ posters called her a slut  shell make sure you all reincarnate as ants for sure
  what about the /jp/ posters who never called her a slut and was nice to her will they suffer as well
  how could that make sense unless they did other things that were worse in life
  what could be worser than being mean to kasen
  being charged for sexual intercouse with her
  she is so cute in gensowanderer  aaaah how i wish i could have a wife as beautiful wise and hardworking as her
  she is not a slut and /jp/ mostly never talked about her like that she is just too sexual for her own good
kasen has 2 threads
  shes just as sexual as any other 2hu
  she is the famous lewd pink she has the most r18 works of any 2hu based on total works
  what is it that draws so many artists to her
  the contrast of her seductive whore body and her refined personality being unwillingly sexy
  she has the most r18 works of any 2hu based on total works  correction she has the highest lewd to nonlewd porn ratio compared to any other 2hu by the numbers cirno and reimu have way way more porn than her despite having lower lewd to nonlewd porn ratios
  i cant less cirno
  those numbers are already years old though new analysis is required
  the percentages only changed by a small margin 12 and those numbers are only two years old anyway
  dont worry tireless researchers like myself are on the case
   i know she isi dont really understand why shes just as strict as shiki  cant help with that sadly   i like wholesome kasen stuff though shes my favorite 2hu
  i blame wahh and azmayas style not to mention theres a lot of subtle sideboobs in there
  you mean her horns
  i think azmayas style is cool  wahh is also comfy its the fans i dont understand
wtc5 op trailer is out    
first for paizuri
so is the main character a boy girl or who gives a fuck so long as its cute
second for dick
what is a kikonia
perfect
  a boy and a girl pretending to be one person    reverse shkanion
seems he is going for some sort of scifi military political conflict reminds me of rose gun days in a way  cant wait to see all those nice designs dying
  has been a while since i last saw a youtube video in 43 ratio
  birb
who is /gravemole/ here
  this has to be the american squad i bet theyre celebrity/idol characters that kids look up to like power rangers only theyre real and also fucking nuns
  based and nunpilled
  they are jewish probably belong to the same state/organization as thalaatha saif being middleeastern and such
  look at the font for the nun squad name
  its useless its all useless  say it in red more than 900000 jews died in the gas chambers in auschwitz
  their name is literally written in hebrew and the whole aesthetics supports this assumption even without direct usage of judaism symbols
  this but only in appearance in reality they are blood hungry psychopaths
  i get it  youre afraid if america
  anon he isnt wrong
  what the fuck have they done to wtc
  wtf have they done to wtc  theyre on a fuckin island now and theres an alternate dimension where they talk to eachother and also is magic real    they did the same thing they did last time you cretin its a different thing with connecting ideas
are we confirmed for cult based plot that last line all is in the name of guiding humanity down the right path seemed kind of suspicious
  seems plausible desu theres going to be several conspiracies at least on a national and one big global conspiracy this time around and the mystery will consist in figuring out who is plotting what with/against whom to which end
  fuck latenight posting
so is a he or a she
  ryusan is the master of copy paste
  whats that hedgehog thing on the left of them
what is umineko α alpha on the 07th expansion twitter it says saku will have the original work plus the new scenario plus α    apparently saku is called wtc4 as well
cant wait for ryukishis battle royal to btfo fate and dies irae
  its ryukishis sonic oc hes a big fan of sonic you didnt know that
ryukishi will die from overworking before 2019
    witch hunt might die from exhaustion first when you see their trackrecord  those guys barely had any break no wonder they couldnt translate hane tsubsasa and trian
  what is this shadow
  plus alpha is waseieigo it means something like something extra so a small bonus
is there a voiced version of minnagoroshi and matsuribayashi hen with english text
  dont even try to pretend like wtc5 isnt the biggest jump yet umineko is still just regular folk in a secluded mansion straight out of a traditional murder mystery novel like attwn also alternate dimensions nonsense existed in higurashi too in fact people thought bernkastel was rika and that higurashi was just a game in umineko
  not to mention the whole magic thing is somewhat similar to higurashis theme of characters believing the three families were behind oyashiros curse it was a rampant belief in the question arcs and would only get cleared up in the answer arcs much like umineko
  real grave mole nigga hours  suparna close runner up
  huge chest and smug smile  literally made for nursing handjobs
  maybe a woman with a hat on the left
  everyone got a smug smile  literally 10/10
  that one was used in higurashi already think of another one
so will this be another gameboard or will the kakeraverse be a religion and umineko was just the cults bible place your bets on the connection
  higurashi was just a game its referenced several times by the witches who took part
  why is everyone acting like wtc5 is going to be some action slut shounen    shit could be akin bladerunner or snatcher for all we know
  i think this direction makes a lot of sense for the series doesnt really make much sense in universe unless its some kind of far off future but in terms of ryukishis past works this is a step that i was kind of hoping for and expecting rose guns days had a lot of combat scenarios and ryukishi only really leaned into scifi for a few specific things in higurashi it even gives him the opportunity to create a different kind of conspiracy mystery    i simply dont know enough to decide if this really is vastly different from the previous works outside of the scifi stuff my main hope in that regard is that the setting feels special in the same way hinamizawa and rokkenjima do
  broken down moon hotel
exactly half of the teams are kette a kette is a chain presumably a team focused around supporting the main fighter
  a different kind of gameboard all combatants are pieces of different witches either one witch controlling one combatant or one witch controlling an entire team this is all just a battle royale simulator for witches
happy birthday beato
  why doesnt ryukishi write an trpg system or something similar  hell it fits in perfectly with the whole witches and pieces concept and i would love to play a gameboard with pieces across diferent fragments
  so what youre saying is wtc5 is fortnite
which ciconia would you take out on a date
  too many to bother even listing them
quick /jp/ give me a documentary on ciconias
  they are birds not cicadas cats or seacats
  they got long legs
  all of grave mole at the same time
  the only valid answer
  
storks more like dorks
    something interesting people might not know about storks which is certainly intentional is that storks dont truly have a cry the storks syrinx is almost vestigial and rather than crying they communicate and make noise by clattering their beaks together you can hear this here  the main period of vocalization is during infancy where they make crude shrill cries with their useless organs i expect some sort of duality here the storks cry when they are born natural and pristine still free of pretense but as they age they dispatch of this for the more efficient clattering which we could compare to binary or morse binary and morse both have history in military and computer use as cryptography literally pretense which helps connect the animal to the idea of rampant propaganda in ciconias world because ciphers are now used to fool everyone but the ingroup theres a real potential thematic duality between when storks truly cry as babies and when they are known to cry as impure but resourceful adults  intertextuality and hermeneutics basically do connect to epistemology closely since exegesis and reliable narrators neither exist in reality so its interesting if ryukishis new philosophy is to depict epistemological interstices through blatantly duplicitous consensus everyone outside the narrator instead of questionable narration the difference here could be if the illusion is endogenous umineko or exogenous ciconia maybe and umineko did already explore this on the side with the witch hunt consensus and episode 4s true method it would be a sensible direction to expand on what he earlier had on the side and was still timorous about
  what if hes a robot that can change genitalia hardware like you can change computer parts
wtc5
cairo squad  ryukishi writing egyptian waifus   already erect desu
  im getting so used to their hair being green its gonna be weird when it turns out its actually brown or blonde or something
  one on the left is definitely going to have blue hair
during the 07th expansion party held last year on april 1st ryukishi gave tidbits of info about ciconia one was that he was keeping the full title a secret because it gave too much away and another was that the codename is the next ____  source      very early during development he was also wondering about the level of abstraction whether it should focus on being entertaining or should be difficult to understand and cause lots of discussion on message boards      now that the title and trailer has been revealed what could the title mean how and what could it be giving away
  maybe the fact that these birds live in many different places and not just asia  
im surprised nobody has tried to theorize the meaning behind the ciconia like human babies being delivered by the ciconia/stork    this article does a nice job of summarizing the various mythologies behind it    
  but he also revealed that it would be a global story with foreign characters during that same event so it wasnt a secret  
  the speculation for that went on for a while starting from  if you forgot or didnt read it but your idea is good since ryukishi is being very deliberate with the cosmopolitan thematic significance of the stork really interesting to see what hell do with it
wtc 5 is yet another boring battle shonen in the vn format  i shouldve figured that r07 became creatively bankrupt since a long time ago it was already noticeable after bts death or the garbage that was rgd who the fuck likes to read epic battles i must probably have a garbage taste according to /jp/ but the type moonesque kind of vn never attracted me in the slightest it saddens me that ryukishi is not going to write mysteries anymore i was pretty excited when i saw the when they cry name now im disappointed
  how do you know there wont be any mystery
  i actually dont i wrote without thinking i got carried out by my emotions
  umineko is still just regular folk in a secluded mansion straight out of a traditional murder mystery novel like attwn  its easy to rewrite history in hindsight uh    you obviously werent there for uminekos episode 2 which was so far removed from anything we had ever seen and making the tea parties canon that a lot of people said wtc was broken forever the fuck is that magic the fuck are those parallel dimensions the fuck that tea party the fuck that western coating nowadays umineko is highly regarded but back then the fanbase was torn apart obvious in hindsight right    ryukishi has said numerous time that he wants to explore new things for each wtc instalment and thats why he went from higurashi eastern horror to umineko western metamurder mystery he wants to surprise readers most of all and doesnt want to retread old grounds everyone sane expected something completely unexpected for wtc 5 if only because he has explicitly told us several times that he would write something unexpected    could have been a space opera wtc could have been an isekai wtc but instead we got strike witches which is guess what unexpected kind of the fucking point kiddo
  strike witches  unexpected  kek
  youre a biology major
  its possible the mc is not the main of their kette usually the main is in the foreground and the teaser said she was second lieutenant if she were her kettes main she would be at least lieutenant i think    id wager the dude in the foreground is the main while the two warcat girls including the mc are secondaries
    hes actually so adorable
  he
  um please refer to them by their proper pronouns they/them
  damn you know so much about it already you read fight in the subtitles and it all fell into place if you question why battles are written in literature then all i can really call you is a closeminded goofball
when people say they like shion over mion are they referring to the original shion turned mion or the mion turned shion the city living shion mion or the country living mion shion
  yes
  a linguistics major with two associates law and computer science so vocal structures interest me though its also part of why i like literature umineko was clever in that its seagull cries had diegetic value but were only ever experienced nondiegetically by the reader like near the end of hope or during certain scenes outside the repeated massacre if youre still interested in uminekos use of the seagull watch chekhovs the seagull which popularized its use in arts especially similarly to umineko is how the seagulls significance changes every act sometimes an icon of hope despair death freedom peace etc really good idea to watch that if youre interested in it   i outlined its the storks relation to avian creation myths in the last thread which  supported with a link though im still interested in the greek ciconians who killed orpheus the mythic aesthete ryukishi likes using holophrasis and wordplay to permeate myriad varied themes pithily uminekocatbox seagull the sea itself all these things are important to the story and he uses yet a seemingly banal title to connect them so elegantly through wordplay which is why i can see ciconia referring not only to the bird but to the tribe of people who killed the artistic orpheus and was coincidentally returned as a swan another bird the ciconians were present as well in the odyssey and ovids metamorphoses and from the profundity of uminekos dantean motif you can be sure ryukishi has read his roman poets and watched historical plays i mean the divine comedy has ovid himself appear and draws from it throughout    but no im not a biology major though ive taken university level courses on it
  the holy agent corps is often viewed as a propaganda corps aimed at youngsters but some suspect theyre actually barrier troops  some suspect theyre actually barrier troops  barrier troops    dude
  ryukishi doing the israelis dirty
do you think all those fancy battle girls will get actual development or will they be siestad
  they seem to be equivalent to the ushiromiya main driving characters in the narrative though i guess some of them would be less developed than others hideyoshi was less developed than say eva    there are already some glimpses of sinister secrets the shavid yalda are possibly barrier troops suparna and baibao probably have a bloody rivalry going on and look at them i wouldnt be surprised if the main girls were sisters the grave mole have this whole amoral military research going on and squad 601s princess is smug as fuck
  does this one count
  isnt that one of the bitches that an heroed with zakuro
  i remember hearing that wtc5 would be umineko part 9  is this the trailer for it or is that something else
  thats umineko saku
  that era is over dude there is no way ryuukishi could keep doing time loop plots in a secluded location without it becoming stale or not reaching umineko levels of hype    this looks like wtc  rgd which is pretty fucking cool in my book
  this is the saku trailer  
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined what the fuck is this mecha futuristic garbage
  havent a lot of other visual novels done time loops now even that aspect has become overdone if someone dies in rgd you know theyre not coming back so i wouldnt be against ciconia dropping time loops to have that same level of suspense and impact im ready for ryukishis wild ride
  wtc was kinda different at least umineko i would never compare it to one of those infinity games the closest comparison is indeed forest x murder mystery
  i like the mion mion from the epilogue that loves to watch lolis bully each other and encourage it for the lulz she probably has kasai rape and kill any girl that gets close to satoshi    i bet shion shion was too much of a pussy to even escape the shitty christian school in that world so shes stuck there playing board games and being bullied by lesbians
  this after reading higurashi watched the anime first like a fool because i couldnt read english at the time i was convinced that id never like any other story more than higurashi i just couldnt imagine anything better so i had zero interest in umineko after actually reading it it blew me away    same with rgd its fantastic and i fucking love the characters but my first impressions were pretty bad the lack of ryuukishi sprites and the wildly different tone of the story made me dislike it but when i finally decided to give it a chance oh boy i wish we got a sequel or something    higanbana is pretty good too there is something about its atmosphere and short story format that feels really comfy it reminds me of how elementary school really felt at the time with the good and the bad as opposed to how the brain selectively remembers only the good bits also tons of mindbroken lolis
  if someone dies in higurashi they stay dead too i mean you get to see them again but thats a different version of them the one that got fucked stays fucked and haunts rikas memory forever while she tries to pretend that only the final world is real and everything else may as well be a dream    its even more fucked up when you realize that she and hanyuu may have been creating these worlds themselves out of the infinite sea of possibilities making them real in order to survive which means that any tragedy that happened after the original world is their fault including satokos nail torture at the hands of a psycho bitch
squad called warcat  blue color scheme  flag is a black cat    hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
  continuing from my earlier astagatyah idea which includes two specific groups garuda suparna and naga baibao of all the factions to be related it ought to be the chinese and indian ones as theyve been philosophically symbiotic for millennia anyway baibao means treasure and this is because as counterparts to the garuda their description states they and the indian/garuda group are two halves of a whole the naga is often depicted adorned with treasure/wealth/kingly status in certain asian countries naga are known for their wealth as well in fact the hindu myth naga reside in patala loka filled with treasures and riches as both their owners and guardians   we can continue this suparnas description says baibao is deified for propaganda purposes the meretricious manipulative snake is also a very common archetype in mythology and baibao is clearly the object of deceit also the japanese equivalent of the buddhist naga is the japanese dragon which is really a pirated chinese dragon and dragons are perhaps more important to the chinese than anyone else it makes sense they would be connected    lets look at grave mole now i squared this in undeniable red   its an и which is a cyrillic character russian is a cyrillic language note their name grave mole a mole often refers to a traitor in espionage tactics its someone who scouts information ahead by melding into the target group this is something the russians were famous for especially around the cold war and its something still attributed overwhelmingly to them above all else in media even now    this is right atop suparnas own symbol  compare its eyes teeth crown and straddled flares at the sides to typical depictions of the garuda in the following links       
  but as a reader you know that its not permanent because you catch on that it will reset it still leaves an impact on the characters in their story but it feels different from a character permanently dying and knowing theyre not coming back and that you wont hear from them again for the rest of the story  umineko breaks it down to the point where the family and servants are treated as pieces on a gameboard but it also cuts to how it affects ange by being a survivor and hearing about what people have been saying about her family her family is already dead and wont be coming back and what happens to them is treated like a game in the meta world so who lives or dies doesnt make a difference  im not saying that this is a bad thing it still works well and you get to see how the characters react differently to those that die or interact with those still alive but im open to seeing ciconia try something different but if time loops stay because its a staple of the series i wont cry about it either either way im curious to see how ryukishi will play with death this time
  id love to hear more from you your posts always interest me ever thought of spilling out everything in one essay
  furudo erika but with boobs
  yeah ive been posting here like crazy the last day so maybe ill just put it all together in one document instead of spamming the threads definitely read your lit and watch your plays too though its as important to be a good reader as it is to be a good writer but yeah i appreciate your encouragement i was thinking of just writing like a 100 page thesis on umineko one day but with ciconia i have to split my attention
is the word kette madeup if not what language is it from all i am getting when i look it up is a town in france
  german for chain
  why dont the ps3 character sprites ever have that gunbuster thing under the eyes its unironically my favorite thing about ryukishis art
  
i find it hilarious that ep6s plot is basically battler gets himself stuck in a room
  the amount of exposition in the trailer referring to propaganda makes me think that kikonia will be primarily about the political environment surrounding the fights it really has even more potential for mindgames than umineko
  oh if its really the case it will be nice
  battler gets himself stuck in a room  
  this is the exact same feeling im getting  something like team x has a secret mission to find out what team y is doing only to fi d out that team z has them figured out but instead of ratting them out team z is willing to help in exchange for blah blah blah then something at the festival goes wrong forcing all the teams to pick sides and play intrigue  etc etc  similar to rgd
should i read rgd where can i find it
cums
  subtlety is for a special kind of people the kind of people who give a shit bernkastel is many thing however but giving a shit she is not      i wonder if that characters name wont be something like e ricafurude knowing bern that would be right in her alley    what exactly is the nature of warcat connexion with the witch of miracles is she sponsoring the team somehow if yes is lambda sponsoring another team which one
wtf umineko anime looks like a hentai
  i hope youre watching the damedame subs
bern has no friends
  anime  not even once
  i want to meet lambdadeltas friends
  they are a type of stork just call them dorks instead
so are we really going to have to call it ciconia or stork idk it sounds weird
how is this wtc 5 ryukishi wrote higurashi which was wtc 1 and then umineko which was wtc 2 then there was rose gun days i dont get the numbers
  higurashi  wtc  higurashi kai  wtc2   umineko  wtc3  umineko chiru  wtc4
  higurashi question arc is wtc1  higurashi answer arc is wtc2  umineko question arc is wtc3  umineko core arc is wtc4
  when the dorks cry
  i see where you are coming from grave mole girls are the only ones who dont seem to have clear afillation so far and russia makes a lot of sense assuming each squad represents a distinct nation but being russian myself i can assure you that neither the font nor the letter you outlined give out an impression of cyrillic even in the slightest also its absolutely not correct for cyrillic letters to be butchered like that я isnt just reverse r its a completely different unrelated sound and they shouldnt substitute each other same with your example of v and и im sure ryukishi wont make this mistake   nonetheless ill be pumped if gm actually turn out to be russian but they might happen to belong to anyone else can as well be another japanese squad
whats the new when they cry about  a political thriller centered around a battle royale in hong kong fought between east asia africa and the middle east by aerial cyborgs featuring nuns and goth lolis to guide humanity also maybe interdimensional witches we dont know yet  east asia  any possibility the grave moles could be korea
  thats fine i understand if they simply mirrored the font though the surrounding letters theres a p right next to the n is not reversed it would certainly make the game much more interesting and suspenseful if one unknown person on any team was secretly a grave mole spy russia would also add top tier literary musical and philosophical material to ryukishis pool so id like to not be mistaken
is there a tag on pixiv for this already i wanna see if the japanese artists have gotten around to it by now
  im tired of battle royale settings and im not liking the character designs maybe it will be interesting anyway
  see  you mean save and backup because pixiv artist are all autistic fucks that randomly nuke their accounts for no reason
ange doesnt like mzakky
  i doubt its a battle royale setting from what i get all these military groups are going to go to a festival someone important is going to get murdered and then tension rises as people with guns are trying to find the culprit  but thats too simple for ryu07
  so supposing that this game happens in our world just following some alternate history    acr  africa including egypt has a royalty obviously  cou  china india possibly pakistan and the middle east has an empire  abn  no idea but deeply religious possibly linked to shavit yalda and thus jewish but maybe not possibly america or european/english state  aou  japan    the interesting pattern is that the acr and bao are both confirmed having two teams if shavit yalda is abn too which is the only other confirmed religious nation then that mean abn has two teams too which implies grave mole is probably aou japan having the military research center team is expected given the associated trope of technological superpower    i could be completely wrong of course
where can i find a copy of rgd available in english for free
   kakeraverse is a religion and umineko is the bible  how do i become a member
  dude just download the patch from witch hunt and apply it to the japanese version    dont trust some random uploader to prepatch the game for you they may accidentally fuck something up or delete a file or who knows what
  ugh reminds me when i unwittingly watched haruhi in chronological order ill never forgive that person
  what do you mean chronological order timeline wise inuniverse who the fuck would force someone else to watch it like this instead of the release order
  in universe and youd be surprised
  abn is most likely middle east
  hmm i can see a vague reference to galidor there
cant wait for ryukishi to blow my small mind again
  at least he wont be blowing your small dick
  the characters could still do it yet
i have noticed a pattern   aou  warcats and grave mole i dont know what they have in common  acr  squad 601 and cairomemorialsquad both african  cou  suparna and baibao idk theyre next to each other in the map and share a good amount in common  abn  thalaatha saif and shavit yalda both middle eastern both holy and religious  this also makes sense because in each two teams one of them is a kette team   and the order theyre shown in the trailer supports my theory even though im not quite sure thats relevant   this makes me think grave mole are korean
  suparna and baibao are both said to be in the cou so its not pure speculation same goes for squad 601 and cairomemorialsquad grave mole and shavit yalda are the only ones not assigned
mc looks like japan from hetalia   wtc5 confirmed hetalia
  i dont see what youre seeing at all
    she does share a thing with og bernkastel to be specific her hair seems to be an asymmetrical himecut if not tied just like bernkastel in the og sprites
  color palette and hair desu
  okay you are genius lambdaposter and im fucking retarded i didnt notice the letter on logo you pointing out to which is actually behind grave mole now im 99 that letters covered by title are cyrillic and they read as герои which directly translates as heroes doodled how i see them i think this is a direct hit guys
  now im 99 sure fuck im so excited i cant read my own posts
  which if we go with the pattern that there are two teams for each country and warcat and grave mole are together into the aou would make the mcs empire either russian or russojapanese    which isnt far fetched remember the russojapanese war maybe in that world japan won and created the russojapanese empire of aou
  it isnt even that farfetched today because putin is preparing to resolve the historic dispute and transfer the part of kuril islands back to japan jurisdiction under the agreement of following economic cooperation
  i considered that but i dont see how a giant robot arm can be in a supportive role unless they gattai i was thinking that if someone else really was the main figure then there would be a route/episode where they die and cravatkun would take over
  or cruelly killing off a character a character that youve become heavily invested in doubly so if there isnt any kind of time loop shenanigans
  i would bet that each different section involves a different team winning the battle royale and then time shenanigans happen and they try again
  
  right of course a propaganda group would be venerated as heroes before the public its important to remember propaganda has fundamental psychological roots so that its something all sides do   ussr actually excelled at this the maternal country to which the people are inherently beholden to which bears their labor and fruit both spiritual in form and the paternal stalin to which the people were externally beholden to because federal wellbeing is always cooperative along all organizational strata consituents to enterprises to governments physical in form the familial rhetoric was pushed with zeal and eventually even the soldiers would be the objects and victims of propaganda    one of the most exciting aspects of a cosmopolitan setting is doubled by 07th expansions talenter composers that the musical boon of the setting is every region getting its cultural/folk music represented is then further tripled by them because they understand music not only as music but as expression and exhibition here this means well have a wide set of music from across the world but also composed well composed tastefully with the story and intertwined with the rest of the soundtrack leitmotif for example i imagine well have one or two signature melodies composed in many different cultural musical forms mainly looking forward to indian in this case
  there are 8 teams too 8 teams 8 episodes
higurashi is seriously spooking me out lads  still on the first chapter though its much better than uminkeo so far
  dont know why i hadnt made that connection in my head already its only super obvious and right in front of me
  stop reading these threads people will post spoilers all over the place and they have every right to do so
  aou is not just japan going by the dialog at the start of the trailer hopefully usa is in it instead of shavit yalda fuck
  hope you will like it
will wtc5 be released in eng any time soon
rika kills everyone
  untranslated wtc5 will be released in summer 2019 the translation will take about 4 to 6 months
  even me
  even the cicadas
  she killed millions of unborn babies
  those werent going to be babies
  barrier troops    hello
  anon girls can only get triplets at best
  i want to have babies with rika
  id say even more military propaganda is one of the pillars of peace and stability in russia nowadays according to the latest census army is the only state institute that retains high level of peoples trust with all other governing institutes and president himself losing like crazy after the recent sequence of unpopular reforms to keep populace minds off shit economic and all other fundamental problems government drags the country in all sorts of military conflicts praising armys deeds and achievements honouring research and development of military tech again this is whats happening right now its honestly terrifying and exciting how real ciconia can get with all this real life baggage
are the credits in meakashi still fucked up after a year or did they fix it
  aou is probably russojapanese all the other teams are paired except grave mole and warcat which have both animal names and grave mole is 100 russian if warcat is japanese then aou is russojapanese
  fuck
anyone notice the order the teams are revealed in the trailer is kette followed by non kette four times  that might be relevant
  kette non kette kette non kette and so on
  theyre all paired ie two for each nation one kette and one nonkette and the kette is always presented first
  i thought they were all kette
  im very aware of putin attacking some of his own oligarchs only five to twenty years ago and even assassinating boris berezovsky for fair opposition towards him the country is spellbound and its a shame because it has tremendous christian and artistic value like its really almost peerless in these things and yeah military propaganda is the name of the game this time im glad i was able to reveal grave moles countrydiscuss baibao and suparna but im going to sleep now    remember to read your borges
what if bern and lambda are boys this time around
  oh noes i hope they remain cute fuckable girls
  bern and lambda are concepts    concepts dont have genders silly
im going to have to spend 46 months not posting on /jp/ at all until the english translation releases  i want to kill myself and yet i cant because otherwise i cant read wtc5
  yet concepts have tits
  cant say much about lambda but bern definitely started as girl
  theres still about half a year until it comes out
    do you ever wonder why translators for indie and aaa games both dont work with the script writers so that the translation can come out as soon as the game does in its home country i havent looked into gamedev at all so if theres someone more informed than me that can explain it id appreciate it
  youre afraid of cute fuckable boys coward
  game scripts i can understand and they usually do to my understanding    but vns/books definately notnot even feasible
  have some baseless thoeries assuming there is a battle royale going on  cairo  loli is the mastermind behind the group even if the girl on the right pretends to be the leader loli is evil/insane and bullies the girl in the middle  girl in the middle eventually betrays the loli and causes her death  baibao  jobbers die the first  601  the underdog will start off weak but will end up being one of the strongest factions later on due to sheer keikakus  shavit yalda  everyone will think they are evil and barrier corps but eventually will get revealed to be good people  expose thighs  one of them will mention sister dlanor/gertrude/cornelia as a reference  grave mole  are really deep into the conspiracy surrounding the events that will happen around episode 6 they will get more focus and start revealing stuff  thalaatha saif  loli is the maria/satoko of the vn will have a sad backstory  either rivals or allies of the warcats  suparna   the ones to kill baibao  warcats  the main squad but one of them is a traitor
  ryukishi actually hasnt even written the story yet for wtc5    he posted the trailer that only revealed the characters and cast so that he could spy on threads like this for ideas
  the translators witch hunt started out as fan translators i think they just want to experience the vn as ryukishi intended for his fans and not get spoiled
  aesthetic
  games dont have much text compared to visual novels thats why they take less time to translate  wtc 5 also isnt even done yet and knowing ryuukishi07 the script will change on a daily basis meaning thats impossible to translate it together while he works on it
  i mean they did make siesta 410 a dude name alan in rgd he was pretty chill tho but yeah
  wtc5  it will be a gameboard it will involve witches both bern and lambda will be back  this is exactly why im not worried about whether itll be good or not
  i want him to fuck me in the ass with his chin
  i will fuck you in the ass with my chin
  bbro
    i wasnt impressed at first but now you are getting me excited the wait is now getting unbearable thanks to you
  reading you guys talk about it is making me feel shallow since im just looking forward to playing the qt mc
  brainlet here i feel just like you i hate not being able to have a better understanding at things that i love
mark my words at least one episode of wtc 5 will finish with the end of the human race all the countries nuking each others into oblivion
  everyones got their own way of enjoying the thing if you cant theorize based on a single trailer it doesnt mean you dont have a brain it just means thats now how you process content  besides im sure that most of what theyre discussing could be entirely wrong as well  and im actually just here for the porn
  a boy is fine too
i want to retrieve the mackerels that i left behind bernkastel help me
  thats probably just how the ending is just like how in rokkenjima they all get bombed and in hinamizawa they all die of a disease or whatever cant recall
dunno if anyone found it out yet but what was the language spoken over the radio in the kikonia trailer
  simlish probably doesnt sound like anything
  the fact that asses can be fucked is pretty lewd because rena has one
  ass is for poop onlyanon
  ive always considered myself a piece of shit
i did better outline of cyrillic letters on grave mole title card theres also a letter on the right which appears to be ю so the whole deal spells as герои ю not enough to guess the second word but ю reads as yu or u which might be somewhat tied to u in aou abbreviation this is exciting
  was about to post this
  grave mole is the best team  but warcats has the best individual furudo erika
does a cat on warcats flag hold а banner/scythe on its back does it have greek letters on it  or am i just seeing things
  who is blessed by certainty
cuando las cigueñas lloran
what nationalities are all the teams supposed to be
nuns are my fetish thank you for delivering ryukishi    we dont know but were trying to guess
  good job it is indeed a fucking scythe    see  and warcat has really been blessed by miracles
  some are pretty obvious like cairo memorial squad being egyptian the rest not as much im betting that the nun team are italians and that squad 601s princess is some sort of indian oil baroness
  what if they are boys girls boys  as a joke
  original ange is a chubby girl
  601s princesses name is south african
ange
  yeah you might be on something  its seems heroes of yu  in russian there not so many catchy words or titles started on ю  maybee south юг
    as i understand the current  leading theories are someone please make a map    acr africa squad 601 south africa and cairo egypt  abn middle east saif saudi arabia and shavit yalda israel  cou india and china suparna india baibao china  aou russojapanese warcat part japanese grave mole russia    europe and the americas are suspiciously absent maybe they are bundled into one of the existing empires or maybe they were nuked long ago or dont participate or participate but we dont know their teams or something
  what makes you think saif is saudi arabia
  nothing thats why i put  they are probably part of the middle east but if an anon could pinpoint it more accurately maybe by using etymology thatd be great
  i think we basically know them all by this point
  thats pretty much the consensus right now i think  the nuns might be israeli
  what if each team is governed by a witch in this case thered be more new witches
  la condición humana de ushiromiya ange
  but where is the finn  while we are at it where is the rest of europe  did it get fucking nuked or are there more characters and squads left
  i have a sneaking suspicion that in this wtc theyll be referring to witches as angels
  i think it might be a coalition of east powers  africa in a world thats split between east and west
sum of digits in number 34 equals 7  sum of digits in number 601 equals 7  coincidence
  oh boy here we go
  native arab here i dont think thats possible their name is written in standard arabic and thus doesnt indicate anything of significance thalaatha saif means three swords but its written in somewhat broken arabic the teams logo also has three different looking swords perhaps each type unveils something about the three characters
  what if hes in the russian team
  by the way shavit yalda is hebrew
  i would say it was a coincidence if i didnt know that lambdadelta is actually capable of being subtle    like bern just slap her fucking black cat and her fucking scythe and selfinsert into her favorite team she doesnt intellectually get the subtlety concept    but lambda is slick i dunno maybe try to connect the dots
  the reason for broken arabic is most likely due to wh having to work with no context and using google for the non jp translations
  mitake miyao sounds like a combination of tomitake and miyo
  yeah i get that i dont really blame them
  they admitted on twitter that theyre open to any suggestion from native speakers of the languages
  tnen why russians in there they knda prowest country also their alliance with japanese kinda unusual
saudi arabia does have a sword in its flag so maybe
  russia and china are much closer politically than russia and the west
  also their alliance with japanese kinda unusual  not if you look at it geographically japan and russia already had a pretty vicious war before the world wars the russojapanese war in an alternate history kind of world or in the future it isnt impossible to think that both unified into a unique compound    maybe one invaded and captured the other either russia invaded japan or japan invaded and kept russia
  with china yes but not with japan  also im from there nobody care about china everybody still fapping and clinging on europe despite current conflicts
  i got struck with an idea that digits in 601 might refer to the power levels of members according to description its a oneman ace kette so comparatively to others their princess has an immense power level of six while dudes in hers escort are supporting weaklings of zero and one and you know what making such a frontloaded team sounds like lambdadelta to me
  also maybe russians just outside bystanders their unit is researchers after all
  prowest  conservatives have for centuries now hammered in the talking point of were not like everyone else were special and need a special third way that is neither asian nor european  also some people who seem to have personal vendetta against the west love looking up to china  or maybe for some reason that region is only allowed one team and has to pair up with another country who happens to be japan
every foreign text has been translated so far except this sanskrit/hindi/whatever  anyone got an idea of what this means does wtc not have any indian fans
  is that like the public opinion because how i see it according to the sinorussian relationship wiki and the multiple proxy wars between russia and us and the looming financial tug of war between china and us i cant help but to picture russia as an enemy of the west if war was to break out
  forgot about this
i want a lee meijiu expy
wtc5 gonna be /pol/
  sad but true  i can already see the freedom aint free and remove kebab wtc5 edits
  wtc6 will be /tv/ like poetry
  i cant wait
  i have no idea why he said that i agree with you
    probably its bait so its like this one is bern self insert and the retard catgirl is bait i totally see bern doing this
as a teaboo the lack of britain disappoints me
  bern pulling the hurrr im retarded look at me trick   classic
  its boring so its plausible coming from her remember she is boring unimaginative to be funny
  i have confirmed that this is hindi apparently it says suparna but its misspelt suparna refers to hindu goddess parvati but it also can mean beauty thats what i was told by native indian
you are now aware over half a year will pass before we get any more stuff to analyze
  there might be more trailers not sure
  who knows we might get more promotional videos
  who knows might die from an accident before it comes out
do you think this has some significance  baibao  background girl has a wing on her neck  601  mole  are those wings on their clothes  saif  guy has a threewinged pendant  suparna  girl in the foreground has a twowinged or is it a wreath brooch on her collar and a crisscrossed wings mark or are those swords  everyone else has nothing
  im a fat fuck the desire to not die of a heart attack before this comes out motivates me to work out
  /tv/  i cant wait for ryuukishi to go full cunny and do wtc  higanbana
  you are a big witch for you
  stereotipical russian hate americas but worship and envy civilized europe also doesnt fuck about asians and nergos at all  and yeah china is ally but you know its china most terrifying country in whole world
  lots of wings and stars
  based and deathpilled
wtc5 has diversty and representation of minorities
  dude not to be rude or anything but you need to work on your english also stop being a melkobukvennyi
  guess what they will all probably die  all are equal in death
  the more i think about it the more i see something about it    3  4  7  6  0  1   7    3 and 4 are both in the middle of the range 6 and 1 are both literally at the extremities if you wanted to do something different but still connect the numbers thats be the number youd choose    additionally the 601 squad is a big power trip for an arrogant girl that is a princess a cute princess with a big ego and all it makes a surprising amount of sense the 6  0  1 squad with the cutest super princess of the world theres something distinctly lambda about it
  you could say that the great equarizer iz za des
  heh i know this is why i shitpost on 4chan
guys i swear warcats flag has δχ written on the scythe  δ  delta  tell me you see it
  sorry im only seeing noise
  you should get a screenshot and circle it
  and then been is just extremely blatant dude cats and scythes lmao chuuniboy girl miyao introduced with dramatic fall from the skycraper and also lets have a big boobied clone of myself because tits have always been rikas biggest complex
  δ  delta  oh shit  i dont see it at all
  oh my god youre right about the skycraper thing that was my first thought when i saw that but it didnt cross my mind again since then
this thread rn  yes yes tumblr filename i googled the image etc
  frederica bernkastel is the girl who selfinserted a clone of herself called furudo erika into a story shes not a girl who really believes in the virtues of being subtle    for all her boisterous personality lambdadelta is far more subtle in her callbacks and you actually need to think about wordplays and maths to catch her
  its a long time since i had speculah of that level brought back some good memories that said now that weve solved the teaser im going to bed
is there any chance the voice in the pv was reversed
  these are on cairos badge it could actually be a very important clue because while you have the obvious sun god it seems there are two or three birds atop the sun horus is an avian god of the sky and this iconography birds in the sky could refer to him but it could also be thoth instead thoth is the avian egyptian god of writing which he created  and wisdom but most interestingly of the moon the lunar archetype a harbinger of illusion and uncertainty and of magic which has axiomatic importanceーi dont have to explain it he is also always depicted with ra who represents the sun thoth is credited with writing the eponymous book of thoth it outlines the highest egyptian understanding and is considered sacred and it served as a formative text for magic so that hermeticism and occultism are based majorly upon it beyond magic thoth is known as the mediator of godly disagreements meta battles and the archiver of history keeping records of everything that passes including the judgments of those who have died he wrote the book of the dead which is the ancient egyptian guide to achieving an optimal afterlife and funeral performance but its mostly a book of spells   thoth was famously turned into hermes by the greeks who represents many of the same things and most importantly storytelling and negotiation hermes trismegistus one of the main figures in magic is considered an equivalent to hermes and thoth specifically and theyve altogether had immense alchemical influence being connected to the metal and planet mercury     ill put it forth i think by humans witches will be referred to as gods in this game there is no other term so intuitively connected to the highest metaphysical entities that everyone from any country would plausibly use and witches in wtc are functionally identical to gods to those who exist below them and that was even a major point of featherines comparison to normal witches and voyagers comparative religion finds archetypal gods throughout cultures as ive mentioned so that the same god can be worshipped by different people with only the inessential name tag differing      it actually is super exciting because this can go over so many incredible literary and mythological stories here will also looking into both macrosocial and microsocial ecosystems in an interesting way ryukishi has the potential to do something very very ambitious with this if he takes advantage of the breadth and depth of art and story these cultures have and comparative anthropology and religion are like my favorite subjects ever which this is ideal for it can be something really excellent hes making wittgenstein proud for flaming frazer        yeah theres nothing to feel bad about if you dont think you can find anything keep in mind im studied in this stuff anyway so ill just notice it wherever i see it while an untrained eye will see mundanity if you love it then youll try your best to understand it all and find things and ill help you along the way in return
  also 601s clothes all have feather motifs look at the dress and then look at eva and beatrices dresses
  rgd had a lot of pol topics without being as retarded as pol
lambda impersonated a god of one of those people im feeling it
  lambda more like allahmbda
bernkastels witnesses
no ones called someone else a faggot in this thread im really enjoying the harmony  keep being heartwarming you glorious bastards
  lion is a faggot
  youre a faggot
that wings and feather stuff might really just be because ryukishi is an amateur artist and doesnt have that many ideas when decorating clothes
  dont think of a pink elephant you faggot
  why state the obvious about other posters
ange is a mammal
  im a faggot
  gay
ange has a reproductive system
okay another point of speculation we know how much ryukishi likes fucking with numbers so what about numbers each squad has attached to them   601 has already been talked  warcat  0017th the most curious one  grave mole  100th  thalaatha  0901st  shavit  012th  cairo  1st  suparna  301st  i dont see any number on baibao card but theres an interesting bit suparnas description theyre more than strong enough to be serve as baibaos other half what can be another half of 301  autistic numerology go
  youre one to talk
    also look how smug is rethabile about her number its like shes saying check those digits pal
  ill have you know ive jerked it to gay stuff only a handful of times
higurashi  0 wings no flying  umineko  1 wing flying used symbolycally  ciconia  2 wings physically flying
  you have to be this tall to date me
  now im 100 convinced its lamda
  blacked hahahha
lambda is transracial
lambda is chocolate flavored
lambda is my girlfriend
lambda is cute
yo lambda is  not erika 
  meanwhile bern still hangs out exclusively with japanese people  now thats what i call unwilling to leave the comfort zone
  berns final solution
  601  the words of goddess
  prove it
  unwilling to leave the comfort zone  thats bern
lambda is preparing to trap bern in a new game      012 adds up to three which in gematria kabbalahistic numerology is signified by the third character gimel it also refers to the conciliation of dialectics teaching blooming and youth and leading gimels sephirotic place is the path between keter and tiferet passing through daath the invisible process of godly to abstract tiferet is the sephirotic nexus all other nodes are adjacent to it  on sephira three also refers to binah the divine feminine  as well hebrew characters correspond to the tarot and gimel the path from crown to beauty corresponds to the high priestess major arcana ii but actually iii because we start counting from 0 the fool high priestess imagery is pretty blatantly superimposed atop shavit and considering ryukishi has read goetia it might be plausible to say he knows some extent of kabbalah or gematria which of course is the tome of the highest hebrew metaphysics and magics its contents so grand and lavish as to be ineffable for human minds
  how do i get on your level intellectually because im too dumb of ass and i dont like it
  thats what i thought but the shapes im seeing are just so nice i have to wonder    sorry mobile platform ive done what i could
  love this lambdaposter are you that anon that was desperate with paranormal related to umineko and stuff
  lambda qi more stuff related with probability and statistics from this cute witch
  either this guys pulling shit out of his ass or hes got very extensive knowledge of mythology everyone has different interests just so happens that his interests help him analyze the themes if you had a phd in computer science i doubt you could do what he does and that is okay
  lets play a game anon  601  0017  100  0901  012  1  301  remove all the 0 and add the digits then their sums  7  8 15  1 16  10 26  3 29  1 30  4 34    haha lambdas orchestrating it all yet again lambda almost always wins      ill help you if youre actually willing to put the effort into understanding these things so many people just want to posture and spew polemics about arts they refuse to invest any time or heart in any its such a turn off but then you meet the few who dazzle with the rare glint in their pupil those are the people worth socializing for who find universality light in the particles roaming the abyssal currents      im never desperate ive been around since april so yeah my identity ought to be distinct from them by now mainly into /lit/ and dharma stuff
  i posted some autistic shit before on seacat threads and there was this anon that said something about that so desperate about the true meaning of the nature of reality but kept going because of umineko or something
  haha lambdas orchestrating it all yet again  thats a nice find but also again what about baibao number
  not him but for mythology id suggest reading actual mythology  like pick a clture find their creation myth or anything else you like and start reading every time you see a new name  look it up and read texts about them  as you learn more read commentaries from experts on the subject dont forget the depictions  you might find it boring at first but youll see the charm of it soon
  its not just about interests of course since cognitive ability does vary up to orders of magnitude between different people so itll be that plus interest and effort i like literature and philosophy and magical and religious systems are a philosophical razor so i like them too except they double with iconographic literary artistry its all for the sake of universality which is why i also study things like linguistics computer sciences and thereby automata semantics extents of biology    i considered that but its likely deliberate that they were the only ones with zero numerical representation even squad 601s is their name instead of their title but its all the numerology they decided to  share this time baibaos name isnt numerical and its title is uniquely imperial which i imagine could make them either lack a number or have it be zero    and yeah this is why i keep telling you guys to read i say it all the time if you want to have a full understanding of literature you consume and degust and compare literature with opulence religion with opulence mythology with opulence occultism with opulence it really is all about willpower if youre competent which is why i like helping people since they stop being so unsure of themselves and learn valuable wisdoms and half the value of wisdom is for it to be passed along
  601  0017  100  0901  012  1  301  adding down by placement11 10 5 8 111058    61  17  1  91  12  1  31  adding down by placement zeroes removed 22 12 2212      601  0017    100   0901   012    1    301  adding down by digit 22 9 3 2293    61  17   1  91  12   1  31  adding down by digit zeroes removed 20 14 2014    adding the numbers together will obviously always equal 34 but being bored and having fun thinking of dumb shit that will 999 of the time have no meaning behind it is my shtick
j u s t i c e
  cicada 3301 if you add 301 you get for and get 34
  i made it more apparent for you      yeah its fun and if baibao is truly zero or has no number then it suddenly becomes even more deliberate by lambda actually if you guys are right that squad 601 belong to lambda then it would make sense theyre the only ones whose title number prevents the total from adding up to 34 since it would be 27 and their vital 7 is in their name this might also be deliberate
this guy
  urusai
  me in the back
  me climbing the wall in the midst of a storm in the dead of the night
  im a shutin and this motivates me to get my life together
    i thought we were all both of these things except for lambda anon who is literally lambda
  get a job where youll spend most of your time active endorphins and shit
no zts    im actually hurt and worried
  and more  have hope anon
  no 45  stupid fuck tried to change hobby into drawing instead of staying in music
the scyscrapers are intentionally made to remind the city of books
  truth be told dumb of ass anon was none other than myself being a bit more blunt than usual about my lack of knowledge outside of a very specific domain i know shock and appall at this surprising and dramatic revelation which isnt surprising or dramatic at all ive definitely got that spark in my eyesif i didnt then by now ive smashed wood and rocks together until i ignited it myselfbut my brains wired in a way that makes it a bit of an uphill battle i suppose in other words im waging war against my nature as a dumbass the good fight theres a reason the sects now known as gnosticism believed that the climb into the world of ideas was so arduous but this isnt my blog so ill refrain from turning it into more of a blog post    ive compiled myself a reading list based on what ive seen you mention going through archived threads while sick any additions youd recommend  pnin vladimir nabokov  invitation to a beheading vladimir nabokov  ficciones jorge luis borges  tlön uqbar orbis tertius jorge luis borges  an examination of the work of herbert quain jorge luis borges  the library of babel jorge luis borges  death and the compass jorge luis borges  the golden bough james george frazer  remarks on frazers golden bough ludwig wittgenstein  philosophical investigations ludwig wittgenstein  the world as will and representation arthur schopenhauer    thanks for the reminder earlier to read your borges by the way my copy of ficciones arrived today and its a bit more difficult than it normally would be since i managed to catch yet another cold but thats life
  hhow can i surely he would be included in the credit here _
  not him but if you like nabokov and postmodernism read pale fire too its hella good
i began to think why does man have no end to his desires how can i wish for anything more than this palace of dreams    im saddened by the thought of man having no end to his desires
is humiliation cute
  reminded that ryukishi isnt writing the script only the scenario and designs nakao boshi is writing the script
  what the actual literal fuck as opposed to figuratively
  but is that neverending dream not a beautiful one
  sorry to give you the bad news
    i thought ryukishi was the scenario writer and boshi was the director
      basically doing exactly what jun maeda started doing at key during rewrite in charge of overall scenario but not script
  you thought right
      no zts  no 45  ryu isnt writing     uh oh
    when the fanbase cries
  who even is that person
  i think that might be a translation issue the scenario writer is what we call the author the one doing the script the director creates the script file ie placing the character sprites and backgrounds in the script file for each line think script like in scripting language not manuscript
  oooohhhh  ok thats better but still  no zts  no 45
  implying isnt some elaborate troll as well
  whats important is that you put forth a great effort when a goal comes in sight never meandering and never hesitating true willpower is the strength to act when and how you must decisively and efficiently with a boundless wellspring of resolve  borges ficciones contains all the short stories you listed so dont worry about them you have them and yeah read schopenhauer and his essays then wittgenstein also is correct but pale fire is his most immense work its his magnum opus and its very difficult for most people but its structure is special and it does metalepsis well which umineko also does though ive never discussed it here the artistry prose and poetry in it are also incredible      remember man can do as he wills but he can not will as he wills pic related is the image i usually refer third time in these threads to when people bring your plight up starting from the pink lines what do you think
  mion shion is the pushover tomboy what a pathetic human
  well said so long as my actions match my resolve im sure i can succeed ive added pale fire to the end of this reading list once ive finished this batch ill move onto some more classical works dante homer virgil and ovid probably in that order       as moreorless stated in the picture lambdaanon posted will is a fire thats never satisfied and constantly begs for more fuel but in turn burns on radiantly so basically 
its confirmed that mion and shion have a hairy green 80s bush
  白豹 white leopard
so we have  warcats nips love kitties  gravemole russian heroes  white leopard remote reference to baihu/byakko although it is supposed to be a tiger  suparna the other name of garuda the legendary bird in the indu legends  thalathat suyuf three swords  yaldat shavit comet girls)))  squad 601  cairo memorial squad    so only the acr squads have mundane names it seems
soon enough you wont be able to come here after it being a daily routine for years because japanese only spoilers will be everywhere  ill miss you guys
ryukishi isnt writing the script  welp
  see 20338081
  he is
kvm
  id hope so
  i know youll come back and ill be sure to spoil you every little juicy detail thats what you get for believing in magic
  do you think battler has a tight anus just asking for a friend
  he does but i bet you can fix that for him  fucking degenerate fag
umineko and higurashi take place in the 80s  its extremely likely that all the women got a full bush why does all the art have them completely shaved lile some loli i want to see mion and natsuhis 80s bush
well at least it wont turn shit midway this time around since his friend is already dead  it will either be good or bad from the start to the end    considering it releases with english included how will they sell it overseas  gog steam physically
  they all follow a same pattern obviously    the acr squads have down to earth names the abn squads have cool names translated into their own languages the cou squads have mythic names while the aou names are in english and about animals
  what about ange did she shave her anus and pussy
hahahahahahahaha how the fuck are zoos real hahahaha animals just break the fence like just jump over it or break the glass with a rock haha
  wh only translated the pv they didnt receive the script so expecting the game to have english right from the get go is a bit too much
  bitch ur the zoo animal
wypypo got btfo out of wtc5
  ryukishi isnt writing the script  still drawing the characters  peter griffin out
  where do you guys get that idea from
  thanks based anon  there might be another delta in the beginning and one more letter behind the c
the new character from umineko saku is bernkadelta an oc i submitted to r07 a long time ago during one of his qas she is more powderful and strength than both berkanstel lambodelta and figurine combined she was born after feeding erikas corpse to a seagull her powers are solving every mystery even the ones from scooby doo and can use red truth for things that arent true
i hope this is shonen battle royale because the magical battles in umineko really turned me on

sayo cant refuse to anal  sayo has a low self esteem  lewd
  nothing personnel
  nigger not only are you buying into secondhand info which a smart person should never do ever but you can literally translate any of his tweets and still get the gist of how hard hes been writing
someone post that picture of lambadelta talking about how she doesnt like thinking
  this  how did people even get through umineko with this level of reading comprehension
bring back the detective
is there any app or site that can generate umineko screenshot    this one seems broken generate doesnt do anything
  that one has a history of being problematic but it can still work try it with different browsers
  crap i dunno if i did something wrong but even with just the background set i have absolutely nothing with firefox chrome and edge
the umineko screenshot generator was the best did the japanese have one of their own that still works    i remember when ep7 was still untranslated and ep8 had just been released in japan the threads were full of fake screenshots fake ep8 characters and fake spoilers in japanese
pic related is important to this and i somehow forgot that ra is also depicted as an avian deity   here you see ras crown a five sided shape with a five pronged flare which only appears atop a sun ra is the god of the sun covered by birds ra is an avian god above a distinct pyramid with a crest pointing upward ra was worshipped with special pyramids let it be known that the modern heliopolis center of ra worship is currently in cairo and the only other time the crown appears is with cairos very own partner rife with feather avian imagery and too at the top of their crest    heres something super interesting too warcats supposed bernkastel incarnation might just be a red herring ive outlined in perfect red arcane similarities between cairos central figure and bernkastel she has cat ears vertical feline pupils nobody elses are nearly as oval and her gloves are meant to look like cats paws also notice how similar her dress is to bernkastels a cool bow mantled by a white frilled plate the dress is a dark color and has a similar shape to bernkastels her short black puff shoulders followed by white frilled sleeves substituted by the new characters identical puff shoulders and white cuffs this might follow what i said in this second paragraph  egyptian gods including ra often came to be as felines as well and so witches may truly be venerated as and dubbed gods in this story
  also forgot to mention this might not invalidate warcats bernkastel avatar but mean every participating witch controls multiple factions or maybe bern and lambda are just both using four against each other
what if warcats flag is just erica being a fangirl
what kind of bern is this
  thats super bern

i wonder if people will finally get used to the original art after following wtc5 from the day of release i cant imagine people shitting on it the moment a soulless version is released especially if theyve been exposed to the original during four whole years or whatever    its been scientifically proven that every ps3fag with an iq over 120 eventually warms up to the old art and grows out of their shit taste only to see new fans fall into the same old trap
  i like ryukishis art but at the same time i do have a soft spot for the ps3 art
  i like it too it looks really good    i just dislike how people immediately dismiss the original art without a second thought the moment they decide to read higurashi or umineko even though it objectively provides a better and more charming experience free of poorly recreated facial expressions cringy cgs ridiculous perspectives sterile backgrounds etc all because the fans encourage them to patch the game
new thread      
  fuck off we have to go until archival ffs dont prematurely kill this shard moron
  i followed umineko during its initial run and still prefer the ps3 art
  there is nothing really wrong with the ps3 art but you have to admit that the intended experience is hurt a bit by the ps3 graphics they make the novel slightly less immersive and a bit more awkward especially those super clear and crispy backgrounds that look boring as hell and make it way too obvious when images are recycled for different locations like the phones or chain locks
  i like the backgrounds it feels much more detailed like a lot of work was put into each and every one meanwhile the original backgrounds while doubtlessly having their own aesthetic feel more like a budgeting decision than anything
  the cgs are my main problem with the ps3 art  a la ugu creepy maria faces
  also my main issue i dont like most of the design changes no battler tan and i still love the originals far more than the ps3 but the cgs are what actually kill it for me i hate the cutin thing they do the fact that more than half of the cgs have a wavey energy effect in the background i could go on really but there are a select few extremely strong cgs that most people already know of
  i like most of them as standalone art but i dont like them randomly showing up in the novel    its the equivalent of the screen fading to black for a random encounter in some rpg and having the battle take place in its own pocket universe where the characters sprites are vastly different from the ones in the overworld it requires a bit of abstraction which isnt a problem at all but its definitely a change from the original cgless umineko experience
  just tossing ideas around but the thought came to me about editing manga panels to use in place of the ps3 cgs or even editting the script to add more in various places hell even thought of what itd be like to create original cgs using ryukishis original artstyle  could even do something along  the lines of a berserk redux and try to combine ps3 original and pachinko along the lines of what is most faithful to the text

why doesnt /jp/ give him the respect he deserves
sekibanki thread    kagerou wakasagihime and kogasa are not welcome here
more like secondarybanki
is sekibanki the most spankable 2hu or has she been replaced
  there will never a sekistory
  theres a fucking fangame about sekibanki getting spanked why not a story
    whats stopping you from just writing a story
  im an esl and last time i tried writing a fanfic people chased me out of the website
  taking sekibanki on a romantic date under the full moon  spanking her in the dead of night
  im an esl and ive written sekistories youre just a slacker
  writing a normal story about sekibanki and writing a story where she get her ass smacked are two different things
i want to gorilla glue sekibankis head back on while she is sleeping
  i would write a story about sekibanki but im not into spanking so im not sure if it would be the kind of thing you would want
  frankly at this point just a story of sekibanki and you on a date would do it reached a point where it transcended lust
  ill write something short and sweet no smut then i have a lot of experience with technical/academic writing but not much with creative writing and ive been wanting to get some practice
  go for it ill try to have some sekibanki spanking going
mfw i said no kogasa in the op  still ended up posting her  shamefur dispray
  ill write something short and sweet  please dont sekibanki is for grump not for flanderising with generic romance
  but a nice date with a grumpy girl is cute  especially if her tsundere tendencies are done right
  i too admire bankis posterior
  pretty
sneaking on sekibanki as she sleeps  dragging her body away
  i want a game where i romance sekibanki must be real fun to get to know that sarcastic loner cutie
i want to put it in
  what do you mean
going out with sekibanki  date drags out to the evening  suddenly she says oh by the way im a youkai  you smile  she wakes up next morning turn around see you  you smugly smile and say i eat youkais
im the armored youkai and shes the colossal youkai
  youll understand when youre older
  and then it ends with sex
  what do you think happened during the night anon  why do you think she cant sit anymore
  lies she likes spankings
  your desire to spank the bank over the years has become a thing of legend at least tater is a little safer because of it
how did banki become the go to spankhu over the years anyway is it because of her short skirt and top tier thighs and ass    this post preapproved by 4channelllc advertising relations team
  just a little bit      small cute chuuni lives in the human village so more likely to adopt human customs short skirt redhead and her model has a really fine ass
who are the best leg/butthus    bank is up there hatate eiki who else
  eirin is the butthu
  raiko is a strong contender
  are redheads generally treated as spanking material
  not to my knowledge its just a coincidence that all redheads in touhou are super spankable suika sekibanki lewd pink and also a personal appeal of mine
  orange and pink arent red you dork
  theyre the fantasy equivalent of redheads  in real life pink hair and red hair are ugly as fuck because mostly clueless feminists are wearing these
fear of the bank fear of the bank    i have a constant fear that banki heads are near
theres a decent amount of sekibanki butt but no spanking sadly
  maid sekibanki      schoolgirl sekibanki    is it greediness to want them both
i raise you sekibanki in a buruma complete with puffy vulva
spankiki the bankiki
would banki be a good mother
  shed probably try but wouldnt manage to scare her kids into behaving
  maybe she could ask kogasa for help
      kogasa  not welcome here
  too puffy
  she needs the d
  kogasa is pure of heart    
  doubt
  what a cutie
  built for deep throat
  what a cute dork i love her and i want to xxxxx her
  you need to be more specific
  it involves spanking
  support your local banki
trying to make her walk  she looks like shes tiptoeing isnt she
  you cant make her walk the banki does what she likes
impregnating sekibankis boobybankis
  cute pocket banki
  whats going on here

  trying to get some sleep
okuul
cuddling with the birb
  cute glad to hear you have fun together
look at the calander  october 26th is utsuho day  nice
  cute
  oh why is that
let say utsuho succeed in burning the whole world how would she take it would she be glad or saddest by what she done
  i dont think okuu understood the gravity of anything she was claiming or threatening to do she was probably in a dark place trying to deal with all that newly acquired power she could barely control it which is likely why she blew that hole all the way to the surface
me and my wife
built for paizuri
youre waifu is my paizuri slave dude
  what sized pillow did you get ive never had a dakimakura before so i have no pillow insert to use and shes just been laying on my spare bed for a while
  you bought the same cover it should have had the dimensions listed on the title where it was sold i believe it was 160x50 since you were able to buy it i assume you are familiar with a proxy service i bought my most recent cover through goodyjapan gave them a link to purchase a dhr6000 off japan amazon but they have others to choose from too from my experience and what ive heard dhr anything is usually a good bet ill be buying a dhr7000 soon myself one of the newer ones     
  yeah same cover and yes it was 160x50 i used fromjapan how much did shipping cost you for the pillow approximately im thinking about just going local because although its compressible i dont want my wallet to get murdered
  half of them have abilities to make grabbing them midair instantly a nonissue if they really felt like it  best one is sagume who catches them has tears well up in her eyes and says im going to be married to herself
thanks by the way
  its usually 3000 yen for ems and i never select any other method so im afraid i dont know about the more affordable options
  thanks 3000 is a bit better than i expected i usually use ems as well i live in new zealand and get most shipments within 35 working days
  yeah the wait time is incredibly long otherwise something ridiculous like a month or longer too bad theres nothing in between hope you get to cuddle with her soon if its your first its a really nice feeling
  groping okuu my favorite past time
  to be honest i dont know if i feel comfortable cuddling her maybe if im in very good condition but otherwise i think ill just use the pillow ornamentally
  take it from someone who was skeptical of it before he even bought his first daki of okuu i too had no clue what it felt like to cuddle with a daki once and for a time i woke up with her thrown onto the floor  but after several months i noticed i grew used to her and waking up to her thrown to the floor became more and more rare give her at least a month of getting used to to see how you judge cuddling with her
  all those feathers must be really fluffy to hug  comfy
okuu is a cute paizuri petgirl
i want the birb to preen me
  yes i want to marry you
  you better take good care of her
  cute little borb
  my wife and my third 3rd daughter

unyu
  what a bird brain
do you think okuu casually hangs out au naturel in human form
  i dont see why not
  nice that this artist is making more okuu if only other artists would follow suit
why satof
koisheep and the chu
nothing to bleeeet about
both threads died thats a new low
    /jp/ has been faster than expected for some reason usually a chu/koisheep thread can last all day on 1 bump but for some reason this past week weve gotten an influx of new threads i blame the increasing amount of idol/virtual youtuber fags they go through threads too fast and simultaneously rape the catalogue once their threads hit bump limit especially the vyt people they create 3 threads at a time once their previous thread dies because of some infighting about which shitty youtuber is on the op pic oh well what can you do hopefully hiro creates a celeb/idol board so that the trash filling up /jp/ goes away
  you sound like a frown town resident
  vyt and idolshit threads that kill choochoo and koisheep threads are frowntown if you support idolshits and vyt whores please exit this thread you are rude
  actually i was bumping both threads but forgot to check the catalog two days ago and they got kill
these threads are the only threads i visit on /jp/ anymore along with the fumo thread    i just want to see soft comfy happy pictures
  yeah i know what you mean
  vtubers has been doing that for the whole year in fact they are rather slow now compared to feb and march i blame the sudden influx of shit tier threads that are nothing but bait probably some random anon from /qa/ trying to get some attention or just baiting people here    anyways we should turn this into a new kind of thread with chu chuu and koisheep at the same time
  i like that idea
  oh what mystical creatures we could see from this combination
  perhaps a 3 headed dragon
  both are cute so i agree
  one hundred thread slots taken up by imagedumps and meme/blog threads  no problem  vtubers have two threads on the board at the same time  give us back our living space    no seriously the math doesnt add up  even if vtubers went completely nuts and did 5000 posts a day which they dont theyd have an absolute max of three threads and that hasnt happened for any general threads in years
  sounds like you hate touhou please exit this happy thread
  maybe blame the new idiot who thinks it cool to make 5 threads for the same character
  the chu and koisheep thread actually died days after the okina threads were made someone didnt bump them for a whole day 2 days ago meanwhile we keep on getting new shittier threads daily its fine though cope yukarifetus
  someone complaining about characters having 5 threads clearly must like yukari who also tends to get spam threads absolutely flawless logic
  the point was that yukari and reimu spam threads happen more often and i dont see why you focus on the okina threads its only 5 threads were you here all year when reimu got 12 threads and yukari got 17 threads furthermore those okina threads didnt bump off the koisheep/chu threads check warosu some other shitposting threads did that
  all those spam threads are terrible and you know the answer to the other question is because those threads are the only ones currently still on /jp/ so obviously they stand out no one is going to check archives for pointless stuff like this also by your logic it would be perfectly fine to spam threads just because people at some point spammed even more guess i could spam 12 okuu threads and no one would have any right to complain
  i am not defending spam threads i am just rightfully refuting your point you said i blame the new idiot who thinks its cool to make 5 threads for the same character when that isnt new or the cause of the dead chu/koisheep threads at all those threads were made days before chu/koisheep died why you chose to obssess over okina is a mystery when those threads have nothing to do with the death of the chu/koisheep threads
  its a new guy because no one ever spammed okina threads before since you apparently check the archives all day you should have known that
  its a new guy  well this new guy is certainly kind enough to not make 10 threads   since you check the archives all day  how are you this mad it takes two minutes to scroll through the archive even less if you use the search function    the point still stands those threads have nothing to do with koisheep/chu dying at all and its provable if you go to the archive and actually look instead of shitposting those threads have nothing to do with this current thread stop obsessing over a topic that isnt related at all to the death of the chu/koisheep threads it just makes you look like a child having a tantrum over nothing
the guy behind okina threads is probably the same that used to do yukari spam there is no point in blaming him or vtuber threads the influx for both are just normal but the silly bait threads and the lack of bump are what killed both chu chuu and koisheep at the same time a rather unfornate incident with people to blame in both sides    leaving that behind this may be a new era for cute posting
where is the chuu
  this ship ate it

just brew yourself a tea or your favorite drink  it doesnt matter as long as you enjoy it  i know it might be awkward   but if you dont do it often find a blanket  wrap yourself around sip your drink   and float away like on a fluffy cloud   just let yourself go  what i do is i brew a cup of earl grey tea  and with a electric fan that blows hot air   i let the warm go under the blanket i snuggle under while drinking tea then i play this    
  
sheep is square
  chu is fair

its december again bros do you think another christmas miracle will happen    
  only if siro goes back to her winter outfit its the best one
  dont bully the very ksk rabbit
  im going to be asleep but i feel like when i wake up there will be a figurative postapocalyptic landscape left in the wake of this stream nothing good will come of this
  i dont care siro already exists
  shes going to be stuck here for a while this part is a bitch
  thats one of my pet peeves watching chuubas play any puzzle or storyheavy game they literally dont give a fuck because they dont read listen or even stop to take a look and think carefully its cute the first few times but then you realize theyre either a real idiot or just dont care and usually chat has to tell them the solution/what to do/where to go    like dude just stop for a moment and pay attention
  irrelevant unknown and not notable literally whos
  no this december is the end of the cycle this time is the december black death
  play a game  commenting  read and interact with chat  thats fucking hard man just see any shitty twitch stream
  the only miracle i want this year is kurumi coming back _
oh huh i didnt realize patra passed haneru in subs
  kanae is proof that you dont need to talk to chat all the time and can still focus on actually playing the game
hanerus stream got slowed down/interrupted several times already
  haneru is small subs  haneru is not big subs  haneru think so big subs
  you cheeky cunt
  oh fuck i thought it was just me  also is the chat looking up youtube walkthroughs for the solution thats kinda cheatingbut then again oh god shes about to start with the gelsthats gonna fry her poor bunny brain    i genuinely expect chat to feed her the answers for most of these
  do not bully the small bunny
  i see what you did there
  are the rest of tenmakinin still active
pyon pyon pyon
  i dont think they needed to look up anything  most of the time it was just look up    also ぐるち
  somewhat  gorilla is by far the most active  akkun comes and goes  mechanic makes more daughters from time to time  inui is a mystery
hnst_mary_love  lmao
  you dont need to talk to chat all the time  thats why i dont watch kanae and pubg is boring to watch
now theres also a suoupatra_love but hes on the other team this vtuber_love meme is really catching on
  now imagine the numbers hed pull if he was able to have an engaging fun stream personality at all times even when playing
  
  patra doing pretty good
whoa alice is the next guest on patoraji
spaghetti was spilled successfully apparently
  its not patoraji but its own thing
  am i understanding this correctly lesser vtubers are complaining to tsukasa for not letting them join
  they were really good too
ten days
  well at least some complaining was sort of inevitable short of creating and managing a tournament of however many hundreds of people that he himself was going to participate in theres no way to make everyone happy managing a tournament like that takes a good amount of effort and a lot of rules for things like no shows how long to wait downtime because of longer matches vs ones that get blitzed through misreporting etc a lot of work    i dont blame him for keeping it small and to names hes sure will show up the bonus of having it be names bigger than him gives him a decent platform for charming some of their subs to his channel its a worthwhile prize for the effort
anonkun its december 1st now wont you give me your first of the month
matsuri     she has the best lets go eevee playthrough next to haneru

  shes really ruffling feathers considering both haneru and patra only have 50k subs each and theyre plenty popular
  i think its cute a bit overdesigned but thats not a bad thing
  watch her videos please
  i dont check these rankings very often but the last time i did mito was above yomemi and himehina were several ranks below the fox loli  what happened with the 4digit increases in subscribers

  and above those two is a 66 idolbu natori with dwu picture natori name is also in 56 with a correct picture
  also sharing the place with deep web underground apparently also known as yaezawa natori
  from the voting on the nobangumi website a month ago
  4 idolbu going 3d few days before nobangumi vote  sasuga umap
did master lose
          the fuck was this was aichan featured on tv
  hes pokemon master
  she is right now and for 3 hours and an half remaining slowpoke
kouhai
    
even the real ai has her new costume kizuna btfo
  featured she has a 5 hour program dedicated to her on primetime
based only fire lineup
  natori is underrated im she got some attention thanks to this fuckup
  im glad
which one would you fug
  the guy on the left is kinda cute
aichan single handedly helping all the smaller chuubas by featuring her on her tv apperance
tamakin all round pokemon is usable but this all fire meme shion is using isnt going to work
holy that drill
  hypnosis lead with a salt inducing move might work
shion is finished
  that is a map of japan
  not yet kyukon should be faster than mega gyarados she still has a chance
  based that machamp is still asleep
kenkun ganbare
this fucking meme sleep
  god i want to fuck that sexbot ai
ken
ken
ken
i honestly cant believe shion won
filthy cheesers everywhere
  she got lucky with sleep and that ohko drill drive at the start
    new aoi cover
oneechan slayer
  i want aoi background theme on my phone
  as expected of a magic user
mirai akari oh nonononono
  one thing ive enjoyed doing lately is listening to aois cover and the original at the same time so it sounds like a duet might seem a bit autistic but it sounds so damn good when aois cover has the same instrumentals
  luck  skill  shes already won
  who are these people to be ranking vtubers anyway
  kou strong
  the fans voted a month ago
  who
its time  
  worst timing possible
alice saying nice things
  based mea
  tama being higher than iroha was kinda unexpected
pinosama playing a dead game  
your queen just reached 1000 subscribers  
  sasuga suits okome will probably kill herself after this
moruru  
semen demons  
  the map
  the old man
  its great that she can finally stream nintendo games without worry now
  kanna pretty much only plays vidya  turn her into an idol  god fucking hell i hate suits
  what is this idol shit holy shit ahahaa someone murder every single retarded japanese suit
  notokuban
  kaijis up there with the big girls feels nice
  i can see kannas panties so its ok
  much appreciated
  now  if you read the fine print of that announcement you must wait until january 1st for that
  nice
  their suits are beyond retarded why did they had to stream during aichans big tv appareance holy fuck shit
  cheers anon
akkun vs kuzu starting
  kou always ends up at weird places nijisanji representative for live king competition unexpected collab with mito and now this       nice im glad for mea she deserves good things sometime
  i like you
  thanks kizuna is doing rakugo now get in here fags
  that gag is timeless jugem jugem etc
  rakugo  japanese theater play and entertainment are both amusing and wierd in a good way jugemu jugemu
very very convincing rakugo artist
  i bet they busted the budget for the two new models into that paper fan model
  this tiny akkun is adorable
ai got btfo by a sexbot ahahaha
  good have better screenshots
  
i will not lie ais male cohost is fucking hot like a hotter keanu reeves if ai wasnt a massive lesbian i bet she would be all over his dick
  like a hotter keanu reeves  stopped reading there
  the fact that shes on tv means she sucked a few dicks already
they already beat the tweet goal and theyre halfway through
akkun
whats the bracket right now i missed pretty much the entire thing because my alarm didnt go off
  he had that in the bag with the initial swords dance but he switched out  this is his first pokemon game so it cant be helped
  nah ai is 100 virgin you can tell it from all of her juvenile reactions to love/romance/sexual innuendos and how she behaves herself in fact i would go a step further and guess she never had any romantic relationship at all i think shes a legit khv
did akkun thinks kuzuha will swap snorlax in thats a pretty bad play
  he forgot about shadow ball i think he said
i just remembered who that android on aichans show is    
  i dont want her to be my gf and im not in love or anything i wouldnt care if she was a massive whore and fucked everyone in tokyo its just something i have picked from watching her videos nozomi seems desperate for a romantic relationship and her reactions to those topics are very juvenile the kind youd expect from a virgin
deja vu
  thanks anon appreciate it whose twitter is this from so i can keep an eye on it when i inevitably miss another match
  
god i want to bully a crying kanae so badly
  from the actual stream
nice label
  i guess he finished fucking mito
  female actress acts like her character when shes in character  more news at 11
  thanks once again anon youre a hero    i must have missed it when i tabbed out for a minute to ask in here whoops
aichan is a fucking savage she pretty good at banter
  its started holy shit theyre so bad at singing holy shit just kill me already
  how old is nozomi again
i dont play much pokemon but in a competitive match wouldnt choosing two of the same type be a bad idea
  not necessarily especially if they fill different roles
  
  makes sense seems to be working for kanae right now anyways  also wow hes got almost 20k viewers
  this is like a trainwreck that i cant look away they are getting canned for sure  holy hell is this bad management  490 viewers  icing on the cake
  this is the worst timing between the pokemon tournament ais show and all the other streams theyre sapped out of potential viewers
  it hurts to watch
did moruru know the tournament was going on its weird to see her with such a low view count of 18k
  if it helps anon they never got that many viewers in the first place
  i want one of these but with these girls instead of enogu both are appropriate anyway
  i remember how they were gunning for a thousand viewers during their summer stream oof
why is shiina so cute bro  and how did she climb up the fame ladder so fast
  not really the fire horse is fucking useless against gyarados and hippo ice fox is useless too putera cant get any free kill from this opponents lineup and it will get fucked by opponents hippo and gyarados so its a bad idea to pick him
  it was the nunchuck memes 2ch really loved it simple as that she went from 45k viewers on most streams to 8k for that stream and pretty much every stream after it
  we will have stream on 12/10 so we will tell you the detail about the live on that day
this way  
im excited to see master lay down the fucking law
ショタハンター  
  pretty sure some of sakus fans also followed her after the graduation
  and then graduation announcement on the 31st  perfecto
  that announcement  oh fuck are they getting killed off
  sakus graduation was a bit later but thats probably a part of it but it was definitely the nunchuck memes that was the big thing
  i thought this was going to be mama but im not complaining
master what the fuck are you doing
gaijin slut16 with  more pokemon  
  natonato zatsudan
master
  its about this  
  that was actually a soundboard sasuga seedsgod
wow not even a single paralyze proc isnt it like 30 chance or something
otn is the strongest
she fucking accidentally disconnected and unplugged the stream for a second because her attack missed  sasuga gamers
this daifuku pulled a kou
these nijisanjis
over 21k people are watching this kusodaifuku break her nijisanjipaid switch
  she guillotined her own connection
  i never knew you could pile so much shit in one image
  aichan must be the only ai that slips out of work to work some more
  mad because 2dshits are getting double the viewers of your queen arent you anon
  thats too bad she was at the top of the game too she should learn to not kick around when excited
when are they continuing the rankings on ais show
after fallout 76 kizuna 78
  seriously ユードリック 
no matter who wins taisa wins he gets to play with a bratty loli without fear of the police after all
  さらばじゃ
  is this the new otp
  taisa with any loli yes has been for months
the call that saved japan
taisa is so fucking cute
  peanutskun that fucker his voice is so funny    too bad ponpoko couldnt join the call too that was nice of him to repay her for their collab earlier
taisa apologizing for winning the match to shion is to be expected of a cute lolicon
felt like an uncle beating his niece in a pokemon game very cute
this taisa guy is just bullying childern not cool
  hello /pol/
  a tensai taisa needs to do whats right for his army not whats right for his lolicon heart
is ais special over im at work and cant watch it
  get off internet and go fucking back to work bob
 chocoaqua
  its still going on its 4 hours long  its on a recap though so im watching something else atm
shes calling again bravo alice
 geimazu no yami
  give me a break the updates on her show stopped so im completely in the dark here now
super intelligent stats
  
 mugimugi   rin   utako video   vrchat ninja road
  literally nothing is happening in the baby game tourney stream yet they still have a good 600 viewers over ai whats happening
kanakuzu semi finals
  oh jesus i didnt even realize this until you mentioned it kanae kuzuha
kanae you fucking chuuni cutie
the semifinal matchups turn out to be pretty cool kanae vs kuzuha and the smartest guy vs vakatuber
  taisa and master is also a fun versus match if you also consider the characters theyre both based on
yua
hes going to swap out to nidoking and make my thunder useless  it happens  all according to my plan  bakaunkoha
天才了解ジーニアス
  
  announcing more new fucking outfits wow
    more outfits  that confirms it then shes only going to get an outfit a year at best
  i need this
    these are cute but will we ever see them implemented
    shes on cloud nine
kuzuha
    arent those just illustrations  イラストまとめ
this fucking 4d chess pokemon
this whole fucking tournament is horn drill
  thats what happens when you remake gen 1 with just gen 1 pokemon and moves for the most part and fix the buggy mechanics it becomes ohkometa fun to see though ohkos never get used in pretty much anywhere ever
pokebattle more like pokeswap
  whos the homewrecker now aifags gotta stop blaming luna for everything
holy shit kanae just swapped out a low hp gyarados with stealth rocks out itll probably die when he throws it back in making it a useless move
real 200 iq match we have here
  ohko moves are banned from actual tourneys if i remember right i guess they forgot to do the same here
where the fuck is moruru on this ranking
kuzuha and kanae are getting into eachothers heads so hard kuzuha even outright said but what if he knows im thinking what hes thinking
  mama
  that green nijisanji bitch either has obsessive fans or a pretty big botnet
kuzuhas banking on horn drill missing and it keeps working sasuga gamers
kanae lost gg
  damn it i thought it was yua on the image
  cute illustrations but has she said when theyre going to release her new outfits
  ryushens strong holy shit
  you havent been paying much attention if you think thats true also please dont insult my husbandwife
laki btfo
  idolshit ai no thanks
sasuga nijigamer
  those are birthday dress and lawson ai
halt lolicon  
  aidol aichan yes arigatou
 chieri
i hope the finals are going to be kuzuha versus master kanaes husband who he abuses versus kanaes other husband who he abuses
  this and the casino outfit are perfect for lewds do i have to learn how to draw myself to get my fill of porn
    this just makes me want to commit more crimes
  i want kuzuha vs taisa smartest gamer vs smartest prisoner
    maybe going to jail will be worth it
  yua top 10 confirmed
  no matter who wins we as viewers will win regardless this was a fun tourney from the bits ive caught of it
  i hope kuzuha get disconnected too in the final like kou and shiina
taisa was supposed to be the smartest chuuba
patra number 10
guess who got caught in the minecraft trap  
  what stream is this grats to her though
no porn allowed number 9
kerin number 8
kerin
chestbutt number 7
        i havent seen a haneru yet though inabagumi doko
  only 7  fire everyone
  lunafags on suicide watch  the worst part is using video footage instead of new stuff
  theyre the inabagumi for a reason shes up there
oh luna didnt send a message
  i believe in them
siro mito haneru and of course yua are in who else
whats this ranking stuff for is this the nobangumi thing to get on tv with ai how many people get in top 5 or top 3 or only the 1    also master fucked up
  himehina didnt appear yet did they
  kurumi _
holy shit taisas reading him like a fucking book
  how is deron so far ahead of rin makes no sense
  itll be siro mito ago himehina dunno about other two spots
  kenchan
  cheater cat didnt cheat hard enough
dork sisters number 6
poop on tv again
  none of you named the omegadorks  im dissapointed /jp/
  naisu
  thats still not a haneru does this mean shes in the top 5
  rin never mentioned or tweeted anything about this voting
  so those and haneru i guess
  so fucking proud of my wife and my sister in law
  neither did most of the top ten
  nice damage control
ago number 5
ago
these threads are fun when theres two really big streams going on like this honestly
soaky no meat
  rigged by upd8
rabbit who doesnt like ntr number 4
    basically you need a venn diagram intersection of people that pay attention to kizuna and pay attention to your favorite chuuba for your chuuba to be higher up on the voting  its like a contest to show which are the most mainstream
  hot bunny
  i dont know anything about whatever this stream is going on but i hope the top 5 win a prize instead of haneru just barely getting cucked out of a third place prize
  upd8  spend money  what timeline do you think this is
siro mito himehina top 3  im pretty satisfied no matter what the order
neruuuuuuuuuuuu
why the fuck there are people in that show who obviously never watched vys or even never went to youtube at all
  because thats how entertainment/variety programs work
  well i dont really know what this is for i remember hearing something about a collab with ai or something on some tv show but everytime it gets brought up shitposters wake up and i end up fucking off to actually watch chuubas instead
  because it isnt about vtubers
i dont think sana has shown up yet either
  thats just japanese tv for you
  its just a ranking there was a poll where fans voted for their favorites
  its not that bad to have people who dont know anything about the scene there they might have a different possibly interesting take on it
 even achan is congratulating haneru    oh wow really so haneru got that high up just for a poll thats really fucking cool
 lol
  they might have a different possibly interesting take on it  different yes  interesting hell no most of their remarks come off as either way too scripted or blatantly retarded
  wheres rin
  some of these are honestly pretty surprising but im happy for them
  oh yes i never thought about chuubas in quite that way until some japanese clist talent whos greatest asset is filling screen space and smiling made that comment that they were sugoi and kawaii
  holy shit magrona is actually up there i was absolutely not expecting that all of these are really surprising
  shes 34th 
  far far far bottom right
the finals are finally here taisa versus kuzuha its a battle of the geniuss
  well this is clearly bullshit
  her rank is literally her age
mitomito
tsukino mito number 3
siro is going to win
  monomi hare
  mito 3rd  oh no no no  this cant be happening mitobros activ8 rigged this shit
  too soon
  sorry
its got to be sana and siro then
  oh no no no no number 2
  sasuga
sana is first holy shit
  you jinxed it
sumanko
  oh no no no no
what is the appeal of this old man
number 1 nurse
  i did not expect that
  im honestly tickled that akari and aoi are below a bunch of 2d chuubas
  unexpected but there was the sana boom a few months back
  さなちゃん一位と予想する
  literally who 
  2dhater on suicide watch
  natorifag must be fapping in joy
wait so wheres himehina
2dhater btfo forever
kaijis playing the versus champion original bgm for the finals got me stupid hyped    sananeru is in the top 5 holy fuck
hime hina forgot to buy ads for the voting
  the officially most popular chuuba
  not fair it was yuas turn
  based
does sana count as seiso we got a seiso trio in top 3 if so
  is she a genius or a time traveler
  chinese could not figure out how to vote
  buying views
  shiro isnt seiso
  you obviously dont get how the yua line works
on the phone now
  are you all from japan here i cant watch this the ping is horrible
  i hope someone reuploads this i want to hear her reaction but cant watch the stream right now
  he is the falseflagger ignore him
  mito isnt seiso
i understand yua but himehina didnt even rank
  who
  they werent in the group feature either
  bilibili link works fine here
  are you all from japan here
  most of their fans are normalfags who sub because of the mvs they dont vote since theyre not really into vtubers
is this producer zuns brother
  damn it forgot to click that
kuzuhas on the ropes
what the hell karte    
im pretty sure slowking has high def af
say something nice to this popular nurse
  even achan is congratulating haneru  she has become really active since making twitter account
kizuna is not on the list aifags btfo
  chinese are the most generous race on earth
  i cant believe real normalfags were hhfags all along
kizuna having an orgasm
taisaaaaaaa
im pretty satisfied with this ranking sana was a surprise and i wish rin was a teeny bit higher but the top 10 is pretty dang good
nijisanji exterminated
aichan got almost 79k hashtag tweets  wheres your god now mitosperms
  yeah she is daiseiso
  looking at it that way its a bit surprising yuni made it that high
give money and win prizes now
hanerus superchat is going wild again
  me too people are shitposting hardcore but mostly im just incredibly glad some of my favorites got so high im not excited for the coming weeks of x placed higher then this heavenly king so theyre factually better but still definitely a fun ranking
taisa smartest vtuber and pokemon master
sana mito and haneru should be crowned heavenly kings desu
akari didnt even get into the top 10 so shes not heavenly king anymore
  as expect shit list with literally who at 1
  only a half hour or so until we hear her cry on stream and probably call with sana and both of them cry on stream
  im so happy for omesis
 himawari and neeyan ワ  
  her husband being number one must be thrilling for her
   hanerus wife now
damnit rion i havent even even gotten around to watching last weeks sao episode    
  i knew she was popular but this is still a shock
  tonight theyre gonna have an all night session of clam clashing hot steamy sex
  nah its just about whoever has the most obsessed fans the nobangumi poll is very similar to 2ch popularity polls
how can she best of cute
how will noja and akari ever recover
  its just about whoever has the most obsessed fans  then rin should have been 1st
big group chat at kaijis
dont forget about shiinas pet  
heres some feels with your superb ranking  
kuromu  
hows ai chan so far i know shes good at emceeing but 5 hours is a long time
  damage control from hhfags already ads cant buy you votes
alice  
  i wish akabane was my sister and treated me like her slave
i cant believe the most popular chuuba follows me on twitter
  i feel like i wont like that hairstyle
  rin has a small amount of very dedicated people
 traplover   aki   shirayuri   mary  i dont expect anyone to watch any of these its a pretty hype time with the streams still going on grats to sananeru and mito being in the top 5
  this hhfags are very selective and dont vote on random pools
  its just about whoever has the most obsessed fans  theres nothing obsessive about spending a minute to fill out a poll for your vtuber  you cant even call yourself a fan if you arent willing to give just that much for them
  and some more  
im just glad siro maintained her popularity and that her seiso kouhai ranked right next to her
  feels like eons since the squeaky bat streamed by herself
  ayamina      hero
please stop the roboco bullying kusokaiji    im glad for pretty much all of the top 5
check this winter sunflower
saikido in around 2 hours and 40 minutes
  why would fans care about a poll that their vtuber doesnt care about most of the top chuubas stepped back to let the less known chuubas shine here
hebiko waking up  
  nobody cares about runnerups
  ponkotsu robot only good for guillotine
  i want to cut her wires if you know what i mean
if a japanese says it its official now right  
rokudo mei  
  the lamestlooking succubus to ever exist
  oh no no no
i am imagining so hard right now
  im just surprised at everyone else who ranked above luna so thats one more thing to be happy for ome sis
    guillotine memes are going to be fun
  more like four heavenly whos
  thats a good representation of current japanese vy fandom
camomi rank 22nd  
    2dhater is going ballistic watch out
im so proud of shiro and what she has accomplished so far to think she was the underdog during the early days
  im surprised she ranked so high good for her
honestly thought inui would show up in the lower ranks somewhere
  what happened here
  hes not japanese and thats another reason i shouldnt care
  hiatuses/inactivity is literally virtual suicide in this fad
  sirogumi are dedicated and are capable of great things look at mito
  this is unironically one of the smartest posts ive seen in these threads for the past year
  hes inactive cant be helped
  everytime she guillotined someone she apologized like the 三下 she is
  i actually like this better than her normal hairstyle
  himatan
kuzuha hates it
  man this performance was really bad  i feel sorry for the girls they were nervous as fuck and their voice was all over the place almost like if they were feeling the bums rush coming for them  suits are fucking retarded for persuing the idol path with so many failed virtual idols projects so far
kuromu was just shouting demands at nanashi to bait a chat response and see if nanashis watching her  i love how much of a brat she can be sometimes
  she is in fact fucking adorable
  this was great
  kuyashii
i hope they do team battles next time
  i hope so too but theyre talking about how theyre going to start planning a smash ultimate tourney first which will definitely be a fucking treat
  why would fans care about a poll that their vtuber doesnt care about  there is not a single vtuber who isnt happy that they made it into the ranking  frankly any vtuber who doesnt care about a poll started by the founder of the community shouldnt be calling themselves vtubers
 get in here inabagumi
  nice kerin and meika should probably join and maybe haruto
  without ohko moves this time as entertaining as it was
my futanari oneechan reviews some toys  
  rin doesnt give a shit
hanerus already made like 300 dollars
  her voice makes my peepee go hard and my anus go wet
  sorry make that easily 500 dollars forgot about donations from before the stream and the dozens of 10 dollar donations shes gotten tsuyotsuyoinabagumi
    uncensored version
  vb ignored it too
  pretty sure shes made a few thousand at this point people were throwing fuckload of superchat money on her before stream even started
    i like arisus new outfit
  im not seriously keeping count but i assumed well over a thousand but mentally cut off half of that because of youtubes cut and nanashis cut   slightly related haneru telling atahuta to draw for her
  your math is garbage she has had 500 superchats already its at least few thousand probably over 5k already
  no
rinfam got to pick the stream they picked minecra  im beginning to doubt the taste of japanese anons        
  like i said not even remotely keeping count thats why i said easily over 500 dollars a few thousand is easily over 500 dollars anon
they made it
time to ask santa for nursing handjobs from mary
  this is funny and sad at the same time
  alright that one got me
  regular sex appeal bfto
 compact version for those who dont want to check all the pics
  minecraft  ksp  euro truck  dbd  no wonder they choose minecraft
  above and beyond anon
chinese btfo
  rinfam are lonely ojisans who just want to listen to their mommys angelic voice i doubt they even care what she plays but minecraft streams are a lot more chill than something like pubg or dbd
  probably choose what they thought rin wanted to play
my pure boy is proud to be 59th  
  all of them were past designs those are the lawson and the videogame ones
my wife kaede is super cute as usual

  she would have destroyed them
  and heres the based version who says fuck reading kanji
pffthahaha
mitosperms btfo  2dshit kiddie tournament btfo
oh my god himawari and akabane are laughing so hard at their own joke that theyve both started making dolphin noises simultaneously  my ears

  oh ninjas actually ranked
  thank you anon  the only thing that surprises me is the total lack of himehina but thats understandable
  two natori  they cant even get the name right what a shitshow
  they also mixed up kuromu and moira
  she was playing that truck simulator to practice safely driving her to school after all
  two good boys in top 10 good shit
  she has the right name here what a shitshow
  im actually surprised akari and luna ranked that high
    sasuga suppah interigento ai

what was the poll about and what do the winners get
  they get to be mating pressed by ai on her tv show
  how much money did you donate to ai
  30 secs of fame on tv
jesus grandma really likes minecraft a lot  no day without a minecraft stream or nightly fishing session
  she does but rinfam apparently just cant get enough either  
today was a good day
  jiro senpai is going to destroy her in bed later tonight
  comfy streams are fun im not a huge rinfam but i always find myself listening to her minecraft streams in the background while im working or playing a game sorta like a podcast in that regard
  todays been a good day for memes too i see
only missing dumb bear for the ultimate team laughwise
  hero_minamori  making me think
himawaris a rantaroufag
  dammit hero you usually leave these up for a few days
    round 2
  not 69 ruined
im glad that im a shirogumi otherwise akabanes recent comebacks would have caused damage to my ears
hima
  did it because she got a running nose midstream and didnt seem that well so she ended it a little early
why dont they just add hero to the discord call instead of having her speak in the pubg voicechat
  theres something happening to her vas life and doesnt looks good
  danger of picking up background noise
they are saying it again its official now  
  good things eilene btfo  bad things neon enogu hanjo and sally outside the ranking
  what she uses discord to talk with chuubas in other collabs though like most chuubas shes even had the discord overlay on some of her streams i think    discord also has push to talk
  natori hearts
  several people on twitter are surprised about how low the 4 heavenly kings but shiro ranked
  siro sirogumi a horny animal and a old man
the ranking is kinda clever a lot of the higher ranked vtubers have promoted the vote themselves while many already famous ones didnt so this really gives a chance for any mid to small vtubers with a dedicated fanbase to shine
  sana is my favorite babiniku chuuba
  i dont remember a babuchi guy specifically but i did have this among my clips       is that what you were referring to    whoops didnt realize the other thread was dead
  akari might or might not be surprising but luna and noja are within expectations if you ask me
  thats the one i was thinking of thanks anon
  the worst part is using video footage instead of new stuff  im still going through the screenshots but it looks like they more or less used everyones intro or some other really old video even matsuris was her intro video that she and chat were literally making fun of a few days ago because its nothing like the way she presents herself on stream now
fuck
  indeed
  this is a good meme
  most tubers sent videos thanking ai and fans
suginosan is in himabanes match
  most chuubas sent a special salutation for the event  one would expect luna who is supposdely aichans girlfriend send her a video too but sony didnt let her out of the dungeon
im not familiar with the 1 vtuber who is she and what made her so popular
  i guess midoris fanbase is really dedicated still surprised that she got 11th place
    im happy for my 組長 and her wife
  an old man
  there are a lot of other vtubers that just casually mention they watch ryushen too sometimes
  well noja abandoned his channel while luna stopped altogether to create good videos with the infamous ebiiber as the most egregious evidence of jumping the shark akaris videos become boring after duo sacked eilene and its even worse now that she ditched her classic outfit    siro on the other hand was always the same laughing dolphin everybody loves and she worked hard to get there she was able to be the image of several games and advertisement companies and she is the only vtuber besides ai to have her own tv show on a steady schedule    im surprised of how high la goblina was in the ranking shes the reason of why the fad is in crisis every 2d vtuber is trying to copy her formula and everything that is wrong with trying to overwhelm a market with the same thing over and over
  shes a proper artist the leader of the babiniku group aka ojiisans who sound and act like girls like notemama or magrona but not like oddai and technically not nora cat and a hardcore cutesexual who creams herself at anything she deems cute and accidentally said sumanko once
  shes fucking sexy
  please dont include my daughtermommywife into your shitposts she wouldnt like that    i believe and dont quote me on this that there was a push by the seeds to get midori up there thatd also explain it that and midoris taken the streams until 6am block kanae used to have for a long time until he took it back recently
  zako countdown ilya impressions vampire lover cheeky brat old man lover rabbit friend
    so is she lke fairys
you know yesterday i was confused about why they had decided to release such a dangerous video now four months after recording it but come to think of it its probably because sega would have their back if it got them a streaming ban or something
  pet  
  not really no
how the hell did rei even make it into top 5 and there are 3 other dudes in top 20 thats absolutely pathetic what kind of faggot goes out of their way to vote for a dude over a cute girl i get voting for kerin because theres potential to see some shitposting on live tv but why is the blonde twink so high in rankings imagine being a bigger faggot than guys watching a fat man larp as a catgirl
  rei  found the newfag trying reading japanese instead of just using his twitter handle
  rei  who  blonde twink  who  fat man larp as a catgirl  who
  rei
  
  if anything im surprised la goblina didnt came up 1st in the rank mostly considering how overly zealot her fanbase is
  rei
i hope ichika survives to learn that shes 3 among the ranked nanashi underlings
  didnt even notice that wow i always thought ichika was one of the leastwatched nanashi girl very glad to see this
  im not shitposting i wish siro was the number one because she deserves it witnessing  her rise on these threads was fun and amazing but at least la nijisantura is not the winner mito is the the face of the vtuber black death uncreative long streams ridden with forced memes the same trendy videogames and idolshit conducted by 2d avatars with low charisma
  did you see that fan art amount comparison a while ago he has by far the most fan art of any male chuuba
  i told you 2dhater is going nuclear
  dont worry hina will complain and say that ichika rigged the results saying that its supposed to be her again
suginosan
  no
  pathetic but expected from the forced memes vtuber and her fanbase
im awaiting the debut of omega reiago myself
    heres mitos they used her intro but she also gave a video letter
  it was kind of obvious from how much hes been shitposting earlier in the thread but since he hasnt been getting replies i guess he decided to just look at some nijisans twitter and reveal hes also an eop who cant read basic japanese either    really sad honestly
  did they keep ai out because shes obviously 1 or because she wasnt first
  mito by herself is not the problem but the army of spergs following her they singlehandedly destroyed the chances of new innovative and creative vtubers
why are people shitting themselves over the ranking those who hounded their fans to vote got more votes and those who didnt get fewer votes its a ranking of mobilisation how good a chuuba can promote themselves plus how much their fanbase is willing to vote its not a just a simple popularity contest it shows how dedicated the fanbases are towards self promotion
  probably both
  based mea fans having stockholm syndrome
  every 2d vtuber is trying to copy her formula  ha i wish putting that much effort into a stream was a common thing
  she also won the vtoker contest
  probably because its already her show and highlighting herself on it would be pointles
  if you compare mito in terms of effort with let say rin or oddai mito is not putting a lot of effort
  shitty goblina  putting effort  you dont even know the meaning of the word
  they just play video games
  its even sadder the unhealthy obsession you have towards him
  mito  uncreative long streams ridden with forced memes the same trendy videogames and idolshit conducted by 2d avatars with low charisma
mamas mama came in and shut it down   
  playing minecraft every single day doesnt require that much effort either
okay made it through everything really happy for sana managing 1st shes a real success story for chuubas on all counts and im glad shes got some real recognition for it too also really happy that camomi came in at a strong 22 very surprising
    at least they do something rather than talking shit nonstop    the absolute state of nijisanjifans
  ive told you this before 2dhater but if youre going to pick on someone for being stale mito is one of the last ones you should be flinging shit at everyone is only going to make fun of you not that we already dont
  we
new age of seiso
  yeah we
  you shouldnt make fun of retards
  i saw it but i dont remember any dudes on the list desu are you implying he has a large female fanbase
where is moemi on the list
  who
binaural oneechan  
    saikido starting any minute now
  still salty
finally i can get some quiet time with my secret crush aoi
  activ8 got mad for being destroyed in views and omitted ecchiecchi sisters votes
  i like it
  seiso gods collab when
idolhater btfo
  i welcome the age of seiso sentai
mama and her sister    do their streams always get this many viewers
  there are your 4 heavenly kings for 2019
  i wish shed get more outfits
  we have a new ojisan a new 月 and a new slut for 2019
  but whats hanerus title though
  a new 月  delete
  shell probably get a new one on her anniversary or even before
  ooh its a 60 minute special
pino mochi and megu are confirmed to show up as well
  i hope the oyabun runs a poll every year now to replace the previous kings
  she didnt run this poll
    if all the chuubas actually cared about the poll and seriously campaigned to win in it the ranking would look completely different mito would be the only nijisanji to make it into top 10 possible even the only one in top 20 it would be a competition between akari luna siro mito and maybe hh for the 1st place realistically mito or luna would win my bet is on mito because her fans are a lot more zealous than even lunafam at the peak of her popularity i could see them trying to cheat or begging/nagging other people to vote for her
  組長
  3 nijisanjis in top 5 is it time to panic we now have solid proof theyre killing the vtuber fad
by the way that was the result of 17000 vtuber fans voting
  saving
  3 nijisanjis in top 5
  just learn japanese
  3 nijisanjis in top 5
how long until kanna graduates
  i like her butt itd be a shame if she did
  so barely 072 of aichans total subscribers
  considering the way they ended their latest stream id say all three are graduating at the same time
  but 17 of her active viewbase
  3 nijisanjis in top 5  what did he mean by this
roboco
  vys stronk
  spots 5 4 3 and 1 are taken by low effort 2d nijisanjis
  what do you mean
  2 sorry most 2d chuubas have such generic design i keep mistaking them for nijisanjis lets look at it from a different perspective we have one just a single 3d chuuba in top 5 and just 4 in top 10 thats fucked up i cant see this fad lasting too long with low effort streamers at the front it will kill all hype and momentum
  3d elitists btfo the japanese have spoken go be an asshole somewhere else
  we have one just a single 3d chuuba in top 5 and just 4 in top 10 thats fucked up  wait 2dhater is actually real i thought he was just someone people shitposted about
  sauce
  we have one just a single 3d chuuba in top 5 and just 4 in top 10
  and just 4 in top 10  mito and rei are 3d sana apparently has a 3d model shes used for vrchat so technically shes also 3d
haha they messed up the links in the description this is the level of incompetence we are at now
  
  its like people their content or something wtf
  low effort streamers  get fucked mate i consider daily video guys like ai low effort since they rely on a sizeable team  shiro being the exceotion because not only she does several videos daily but her staff also uploads their own videos
  imagine being this mad that people voted for people they like
  this is getting a yikes from me brother
  we have one just a single 3d chuuba in top 5
  i refuse to believe someone is seething this hard about a poll unironically
  he is and hes probably waiting for someone else to post an ai image so he can start flooding the thread again like last time he got this btfo and then say it was some falseflagger instead
notemama sure is hardworking
  jesus notemama is going off
  dude stop
  who do you think has been shitposting every thread
  i hope this is the absolute chuuniest outfit possible i need it to be
  ive been on this site long enough my eyes basically just skip over any really stupid shitposts with the exception of the funny ones like that guys so ive seen the name thrown around but didnt actually think he was anything more then a boogeyman what a fucking autist
  hes being paid to dress up his own daughters why wouldnt he be hardworking
        im not hating on anyone here calm down you thinskinned pussies do you honestly believe this scene can last for too long with generic streamers at the top they will kill all the interest hype and momentum it has already happened but it will be much worse once all the unique and 3d chuubas start fucking off because they cant make a profit or find an audience
next saikido will be on 1223
  literally every statistic disagrees with your theory
  its kinda cute how you expect anyone to believe you when you post this shit every day
  remember when you thought that people in the threads agreed with you and your post is one of the most replied in the past dozen or so threads with every reply calling you a faggot good times gooood times
  point out whos generic and why with clips corroborating your arguments or be quiet
if 2dhater is real and 3dhater isnt real then what is 1dhater
will there be a day you idiots stop falling for this 2d vs 3d bait
  nobody hates the d that would be gay
  no ones falling for bait buddy everyones making fun of a retard for openly beingly retarded as you should do
see ninjas in the sub box  its a stream 2 planned weeks in advance
  who are you quoting
kirby talk about the state of the scene  
  falling for the bait would be believing those ranked high dont deserve their popularity
looks like roboco got a decent sub boost after all that bullying that happened in the tourney
  its like those 30 year old prostitutes you see who dress in schoolgirl outfits
  40 year old prostitutes  fixed that for you
  shion gained 1k subs thanks to her 小学生 level  team building
  her getting bullied at the end was very very cute
who are the best senpai in the scene
  which statistic is that     playing video games and chatting on stream is literally what any other stream does hence why it is generic its not an insult the only difference between a traditional streamer and vtuber streamer is the anime avatar but how long do you think that novelty will last people will get tired of this type of content as they usually do and move on to something else
  thats the big event the one she has been hyping up for a couple of months already
  2nd part  
  i cant believe ai is killing the fad with her generic gaming videos
  how long do you think that novelty will last people will get tired of this type of content as they usually do and move on to something else  alright ill bite lets say for a minute that this is true people will get tired of streaming and typical content with an anime avatar on it then what those people quit because no ones watching them anymore and you end up with your ideal scene right so why argue like a retard about it if youre right theyll atrophy and die off on their own and if youre wrong which you are then the scene stay strong with a variety of content and content producers    wheres the problem 2dhater im not seeing it
  im really at a lost on what you think a virtual youtuber is and does  you really think doing stuff in 3d is revolutionary or something ill admit playing around in vr chat is fun for some hours but come on
  aichan plays whatever she feels like playing though
  depends if were talking about people who actively support their kouhais then theres really no better examples then roboco shes pretty much always in some hololives chat or even other chuubas and actively wants to collab with them giving a really friendly air to her kanae is also a pretty decent senpai but robocos probably one of the best    the only difference between a traditional streamer and vtuber streamer is the anime avatar but how long do you think that novelty will last  people watch chuubas for more then their icons you just cant understand any japanese or only care for seeing a model move around pino is just as enjoyable 3d as she was 2d calm down
  i missed you moemihater
  roboco is a fantastic senpai within hololive and its almost funny how bad of one sora is by comparison when fubuki has to teach her on her own channel who literally anyone that isnt roboco is within hololive
  so what theyre still generic gaming videos with anime avatar
  sora has a pretty painful disconnect yeah i still remember that fortnite collab stream with roboco it was more then a bit awkward sora just feels like shes part of some totally different project which technically is true but still shiro supports her kouhais even if its mostly just on twitter and rarely for collabs but they all feel pretty natural in a regard    thinking about senpais though does kaiji or akkun count as ones because if they do theyre also up there with roboco
  thats true i think she could do a little more with them and i hope she does in the future
  definitely not me because i failed my smelly kouhai
  why kirby thinking so hard at 4 am  chuubas and their sleeping schedules yikes
  they couldnt figure out how to buy votes
  shame on you
  dont blame yourself we all failed
  its said girls are cute when they are a little retarded your kouhai tried to be a bit too cute for her own good
  support male vtubers  
因幡組 stronk
  but im not a woman
  shes the best wingman a man could wish for
  theres nothing wrong with going full cute
the 2dhater is an idiot but that dont mean everything he says is wrong nijisanji are the original sin they were the first to push for a more corporate scene idolbu was a direct respond to their model they were the first to push for a brand instead of a person they make it ok to be 2d when getting a 3d model was a huge deal many people opened donations for 3d models or went into debt also how hiyokopon and ukasama became famous for helping in creating 3d models now many dont even bother in getting one they started the trend of streaming every day with the ocaccional video instead of videos every day with the ocaccional stream they also flooded the market with quantity instead of quality theres more than 50 vtubers relate to nijisanji  etc etc  anyone who defends nijisanji is just a corporate cock sucker and cant see what they did to this scene
  okay 2dhater
  its cool im subbed to three
  who could be behind this post
  50 usd per stream
  the man whose gotten more yous then anyone else in this threads history
  yeah okay whatever you say but what the fuck happened to kuon anyway
  its a trade off you either give up part of your brain or your voice
  youre not helping your point by posting with that failure 2dhater
  im not homo
  shes a failure because she couldnt get a 3d model at a time when 3d models where important which is exactly the point dumbfuck
  they make it ok to be 2d when getting a 3d model was a huge deal  example  the only person making a fuzz about mecoming 3d in the early days was akkun and he didnt exactly thrived thanks to it
  so your point is that 3d models are not important anymore
so ai chans new outfits are delayed to mid december
  which year
  scene was started by corporate vtubers hobbyists joined later
  shes a failure because she failed again after she got one since it doesnt mean anything whether you have one or not 2dhater
  yes
  youtubers with anime avatars existed way before niijisanji and none of them called themselves virtual youtubers
  kuon failed because the retarded producer couldnt keep a good voice actor and acted like they would stay the whole time while it took forever for a model to get made
its pretty cool that patra is gonna hang out with my mom
  fact
おはクズ
  its pretty cool that my mom is gonna hang out with my oni
  get over yourself roboko it was inevitable that fubuki surpassed you since your content is boring and your va is etc
  only aichan and shiro were corporate vtubers at the beginning one literally started the scene and was pushing as a person and not a brand and the other started as a failure their corporations were totally irrelevant it was hobbyists that put life in the scene luna noja mate
  only aichan and shiro were corporate vtubers at the beginning  then you have yua and akari as well
kuromu i
  yua akari aoi sora
  its actually a mystery what happened with kuon i think a lot of people here didnt notice simply because they were still so stuck on that first va but she had her model and both her videos and her livestreams were actually quite popular her activity just kind of fizzled out for some reason and now we havent heard anything from her since these tweets      
  akari was eilenes project as a response to aichan at first duo came later
  yua was always irrelevant and akari started as a hobbyists
  one literally started the scene  what does ami has to do with anything
    duo came right after eilene realized making the project alone was expensive as fuck
this is your fire type gym leader say something nice to her
  she liked azulims tweets before disappearing
    hobbyists  how can chuubas hired to do voice acting be labeled as hobbyists  luna wasnt alone in the beginning and akari wasnt alone in the beginning  noja was the only true independent that inspired all the other actual hobbyists that poured in
  this image is missing some tummy
  in hindsight and looking at mikoto now i kinda wish those jokes about kuons va being hired by nijisanji were true
akari was created by both duo and eilene you fucking idiots and her va is a professional hired va holy shit eops  also eilene wanted to make a netflix anime with akari no joke
    duo site says they started working on akari in august akaris first video was released in october
   and her va is a professional hired va     akari was maias literal first job you moron she wasnt professional at all when she was hired
  her activity just kind of fizzled out for some reason and now we havent heard anything from her since these tweets  thats the entum curse
  maia voiced some mobages prior to voicing akari
   interestingly toto seems to be still alive
  aoi sora  now those are good examples especially sora note how she started just two friends hired to promote some shitty product that nobody cares about and instead they did daily videos with one stream a week because of aichan now look were sora is acting as an idol and at the front of a group of vtubers with multiple live event  i really dont understand how people can deny that corporations didnt put their dirty claws in this hobby
  im not 2dhater and im not really sure why you and so many others are trying to pick a fight with me and desperately win an argument against me when im just trying to have a civil discussion here my issue is not so much with the 2d or 3d models but the type of content that most 2d vtubers make they just play video games and chat on stream you also have some 3d vtubers doing the exact same thing so the issue isnt really about 2d or 3d but that this is essentially the exact same type of content that every other traditional streamer has theres no catch to this type of content and since theres no catch they wont be bringing any new people to the scene and if theyre not bringing in new people whos even going to be left here in a year or two my worry is that most of the audience in vtuber scene is going to be consolidated by a few streamers while the lesser channels and most 3d nonstreamer channels will have to close shop     you can do a lot more with a 3d model and mocap than 2d with facerig the way i see it theres no future for 2d chuubas they cant really innovate or change their content unless they go 3d theyll just be stuck playing vidya or voicechatting this is not an issue with 3d vtubers because their only limit is their creativity and imagination and budget i guess of course there are exceptions and im talking in generalities here not absolutes so dont point me to some dying channel of 2d chuuba making high effort unique content to prove me wrong     thats nothing unique to vtubers people dont just watch lets plays or twitch streamers because of the game they play most of their fans like the personality of the eceleb theyre watching and their community you seem to be missing my point about the lines between virtual youtubers and standard youtubers/streamers blurring and the former eventually turning back into the latter my concern is that the virtual livers will kill the scene before that happens
  god i love nerus stupidly cute improv songs
  tldr
  im not 2dhater    stopped reading there
  whatever you say 2dhater
  is she actually with entum i thought she was but they dont even list her on their site
  good thing popular nijisanji are 3d huh
  their only limit is their creativity and imagination  3d isnt magic you know  they can do exactly the same things but in different styles just like animated movies made with 2d and ones done in 3d
  this has her under entum  
  my worry is that most of the audience in vtuber scene is going to be consolidated by a few streamers while the lesser channels and most 3d nonstreamer channels will have to close shop  this is literally the opposite of what you said before 2dhater    people will get tired of this type of content as they usually do and move on to something else
  what site are you looking at    right here between neets and midy not a very flattering artwork
  she joined entum a couple of months ago dunno if she is still enrolled under them
  whoops youre right i missed her there thats on me
wheres the imagespam
  already happened during the pockymans shit event
  barely any screencaps of the tournament were posted what are you on about
  hes going to die if he doesnt shitpost please understand
  achan
  
  wtf i opened this pic and now im pregnant
  いわいわいわいわいわいわ
  artist sauce
  and whos going to be doing that do you know how much effort it takes to make 2d animation why even bother when some guy or girl with a cute anime avatar is going to be making more money and will have more fans by simply playing some video game its not profitable and it will be insanely demoralizing to any such content creater  9999 of 2d vtubers use facerig or some similar software they cant do exactly the same things but in different styles because theyre limited to a fixed avatar that just stands in one place while they provide commentary to whatever they are doing theres no limit to what 3d vtubers can do which makes them potentially not only superior to 2d vtubers but also to traditional youtubers
poor kaede she will never have friendly battles against other chuubas and shes also doomed to only collab with old men in some pokemon tv show
  you may not like it but this is what the ideal male body looks like
  iwanaga
if someone hebi showed us that going 3d takes no effort
  she put a lot of effort into her 3d model though
  
  hebi is a legit genius though
theres plenty of male vtubers in the scene too bad that they do not stream as much as kanae kuzuha x kanae would definitely sell to fujos though
  the man who saved this fad
むぎむぎむぎ
  whats with the dumb gloves  how can she play video games like that
  the same way as cheater cat
  she uses her bare hands instead of her bear hands
  that picture is brutal
  fujos dont bite for some reason i think theres some sort of taboo on shipping in voice fetish crowd and general fujo audience avoids vtubers because its considered normal otaku zone
  delet
  ahogao
  if youre going to pick on someone for being stale mito is one of the last ones you should be flinging shit at  in fact all of this started with her and her style she is the reason the bar is so low  2dhater  wanting the 2d to be better is not hating them embracing mediocrity is why the fad is full of mito clones even mito could be better but conformism prevents improvement
  we    neon is the new 月
  general fujo audience avoids vtubers because its considered normal otaku zone  holy fuck are you serious do they really think vtubers are too casual and below them they really are female neckbeards theres plenty of ago x gaku though
  japanese women fucking love male utaites though so its a bit odd i remember a long time ago some famous utaite got arrested for sleeping with a female fan who was underage
  niijisanji is the embodiment of if isnt broken dont fix it they took vys to the minimal possible expression and exploited it to infinitum and beyond
  mito because her fans are a lot more zealous  this is why they create boogeymen like the 2dhater the love the mud and the filth so much they dont want a chance for mito to improve
  sorry most 2d chuubas have such generic design i keep mistaking them for nijisanjis  youre right all 2d are just generic nijisanji clones
  in fact all of this started with her and her style she is the reason the bar is so low  no one else does anything like mito except maybe gilzaren and both of them put more effort into their individual stream concepts than anyone else so once again youre really just making yourself look like an idiot that has no idea what theyre talking about or at least someone who flies into a blind rage and disregards logic 2dhater
  so thats why people make fun of you
  wrong
        holy shit samefagging so hard from different ips to get around post limit even
  well youre not going to watch all those anime about male idols singing if you prefer cute girls right its like this      they like utaites and idols but not utaites and idols fucking each other
  kartes got her own thing going with this overarching narrative shes building its impressive probably moreso but its different than what mito does mitos like a western show where everything resets from one to the next and kartes like an eastern drama
  so is this why azulim didnt want to join because of retarded suits
3d flagship ai gets lets views than 2d mito even though having 10 times more subscribers  really puts mediocrity into context
  ok upset mitofan
  thanks to people like you who loves mediocrity
  the chad stride vs the virgin walk
  im not subbed to kizuna though
  my concern is that the virtual livers will kill the scene  underrated post but mediocre people like  will never get it
  dont upvote your own posts
  like 10 of them neither mama nor chadhime nor hisoka are 3d so no
  shes literally being carried by her guests she barely breaks 100k by herself
  heil mito      half of chocos body is just legalso mary isnt the tallest hnst right i think that was eli iirc
  in what world hajime is popular
  woah this school nurse succubus looks pretty tall
  niijisanji is the embodiment of if isnt broken dont fix it  nijisanji is the embodiment of being broken and damaged since the beginning
can we have an osu thread     what does /jp/ think of osu    post favourite beatmaps
  
  id really rather not
i really enjoy playing it and have been doing so for many years  but everyone who openly seeks out others who play this and every sort of community centered around this game is absolute trash and should be avoided at all costs

go to bed  wake up  thread was slid to oblivion and had to be remade  wtf /jp/ is supposed to be slower than this
  i blame all the idolshit
  more idolshit started popping out after the 4channel divergance  what did (((hiro))) meant by this
its been awhile since i played this game how do i stop my pet from drinking from wells would rather not recreate the experience my first character had
  why the fuck isnt this thread on the video games boards again
  why the fuck arent all idolshit threads on the music board again
  too fast and /rlg/ really hates us for some reason
  interact with your pet then choose  a talk  i other  b other settings  a eat items from your bag  then make sure your pet always has food on hand only hungry pets drink from wells
where can i find elona art that isnt from pixiv or twitter
  your own computer  start drawing anon
decide to give elona another try  cant suffer through the early game potential grind  stop playing  repeat    how do i break the curse without dying of boredom on a god damn herb farm id rather find a way to reliably earn potions of potential than play farmville indefinitely
  you dont need herbs to beat the game just dump all you bonus points into your weapon skill grab gear with resists and aim for 15 on everything
elona newfag here do they still update this game
  vanilla elona was discontinued years ago elona is regularly updated
  i dont seriously worry about my potential until midgame up until that point just use your skill points on your lowest potential skills buy some training with platinum if something importants potential gets really dire attribute potentials you can honestly just ignore early on go ahead and let them hit hopeless its almost inevitable anyway once you have money you can invest in magic vendors for a constant supply of potions of potential    really you should just do whatever you have the most fun with everything you do pays experience inefficient suboptimal play will still eventually make your character unstoppable itll just take longer
  never sacrifice fun for efficiency ever
  so what are the backstories for the gods
  once upon a time humans invented spaceships and flew off into space there werent many humans left behind to worship them so the gods panicked and started slaughtering each other wrecking the planet in the process  eventually there were only a few gods left compared to the previous number and only a small population of humans who were understandably upset about the whole everything got nuked in the godwars thing  of course that was about twoandahalf civilizational collapses ago so today nobody remembers it
  cunnyromi just wants some veggies dont overcomplicate it
ive been trying omake overhaul lately and does anyone know how the custom race/class thing work ive seen people mentioning it but i cant find anywhere how to do it
is there any compelling reason to upgrade e past 177
  damn what happened i dont remember these threads being so slow anyway i figured it out might as well post it if someone else is playing omake overhaul too  you can find the files in the data folder they are o_race and oo_class obviously make back up before modding the file is really simple so anyone can figure it out you can edit it with any text editor if you want skill ids and trait ids just copy them from the classes/races that have them the limb section is super easy to find so if you want to give the proper limbs to all debug races its simple    it would be nice if they added pic related to plus too that type of customization is nice to have
i updated the younger sister pack for elona v184 i really really need better faces for the npcs if anyone were to draw a 30x40 portrait of a younger sister id be extremely grateful  
sleep on an eastern bed during overworld travel  potential increases by 49  holy shit did they change something since i last played not even happy beds boosted my potential this much before
  ive found some pretty extreme variance with potential gains lately my happy bed can give me anywhere between 13 and 86 in potential and i have no idea why
  thanks for this
    and mani is just some human bloke that convinced lulwy to help him slaughter the actual machine god which is why hes just a dude with one arm as opposed to a robot
  youre welcome anon i guess as a forewarning now i probably wont be able to update it at all until around this time next year because of reasons
how do i go about making a mage character its been a long time since ive played this game and i never really got far but i dont want to make another warrior
  the more you use a spell the better it gets and less likely it is for it to fail also access to the mages guild helps facilitate easy access to spellbooks and thus replenishing your spell stocks becomes really easy
  get a couple of pets to draw enemy attention away from you and blast shit from afar the only problem i have with my mage is that my damage output seems kinda weak compared to my meele and ranged pets i feel like a back up character healing and buffing then while they kill every big bad guy
  isnt that just the e version of the story      basically you want a high magic stat and a high skill level in whatever spells youre using for damage youre gonna need a lot of books so join the mage guild its better to specialize in a small number of spells than to dabble in everything magicelement damage magic dart crystal spear magic storm is good since it works on just about everything in e water element damage is least resisted unresistable damage type its base damage is bad but it should work well against bells and such wet enemies also take more damage from lightning but i dont know whether lightning or magic is better against a wet enemy with high lightning resistance    i just use magic for support healing and convenience but im given to understand that like martial arts magic damage has a somewhat weak early game but eventually outstrips weapons in vanilla pure magic users are generally considered more effort than theyre worth but in e theyre a top tier build if youre in omake overhaul then theres a spellmaking system but i dont know how powerful it is late game characters tend to wind up with more mp than they know what to do with so it sounds like an expensive highpower custom spell would be useful
  damn mani is metal
  are the elona threads too slow for the new 4channel jp/
  quick spam post pointless progress updates
why are younger sisters so great and why should everything be younger sisters
  why would hiroshimoots domain autism change anything
  who knows  but these threads are dying faster than usual these days
the last time i played elona was when they added the necromancy stuff should i play e or ecustom  which one has more english translation
  custom adds more translations but some stuff is still only placeholder text customg replaces all placeholder text with machine translations
  custom it is then whats a fun build to play the last time i went necromancer and just summoned shithoad of skulldragon and wreck shit even chaos bosses can i still do that
kumiromi
  cummyromi
kumiromi is gay the best goddess is obviously yacatect
bleh what was the alchemy throwing sword damage based off of in e again was it the alchemy stat/ magic device stat or anatomy stat im kinda tempted to make a char that just throws chestnuts and swords at people
how the hell do you get custom music to play editing musiclisttxt and putting the mp3s in the music folder in the user folder does nothing but make it so that no music plays at all
  disregard this im a fucking idiot the game folder has to be on the same drive as your mp3 media player codec
    speaking of which ive created a music pack consisting of kemono friends and yuru camps soundtracks    
  damage is based on the swords displayed level which is based on alchemy
  so theres no additional multiplier based off of magic device or anything else im considering whether i feel like naturally grinding alchemy for it or just inheriting a sword down
is collageanon still alive are you coming back
  didnt he just randomly stop posting one day
im not a /g/ what should i do to make the midi files not fucked up
  the first step would be to go into more detail than fucked up
  he did say something about taking a break a bit  guess that break is neverending
  is it a consistent problem that is youre sure its not just elona randomly altering the midi playback like usual
  yeah i believe its consistent
  which os are you on windows 7 windows 10 mac linux
  windows 10
  have you tried playing the midi files in a media player do they sound like you think they should or the same way they sound ingame vernis would be pop01mid
  it played perfectly in foobar but when played in windows media player it was the same as in the game
  what soundfont do you have foobar set to use
  i use florestan basic gm gs
  have you changed windows soundfont to that soundfont using virtualmidisynth or whatever or is windows still on the default microsoft gs wavetable synth
a aint played this since around the time elona g was made i remember i edited it to have marking then lost interest is it still the latest variant
does anyone know why anno went insane
  yeah its still being kept up to date
did somebody ever finish that elochat mirror id gladly host a server if i had access to the files
  i dont think jdstroys server ever progressed beyond chat not to mention that one time someone made arbitrary text appear as ingame event messages for everyone if theres any source code for any of that stuff published anywhere online im unaware of it
so i never tried oo what major changes should i be careful of when coming from ecg particularly gameplay changes that would cause muscle memory to get me destroyed
  youll need about five times as much platinum as youre used to and potions of potential arent going to do as much for you pets will probably be several orders of magnitude weaker and less useful as well
which pet not the little girl should become my shopkeeper      min plat cost is very high and still goes up  pots of pot suck dick  pets are super broken because they get max potential super fast via kuroromi/fox goddess food while you gain less than 1 for eating 100 god blessed foods far better in comparison to you than in   you need to manually drag pets to town to train them then put back in shop no just paying the register  the main interesting feature the god miracles come at such absurdly high levels for a version of the game where you gain skill so slow you will have probably done everything worth doing before getting them unless noyel grinding with a book and even when you have them their costs are so high that outside of the gods who use rocks they arent worth using ever and even for those goods theyre very underwhelming  you can make your own wep but its limited having very few weapon options despite the focus on specializing via feats only good if you specifically want to use swords and even then very meh  despite all of this its not actually very hard the aforementioned specializations let you start with 100 extra damage simply for holding the right weapon and the content is so low leveled thats enough to trivialize the game via simply dungeon crawling and completely ignoring quests  in general its slower and more tedious than  because it focussed on adding options on how to play the game over qol but the options it added arent as good as what  added nothing remotely comparable to necromancy  some guy released a cheat edit of it where you can ge tlike 15x plat but id still not rec it over just playing   making a god is a neat concept i nearly made one but got stuck at what its wep should be and lost interest when i saw how limited their miracles and items are
  a robot little girl
  pets are super broken  huh didnt know that i had figured itd be more like vanilla with you having to trade up pets regularly
  seems to be a common misconception the god food is insanely effective on pets for how easy it is to stockpile since theres no limit on blesses per pray far as i can tell and the busted bread recipe is infinite easy nonrotting food
newfag here came after watching a youtube review of this game any tips for a new player
  everything be younger sisters  i am pretty sure there are mods that do this and i dont mean just sprite changes
  he didnt just randomly stop one 1 anon here said he didnt like the collage ops and made his own thread collages anon then took the opportunity to take a well deserved rest      read the pastebins ad the wiki for some begginner tips other than that id advice to just go in blind for your first character and have fun with whatever curveballs your life in irva throws at you
  sounds great seems like a fun game going with a farmer for my first time through
  play its less tedious if you use a pet thats it gj gg you won the game is done nothing can deal with how fast pets grow
  its a lot more like vanilla elona its slowerpaced and only really has north tyris content youre not expected to learn every skill and even learning half would take a good long while there are tons of special types of random nefia dungeons with interesting gimmicks different types of monsters fight against each other adventurers can be encountered in dungeons and are overall a bigger part of the game
  farmer for my first time through  youre so fucked    and it will be the best fun youll ever have
  i got wiped 5 times before i called it quits with that character managed to invest in a few shops and inns before i got royally screwed by random encounters it was 1000 my young girl carrying the worthless farmer that i was
  sounds like youre doing fairly well for a new player next time id suggest focusing on equipment initially and not investing in shops until youre wellestablished and want to buy lots of items from them a full set of 2 gear will make you and your little girl much stronger  assuming youre playing something from the elona branch town blacksmiths can enhance your equipment and the first couple of pluses are reasonably affordable
  farmer is pretty freaking good if you can get some combat skills asap i suggest picking up sense quality then talk to the fighters guild about getting inside
is there any way to fill empty bottles at wells or am i trying to game the system too hard
  mix empty bottles into the well    obviously only works if the well is filled
  take hypnosis or in e strings assassin feat in the beginning to get a huge leg up in the early game theyll give you special actions that 100 will never miss no matter what the hypnosis special action does only minor damage but inflicts sleep on anything not immune to it blade strings does tons of damage and will oneshot anything in the early game both abilities use stamina which you want to avoid running low on or else youll slow down fall down stairs and fail at special actions you also want to rely regular attacks when you can so those skills go up    dont do any investing until your character is established money should be spent on equipment you especially want pv have a means of teleportation to escape from trouble the dimensional move feat will give you a short ranged teleport that will never fail even if you have status ailments but some people think its a waste of a feat consumable scrolls and rods or learning teleport spells are your alternatives
  doesnt strings assassin require the tactics skill to do serious damage besides if were talking featbased crutch skills for a farmer why not take the magical plant knowledge feat and aim for violent garden his little girl could keep him covered while he did harvest quests in yowyn and as soon as he hit l30 gardening hed be set
stamina cost in g is so nice no making my food in batches after holding 5 until my finger gives in to regen stamina at the pathetic default rate      pick the little girl pet  take the sleep touch feat this never misses negates most of the threat from most enemies in act 1  take the plant feat at around 30 gardening this 1 shots every basic enemy in act 1 on the entire screen and never misses  other feat doesnt matter  pick a god kumiromi or yacatect yacatect is best second since you can use cash from farming to simply buy her faith via buying cheap jewelery   hide behind the little girl and bad touch anything that bothers you go to yowyn farm drink from wells fuck the downsides you have a super high chance for a wish get 7leagueboots when you get that wish   take missions to escort people farm repeat decide if the game is for you or not because repetetive taks like this is the meat of the game  buy a farm at some point buy a shop put a pet in the shop set it to food sell food   your primary goal is to get the shop up and running then you can just drown any issues you may have in money
  i tried virtualmidisynth it plays properly in wmp now but no change whatsoever in game
  you might need to select a different music device in elonas settings
  i havent tried strings assassin on a character who doesnt have the tactics skill at all but for any character who didnt start with it id recommend tactics as their free skill they choose during character creation even a brand new character with a tactics of 1 should be able to oneshot the great majority of what they encounter    violent garden is a great option but its not really a solution for someone whos getting slaughtered right out the gate going to yowyn at level 1 and staying there until 30 gardening sounds unbearably tedious the best option is to take string assassin at level 1 and then magical plant knowledge when at or near 30 gardening theres no need to be stingy with feats in e there are only a few important ones especially now that the ascetic line is a waste and you get more than enough points to take all of them      by the way a new player should definitely be playing elona custom or elona customg omake overhaul has a lot of great things about it too but its much less beginnerfriendly has a super grindy early game and is much smaller in scope    theres not really much reason to play vanilla elona given those other options
  waiting for anons report
starting out the game have two little girls tried to do an escort but full party so i had one girl wait at the town but i still cant accept is there something im missing
  pets still count as being in the party if they are  waiting in town  dead  staying at your house  on a ranch  running a shop    pets no longer count as being in the party if they are  staying at the dojo  staying at a discarded ranch  fused into another pet via gene machine permanently gone  abandoned through pet dialogue permanently gone
  you get one additional party slot for every 5 points of charisma you have
  so what do i have to do abandon them till i got enough dosh for a discarded ranch
  dump them in the dojo  find gear with  charisma  dance sing whatever else raises charisma
  also if you want pets without worrying about the cap so much use the undead you get 3 for free from the cemetary
  worked at last thank so much
  dance sing whatever else raises charisma  definitely never try to entertain at the bar in vernis or whenever guards are nearby being a lousy musician is punishable by stoning
  some shitty musician starts to openly rape my ears with the worst performance in recorded history  cant even ignore him staring at shenas ass thats how bad he is   a few stones to the face is getting off easy
cool  onee san  yacatect
  buying and selling items will train your negotiation skill which will train your charisma in e engagement rings come with 5 to charisma theyre fairly common even in the puppy cave and its not like youre doing anything important with those ring slots
  yacatect fucks old men for money
  yacatect the godness of whores
i dreamed that elin was completed and had a translation
  i dreamed that noas friend didnt die and ano didnt turn into a degenerate
  that sounds like a nice dream
please dont kill yukkiris   all they want is lovewarmth and something to eat
  and they will get all of that a nice warm nest and lots of love even when theyre being brats
  why would anyone want to hurt a yukkuri those people should take it easy okay yukkuri get loved  hugs yukkuri
i wish yukkuris exist so that i can make an abyuse labyrinth for them god i really want to make those farm thingy like those in bigg comics its my dream to make them suffer
please dont kill yukkuris because watching them cry and roll their bodies around in a tantrum is way funnier then a pile of goop
is it okay to post abyuse here
  you stupid wanna die
  sure yukkuri threads welcome all
ill keep a couple of yukkuri preferably a patchy an alice couple and love them spoiler them teach them pamper them and treat them even better than actual people they will be my family but at the same time ill have a room dedicated to abusing and torturing other yukkuri both physically and mentally not caring if theyre niceheads or shitheads depends on the type of abuse i wanna inflict and the type of reaction id like to see i love yukkuri so much but also hate yukkuri just as much such a complicated mixed feeling raging inside me
id never abuse a cute patchouli they are precious
  you can buy a game called yukkuri diary  and you can murder them in millions    
i cant mating press those things    what a tiny worthless being haha
the very existence of yukkuri is a mistery to me they completely lack any purpose or charm not being autistic enough its a strange feeling
  lack any purpose    wrong they are eat able every different yukkuri have different flavour inside of them  so they are seen as more like we see pigs    or others see them as pets
  youve never tried then
i wish yukkuri booru received new content more often
a love song about yukkuri     you are my little lovely yukkuri   i will put a strawberry in your mouth  i will put sausage and cucumber   and i will pour a bottle of milk in your cup    you better have a rest and eat well  because in the future you will be a beautiful creature     you must eat a lot and have a rest often  to be big and so nice  eat my sunshine my little angel   your little babies are getting fried     i will take your children and take your friend and i will burn them in the oven and i will give them to you my dear    you will be strong you will be fat   and together we will go to /jp/  we will catch anon and fry him up  and together we will have a lovely dinner    my fat fat sukkur   after the milk i will give you blood   drink carefully dont choke  oh you my little bitch oh you my little angel  yu yu    then i will go to the shop and i will bring your friend your lunch will be the biggest in the entire world    you will become too big to a large bitch  i will be proud of you and then
happy end
a stray yukkuri family have sneaked inside your house and declared it their new home what do you do
  just give them an ultimatum ill buy a yukkuriarium food and tell them they can live there only if they let me keep my house or else i kill them all
any favorite artists other than bigg and takumi or other big names who produce quality
  
anyone know where to get darksnow13s eight views of yukkuri script the mixtape link is 404
  what is that
  its a sanny taking a sanny
you faggots keep saying that you love your yukkuris yet everytime there is a /jp/ meetup i have to clean up their poo poos horrible mishter humans you guys are
  look sakuya there is a lazy faggot who is refusing to do his job what do you think what we must do with him
killing a yukkuri should always be a last ditch effort to correct their behavior    
  i fill a bucket with water hell if they are small enough a glass should do
  licklick achy place    strange disturbing thoughts are filling my mind
is it bad that i have been acting like a shithead yukkuri after reading a lot of abyuse comics i have been  fantasising about getting abyused by my crush as if hes my abuser and im his yukkuri is it weird should i get help
why is /jp/ full of faggots
  fuck off marisa this is your yukkuri easy
    no continue living out your fantasies    i regularly fantasize about owning a yukkuri family and spoiling them on purpose only to either watch them die out of old age their own failures or by doing a 180 on their treatment without abusing them to death but making their lives unbearable compared to the luxury they had
  i volunteer for mating press punishment
  no yu
cool yukkuris
  cute yukkuris
careful /jp/  i hope you can distinguish yukkuri from humans  
  interesting comic thank you for posting    i have a theory that master human had  a paranoid schizophrenia and was hallucinating and he killed  not a yukkiri but his wife
buying pet clothes seems like a waste to me
  just get some diapers or a yukkuri dress
  wife  no way in dude not with this panel unless theres something i missed    the other sakuya might be gold but it seems like sakuyatypes are pretty nice if they arent angered or angry for some other reason which makes this even worse since the uneasy misters sakuya was possibly just a nicehead with a shit owner the other mister from the beginning seems to have probably kept this up for a while so snapping at one point wouldnt really be a surprise for the sakuya what is a surprise is how it all ended in the first place if the yukkuri wasnt sakuya to begin with then mister is criminally insane if the sakuya really was healed by the orange juice faked being out cold then went out in stopped time and killed someone before he came back possibly as revenge then this is something else entirely it is literally states on the yukkuri wiki that you shouldnt leave a sakuyatype unattended and this really shows that if the latter is true but that brings problems of its own since it is unknown how or why the body is there especially when you consider that the sakuya is a yukkuri and the physical limitations mister really dug his grave here or rather he reserved his permanent spot in jail    following the supposed murder the connection with yukkuri seems to have dulled their senses to a point of questioning whether what the see before them is the real deal or if they might be following the uneasy misters footsteps in a different way under the very same hallucinations  there are those who love yukkuri and those who abuse yukkuri mister seems to have forgotten what a yukkuri is if the sakuya was a random all along
  
  fucking /pol/tards ruining everything
  not yukkuri
  there is this one faggot on here for the past few days making several posts like this  you can tell he blew in from reddit but wont fuck off
    this is one of my favorites all misery caused is from natural causes of yukkuri stupidity which makes it much more satisfying to read than human caused abyuse
saving yukkuris from page 10 death sentence
  that reminds me of that one pool with the femanon doctor who treats compulsive abyusers what a doll
emotionally abuse the yukkuri    
i just want to pinch a yukkuris cheeks and see tears well up in its eyes so i can then comfort it with treats and such
what are some pools where justice is served    
  those are some big phat yukkuris
  is that a tentacle monster
  yes
  tsundere compost yukkuri are cute a shame this looks like it wasnt finished though
  such big useless ears  she can have those trimmed downread cut off completely
  ohhh this is perfect  i just realized something /jp/
  take them one by one  end the yukkuri menace   not a single one should escape
bullying is so satisfying
    name of the pool please
    yukkuri in house
  you like little hoihoi san
eajy
dont kill yukkuris
    perfect yukkuri image
  i want to marry that dosu
yukkuribooru updating so slowly
what the fuck is wrong with you people
  what is wrong anon you dont find this thread advertising friendly
i wish yukkuri wear real i want an alice or a shou so badly
whats a good yukkuri game these days
no violence or abuse below this line  ___________________________________
    what exactly is there wrong
    thats fine you dont need human interaction for yukkuris to die in a miserable way since they do it themselves
hello im new i have a question did these things come before or after the fluffies that a certain fandom spawned because i am seeing a shit ton of similarities between the two and the artwork made about them
  before and jissouseki came before yukkuri yukkuri came about as a failed artists hilariously horrible attempt to draw reimu and marisa
  gotcha thank anon
what is the eight views of yukkuri thread any hints    the marisa game  that marisa game
  suck my dick dude
  thank you spoonfeeding anon  ive been in these threads for years about which came first the chicken or the egg regarding yukkuris and fluffies
artist  takumi
not all alicetypes are bad    
  a failed artists hilariously horrible attempt to draw reimu and marisa  wheres this image nowadays
  it was actually a fucked up ascii art post either on 2ch or futaba
anyone know where i can get this    
  come on it wasnt that bad
  i wonder what would happen if you drained the yukkuri of their paste put it all into a ultra fine blender with different yukkuri type pastes blended it added either water or orange juice and blended it again and poured into something that allows it to flow into the yukkuri of choice like alice since she can practically mate with literally anything if her paste isnt included of course but i think alicetypes are important for the mixture to take effect so if the mixture isnt an even once of several types then have it be 5051 alicetype and 49 other with orange juice included i wonder if this would result in many different yukkuri types instead of one specific type or two as seen wit reimu and marisa types   truly a strange and interesting proposition  this can bring new things to the table and challenge the yukkuri lore with if this is even possible  anyone
  t failed artist
  there have been some comics where hybrids occurs from mixing pastes i recall a reimu/patchy hydbrid in stalk amputation  though that was an onthefly repair for an injury not a thorough mixing like you suggest
    shitheads
  too far not okay
  reminds me of this  
  well at least one video where yukkuri died in her sleep  
  remove yourself
  nothing wrong with light bullying  it makes them cuter
  no delete this  all kinds of bullying is wrong
  what about when they get bullied by other yus or nature
    bullied to death by nature is the best most satisfying yukkuri content
  agreed yukkuris by their own nature are so cruel selfish and stupid that they usually die in horrible ways without the help of people  its fun to watch that play out naturally without interference  seems the only way for a yu to live out a full and easy life is to be adopted by a kind mister and then not be a shithead
  how could anyone want to see hurt or bullied yukkiris
  sadists and psychopaths
  the appeal of yukkuri abuse to me at least isnt the actual abuse but how ridiculous the torture methods can be its somewhat entertaining thinking about what kind of sick individual would come up with something like skinning a yukkuri with a corkscrew

does sr views factor much into who passes      i was going to ask yesterday if the ones who dont show their faces ever passed before were these two more interesting compared to cute talking faces
  i too have no problems with them yet
  no because the girl who had the most views/ranked the highest did not pass
  the second one showed her face dude
profile pics lmao

  gross
  your point is that girl is still ugly even outside of her profile pic
  beautiful
  isnt this risa
  i see  who was that are there no more chances for other groups    20 i looked at yt archives and all they had were cartoon faces
  i hope youre not just baiting the nogis because shes really and unironically gross
  based and redpilled
bbut guysact like if you hate them too and i will sub again ree
  yeah i find her attractive too
  no shes seriously gross with her long pencil neck and disproportionate head not to mention ever since finding out shes sea  i just cant like her
  yeah seems like he is still at it   pa the tic
  lmao check this newfag
  if the ones who dont show their faces ever passed before  umezawa  hazuki      who was that  67
  cant wait for him to post hs numbers again
  ya
4th gens showcase
    ugh uglies
  is that katoshi
  lmao the middle one is literally harada mayu
  yes
images all from    
       apologychan and the prettier version of matsumoto honoka makes this gen worthwhile the others are shit for now at least
dont know about you guys but im at least interested in the american
  too busu hopefully she has a redeemable character
lets be honest here this is such a downgrade from gen 3
  7/10  7/10  11/10
4th gen sucks  2nd gen sucks  whatever hiragana gen will suck    yeah im done with sakamichi in 2019
  following all of them  groupmixers should apply themselves
  my new oshi cute
  she was great on sr
is there any stream for todays omitatekai
  my girl is cute
  レベルが違うんだよ  nothing will ever top this
  obviously
is someone who isnt a fucking faggot translating keyas shows
  gees is still doing keyakitte
i cant wait to see our new girls on tv
worse chomper than kubo holy shit
nogibingo mommy special  they are really hitting all my fetishes lately
  god damn shes ugly
  they fix those later on right
  my girl
where are the nogifags damage controls  it seems rather quiet here compared to other places
15 25 and 67 were sacrificed for this  no seriously fuck akip fuck the management and fuck the degenerative wotas
  damage control for what
  15s agency made her withdraw im guessing 25 67 didnt make it because they were active on sns
  weve seen their faces during showroom theyre all ugly
  lets be honest keyakizaka isnt better yeah those girls  minus the busu in the middle are good but they have yet to reveal the rest  every group will be getting 23 goodlooking girls and the rest will be as were seeing here   
  duh 25  67 both said they didnt make it a few days after the sr audition
  duh what they revealed that was the reason they didnt make it
can we not pretend we love the ugly girls this time
  some set their profiles on private some deleted their accounts altogether only after the audition did they start posting on sns again
  wasnt 67 the scandal girl
  fair enough
  no
      saves your abysmal gen in your path
  yeah i know but i meant that perhaps them being active on sns and having their accounts get found out factored into it i dont know if any of the girls who made it had their sns account discovered during the audition
  i like her vibe
  kek
  rumored boyfriend but she denied it on stream iirc
  the wotas found the twitter account of some girl named mayu who is she nogi 4th gen
  she did i remember watching that
  yeah tamura mayu but that account was found a few days ago after she had her name revealed im only speculating their twitter could have had nothing to do with it
  was there anything scandalous
  imagine having a tantrum because this delicious girls join the group  one must be an entitled faggot to do so
  its the enemy from goblin slayer anime
  if you ever feel disappointed towards us believe me we also have the same feelings towards some people out there were doing all of this because of our love towards the idol yet some of you seems cant understand that so whats the point of doing all of that
  damn this post surely triggered him quickly xd
  if you dont want to do it thats fine just spare me your cringy posts and tweets
  i like the one on the left but the other two are pretty average hopefully tomorrow is better
  finally real idols
soon
  so far yes but i usually wait a few months before i decide who i like or not that way you get them on variety to see how they act they do lots of practice and hopefully get more fit and attractive and then its easier to see who is good and bad
  theyre all cute tbqh
im in love
will they fix their fucked up teeth though they always do no
  shes very beautiful the ojousama beauty isnt my type but im glad she made it in keyakizaka
the problem with the 4th gens that theres no real standouts other than the fumika baba clone girl even the 2nd gens had more standouts but got screwed over with how badly they were handled by management anyways i dont see any on these new gens sans the fumika lookalike being a danger to the popular 3rd gen members in senbatsu
  only the really bad ones some like riria still have her fucked up front teeth
  riria doesnt have fucked up teeth
  her two front teeth are twisted inward at an awkward angle like aois were
  nothing wrong with her cute teeth
  do you mean the 14 something years old based solely on her look and age shes gonna be top the others have to step up their games and work harder
    she looks really cute in this
  this degenerate meme needs to die
  the burgers care way too much about straight white teeth lol  the ones with extremely bad ones will probably fix a little bit but the rest wont and thats good because its really cute
  just got in from work not bad not bad at all the one in the middle looks like she wants to kick my teeth in
    someone needs to shop her onto a bed with pov hands pinning her wrists down
    shes a princess and im just a street rat
  based
  thread is healed thanks himukochan
    those eyes shes so cute aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  i hope she made it and is not stuck in the spares group

  kanagawa saya shes a cutie
  oh good to know shes still there looks different though

  traditional japanese beauty  female oriented  the sakamichi vibe    10/10
  based
this comfy cutie to hiragana  imagine the comfiness
  instantly my new oshimen if she actually made it into kanji
  i think she is the most likely she probably put hiragana as her first choice and was probably the only one
  techi done right
  dont fucking insult karin like this bitchtits
  
  lovely 
    these two are joining keyakizaka  yep i think we won the battle keyabros
    cutie

  japanese eyes also think they look alike search her name
  god i wish that were me
  get a fishing rod
  let her hair grow long again and then just exist as the most beautyful sakamichi ever
was todays nogibingo episode the best ever nogibingo episode
  yeah i take my words back its the second coming of karin
    
  theyre talking about their likeness in that one profile pic not in general
  now that is a bad vibe girl
this lad will be thrown into keyaki  god have mercy
    i really didnt think i had to specify that
  dont bully our newest brown goddess
  i chuckled
  sorry i didnt play attention to her sr profile photo was too busy admiring 15番
  he will blossom into a fine young boy after the post audition makeover
  what does she do for a living now
  we could tell you have trouble making sense of japanese conversations and the concept of context were here to help if you have more questions
  maybe being a cashier at a konbini
  one day someone has to replace techi
  probably a neet considering she got fired from her agency for applying for a job elsewhere without permission
  thats fair they have really cute workers
  if you say so autist
  waiting in her home to apply for the next sakamichi audition
  seething
  google translate really was a mistake
  now thats a cute boy
  unf
  pretty much this

  i honestly feel secondhand embarrassment whenever i see her at this point
watching nogizakatte doko  no subs for 10 episodes straight  why are fansubbers so lazy  and im learning japanese before you tell me to go do that
  to be honest they are probably shit if they havent been subbed by now all the classic episodes have been subbed
has anyone claimed hiragana oshi yet
  yeah my oshi is memi
  waka
  bad vibes
  i thought it was her immediately but no sign of her mole threw me off
  shes really rocking that fat midlife crisis lesbian look thats so popular
  good vibes tell me who has good vibes in your mind
  mireiiiiii 3
  almost all of the gana girls are good girls but memi knows the kind of power she has
  perfect/10
  meant for   
  yes mei is perfect
  long hair mei  the world
  long hair mei is just poor mans ktk
  lovely
  memi had an idea of her strength but when she turned kasuga into mush with a wink is when she fully realised what power she had

  youre going to feel pretty stupid when nijika steps her variety game up
  is this kubos replacement
  she seems like a nice girl and your support is admirable but its probably best to start preparing for the reality of 二期生
  still the most beautiful of japan according to women
  seki is a 10
チャプチェじゃない
  nijika is a real cutie
  there is no bad episode of nogidoko

new batch of keya girls for today
      new gen keya keeps getting better and better
  shes beautiful    shes cute    she has a strong jaw
  very good    i didnt know this busu made it unfortunately ended up in my keyaki    akbusu tier    where the fuck is 35chan
  didnt this girl get revealed yesterday or does she just look extremely generic
  which number was this was she faceless
  whyyyyyy
cocoichi de happy campaign video with miipan takechan and meimei eating curry    
where is 44
  any cute girl that is not the chosen push must be nerfed
where is 43
where is 35
where is 15
    busukawa
stop liking the new girls     muh og harmony    muh subs
  but by that logic oshi2 and oshi3 would be kitano
2nd gen already performing with 1st gen 21 kita  
goodbye waka
  goodbye
  nice    long hair pls    oh a obasan made it
too many busu im very pissed lads
hahaha very funny management not showing best girls 44 and 35 until the last day very sneaky haha
where is 71
  id rather have few bijin in a pool of busu so i can pick my oshi easily
these girls are way too old
  shut the fuck up pedo virgin
  lol
  no an idol becomes worthless at 25 so if they join at 16 we get 9 years of worthwile idol compared to the 5 years of a 20 year old these girls arent getting any younger and keyaki are going to need to be searching for a 3rd gen pretty soon
  no an idol becomes worthless at 25  said like a genuine pedo
  liking 16 to 24 y/o is pedo
  i would have erika at any age at any rate at any cost
  i dont get it shes a beauty even before the idol treatment definitely stanning
  why did you compliment him
  gosh i love her more with each passing day how did i never notice this cute imperfect japanese girl
    is she the only asian girl you have ever seen
  are you anglo
did you spot the new backdancers
  no
    yes
ara ara
wew i can understand techi a year ago because they were constantly doing activities but now that kanji and even she doesnt have that much anymore she kinda annoyed me with that lazy performance now i feel that shes just playing special i didnt even notice the new members smhfam
despite kanji being shit for more than a year already i just want to say i still love my girls risa nen sugai yuipon koike fuyuka and satoshi i will support them till the end
  you forgot aoi
  sugai yuipon  and you were off to such a good start
  based cultist
so who is the predicted hiragana 3rd gen member see if anyone can guess
  its 23
  its 15
  its 71
only 4 girls left out of all those that passed i hope you people are prepared for the likely possibility that your girls dropped
  if 44 isnt in i shall drop kanji
techis awful performance today is disrespectful towards the new members desu this is one of the defining moments of their life
  janny pls delete this post its problematic
  lmao i dont miss that brown shit      i know my list is great isnt it all great girls
  this was a very rude post apologise please
  aoi more like aoiiiiii shiet lmao
  anyone got that top left picture of naachan in high resolution
  his dp or from the mag its a mobame pic so this is the highest available
  imagine giving a fuck about aoietty when hiyotan exists
  aoietty btfo and never drew a dime to hiyotan
stage likes matsuda rina    wtf shes fuuchan tier our taste is better
  none of them is a draw both suck at being an idol but hiyotan is 10x more goodlooking and cute
  yikes
      damnit management where is my 35chan
  rumors say she was dropped
  but that was just a rumour right
  instagram when
  fuck if i know all i know is im dropping sakamichi if she was dropped

  nice awkward english friend now go back to stage
  i fucking love you my underrated oshi
  lolwut
  he is australian
  shes mine i posted that
  found my new okappa oshi
i lold at techis performance she looked so lazy
  could it be that the rumors about her not wanting new members in the group be true after all i mean im no fan of kanji but she showed zero effort even i got pissed
  fuuchan tier    so goddess tier
  thats not even a rumour
what is this new narrative you are trying to push anon it was the typical techi performance none lazier than all her other performance of the past year stay seething that people actually love the new gens you attention seeking subber
  im not even a techi cuck but you fucks are  delusional brainlets if you actually believe such a joke of a rumor is true
goodbye richard
nibu appreciation post
i miss her bros
  imagine those boobs in a lewd pb
  i want to nibble nibus nips
  hello sensei
oof i thought you guys were fucking around with the techi thing holy shit she was lazy as fuck even by her standards     
techi performs with her all like a sperg  complains  techi has one bad night and performs off  complains

20290742  shit bait   not even worth a you
  mad noob bad noob
this is far and away my favorite sumi doujin probably my favorite bit of fan content of her and if i had a top 10 hdoujins itd probably be in there its really really fucking good the unfortunate side of this is that it really effects how i treat and think of sumi as a whole its not that i really dislike her or anything but end up bullying her anyway   sorry sumi you dont deserve this at all but youre just so so cute when you cry
  those nose things are really mean why not find a better less harsh way to make her cry
  theres also a lot of oral and rape and body control which is all hot as sin especially the last one probably the best body control book ive ever seen not that theres a lot of competition     why not find a better less harsh way to make her cry  because sexy
  thats one of the reasons i dont read h doujins
  body control seems like its going a bit too far seems worse than rape no struggle at least with rape or torment shes still in full control of herself technically do you not feel upset or sad at all when looking at those that go that much further than just rape if so youre a lucky fucking bastard have you ever had any cognitive dissonance stemming from these interests
please stop posting dorks /jp/ is supposed to be a cool board
  well normally its not a problem 95 of the time i like the touhou enough outside of porn and/or theyve got enough nonh stuff for a good fap to not color my opinion so severely neither is the case here its also rare for a porn book to be this good      theres as much struggle as there is with bondage i dont see the issue     do you not feel upset or sad at all when looking at those that go that much further than just rape  have you ever had any cognitive dissonance stemming from these interests  oh definitely i love me some rape but when it goes into say mind break that just makes me feel awful another point for this book that doesnt happen which is unfortunately noteworthy for a noncon scenario
  you didnt deserve that game and everybody knows it you chuuni shit
  that anon is not sumi  or is he
  cant discount the possibility    sorry for posting gross stuff of you sumi i wont stop but i am sorry at least a little
sumi deserved the game  sumi deserves all games  sumi deserves your game
  your game  sorry sumi copyright is a bitch thanks for the offer though
  now whats going on here
  im not sorry at all for making fun of her bed wetting problem she deserves the abuse anyway
  i just want a game with merry  renko is that too much to ask for
  why would you want a game with sumis gay granddaughter and her gay girlfriend when you could have sumi instead
  i want to cum into her gloves what do
  body control anon werent you listening
  source
no peeking
nicoms/sm34223069
  no panties with a short skirt you reap what you sow sumireko
  theres like 10 translated sumi doujins and this thread has all the info youd need to find it among them dont be lazy anon
  but im your boyfriend
  sumi a shit
  sumi a best
sumi is fucking trash
sumi is fucking best
  cute sweater
  i want to treat sumi like royalty so badly
  sumihime
  yes
would you let sumireko copy your homework if she asked she couldnt do it because she was too busy sleeping
  i dont see why not
  id purposely show her homework that was done  wrong in an obscene way as a joke later id laugh at her when the teacher yells at her
  ill show her my wrong homework on purpose so we both end up in makeup class together
is there an image of her glasses being snapped in half if theres one thing i hate is megane girls    no and id tell the teacher about it before she gets a chance to do it
  kill yourself right now or at least get the fuck out bully her all you want but there are certain lines you dont cross you son of a bitch
  theres shit taste and then theres this guy
  ウサミーです
a walk in the nature with sumireko
    i want to throw her glasses on the floor and stomp on them with my boots
burger
  why are those slut hags trying to get sumi to wear slut clothes
  renko and maribel arent sluts
  if anything sumireko is the slut  only sluts wear glasses
  no
sumireko when she goes fishing
  in the middle of the city
  whats wrong with fishing in the middle of the city
did you know that real sumireko didnt appear in nightmare diary at all the sumireko that fights you at the end is actually a doppelganger
sumireko usami fishing
  sumireko stronk
why does sumireko like pandas so much
  because theyre cute
  why is sumi so beautiful lads
  i want to protect this fragile girl
  are you sure anon shes got a knack for getting herself in dangerous places itd be very difficult to keep her safe
  sumi can fcfking kill everytging she has fire and esp and gun she can move big stuff shes cool  strong she isnot weak
which touhou project character would you like to have sex with
  luna child shes very cute and sexy
  kaguya i mean dozens of guys really really wanted to fuck her and half a dozen of them were even willing to risk their lives for that so i assume shes inhumanly sexy or something
  i want to be a neet with kaguya and play vidya and watch anime all day    and mating press and creampie literally every 30 minute
  or maybe those guys where all a bunch of bums who just wanted to marry a girl from a rich family
  wasnt she raised by an old couple in a tiny house when she first came to earth
  even so shes a princess and she lives in a huge house full of people serving her marrying her will certainly result in an easy life free of work
  yeah but i think that was all after the whole marriage requests thing
the fortune teller
either alice or yuyuko
i want to use yuyukos ample ghostly mammaries for my own satisfaction

  most of them really but only under the right circumstances under the wrong circumstances youd end up dead or worse youkai pickup artist is one of the few hobbies with 100 mortality actually that could be a fun 4koma strip a ladies man outsider somehow stumbles into gensokyo  tries to be smooth with this or that 2hu then terrible things happen
this is evil idol chihaya miss sleazy kisaragi    she is sad because other idols will be celebrating christmas in their threads while chihaya gets left out because she is a loser    cheer her up say something nice to her
72
ill spend christmas with you chihaya   just make sure to bring your cute friend miki along
gonzalez
  will this thread even make it to christmas
  the previous thread lasted just slightly longer than a month chihaya wont make it to christmas
  oh dear
will chihaya threads ever go out of style
  of course miki will be there shes dinner
i want to breed with chihaya and starts a dynasty of flat chested warlords
  do not eat idols
  it was chihayas idea im not even a cannibal i dont eat people idols or otherwise
  why not
  thats not what she meant
  idoleating isnt generally accepted by society besides there are many better things to eat like filet mignon
  society can suck a dick
  ill take chihaya mediumrare    what side would be good
  the ass
    the breasts
  theres not enough meat on her to do steak youd be best using her to make a broth / stew
flat as a board
  the last 3 letters of the filename says hrt  is there a conspiracy
  what the fuck are you suggesting about chihaya
  i think you have found the cause of her loyal fanbase its not that she tastes good either
i got a new co worker who is as flat and slender as chihaya i cant the sexual pressure
chihaya kimochi
  i actually want to get full      good point
  that looks like an okinawan
  chihaya is so full of shit she bleeds brown
  whats going on
    chihaya is laying down in a puddle of melted chocolate
  looks like burnt motor oil to me
  she is sure into some kinky stuff
  like wearing shiny helmets and boots
  chis right hand is precious
  chichans right hand is a squid swimming happily
  explain
  
  chihaya signed the good friday agreement
  for both sides
  chichan is a major player
chihaya
    wow chihaya is number one idol for peace
  miss kisaragi tear down the wall
  chihaya squeezing out a treaty between the two parties by convincing them at their most vulnerable moment postorgasm
    bs haya supports 32csm    
  im glad to see the real history here
oh no /jp/ i think chihaya is trying to tell me something but i dont know what it is
  shes trying to make you cum inside her
  how can i do that
  shes telling you to wipe the sweat that accumulated around her panty area from all the exercise shes been doing please make it quick chihaya has things to do and places to be
  why did they orgasm
  chihaya raped them obviously
happy birthday
  chihaya is hanging on to miki in hopes some of mikis breast measurement will rub off on her
  they just get touchyfeely sometimes
  chi haya and the wife   watch an all new episode of this hilarious family friendly sitcom on channel 765
  is she vegan no suprise that she is flat
  local idol inspires global vegan trend
  meat consumption reduced over 72
  miki is already married to makoto chihaya the homewrecker
  tactical flat
  is that true nano
  hi chihaya
  what
  who are these sexy bodies
    i was just wondering what is going on with the difference here
  shut up  vegan girls are heathier than carnivore girls because they take vitamin pills to compensate their diet
chihaya smokes
  niggas with her colt m911
  vegan girls are heathier than carnivore girls because they take pills to compensate their diet  pills are not food
chihaya likes to hold hands
  niggas with her colt m911 
  even if we squashin the beef i aint touchin ya hand
  what a fucking slut
  is that a jojo reference
  what isnt
  this picture is visually pleasing thanks
chihaya looks so cute all of the time
  what is pleasing about it
      for those who dont know its an interesting parody of boris album feedbacker drone/noise rock/postmetal stuff which oddly enough fits chihayas personality nicely    if only there was a /mu/core album that featured jpop idols
  i think its the classic pose draw well with nice colors and proportions her chest is faithfully drawn too
  chihaya is only sometimes cute at the least and never cute at the extreme end of the opinion spectrum cute all of the time is definitely something hes not
  chihaya cant be cute
  check out koto  platonic planet idk if id call it /mu/core but its rymcore no matter how much i like idolshit ill be the first to admit its usually not the greatest quality of music japan has way better other music to offer take a look at pic related platonic planet is in there as well
  he
    my ideal christmas with chihaya would be that wed meet up in a jazz club at night we would chat sing drink etc wed have a great time and then of all sudden shed bring all her cute idol friends like takane or azusa and then chihaya would go away
    shoegaze idol group
im gonna eat a christmas cake with chihaya
  pancakes does everyone but chihaya a favor
  i want to sexual herras chihaya
natural ships    x haruka  x azusa    good ships    x takane  x miki    enjoyable crack ships    x yayoi  x yukiho     wasted potential ship    x makoto
  i wanna dp a christmas cake with chihaya
  chihaya will definitely not be around when the police discover azusas cold stinking corpse
  and the other 4  twins cant be separated
  where would hibiki fall under
  do they even interact
chihaya likes to fuck shota
  woman of culture
  woman of crime
  hibiki would passively bully chihaya ignoring her not inviting chihaya out with the others etc
  hibiki is a good girl
  yeah but chihaya is a weirdo who doesnt talk
  she talks to people who love her    like me
  chichans back is a treasure
  whoa buddy im at work
  chihaya doesnt care
  actually i do he needs to work so he can support me and our two children
goes chihaya into a bar
  ouch i should watch where im going
  will the monster be pleased or disappointed also surely that isnt all she wore into battle
  and what do you do
  disappointed theres not enough energy density
人間は愚か
jiiiiro
  support mea buy kissing noises
  this is not going end well for her    oh i see its only bad when its not mea earning the money derived of whoring herself
  shiloh
  this is not going end well for her  not really she only doesnt like yuri pairing and 本番 anything else is ok
  no i mean she is asking for more ruthless bullying
meas already making thousands isnt she shes doing quite well
  the fanmade shiro game will be released in 2 days
  i bet she wants to be bullied by the strong masculine penises

  when will they announce the results of the auditions anyway
  id main shota hunter
  11 views  how do you find these

best of bootlegs
hebikos new outfit is the cutest thing ever
  proud of her it shows that theres enough demand
  adventurer daughter
  fuck i knew it was a matter of time until the chinese started stealing my chuubas profits     i seriously hope these bootlegs dont damage activ8 appland or duos operations companies like exyss are big enough to be safe but the small companies depend entirely on their chuubas
  theres always been bags shirts and cosplay outfits made by the chinese you can find them easily they even of course steal fan art to slap on a shirt
  isnt the whole chuuba thing a side business for appland i thought theyre mainly a software development company bacharu worked as a programmer before he started with the whole vtuber manager thing
  if they manage to destroy nijisanji then the chinese will be the good guys
  19 minutes
oh my  
  what the fuck
    did they actually get wakamoto or is this an impersonator
  lunas suits basicallly setting a big pile of cash on fire by hiring norio wakamoto
      oh god why
monachan is live    
i cant believe cell is going to be the one to put luna out of her misery
    tsukichan sounds different

  nani
    get in here eilenebros
   watch  instead
surgeon akari  
  give that money to moemi you fat fuck
  karte story stream
  fucking hell eilene you should have given the money to yoriko shes literally dying
candy crush sponsor
  where the letter a this one look like i to me
karte is live with a lore episode  please support kartechan in all her projects and endeavors     
    she worked super hard to make this
was karte demonetized     theres no donation button
  please support kartechan in all her projects and endeavors  no thanks shes ultraboring
hero  
  it was obviously released out of order they probably wanted this one to be out for the notokuban
    thats not karte thats her big sis/bro
  shes just weird and probably turned it off  maybe shes feeling guilty over people throwing their money at her on stream
  she removed her superchat herself months ago didnt like people throwing stupid amounts of cash at her
wheres the akari lore episodes 
    colorful boxes get in the way of the atmosphere she is creating
     she removed her superchat herself months ago didnt like people throwing stupid amounts of cash at her  why
    eilene worked hard scamming retards to get money feed your alcoholic waifu yourself
  very low self esteem
note that karte does have a fanbox although she rarely posts in it  
  i karte like super rich
  like absurdly low self esteem  to the point where she didnt think she deserved all the charity people were tossing at her the first couple times she streamed with superchat
  its a girl
  its not always about money
    most of the time she even deletes her streams
whats eilene scheming     
  200 and  500 yen levels  only  thats virtually nothing    meas fanbox has pledge levels up to 10k yen  with the promise at each level being lol thank for the cash  
nomus first stream going  
  thicc and sticc    i love it
  what in the fuck is that american vtuber
  200 and 500 yen levels only thats virtually nothing    when she had superchat enabled she started getting 20k 30k 50k yen donations and she felt she didnt deserve all that money so she completely turned superchat off
  actually strictly speaking not true  over 50 of her streams are still on her channel but theyre unlisted and not in playlists  gotta lurk the archives for the original links to find them
  shes not posting often so maybe she doesnt want people to feel like theyre not getting their moneys worth  also mea is a bad comparison she has no conscience
  also mea is a bad comparison she has no conscience  and thats why i love her so much
karte is kill
anyone can decipher morse
  shes cute and i love her shutup vt needs more thicc sonico cant do it alone
  kon has nothing in common with nijishits this is retarded
  i love me some thicc coffee
  oh i didnt even realize the table is a kuma
cozylooking rin  
  at this point its just because you are retarded  you will like her regardless of what she does and the reasons she has
dayum she thicc
craft boss coffe will never be sold in my country    nomu why
how many of you fags even speak japanese
  that fanart and her model are not very jk looking
    maria
  凛
but craft boss taste really bad
  so ririas little sister maria died and somehow became karte as a virtual existence
  あなたは日本語を話しますか
  i dont even speak english
  why do you want to know
  speak  god no  id butcher it  listen  all day every day
  i dont speak it fluently but i know enough to understand most of whats being said not confident in my ability to properly speak it anyways speaking foreign languages youre not confident in speaking is a one way trip to spaghetti all over the floors
  good god shes got such deep lore
  id like to dive deep into her lore if you catch my drift
 this dork is so good at this game
i asked when last thread was mostly dying so ill ask again does anyone have the webm of haneru and the babuchi guy
  you arent asahi
  wow shizukura started so early today
how did they make tsugu such a disappointment what a waste of kino
  the only reason to like her anymore is if youre a lolicon before you could also like her because she was in some supernatural setting and probably a monsters cumdumpster but not anymore dumbest decision made in the entire scene
  as a side benefit to her existence though the tsugu ryona doujinshi on sadpanda are toptier
  何言ってんのこの馬鹿やろ
heros park
  nice  also it was about time they added modifiers in beat saber
  as long as its not something complex but it depends
  wha happen
when you manipulate peoples emotion with candy crush money
  gunna be honest this is singlehandedly the most cursed image ive seen in these threads every single thing about this image is horrible
  jesus f christ the cringe is almost palpable
  as long as they arent motormouths i can understand fairly well trying to listen to someone like icotsu or meika is a nightmare
  please go back this isnt a certain swedes comments section
  wakamoto using pmaru as cumdump confirmed
  i partially agree icotsus really hard to listen to but meika is only sometimes a really fast speaker and usually its when hes laughing his ass off at something at least in my experience hes understandable what really trips me up is someone like mikoto who uses a lot of olden language or whatever the proper term is but granted those people are pretty rare that or people who speak retardedly like luna
  for 2000 ill let eilene manipulate my ass all he wants
magical dolls stream  
mary  
  mea should just disappear for the greater good of the scene
ohebidesu  
based  
the hell is eilene getting 4000 anyway hes supposed to be dirt poor eating grass and shit
  eilene sold akari for a lot of money
  play candy crush
homosanji singing  
  did you even watch the video candy crush have eilene the money
 himachan   suzu    i thought she beat donkey kong a while ago i remembered she beat the final boss after an entire stream or something
  extra levels
post chuubas that are going to get the axe
  makes sense guess ill have to catch up on the stream i missed too after checking her channel thanks
  holy shit
  hopefully all the neo tubers get the axe hard
  now this is the quality content i love
  what the hell is wrong with robokos voice
lunas show will have ai and lisa as guests  
  what the hell is wrong with your ears
  chinchin
  sony money is going a long way now if only they could replace luna with pmaru so she can actually you know host a talking show without being retarded
  she was the only legit good one in that dumpster fire
  just what chestbutt needs a strong personality to overshadow her do sonys producers even know luna
  chinese are the scummiest race on earth and you should never believe their lies
  heavy edit cuts incoming
mary is too fucking cute god damn
  is that the second docomo commercial shes been in
  based
  robocos voice
mama
wake me up when we finally have our own virtual dead tuber
  the lovely eyepatch that aint jubei
    kartes morse deciphered
  karte is so sweet
watch this premiere with matsuri and nobu first part    
  is that neon
how did eilene go from having to eat grass soup in order to survive to have a deal with candy crush in just less than a year
  its a message from the doctor to kartemaria  つらい
  kartechan is putting so much effort into her lore
  kurumi i mean maria
  sonys cumpdump will have kadokawas cumdump and another sony cumdump on her show
  she sold beilenes sold to the devil
    nice i will dance my ass off to this with my friends in the club this weekend i will then proceed to go home with a random woman from the club with which i will have sexual intercourse
  this but with the ww collab song
  source on this lovely pedophile
  this but with the rusky hardbass song comrade
  
  cute mikan
  i like how ais voice sounds out of place in every track
  i really love karte thank you for living thank you dear patient
  dont forget to buy her some aichan merch bitches love ai goods
where is that kaiji pokemon collab
  it was exactly what youd expect from a collaboration between those two
  is this her actual alt outfit its cute
  buoooo buoooo buoooo
  
  5 minutes
hoonie  
something no one tried before virtual idols    
  premiere of ruri eating a watermelon hikaris lettuce stream ended up turning into something utterly bizarre but this is prerecorded so maybe its actual asmr
my favorite vtuber is doing an archiveless stream and i dont have my recording setup ready    curse my unprepared traveling
  chink cat
  my favorite vtuber is dead
sharupon  
  oh for fucks 酒 not again
that was the lewdest arigatogozaimasu ive ever heard mary
she did it if this is like literally any other donkey kong game theres probably another 2 left though
    3d peanuts
this isnt deceit  
  hai hai    currently seeing if i can set it up on a server i have lying around      i guess that kind of puts things into perspective    kurumi
    ayamina premiere
  im reminded of 
 chocosensei teaching soras girlfriend   tama   yashiro beatmania hes really good   sensei   my drunk mom
please watch  
my drunk mom drinking  
  lewd    during the awards stream ruri was saying she would buy binaural mic if she won but i guess it will take a while
  ichika being left out of the collab because she keeps sleeping with everyone
guys i think i really fell in love with comcast
  theresa fair bit more slurping than i was expecting
rin no aoi
  probably but also this video was taken back in august
how good is suzuki hina tanaka hime i liked their songs they sang to
  ok eilene but isnt chinak the most antigay country
  that doesnt even look like rin from the thumbnail get some glasses
  very good theyre both pro utaite
  aoiposter was poorly trying to coop the rin meme
  
  imagine being an out of touch /jp/tard and not even getting the most basic anime references
man aichan really wants to be a singer huh
  i said that to point it out and now hes trying to embarrassingly back down from it dont see why he cant just accept his joke was shit
  i wanna get a faceful of those tiddies
  apparently ichika had better things to do than show up for work  
  are there any other good ones like em i havent looked at others if there is a list of youtubers
  the idol shit didnt tip you off immediately that she probably wanted to be one when she was younger and that this is the closest thing now that shell get to her dream
  theres still one animare she hasnt slept with on stream anon i heard nanashi was last seen buying a large order of the impregnation calpis
      embarrassing
  this will be fun roboco vs shiina master vs tamakin and kanae vs ene right off the bat
  i got the setup working but singing cats stream is now imploding    such is life when your network is installed by cats
  what the fuck he can fc 12s  i kinda wanna see how good he is but he just keeps playing 4s
  shes restreaming on bili no idea how that sides doing
misaka kotone  
  i know but its sad its like watching someone with parkinsons try really really hard to be an artist
  hes really really good at rhythm games he did another stream of it earlier but thees only a handful of songs he can actually use without getting sued so thats a downside
rantarous about to piss her pants
  how could my joke be shit if you dont even get the reference even the neet granny would get it although this isnt even about her
  do you think kanae and kuzuha have fujofan
elis singing voice doesnt suit cute stuff after all  
   chocosensei teaching soras girlfriend  why is this succubus corrupting my pure chocochan
i know posting links is a bad idea but i like chink cat a fair bit  glad to see theres still a few anons here that are fans
  i never find the time to watch her but she has a good voice when shes not being overly cutesy
  god my secret crush is so beautiful
  i guess thats porbably because the hardest song require full concentration so you cant really speak while playing
  ive never seen damage control this frantic
new winks chink    it looks like this guy is associated with winks too  
    i know we shouldnt reply to obvious trolling but why is the aoiposter like this i like aoi but guys like him make everyone who like her look worse what did aoi do to deserve this hate
magical dolls  
its time  
our girl is live  
  fucking pussy  
  no holds shees thats like babys play compared to o2jam
  i wish i was fucking this pussy
    3dpd normalfag   ew
  how old is she actually  normally she sounds like twelve but her voice goes infinitely deeper when she wants it to
  14
is this picture real 95 of americans got it wrong
  man my wrist hurts just looking at that
  this time also was really great hopefully magical girls channel wont be banned after all that
  me on the left
rip uuum
    doubling down this hard just because you didnt get a simple anime reference are you that insecure why do you even care what people on anonymous board think of you
the animal kingdom is a scary place the weakest of the bunch hinako get viciously bullied and roadkilled by the strong
this is the weirdest long con ive ever seen is anon okay
patra
さすが あたし  this is why i fucking love kuromu
  if this was any other chuuba it could probably be taken as an insult as expected of the 天然天使
nanashi is an ai
what the fuck but i thought she was dirt poor and can only live by eating kusokusos    
  kusokusos  learn japanese please
fuck i love alices voice
  yeah where is she getting all this money from
vivdsyndrome and kumomo somehow managed to guess the password to the custom game    i wonder how
started my twitter account like a decade ago  only one tweet in my account made back in the 00s  only use twitter to follow a few old friends and a bunch of artists mainly porn mangaka but also musicians writers nonporn illustrators and of course virtual youtubers    my single old very old tweet gets liked by a seemingly desperate vy  pathetic and creepy but endearing  that said she apparently sings with her own voice but uses software for her nonmusic vids i dont get that shit  anyone got a quick rundown on セリーヌ
mico  
the inabagumi immediately surrounded and trapped her in a circle sasuga
  you have to marry her now
  i also got a like from her
  as expected of people that haneru considers her property
  my single old very old tweet gets liked by a seemingly desperate vy  its a bot
its time  
  starting in 12 minutes
 washi   ponpoko   ken   natori   traplover with a babiniku
 ken   akikun sushi
  doubles of truth  now that you mention it joined november 2018 13k likes  yep aaaaand unfollowed still desperate and pathetic but not endearing anymore
rukiroki  
  who and who
  ponpoko no
aichans live vod      she was in a great mood in this until toriip appeared for some reason
  yashiro and icotsu rhythm game collab when
kuromu seriously playing herself up after getting a kill is cute as fuck anon was right
haneru_lovesan
  the blonde cats voice isnt cute enough its a bit jarring
  its on
saibopapa just executed the entirety of animare while haneru begged for him to stop the inabagumi is cruel
  not only that but they picked everyone else off first before killing haneru and are now looting her body is there any fanbase more cruel
  haneru then declared him not a real inabagumi and yelled that hed better remember this for later  i feel like this happens every time they play with inabagumi
platinumプレミウム
aoi is upset
this is fine art
  is she upset that her only representatives in these threads are all morons
oh this team has hinako_love in it  hinako_love do your best  ah hes naked  sasuga  no wonder why shell never get monetized    shes glad all the inabagumis are killing eachother as well
  what the fuck is  this abomination  i get that its pork meat but what is this transparent thing
  what the fuck is that
  id be upset too if i had anons try to deny my accomplishments after having such a good run in the jav scene
ohebidesu again  
  i want to be that tissue
  its some weird attempt at shitposting like how moemihater was shitposting and falseflagging for months to try and get a thread split
  resin
  i want to touch her lips maybe kiss them but mostly i just want to see how they feel to touch
  or like how 2dhater comes off as an aifag but hes just here to shitpost and poorly attempt to create a tribal war
  are you the same anon who achieved some type of higher plane of existence after nutting to ai and weirdly posted about it for half a thread
  possibly do you have a link to that thread
  i think 2dhater is an actual aifag it lines up with the types of increasingly autistic posts aifags have made in the past few months marketingposter was pretty bad and disliked but not outright hated like that guy
when an akari door closes an ao door opens
  no but theres no possibly to it that post reads like someone as pathetic as him was the implication i was making
  the anon that had a thing for ais lips was a different one
  i didnt even remember that there was an anon who had a thing for ais lips was there such an anon
  wheres that new god damn costume ai you lazy whooooooooooooorrrrreeeeeee
  gotta fill the power vacuum
  
  what a cozy looking rin
eilene sponsored collab    
someone should tell nijisanjshill that everyone knows hes samefagging and he should stop having conversations with himself about 2dhater moemihaternofunposter mitohateraoifagaifag etc whenever hes triggered we all know dude just stop
  please have patience
  oh it went down already guess it really was too much
    i want to feel the comfy of rins breasts
i havent been keeping up with these threads so whats happened since the last 8 or so months
  guess i never noticed that post then also wow the most active people were in proving cheater cats cheats was around july that feels like forever ago    we all know dude  oh so youre getting upset because people know who you are and are deflecting instead using the same words they used to make a public embarrassment of you yikes
  kurumi came back yua broke 250k subs akari lore episode 1 was released
ahopinku  
  its not like he listens the more productive thing would be to tell everyone else to stop engaging with him
loli nora cat no  
  swap places with me i want to live in the timeline you live in      please stop samefagging
    and bararakaren came back too promising theyll never leave again
  nothing of importance fad is nearly dead nijisanjis ruined everything
shitposting hours arent supposed to start for another hour and a half at least offsiters
  someone keeps trying to kill aichan  inna universe they already killed love prof and culture prof ai
  a huge amount of shitposting falseflagging memes that consist of nothing but shitposting  but thats all still happening
  rip
  meh
  handjob maid and titty bat got monetized
  the none meme answer is too many things to summarize though having been around for a while any post like these asking for a summary are generally just some anons wish to get yous and start shitposters up
  are the vtubers so desperate that now all of them are taking the whoring route
  i think aihater is an actual nijisanjifag it lines up with the types of increasingly autistic posts nijisanjifags have made in the past few months moemiposter was pretty bad and disliked but not outright hated like that guy
  i was gonna refute you but then realized that most female chuubas were kinda whores from the start there was just no change there
  i mean go watch aos first video and then ask again
why isnt kuromu talking her mic busted
  vtubers got too popular that we cannot avoid envious shitposters anymore
      i see do lunas videos get translated at release or has it been left up to fans
  your namefagging aside dont do that by the way pretty much no one gets translated on release anymore usually it takes a week if they have reliable translators or some anons here will quietly push subs but thats gotten rarer and rarer hell nobuhime used to get all of her stuff stuffed within a few days to a week which was pretty fast for this scene but whoever her translator was left around a month ago
shiinari collab has 45k views on shiinas channel but only 12k on kuromus its not fair
    so its pretty confirmed eilene is not directly in charge of the natsumi moe channel the rat just granted comdost and the vocaroo girl a franchise and let them on their own without any kind of financial aid
  oh lord my secret crush is so hot
  it also had less live viewers which sucks and shiina has way more viewers on average then kuromu it was a slightly awkward collab at times so i cant fully blame them that being said kuromus pov was fun that one anon was right in that you can physically see her freaking out and seeing someone whip their camera around that fast with gyro controls is pretty cool
      i know that but this time is not subtle anymore they are embracing the thotness
meato is back
  again go watch aos first video
  it also had less live viewers  less live viewers in general for shiishii i meant worded that weirdly something like 5k which used to be her average before the pikmin stream i guess even though nowadays its 8k
  you forgot to add moemi has now her 3d model
  
high effort movie
  who the fuck has a single tomato on the side of a meal
  tsukino mito
  just the 2d ones virtually every single one of them is a massive thot nonthots are just too boring and plain to succeed as vtubers they dont have the voice personality and charm that the thots do well its not like its an issue unless youre gullible idolfag
  okay i believe you
  ohayua
    lets wait until the next moemi video will use this issue as the plot of a kusoge shilling video eilene promises moemi he will give money to her if she defeats him eilene wins and moemi is forced to humiliate herself with a batsu game
hanerus having way too much fun murdering innocents who can barely fight back zombie mode was a mistake
  dont get any weird ideas bud
  well its not like its an issue unless youre gullible idolfag  thats not a nice thing to say about all the 3dlovers
  theyre fucking dead
the mitortanic is sinking
  again i watched it im talking of the fad as a whole it started with kanna shishi and okome doing that forced swimsuit fanservice video
  no they survived incredible
mikoto is live  
hinakos going to crush someones balls
  im gunna put a fucking baby in this oni
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  suits are getting desperate since the fad is dying
safe mama for 4channel
    why repost it
the entire zombie train is after haneru
  at least theyre different sizes use your eyes  hardly the worst reposting we see around here

old man petting shiro
  what is this trash
  shit yo
  no problem  
  
  is that mikoto from 1st lostbelt
  thanks
  a graph measuring trend index and search frequency  those results are actually pretty surprising
  neon is best luna she even have a better chest
  r18  to think there was a time when such titles werent mere clickbait
  mitos the only one in the break area holy shit
  what even happened here is it worth a fap or something
aquas birthday soon  
  when i see those stupidly tall geta okobo that mikoto wears it makes me think of the seeds height chart where shes near the bottom  standing  paizuri
big twitter account on the spotlight
  i m a g i n e
  that wasnt me  t og moemihater
  this but unironically
just like my favorite cartoons
 midoriichigo midori pov   ichigo pov   ken
  i cant be the only one who hates paizuri its kind of boring is it weird to like huge tits but hate paizuri
good karaoke session
lucky warer
  i cant be the only one  as with all of these types of questions yes obviously youre not the only one however that doesnt make you any less gay
  im reminded of sasakis intermissions
  liking huge tits is already weird
  delete this right now water is pure unlike that used condom of a woman
  rip the 12th  dont use his name to shitpost thanks  and no luna videos arent transalted at release anymore and her channel went to complete shit after sony bought it
  
lost finally resumed in japan
  yes
  akari is cute cute
thats now how you do it  
  didnt know lost island had mobile connection
  its japan after all
  holy fuck this guys a hero ichigo no from him when
  i wasnt a big fan but then i had a dream where i was fucking aichans titties it was a real eye opener
oh no no no no no
  shes shorter than noja and hes already fucking tiny hes like 135cm
miria is the perfect partner
  i feel like big breasts are perfect for cumming on them but fucking them is kind of meh nothing beats vaginal penetration
  but then i had a dream where i was fucking aichans titties  thats both pathetic and hilarious because ai doesnt have tits
  oh no its even called screenshot what do we do mitobros
  nijisantura
found the image and reference on the archives  130cm 30kg
  why are these ninjas so wifeable
  i can understand that i used to hate cunnilingus but then i had a dream of eating nico robin and ive had a huge fetish for puffy innie vaginas since then
  but then i had a dream where i was fucking aichans titties  thats both enviable and arousing because ai has very nice tiddies
  thats a nice background and the exact opposite of what i expected from her considering how much of a lesbian she is id expect her background to be some anime girl or kemt
  so many whos
  finally the voice changer ojisan is gone now i can actually watch this
buy my stuff
  too seiso for youtube
  the gilz bookmark is cute id definitely buy one of that and homeless cat
buy all of it
if i have to see that fucking smug cat one more time ill  ill
just give it all
fucking go broke you neet
trap x ojiisan pee endurance collab  
  id buy at least a few but buying from japan is a pain sometimes so i might not bother
oh neat even one for all the groups including the fujoshi trio these drawings are all pretty cute too glad to see theyre not all just literally the facerigs put onto merch like most of the other merchs on display
rin pets the cat why wont you
  ironically this
  i pet all cats
  that homeless cat chichan hajime and ago are all pretty cute gilz too
i dont remember old aoi having a collab with luna
  perfect height
  for months to try and get a thread split  and why that is bad a niijisanji thread will be fine and desirable dont you think
cheater cat no  
  please dont lewd my cute clown and the bartender from my dreams literally thank you
  she has almost the same measurements as this model      theyre both 156cm tall the model is b84 w58 h82 ai is b85 w59 h83 65fcup too
  looks like she needs the geta just so that she can reach properly
rins winter outfit makes her dressed like a russian in gta4
  that would expose the fact that there are only 5 people at best who care about them here so not desirable at all they would rather samefag here
  oh yes
  that would expose the fact that theres only 5 people at best who dont care about them here so not desirable at all they would watch not samefag here
  hot
    oh no
thread is movig so fast no one will notice i have secret crush on aoi
    more like 2 of you
  at least pick a nonslut vy to idolfag
  if you keep sperging im going to tweet aoi and pointing her to these very posts of yours i would even translate them for her    megu is a homewrecker slut
finally some よっぱっぱ in this stream
  megu  nonslut
unmonetizable  
 traplover drawing 4000cocklover   agoraji   yuuko20
  after sex images alone are shit why the fuck would i want to see only the aftermath
  this is the average yuaposter point at them point at them and laugh
  this anon prefers all images to have dicks in them
  literally garbage
  you have notifications set for her
    doesnt he have a point why would you want to look at someone elses cum on/in a girl thats kind of cucky
  whats the point in jerking off to hentai when all youre doing is watching someone else fuck your favorite anime girls
  look at someone elses  but its mine anon
  because im the girl
  id rather have a clean version before that
  im subbed to like 150 chuubas with notifications set for 98 of them  if there are any allegedly dead ones in there kaheru was apparently inactive for a long while id have no way of even knowing
say something nice to aqua
  is there an high res version of the full body somewhere
  kusomisokusomisokusomiso
１０分でご理解いただける nun      although you really only need the first 10 minutes
  thats kind of the point porn is cuckoldish by default unless youre watching solo or lesbians which is frankly too boring and uneventful to get off to it might as well just use your own imagation instead     this is what porn does to people you start off by masturbating to some vanilla softcore movies but end up selfinserting as the girl in bukakke orgies
  not until its posted on her own or the 2434 twitter  lost some resolution since she was just resizing the model
  answer
  whats wrong with a cute girl self inserting as a cute girl everyone on /jp/ is a girl you know
  because i liked the previous videos
  she got a cheap giggle from me and its not like she uploads so there wasnt really a reason for me not to subscribe and unsubbing takes more effort then its worth
  there are no girls on the internet
  already did
  i want to do many things with her like eating her cooking
what happened to the ruri asmr video
  no you arent you faggot kys
  they really are theyre shapely and around a handful each in size though what really got me and i dont want to get called a pervert for this was her respiration you can really feel someone breathe when youre making love to their chest
  thats like the first and only thing you would do
  though what really got me and i dont want to get called a pervert for this was her respiration  youre a pervert and also this is incredibly pathetic even by /jp/ standards please stop posting with your dick
  patras eaten her own menu before  as a demon it only made her ill and broke her teeth
  slurping the watermelon like a slut would do to a cock shes done youtube unmonetized her and the channel will close in a week
check this nice 3d loli play shadowverse  
  do you mean youre not supposed to suck on the watermelon like youre trying to extract all the liquid from its flesh  apparently nobody told the ninja
    this was a lot cuter than i expected from a shill video
  dont doubt their judgement theyve got a watermelon eating sound expert on their team  
  because i want to breed this cute little pinoy
ok rins completely obsessed with minecraft now  this is the first time shes gone live with the same game twice in a row within the same day not including collabs    
  mial is such a dork
  i want to lift up that skirt and enter the forbidden land
  she was told to slurp the watermelon like those thots in jav and hentai videos and not just eat it like a fucking normal humane bean
  its on the ninjas booth now
  oh i just noticed its a cover of ais new world pretty cool i would like to see more people cover her new songs
why is aoi so cute
 tama asmr   fairys   riri   kanakana   choco asmr   babumegane
  riri got really active in the past month huh i remember her having trouble with her youtube streams and going back to mirrativ months ago
    i thought she was wearing shorts underneath her skirt youre telling me her pussy is actually for everyone on display
  yeah im surprised that im getting so many notifications for her now since she went a good like what 3 4 months without ever really touching youtube i dont watch her much though but its always nice to see a chuuba really start getting into it
  wasnt it because she was still in the future back then
  porn is cuckoldish by default  only if youre enough of a sperg to get attached to all of the women youll never meet and especially never have sex with its a world of voyeur fetish for everyone else we just like to watch
  she still is from one of her tweets
  she time traveled for summer not sure what happened after this
  summer ended and she went back
  ken
 aqua doing another no sleep until donkatsu stream also she has already called hololive homolive several times by accident lol
weekly schedules are for the weak
  shes isnt gonna make it this time
  its the same thing retard voyeurism  cuckoldry
  that thumbnail is freaky
  thats something ive always found a bit strange about aichans design she is obviously meant to be very very cute but she has the proportions of a gravure idol
  it always weirds me out when one chuuba is watching the channel of another that as far as i can tell has no particular relation to them and they have such a difference in content and yet heres patra watching rion makes me think of a while back when patra was much smaller and rin dropped a こんばんわんわん out of nowhere
      thats quite disheartening though it makes sense i havent watched her videos since we stopped doing translations
  no its not you dipshit go learn what cuckolding actually is
  back in september she was also watching moruru but then moruru got the japanese cold
  its the same mentality as cuckoldry ie youre getting off to someone else fucking instead of having sex yourself
  hot
  i see a nijisanji mario kart cup
  by accident  accident  you sure
megu btfo
  show pantsu
    aoi would make a great disney princess it would be cool if smarprise could get a collab with disney i know aoi really liked their movies so it would be something she would actually really like to do herself
  chuubas watch other chuubas not really sure whats weird about that gilzaren is one of the like three vys who actually have a tangible plot to his streams yet hes probably a bigger chuubawatcher then most people in these threads hes in everyones chat    still i can kind of get what youre saying anyways just never forget the simplest fact of them all every chuuba who joined the scene postmiracle watches other chuubas theyre fans just like me or you
  based homewrecker and ais personal onahole rabbit btfo ai x luna is the otp of vtubers
  i wonder if theyll stay good friends after ai rips luna a new chestbutt on her own tv show
  yeah just look at this sirogumi
how come shishi is the least popular of her group
  luna should be the groom
900 subs for 1million yen money well spent
  doesnt make sense ai is a natural alpha while luna is a sperg who can only act confident in prerecorded solo videos and spills her spaghetti whenever theres more than one person in the room its pretty obvious that ai is the man in their relationship and luna is her cute little bratty princess that she likes to spoil
seems like the fire drake is under suspicion of youtube crimes and violation of public morals shouldve gone with the china dress fuck youtube  
  why this sirogumi is holding derons tshirt
  because the suits are idiots shishi has the best voice skills and shes a nice singer
  and not one single penny to moemi also why eilene is not backing directly moes channel
  because eilene can only interact with the world through the lens of clickbait and memes
  there are definitely a few you can find absolutely everywhere gil is one matsuri homolive used to be matsuri doll is one not all of them are that way though most have certain circles and interests and its just surprising when they seem to be breaking out of them
    kitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  shions one as well so on and so forth you dont see them chat a lot of the time but im sure if you had some extension or a good eye you could spot a lot of chuubas just lurking in random channels
  hes stealing ideas from mrbeast its kind of pathetic and also insulting people did not support him so he could throw his money around on random twitch whores
 akkun   babumegane part 2   ken   gaku
  cookpad shows up in some really unexpected places too
  youtube chat lists participants but it doesnt really work worth a shit and only shows a fraction of them      saw her in rions too shes got mod status
77 minutes
  goodnight aqua
  i see your ridiculous corporate hate has melted your brain
wow shes really emotional the stream only lasted a bit over an hour
  nah it was just the dumb tiktok stuff
  my daughter aoi is really going places im so proud of her
  theyre still going has ichigo been having a good time because usually in collabs shes a bit out of it
  my secret crush aoi is really going places im so proud of her
jesus christ ichigos going insane
cute af desu
my word
  did they do a cover of this song
  rin
  yes    
  i see your ridiculous corporate hate has melted your brain  t hoshisora gakuen executive  denouncing the bad decisions of some companies is not hating all of them
  guess i know what songs earworming its way back into my brain again thanks anon
  caroline is the only one out of that group i find appealing
mofu mofu
  i wanna dip my ponos into daba
  im afraid to watch her if shes too enjoyable and cute ill have mister hanson watching my browser history
  get out daba
i like hebis fashion sense
  after i came
  nah mr hanson would be watching your browser history over videos like this one  
  rhythm is also nice
  jokes on you i dont watch hiyoko
    looks too slutty for me sorry
  why do hebidads let this girl dress like some hoodlum
  slutty  where do you think we are all of them are slutty
  hebiko is not a gangster you take that back
  i feel bad for hebiko she got surrounded by some of the legitimately creepiest people in the scene and her base was already so small she didnt really have anything to springboard out of that group i remember when she used to have 50 or even 60 viewers but i just checked the other day and its only less then 30 now    thanks hebidads
  shes pure her laugh can cure cancer
  all of them are slutty  yeah but most yuuchubas at least dont look like prostitutes
  i hope she doesnt spiral into depression like marie
  most yuuchubas at least dont look like prostitutes  again where do you think we are all vtubers look like prostitutes
  does this thread look like an auditorium to you go project somewhere else buddy my daughter aoi and her best friend are pure and sweet girls
  50 or even 60 viewers  thats on her oekaki request videos because naturally they attract leeches that want free pictures  not saying 30 viewers is normal either but thats probably because of the hibernation month
  i didnt know prostitutes dressed like this
  objectively and factually wrong
  one of them is showing her midriff and has her shoulders exposed and both wear miniskirts its almost like you have the same level of denial of people from portland
  sora maybe but aoi man shes the sluttiest of them all
  now thats a turboslut way to prove his point anon
  she wears a deliberately tight pajama and she also respond the calls of her boyfriend midstream
  i was talking way back in the day probably june or something fuck if i know my sense of time is fucked but i remember her always hovering around 50 viewers or so on most streams
    how about this one then
  those reddish eyes like they were high or something like that
  what kind of whores are you fucking that look like this
  too horny that she has a dick fon heer body or 24/7
  she also respond the calls of her boyfriend midstream  how does she still have an audience that was pure ntr
  the coolest ones
  dick fon heer body or 24/7  what did he mean by this
  faggot cats are sluts
  probably high from the smell of cocks and pheromones
  whats your favorite chuuba muhammad
  now this is a classy feminine lady
  has dick on her body
  she went negative on sub growth temporarily but i feel its fine for her to purge her more autistic viewers
  i bet most female yuuchubas get horny just by smelling a mans masculine odor
  no stable concurrent 50 has never been a thing sadly but around 40 its possible  i think some of those lost numbers are other vtubers since at those times many of them used to watch each other every day but that kinda stopped arounf august probably because of school
rin stream is free from eop now
  im not the one trying to find the impossible on vtubers i like sora aoi akari deron siro and many more but they are sluts they are not pure im not an idolshit believing the vtubers i enjoy watching are pristine maidens when its a fact they are not
  thanks for reminding me to ask her to sing country roads in order to that snippet to be on meme review
the 2434 minecraft server is lagging pretty severely for everyone streaming on it right now  i wonder if its running on an old xerox machine in dolas living room or if they actually rented a realm
  stone yourself you dumb sandsnorter
  i think its a realm server but i could be mistaken it seems to be up 24/7 at least which means it probably is
  i respectfully disagree aoi is as close as it comes to a genuine pristine maiden and the only skin she is showing is a bit on her thighs her hands and face if she was hiding any more of her skin shed be muslim or a nun id appreciate if you would cease slandering my lovely daughter
time for predictions  
  why cant you falseflag with someone thatd make these threads more entertaining like shizurin no one really cared for aoi so i dont get why youre throwing them under the bus these past few weeks
  im rooting for oneechan
    i understand your denial but its unhealthy to be this naive and delusional all of this remind me of when people in here still believe that tokino sora is a real jk streaming from her house with a home made equipment and aided only by achan
  theres only one answer
  why is megu trying to hook up with this based guy
  lurk more its not even that old
  tsukasa is over mugi
  i know this not new but why
  that seems a little harder to do with shizurin  while shes playing a character like any other vtuber rin puts minimal effort into being someone she isnt  plus you cant idolfag a woman so openly thirsty as shizurin
  probably wont happen but i want master or homolive to win
  watching kanae try to hit phantoms with arrows while both he and the phantoms are rubberbanding all over the place is really painful
  youre correct that 99 of all vtubers are whores but remember that there are pure vtubers out there like souma aya or ken
  iwanaga on suicide watch
sexy drake
aoichan seems to have caught cold shes breathing heavily and her face is all red
  fuck off marie
why is exhentai so fucking retarded
  人妻ファイアドレイク
    its rented server check dolahimakura season 2 video she explained it there
  their mods are ponyfuckers
excellent name rin
    too hot for youtube
  at least theyre not fakku
  nice try maximum joe
  this person does not look like a jk to me at all in fact shes starting to look more like luene
  defending fakku
  fakku are literal jews
  whats wrong with fakku
  i wonder
  thats a question for /h/ and if you post that question there youd have a thread full of passionate answers
  whats bad about that japan has the same services
  their literal jew owner made tons of adbucks with pirated content and a few years ago put a paywall and started dmcaing any site with content pirated from them
  so many lies in such a small amount of pixels
  nice description of crunchyroll
  fakku crunchyroll and eilene are literally the same shit
  free spirited projects lose any trace of soul or identity after being assimilated by big companies
  whats wrong with pic related sounds like a great deal
  makes sense theyre both brands only good for porn and not much more
  all the official anime related sites started as filthy pirates then go legal and dmc all their competitors is disgusting
  you should know by now that rinfams here are generally not bothered by rin shitposting so no one bothers because its too hard to get a rise out of them
  i cant believe tsugu is about to become a shipgirl
  初めてのasmr  how was it
  cursed collab
  watch and tell me im not into asmr
  why does she need to do sponsor shit when she got way more money than she needed from the crowdfunding
  exceptional
  as a gaijin i must pirate
  rinfams here  next youll be telling us santa is real
pet me
  and theyre equally jewish
  t entitled neet
  rin shitposting is mostly just calling her an old hag so as a rinfam thats nothing that would make me mad
  more like if i was in japan id just actually buy the fucking doujins themselves at least that way i know the artist is getting most of the money
  are you somehow trying to imply that rimfam dont post here  thats really odd  where are you going with this
  okay
  rin
  i want shiro to force me to rape akari or else she kills us both
i wanna marry two ninja girls  is that legally possible in japen
  yeah
  no though they are accepting of a legal wife and mistress or concubines
    for started they dmc all wani scan in the panda but they never upload what they delete they also banned loli and other more hardcore fetishes they also lie about everything in that image the authors dont see a penny some didnt even know they were part of fakku  just do  if youre interesting
  why is there a floating candle in the back
  as long as you continiously impregnate both of them the japanese government will accept it
  i never learned what she was humming
  tfw no brainlet smug catgirl gf
    ya dun goofed
  country roads
  they also lie about everything in that image the authors dont see a penny  as is the case with all western publishers of japanese shit really the majority of the money you give to localised shit all goes to the publishers and the original creators barely see any of that money    youre not supporting artists with fakku
  cursed song
  theres something about dumb smug girls that makes me want to rape the smug out of them
  im pretty sure theyre just shitposting no one on this site would unironically see nothing wrong with faggu panda is going to shit too see changing trap tag to tomgirl applied retrospectively but its still the absolute best by far compared to the alternatives      brainlet  
  brainlet nora is great
  i remember when henreader was surprised about seeing his illustrations in some fakku skateboard  then this other girl mangaka who got really mad about seeing her work uncensored overseas
  in that stream her lip sync app fucked app and her mouth wouldnt close  think himawari
  i remember seeing people showing off that henreader skateboard in buyfag threads like it was something to be proud of
  i miss the 2d model
  in both cases jacob had to engage into twitter dm damage control at light speed
dont forget the ahegao compilation meme shirt at least asanagi was a good sport about it and decided he wanted in on it too but man if it were me id be pissed      holy fuck i gotta see this any links or screenshots
  wait the shirt was sold by fakku i though it was being sold by fans
  i cant believe he seriously saw that shirt and was all these white pigs have fine taste im gonna sell this shirt myself
  asanagi is white
  ahegao compilation meme shirt  open at own risk
  now this is definitely a lie i remember one time when an eroge and manga artist sayori had one of her doujin published in english by fakku she twitted that one day after she got the payment and notice that her work has been published she decided to check it on fakku and to her surprise her work was uncensored she was not okay with this and made it take down she still kept her payment and fakku issued an apology i know about this incident because i play eroge and people were surprised at sayoris attitude  the artists definitely are getting paid
  cursed image extremely cursed
  i cant help you with that those where old sadpanda threads from /a/ from around 23 years ago  i do remember henreader retweeting the skateboards announcement and saying seems like overseas pirates are using my illustrations for stuff or something among those lines then jacob replied with dm me  same with the female mangaka she posted some pics of some recent at the time lewd manga from her and said some overseas publisher is uncensoring my work and charging for it i never allowed this and jacob again dm me then the mangaka tweeted i got everything explained to me i feel embarassed because didnt put effort into making the girls genitals also now i know why ive got that small bonus in my last paycheck
  this is aichan and eilenes target audience huh
  surprise her work was uncensored she was not okay with this and made it take down  shit artist i bet her art is shit too
  henreaders account is suspended but this was the original link    
  i dont usually get the urge to punch someone in the face but this image totally did it
  people dont know who sayori is
  ahegao pants  thats new
    her arts ok
  probably chink made or jlist
    i dont give a shit about generic chinkshit artist
  wheter you give a shit or not you dont even know about nekopara that even normalfags know about  what the fuck are you
  im implying its two guys at best posting the same fanart of rin and replying with rin to each other
  welcome to modern day ironic weebs and by that i mean circa 2012 im genuinely afraid what the future will look like as anime starts getting much more mainstream thanks to netflix and the like not that im a gatekeeper who wants  to keep everything pure and japanese its just that casualization attracts the lowest of the low crowd kind of people im sure you know exactly the type im talking about
  nekopara  i dont give a shit about your nomalfag kusoge fuck off to reddit with that shit
pet the cat
    i am legit hyped
  thats a soft shelled turtle
  silly anon thats a muskrat
  harem catgirl eroge with animated sex scenes arent played by normalfags  maybe you need to get out more anon
  rin
  when chubas touch each other are they touching irl as well how do they know where totouch when theyre wearing the vr headset
  nekopara  feel free to point out where you actually referenced this all youve been doing is talking about some random artist
  only rin is getting a new outfit
  already a new one not that im complaining
  isnt she a bit old to be dressing like some teenager
  rin is iwanagas special bitch confirmed
  shes a jk anon
  change lewds to yua and its perfect
  how muscular is iwanaga
  yes and yua is pure
  youre telling me teenagers dress like that
  hes a wimp
  implying  yua isnt aoi
  and luna is very successful
  off yourself faggot
  better
  what about the third one
  i wont wife a cheater
  anon
  shes already in his rape dungeon and counts as furniture to the government
  sayori is nekoparas artist
  i wish this meme was true but i fear she just didnt care enough to continue being a vtuber
ai not a workaholic kizuna will be doing some warmup tv appearance before hosting the notokuban later today you can watch her live here    
  yes but you never actually said nekopara did you
  ill watch something interesting instead thanks
  knowing how pure ruri is i wonder if she cried when akane decided to leave she tried really hard to keep the channel together and continue despite their low numbers early on im glad its paid off so well
  for fucks sake 
being a ninja is tough you risk becoming a cumdumpster if you fail a mission
  didnt ntv have some java files you could download before also watching this makes me remember how fucking much i hate these sorts of japanese shows  えええええええ  すごいいいいい  まじかあああああ  replay 3x
  dont post kizuna ai here its gonna attract the shitposter and hes going to start insulting nijisanji and try to incite a fanwar its not worth
  their voices sounds too alike and akane left around the time cheater cat exploded in popularity      in my headcanon all the ninja vas are blood related for reallike cousins or something and ruri and co kept akane because they love their sibling and wish for her success
  yeah its like theyre using a soundboard and everything is scripted as fuck
  is that true for all ninjas our just taimanins
  which is after  my point is that unless you followed nekopara you wouldnt know that the name sayuri is supposed to be related to nekopara
  its true for all female ninjas
  i give up
  i liked their reactions when they showed aichans achievements
  mito still needs to pick the design contest winners
  it might as well be so the whole point of getting guests on the show is for their own personal input but theyre all so worried about appearing professional that they all end up responding the same way    i remember reading somewhere that japanese people think japanese tv is pretty shit also the stories about tv subscription people being scummy as fuck are fun to read about
  japanese shows  asian variety shows actually im a chink and this shit is the same everywhere no matter the language hell ive even remembering watching old ones from back in the early 00s and they were the exact same it gets worse when the topic of the day is cooking or food oriented from all the umaaaaai oishiiiiii or the equivalent in your language
  oh hai japanhater
  probably because youve assumed that everyone else has some sort of interest in nekopara for some reason
  akane left around the time cheater cat exploded in popularity  hinata started in february and was immediately a huge hit akane showed up in early may and was already gone by the end of the month it really wouldnt make any sense for them to be the same person i thought everyone just said it as a joke
  most posters here are somewhat jpotaku who recognize major hartist names  just admit youre more of a normalfag than the average poster and well leave it at that
  the problem with their food shows is that its all about eating so obviously youll run into that problem at least learn from the west and do some shit like kitchen nightmares or masterchef or great british bake off or whatever theres a whole load of shit you could do but they just copy whatever everyone else is doing    kind of like the vy scene
  everyonebasicallymakesthesamevideosluna  fuck wheres that pic when you need it
  major hartist names  sayuri is not a major artist anon her style is barely above average she may do really cute girls but her samefacey style is boring
  thats not what  is saying though and sayori is a major hartist im looking on sadpanda and she only has like 2 doujins and 1 hgame to her name
  she only has like 2 doujins and 1 hgame to her name prior to nekopara rather
no buzz talk vod i blame liz    nijikuji specials        looking for translators for nijisanji manga and allages vtuber doujinshi mail me  uawgkcndtaiidropmailme
  allages vtuber doujinshi  i pass
  shit now i want a wakamoto vtuber  hes not doing much these days anyways right  imagine the asmr vids
  imagine wakamotos asmr vids
  his tongue roll sounds off to me so i think it might be an impersonator but wakamoto does tv voice overs pretty often so it wouldnt be impossible
rions morning stream hasnt been posted yet so here  
  thanks mate
yahoi compilation

むぎむぎむぎ
  i really want to pet her vaginal walls
  this but with my dick
  whos stopping you from petting your dick
        no    girl        ok
  do you think omegasis should get an upgrade their models arent terrible by any means but maybe it wouldnt hurt if they were cuter
ｙｏｕ　ｗｉｌｌ　ｐｅｔ　ｍｅ
  good taste
  no i dont but they probably will
  what do you mean by cuter cutesy designs wont suit their voices
golshi    
  n o
  i will unsub them if they ever make themselves look cuter
show me your predictions
  what happened to horsesubber
  i have a hard time imagining them looking any other way even the lack of facial expressions is so them
the ai part of the program started  
  taisa will take the championship
its ok
kizuna is gonna fuck david beckam
  i wanna pet your dickinal walls
  oof selfassessed n5
    it can work pic related by cute i didnt mean moe moe cute just make them a bit more attractive and easier to sexualize japan likes cute things after all their models looking as plain as they do is probably the main reason why they arent a lot more popular
  can you point me to a tutorial of how to install streamlink and use it with mpv
  he explained it in detail several threads ago
  gaijin cock always wins  how will luna ever recover now
  absolutely not  the somewhat awkward quality is part of the charm specially the muppet like expressions and movements
  just using youtubedl with mpv for my part        dunno
kizuna confirmed for smash
  /v/ confirmed for browsing these threads
  ded
  confirmed  we had /v/ermins since these threads were kizuna generals
god i fucking hate japanese tv shows
based ads cutting when kizuna was talking
  what race is that guy
  thats hardly surprising considering the level of quality
neetchan no  
holy shit nobuhime is so fucking small
  imagine
  you just noticed i remember back in her intro video she said she was like 140 cm tall
  her names ニー子
  so is her sex appeal one might say its infinitesimal
  how did hinako manage to surpass the other two animares im pretty sure until last month she used be to like 34k subs lower than ichika and kuromu
  not liking small girls with huge faces  shit taste
  wrong she was the one with most subs before haneru started picking up steam mid july
why am i watching prince akishino wheres ai
  she was at the beginning so shell probably appear again around the end
  now imagine this
  she was the one that kickstarted animare with her kongyo karaoke
thats a big roster  
  getting fucked offscreen
  hhot
  agoooooooo
  i need this as a soundboard
what was that thing on the panel a man a woman japan accepts trannies now
  shota hunter
whats this  
  now  hello 4chan
  screenshot
  apparently is a channel with content for vr devices dunno if they have the rights to use kizuna ais image just like that shady seminar denounced by dwu
  copyright  2018 technoblood inc all rights reserved  kizuna ai  still i dont think ai could be happy to advertise gravure
  i found it from a tweet saying they were testing something
  why does it say virtual gate when thats a real door right there really gets the noggin jogging
yep there she is again at the end
  apparently they sell the device as well but by looking the website theres a lot of gravure channels
  its a vr service for net cafe their service is used in 1000 stores all over japan and korea
  well the tweet said they were sleeping with ai
  denounced by dwu  based
give your energy to mugi
  will a mana transfer be acceptable
  depends on what type of supernatural creature she is  but probably yes
812    一人じゃちょっと寂しいね  817ノジョと相部屋だから寂しくないぞ    i thought japs couldnt into banter
  theres no banter there though just some anon ropleplaying
  what banter  her familiar is by her side at all times
  kanae is still streaming even after midori and ichigo have gone to bed

sahana wii fit u

  wheres the new costumes kizuna
  mitomito
  why are men pretending to be girls so hot
  its a mystery
  thats aoi you horny baka
  diabetes is pretty sexy too
achan
  kizuna akari no  
  cute
how can we save the dishonorable cat
  i know right
  oh my
  delete   just because shes always thirsty and needs to use the restroom a lot doesnt mean anything
    oh theyll be streaming some of the program on aichannel
  sasuga ironic weebs
  why are they wearing masks
  quite normal practice among comfort ladies in roppongi
cute old man  
how much do you think they hate ai especially that bitch on the right side
  they asked her last time she was on morning tv what can they do to compete with someone as cute as her ai said they have different appeals
  what gave you that impression theyd probably find it weird and dont totally get it but i dont think they actually hate her
  tell me about ene why does she wear the mask
  im happy they are thinking about the international audience
  im not entirely sure if its that or if its a short stream theyll do in the middle of the broadcast they do have a ton of vods ready for it
  the more you know
  she is literally a big girl
    i think they would prefer to be the main personality of that anniversary program than some greenhorn that showed up from nowhere
  for you
how do we save her   
  anon shes literally dead already the chance to save her passed long ago not that she could realistically be saved in the first place
  anon they azulimd her out of existence  shes even still stuck at the company
  save  what a funny joke anon
  little late for that dont you think besides they set her up there was no winning for her
last hanjo before the 100k subs of course  
  you cant convert all of your hanjocoin to yuacoin before its too late
  monitor new vtubers for someone with her voice
  do they think its her fault them making her to do this publicly makes it feel like theyre punishing her
  i know she died but i really like her songs    i guess thats the best bet
  this is japan were talking about of course they do
  who called them out during the stream
mito had to google her own birthday date
ichika talking about gachi koi is cute  
  i dunno i kinda like miya and kokon though kokon is cuter
  cant be played because file is corrupt
  god i just want to fuck ray so bad after watching this
  oh goodness he thinks there are only two rinposters
  sayori was doing nekopara before the games you should probably datecheck before you start disregarding a huge chunk of her body of work
  wheres the version where its anons discussing virtual youtubers at the circular table and anons discussing ai and nijisanjishits/fags and its just one guy talking to himself in a mirror
  thanks anon sucks about the buzz talk it was sonico part 2 right
  i dont know why it does that in firefox it works in chrome/media players
  works for me in firefox
  better enjoy these while they last shes on the path to being sent to the same soapland as kiki by the looks of it
magrona beatmania    frank zappa suikoden 2  
  fukkin saved
  suikoden 2  oh shit
  seedsgod is the fucking best
shes back for good now  
  suikoden 2  what amazing fucking taste best taste in the entire scene
how was november aka novtuber month for you
check those views kizuna is fucking finished in 2019 all hail china  
  it was going pretty good with the succ but then the chuubapocalypse started
  my favorite jrpg good taste
  same as any other month for me didnt really care much for azulim cared a bit for kanna after the dolls collab but every other chuuba i watch had some good streams or good announcements good fun
  seeing all the reactions to pokemon was nice hopefully the smash stuff will be as fun to watch  shame about all the corporate drama and deaths
  judging by the comments its mostly confused 12 year olds from south america who clicked an ad and not china
so do you think that december will be more of a massacre than november or do you think the gods of death are satisfied
  hopefully the smash stuff will be as fun to watch  i hope so too but smash isnt really an entertaining game to watch a stream of unless youre watching good players then again chuubas are known for their personalities and/or bantz being able to make even the unwatchable watchable and smash is by no means an unwatchable game so who knows
  eagerly awaiting her winter outfit
  ayamina are already on the december list thats probably not enough to satisfy any vtuber shinigami
  this pleases the shiro god
  did you think anyone could have predicted november in october or october in september come on now anon we cant see the future or even hope to predict it
dmm shill poster hasnt been around today i guess  
    you forgot to say siro no
  please dont call my kumichous wife an old man
  frank zappa is truly a vtuber of culture
  i like that they stuck to siros toilet tuber storyline
  i think im outside rins preferred age range
  she doesnt care as long as youre ripped
aichans notokuban is in a few hours the tv channel is bs ntv there are no good streams for it but theres this very cursed link      it downloads some sort of file you drag in onto mpv with youtubedl and it sort of works
  i dont know why i cant make it work i drag the the link to mpv i have youtubedl on the same folder as mpv and nothing happens
   watch this hospice tuber
  what do you drag the url or the file
  is there a list of the chuubas wholl make it into the show
  the time has come
  rin
  no i didnt
akabane with her other sunflower girlfriend later tonight  
  kizuna akari no
  i wanted to say just look for the ones who will not be streaming tonight but it seems no one gives a shit about streaming at the same time as the program they will be showing up in aichan included
  and
  you forgot to mention siro
  isnt haneru gonna be in this one
  shiro lewds are always a yes  but in this case it was so out of character you couldnt consider that shiro
  shes not even part of the heavenly kings   who cares
  shes going to buy it though yeah
  委員長清楚  nice
  wait thats like amazon and not something like dlsite right
ichika wasnt in the collab because the japanese cold struck again   shes resting up now
    theres a dark elf elu one too
  ebin
  that one has nothing to do with eru it was released before vtuber boom and it already got canned

akunetty playing 7 days to die
  sorry i dropped her after finding out shes married whats the point in giving her attention and money when youll never be 1
  whats the point in giving her attention and money when youll never be 1  the absolute state of idolshits
  i did some research and seems shes married for real im seriously considering dropping being her patreon
  nice bait heres a reply for good effort
  do you think akunetty should collab with frank zappa for example
  is she running this on a toaster
    she sounds like shes in her 30s anyway what did you expect
  probably expected someone like rin
stop trying to stir shit with my alien
  she brought it on herself in a way  why get into a scene known for unhealthy attachments when youre technically speaking not available
  i said stop
  she should have started anew instead of using the same nickname for more than a decade
notemama  
akunetty  
at this rate theyre going to hit 300k subs in a week and a few days     how do they do it is it the extreme sex appeal
oneechan really likes pokemon
  whats that streamlabs message is it a bot that keeps track of whos donated how much to a channel holy fuck that better not be true and if it is not only is that mind boggling but also retarded since it just fans the flames of idiots even more as now it really is a competition to see who can throw around the most dosh
  they should be crowned as the new heavenly kings already
  ive actually read the old blogs  youre a faggot for trying this
  theyre making an average of 25k daily subs with 4k peaks im very happy for them
  they should be crowned as the new heavenly kings already  get out and never dare to come back
  hey you cant post sex appeal like that on 4channel
    hime and hina no when when
hero  
  you cant make iwara videos of the overly sexual hina without the utterly unsexy hime
mea no when
  hime is for rough mating press so you better retract your statement
  too much sex appeal it cant be allowed
      remember when /jp/ was saying their company fucked up because they delayed himes debut too much and it was too late to make a successful vy     why is /jp/ always wrong
  son you have a terminal case of shit taste
hime is just hiding her sex appeal power level
  because they were and some are still now in love with mito
  shes not doing a very good job then
  im getting tired of this fucking game
  son you have a terminal case of norafanaticism
  why does this daifuku have such large daifukus

  toilet break
image limit  
  nice op /v/ermin
  half her comments are just people saying theyre from mexico this is fucking depressing
    we are reaching new spheres of autism  do you really think she would give you any attention if you didnt gave her views or money  you will never be 1 even if she was not married and desperate for dicks you cant speak her fucking language
  we are reaching new spheres of autism  no kidding
  id say they were pretending to be retarded but theres been cases of people getting flustered after finding out their favourite twitch camwhore had a boyfriend and wasnt interested in them in spite of their generous donations i guess there really are people so deluded they think theres a realistic chance theyll get something like this out of donating to streamers
  i dont remember a babuchi guy specifically but i did have this among my clips       is that what you were referring to
mommy is doing her best
i like when she borrows alices boyfriend
would she let me go out with yumekoneesan
cutest goddess
i want to marry her eldest daughter who still lives with her mom and wouldnt even have a job without her
some things never change
  i want to marry her too
  did you fact check that before posting
    sacchan a cute
  hellooooo kongaɽra dont you need to let someone else touch that once in a while uncute jittery bitch make a choice
  its not borrowing everyone in makai is her property by divine right
  i want to be shinkis property

reminder that shinki is a demiurge false god that didnt create sariel
  not created but through birth
big
  yumeko is too busy to go out with a filthy human
i will cheat on alice with this woman
  itd be nice if there was a series about that like the one with tewi and reisen
  i will only use alice to get closer to shinki so it wont be cheating when i inevitabily sleep with her
  this sounds like a plan
  hher breasts are bigger than her head
   im not sure if youre pretending not to know that that itself exists as well
  she has a lot of kids she needed to feed at point
lot of blonde offsprings you got there shinki kind of odd that some are not how many men and does it have any connection to your failed tourist agency
  we did this already once the answer is at least one hypothetical blond man and one lewd monk
  why does she look so scared shes obviously done this countless of times before
i want to wipe my smegma on her shinkis breasts
  dont smegmate the shinki
  pick the child
  but isnt blonde hair colour a recessive gene  what if shinkis hair colour is dominant wouldnt that mean alices hair would have to be the same as her mums
  light hair colors tend to be recessive and shinkis light blue is certainly lighter than her daughters medium blonde
  not if shinki has the allele for blonde hair as well the punnet square would have shinki with white dominant and blonde recessive while her partner would have 2 blonde recessive making it a 50 chance for each offspring to have blonde hair
  shinkisamas underwear has a hole
i want to marry alice then cheat on her with her mom
this pic makes me feel it in by boner
i want to have sex with mom
shinki is very happy to see alice got a new friend
  i want to make friends with shinki
  oyakodon with shink and arisu

  youre not thinking anything weird are you
  do you think she would get mad if she caught you going through her underwear drawer or sniffing her used panties taken from the laundry basket
shinki trying on alices underwear without permisson
      hey now
  i want shinki to punish me for being a pervert
im going to sleep in her bed with her tonight

interesting frog
ever wonder what that pattern on clownpiece is its actually inspired by the american flag
  its one of the frogs from suwakos clothes the images of these anthropomorphic frogs come from the famous japanese work of art 鳥獣人物戯画 choujujinbutsugiga lit animalperson caricatures in english the common nickname of the piece is scrolls of frolicking animals suwako is wearing it because obviously shes associated with frogs the god shes based on moreya 洩矢 is associated with frogs/toads mamizou also references the scrolls in her cards 伍番勝負鳥獣戯画fifth duel chouju giga from td and its counterpart 変化鳥獣戯画transformation chouju giga from hm chouju giga lit animal caricature is a common shortening of the full name most fan translations have opted for the common english nickname scrolls of frolicking animals in fact mamizous iconic danmaku may be inspired from the scroll itself her humanshaped danmaku references the anthropomorphic monkeys from the chouju giga the first card featuring them specifically used the term primate and not human similarly her frog and fox danmaku also comes from the famous scrolls the fox danmaku is commonly mistaken for to be a dog although it most likely represents a fox finally her bird danmaku is a reference to the birds that appear in the scroll and is probably a nod to the name of the scroll itself chouju 鳥獣 is translated as animals but it literally means birds and beasts  but why is mamizou associated with the scroll this post is to be continued
  marisas pointy hat is a subtle reference to the fact that shes a witch
  well the answer is simple the scrolls were commissioned and owned by the buddhist kozan  temple 高山寺 kozanji the scrolls depict animals dressed up as buddhist monks and frogs praying to a frog buddha that is what the op pic is a frog in a buddhalike pose you must be thinking that its ironic that the shintobased suwako has that on her clothes but its actually not historically the suwa shrine complex has also been in the hands of buddhist temples shintoism and esotetric buddhism had good relations with each other in those times to the point where many kami were considered incarnations of buddhist figures including the kami of the suwa shrine getting back on track tanuki by themselves are intrinsically linked with buddhism before buddhism became prevalent in japan tanuki were portrayed as slender selfish tricksters similar to kitsune foxes and raccoon dogs look similar and are closely related the evil tanuki were skilled at transforming themselves and other things particularly leaves into different objects when buddhism came around tanuki transformed into goodwilled although still mischievous potbellied creatures that symbolized happiness wealth and fortune these tanuki commonly dressed up as buddhist monks straw hat and all and had knowledge of sutras and buddhist teachings its speculated that this fat monkdressed depiction of tanuki originated from images of hotei a famous roundbellied buddhist monk who also symbolized wealth and good fortune in any case tanuki are associated with buddhism this is why zun associated mamizou with the myouren temple and why he associated mamizou with the chouju jinbutsu giga
    interesting
whats the deal with shikieiki why isnt she having much control of hell compared to someone like hecatia
    perhaps most interesting itself is that zun has an illustration of some frogs from the chouju giga on his own door this picture is taken from the magnet touhou documentary some years back the choju giga is considered by many to be the first manga and is like touhou riddled with many religious and cultural undertones it clearly holds some personal significance to zun perhaps serves it as some sort of inspiration to him anyway lets break down mamizou further her first name マミゾウ mamizou comes from 猯/貒 mami lit badger/raccoon dog and 三 san lit three which can also be read as ゾウ zou mami although having the modern meaning of badger references either tanuki 狸 raccoon dog or anaguma 穴熊 badger/kan 貛 badger or both depending on what regional dialect is used mami could also come from 魔魅 deceiving spirit references the trickster nature of youkai tanuki and youkai badgers even 狸 tanuki can be read as mami interesting but not related is the 狢/貉 mujina lit badger/raccoon dog another term corresponding to tanuki or araguma/kan or both depending on what dialect is being used 三 san read as zou in mamizou comes from 団三郎狸 danzaburoudanuki in this case 三 is read as za danzaburoudanuki is one of the three legendary tanuki bakedanuki of japan along with shibaemondanuki and hagedanuki danzaburoudanuki is the leader of the tanuki from sado island and is said to be an extremely cunning due to his latent abilities in transformation he famously kept kitsune foxes from coming to the island which is supposedly why the island is so full of tanuki but absent of kitsune today mamizous surname futatsuiwa 二ッ岩 lit two stones referencing the giant testicles of a tanuki is a direct reference to the futatsuiwa of sado island a location where the most of the islands tanuki proliferate danzaburoudanuki was so beloved in his island that he was dieified as the futatsuiwa daimyojin people still visit the futatsuiwa shrine to pay their respects to the god anyway mamizou claims she is one of the top 3 tanuki of japan and that she sailed from sado into gensokyo and that her island was devoid of foxes her td theme is futatsuiwa from sado all this points to her being danzaburoudanuki    after mamizou ill do this
  魔魅  mima backwards  i feel it in my bones
  reimus outfit is inspired by the occupation known as a miko in the religion shinto which is practiced in japan
      anon is shitting up this thread and should probably go back to his waifu image dump instead of seething very publicly and loudly for no good reason other than to shitpost
  make a good post instead of adding to the shit then
  very low quality post
  next analysis of her designs mamizous first appearance in td her appearance is that of a typical tanuki her main palette is green and brown typical for a tanuki her skirt has a pattern of waves and a boat on it this is in reference to her sailing from sado to gensokyo and also a reference to how danzaburoudanuki originally came to sado by boat danzaburous connection with boats is deeper than that he was also sados ferryman and in one story he tricked a kitsune who wanted to go to sado by having it transform into a vest to supposedly disguise him from potential humans at the half way point to sado danzaburou quickly slipped the vest off into the ocean and rowed away other things of note are her also carries a sake bottle paper book leaf giant tail and glasses her sake bottle 徳利 tokkuri is typical of a tanuki to carry it symbolizes gratitude and virtue and comes from and old tale in which a tanuki comes to a brewery to take sake on a rainy night there exists a character 霾 bai lit misty which is composed of the radicals 雨 rain and 貍 tanuki the japanese text 新著聞集畧記 shinchomonshu ryakki tells of a mujina/tanuki killed by a dog the last thing the creature wrote before it died was a seal containing the character 霾 according to the author of text tanuki and mujina live in holes although it rains because they can bypass it using their magical power but even they cannot escape a surprise attack of a ferocious dog tanuki/mujina and kitsune enemies of dogs usually a tanukis sake bottle has the character 八 hachi lit eight on it to symbolize trust and the procurement of sake the hachi emblem was a very trustworthy seal in edo japan when the character was first put on the tanukis sake bottle but mamizous bottle has the character for alcoholic beverage on it 酒 probably because zun himself is a drunkard mamizous notebook is actually promissory note 通長tsucho that tanuki carry because they never pay their debts theyre always transforming leaves into money instead of actually paying in modern times it symbolizes trustworthiness instead it was construed so that the notes means that the tanuki would pay instead of its avoidance of paying the leaf on mamizous head is a common feature of tanuki it is said that a tanuki puts leaves on its head before transforming her giant raccoonlike striped tail is a common feature in modern tanuki tanuki never had giant raccoon tails in traditional japanese folklore but thanks to super mario bros 3 the raccoon and tanuki are often conflated in popular culture zun says that the larger and more magnificent a beast youkais tail is the more important and highstatus they are mamizou has a huge tail fitting for the great danzaburoudanuki the glasses are a reflection of mamizous oldfashioned ways and might zuns way of referencing himself mamizous human form has ger gain longer hair and a kimono with a button that has a silhouette of a human on it and a checkered scarf that could be mamizous way of mimicking kosuzu in hm/ulil nothing changes except for her hat which is now a giant green leaf with a yellow bow and bells this hat is supposed to resemble a straw hat 笠 kasa tanuki often wear this due to the rain or in order to mimick a buddhist monk as explained in previous posts the bells and bow are another nod to kosuzu mamizou also gains a pipe 煙管 kiseru probably just another way to show her seemingly old age/maturity her ulil/aocf portrait also has a pose in which her tail looks likes giant testicles its almost certain that this was intentional of course in ulil she gets a black suit as a reference to mib but thatll be covered when going over spell cards    coincidence    its fine just let it happen theres always those shitposters who are very vocal about being antilore and antianalysis dont interact with the ignorant
    i see some touhou lore is simply too deep for you thats okay
  i think hes just making fun of the last thread where some anon was surprised kaguya was based on a legend
  great stuff anon
  given that the next games plot is probably related to hell and evil spirits ibarakasen is building to this
  who are the other 2 top tanuki
hecatia is the beloved and only daughter of perses and asteria the most beloved caretaker and aunt of the gods has dominion over the earth seas and skies can freely travel between the mortal realm and the land of the dead can bless mortals with good luck and prosperity can take aforementioned blessings away in fact hecatia was so great she was often identified with several other goddesses as the queen of nature she would be praised in place of demeter as a huntress and protector of youth in place of artemis as a goddess of the moon she was considered a mystic persephone she was also connected to the worship of cabeiri and curetes and even apollo and he muses in the time of the greek tragedians she also became a goddess of the underworld comforting persephone in the fall and winter seasons she has power over the dead the goddess of purifications and expiations and is accompanied by stygian dogs though a virgin goddess she is the mother of scylla and as an infernal divinity she can send from the underworld demons and phantoms powerful in sorcery and witchcraft to crossroads tombs and the murdered she is announced by the whining and howling of dogs and may sometimes have the head of a horse a dog and a lion befitting her monstrosity she was so popular greek households would have small statues before or in the house and at crossroads and people would often consult these statues the hecataea as oracles    as great and powerful as hecatia is though she is not the type to tackle a problem headon as her name implies she works from afar she is a divine almost mystical goddess and was worshiped for the production of mysteries
  i remember this post  it was in the same thread as my hecatia is the only idol im happy to see on /jp/ joke  its good to think back
  it was a nice thread from what i remember ill continue to repost some of them everyone once in a while to keep this thread running so the other anon can keep his analysis
  ibarakasen is building to this  so is sangetsusei
  i had things to do these past couple of days so sorry this took so long but lets continue with spell cards   壱番勝負霊長化弾幕変化first duel primate danmaku transformation   弐番勝負肉食化弾幕変化second duel carnivorous danmaku transformation   参番勝負延羽化弾幕変化third duel avian danmaku transformation   四番勝負両生化弾幕変化fourth duel amphibian danmaku transformation   伍番勝負鳥獣戯画fifth duel scrolls of frolicking animals / 変化鳥獣戯画transformation scrolls of frolicking animals  all referencing the chouju jinbutsu giga see these posts 20292654 and 20292786 also the japanese touhou wiki points out that the frog danmaku in amphibian danmaku transformation look strikingly similar to the frog suit sprite from super mario bros 3 whether this was intentional or not is unknown but if it is then it connects perfectly since the main attraction of smb3 was the tanuki leaf power up    六番勝負狸の化け学校sixth duel tanukis monster transformation school    for some reason the english touhou wiki translates it as just monstrous school even though 化け is clearly a pun on both the literal meaning of transformation tanuki are prolific transformation artists and obake/bakemono monster anyway the name is a reference to the お化け大学校 obakedaigakkou lit great monster school program that has gegege no kitaro creator shigeru mizuki and co travel to schools/colleges to lecture about youkai japanese mythology and his experiences working with his series mamizou is a tanuki tanuki are youkai youkai are monsters this is why zun chose to reference that program oh and probably because gegege was a huge part of his childhood like many other japanese people the program is still active as of 2018 and it has a website    七番勝負野生の離島seventh duel wild remote island /ワイルドカーペットwild carpet   touhou wiki translates it as wild deserted island but thats incorrect 離島 means isolated island and the most accurate english term for that is remote island sado isnt deserted people still live there anyway the card refers to sado island the home of mamizou where tanuki run amok the japanese wiki states that the danmaku in this card resembles a maurits escher pattern but that seems to be a stretch wild carpet is the overdrive version of the spell card and it seems the name might be a reference to carpet bombing the japanese wiki points out that it may be a reference to a tanukis scrotum which is said to be able to stretch out to the size of 8 tatami mats matscarpet the simplest explanation is that the danmaku looks like a rolling carpet  変化まぬけ巫女の偽調伏transformation pseudoexorcism of the foolish shrine maiden  touhou wiki used stupid but mamizou never calls reimu dumb in the extra stage dialogue she just calls her confident and says that she will put her back in her place after the fight is over mamizou calls reimu ignorant thus foolish as in foolish to challenge me foolish for being so closedminded is the right choice mamizou transforms into reimu in this card and performs a mock exorcism shes making fun of reimu まぬけ manuke lit idiot/moron/fool maybe a reference to 魔奴化 also pronounced manuke a boss from taitos kiki kaikai that transforms into the main character miko sayochan and attacks her manuke is a tanuki and later becomes sayochans companion thus the whole spell card is a reference to kiki kaikai not to mention the entire series   マミゾウ化弾幕十変化mamizou danmaku in ten transformations   her penultimate spell card in tds extra it reminds us of the ten spell cards an extra boss has and the name of the game ten desires 10 is a recurring theme in the game with miko having the ability to listen to ten conversations at once and figure out a persons ten desires
  cont  狢符満月のポンポコリンmujina sign full moon pompokolin  狢 means mujina not raccoon look back at post 20293050 for details mujina is the word the residents of sado used instead of tanuki danzaburodanuki used to be called danzaburoumujina before tanuki overtook mujina in usage おどるポンポコリン odoru pompokolin is a 90s song by the japanese pop group bb queens popularly known due to its use in the original ed of the anime chibi marukochan the sound a tanuki makes when it drums its belly is ポンポコ ポン ポン ponpoko pon pon tanuki belly drum specifically during nights of a full moon in japanese mythology mamizous power increases during a full moon but this is true of most youkai her spell card background is also of a full moon perhaps coincidentally ten desires was released on august 13th 2011 japan had a full moon the next day this spell card also mimics and opposes mikos spell card 仙符日出ずる処の天子hermit sign emperor of the land of the rising sun due to obvious reasons mamizou was called in by nue to defeat miko  うつせみ地蔵変化 utsusemi jizo transformation  a skill not a spell card うつせみ utsusemi cannot really be translated but it means something like person of the present/ephemeral world or temporal not spiritual/irreligious or life/reality apparently the word refers to the frail evanescent nature of all things in this world it also refers to cicada shells 空蝉 utsusemi utsusemi is also the name of a noh play and a character in the tale of genji which is also a popular noh play hopeless masquerade deals with kokoro a tsukumogami born from 66 noh masks utsusemi is also a ninja technique in which the user quickly replaces their body with a nearby object like a log or leaves in order to evade a hit much like how mamizou transforms into a jizo statue to not get hit in this skill with that it should basically mean transient jizo transformation or shortterm jizo transformation but that would lose the poetic and multifaceted nature of the word utsusemi its a jizo statue specifically because there are tanukishaped jizo statues it also brings to mind the tanuki suit power up of super mario bros 3 which allows mario to transform into a jizo statue  怪奇送り提灯 bizarre okurichouchin  a skill not a spell card okurichouchin lit sending off lantern are youkai lanterns similar to chouchinobake lit lantern monster mamizou has a traditional youkai theme to her and uses her tanuki followers as weapons having them transform into various things such as youkai  鳥獣琵琶法師 animal biwa priest  a skill 鳥獣 choujuu lit birds and beasts animals another reference the chouju giga this attack allows mamizou to send out danmaku that look exactly like the animals from the chouju giga see post 20292654 and 20292786 for more on the chouju giga 琵琶法師 biwa hoshi lit biwa priest were traveling performers who dressed up like buddhist monks and were most active before the meiji period 鳥獣琵琶法師 is also the name of an enemy in the game genpei toma den who shoots out animals from the chouju giga using his biwa this skill is almost certainly likely to be derived from from that enemy by the way a biwa is a japanese instrument similar to a lute  妖怪アミキリ変化 youkai amikiri transformation  a skill mamizou sends out one of her tanuki followers in the form of an amikiri a weird youkai with crablike claws to attack  妖怪カラカッサ変化 youkai karakasa transformation  a skill mamizou uses one of her tanuki followers in the form of a karakasa youkai umbrella as a melee weapon
  cont  妖怪つるべぇ変化 youkai tsurube transformation  a skill mamizou sends out one of her tanuki followers in the form of a tsurube a youkai in a bucket that drops down from trees to swing out and smash the opponent   妖怪オモカゲ変化 youkai omokage transformation  a skill mamizou transforms into the opponent and uses one of their skills or stabs using her karakasa or slams down using her nurikabe 塗壁 wall youkai or swings with her sake bottle omokage オモカゲ means face shadow or vestige interesting to note is that the origins of the nurikabe are speculated to be from tanuki who use their scrotum as a wall to block people or other transforming beast youkai who take the form of a wall for their tricks  変化分福熱湯風呂transformation bunbuku hot water bath  分福 bunbuku refers to the story 分福茶釜 bunbuku chagama lit tea pot bubbling with luck in which the tanuki priest shukaku 守鶴 was saved from an animal trap by a poor man as thanks the tanuki transformed into a wondrous tea pot that always retains perfect boiling temperature the poor man sells this tea pot to a buddhist monk but when the monk heats up the tea pot with fire shukaku dispels his illusion and runs away feeling bad for the poor man shukaku goes back to him and comes up with a plan to make the man more money he transforms into a tea pot once again and walks on a tightrope much to peoples amazement people pay to see this show and the poor man is poor no longer 熱湯風呂 is literally hot water bath yet the english touhou wiki translates it as hot soup bath even though the kanji for soup is not present the spell card features mamizou in a giant chagama tea pot that expels steam upwards to attack the opponent the chagama has a tanuki tail which makes one wonder if mamizou is using shukaku himself 熱湯風呂 is also probably coincidentally the name of a game show segment on theガンバルマン the ganbaruman  変化百鬼妖界の門transformation youkai world gate of one hundred demons  百鬼 hyakki lit one hundred demons is a shortening of 百鬼夜行 hyakki yagyo lit night parade of one hundred demons a famous motif in japanese mythology wherein a great amount of youkai march from the supernatural world into the real world 妖界 literally means spirit world but it reads exactly the same as 妖怪 youkai due to it being a pun thus the compromise in english is just youkai world 門 means gate but its referencing the tori 鳥居 that mamizou summons in order for the youkai tanuki disguised as youkai to cross the youkai are described here    the card references the art style of the many depictions of hyakki yagyos in japanese scrolls and art pieces  変化二ッ岩家の裁きtransformation judgement of the futatsuiwa clan  the spell card name and function is a reference to one of anakaris moves from capcoms darkstalkers judgment of the royal family 王家の裁き anakaris turns the opponent into an animal or other defenseless thing similarly mamizou does the exact same the transformations of each character and their meaning can be found here    変化満月の花鳥園transformation garden of flowers and birds under the full moon  花鳥園 kachouen lit flower bird garden are a modern line of zoolike ecoparks found all over japan with the most famous being kakegawa kachouen it has no real relation to mamizou but the prevalence of birds and flora in the park kind of go with mamizous leaves and bird danmaku which she heavily uses in the spell card perhaps zun had fond memories of going to one of the kachouen and decided to dedicate a spell card to it its specifically under the full moon because tanuki are most active on nights of the full moon as stated previously
  cont  神社のお釈迦様oshakasama of the shinto shrine  mamizou is disguised as reimu in this spell card she flies around on clouds and drops yinyang orbs this is very similar to the oshakasama in genpei toma dens bonus stage who rides around on a cloud while dropping points oshakasama roughly translates to great master shaka and is referencing the shakyamuni buddha otherwise known as gautama buddha the connection between tanuki and buddhism was made in a previous post the shinto shrine part obviously references reimu as mamizou is disguised as her  ベンテンの琵琶法師benten biwa priest  mamizou is disguised as byakuren in this spell card ベンテン benten is a nickname for the japanese buddhist goddess benzaiten 弁才天 the biwa is a symbol of benzaiten this spell card is a upgraded version of animal biwa priest so it retains the same references to the chouju giga and genpei toma den  たわむれはおわりじゃplaytimes over  mamizou is disguised as miko in this spell card the name is a reference to mikos exact quote from her td fight and the words of the last boss from genpei toma den yoritomo 頼朝 the card has miko mamizou turn giant as she rides around on a cloud and attacks the player yoritomo is giant in one stage section of genpei toma den and his final boss fight has him float around in a manner similar to what is presented in this spell card yorimoto also carries a shaku 笏 much like miko which is probably why the spell card is associated with her in the first place   八百八狸囃子bellydrumming of the eight hundred and eight tanuki  this is mamizous last word in hm for some reason the english touhou wiki translates this as bellydrumming of infinitely infinite tanuki but thats just plain wrong the spell card is referencing the story 松山騒動八百八狸物語 tale of the matsuyama disturbance and the eight hundred and eight tanuki in that story the legendary bakedanuki inugami gyobu 隠神刑部 commands a legion of 808 tanuki in order to guard matsuyama castle bellydrumming is what tanuki usually do on nights of a full moon as mentioned earlier also the animation mamizou makes during the spell card is similar to one of rocket raccoons hyper combos from ultimate marvel vs capcom 3  鳴かぬなら泣くまで待とう時鳥if the cuckoo does not call wait for it to cry  this spell card is a slightly harder version of 参番勝負延羽化弾幕変化third duel avian danmaku transformation the spell cards name is directly lifted from a poem with this specific line referring to daimyo feudal lord tokugawa ieyasu who was known for his thoughtful patient approach to things he patiently waited for previous daimyo toyotomi hideyoshi deaths to take power his cunning demeanor led people to jokingly refer to him as a tanuki who are known to be crafty which is probably why mamizou had this spell card name it could also reference instory events mamizou tells seija to give up on iscs 6th day since the tengus papers will alert stronger people to try and catch her then she randomly gives her the idea to use two items at once mamizou doesnt attack seija until the 8th day however perhaps mamizous intention was to give seija an edge in order to have her win a couple of battles and attract even stronger people who could defeat her mamizou was playing the waiting game just like the spell card described  にんげんって良いなhumans are nice  the title is a parody of one of the ed songs from the anime manga nippon mukashi banashi まんが日本昔ばなし lit japanese folk tale cartoon にんげんっていいな humans are nice the anime of course adapts a bunch of old japanese folk tales and myths including those concerning tanuki it also goes with mamizous pompokolin spell card which also referenced an anime ed mamizou fires humanshaped bullets its also worth noting that mamizou herself enjoys the company of humans and visits the human village often  エイリアンカプセル alien capsule  a skill mamizou deploys a gachapon ガチャポン capsule that can expel a tanuki disguised as an alien the aliens are a typical grey alien a flatwoods monster alien and a japanese martian 火星人 kaseijin the pink martians fly with their tentacles rotating like a fan similarly to the martians from the metal slug series mamizous urban legend is the men in black mib an american urban legend that describes government officials dressed in allblack suits appearing after alien and ufo sightings mib could also stand for mamizou in black as mamizou herself wears the black suit in some of her ulil portraits mamizou is probably associated with aliens because her friend nue houjuu is also associated with aliens nue species have the the body of a tanuki and can transform like tanuki which is probably why zun associated nue with mamizou the colors of the gachapon capsules red blue green also match up with the colors of nues ufos
  cont  未確認遊抱戯画unidentified scrolls of wandering ufos  遊抱 yuuhou is not an actual word and is just a kanji representation of the pronunciation of ufo in japanese 遊 does mean wandering/walking/playing but 抱 has has the completely unrelated meaning of hold or embrace if you were to literally translate the card it would be caricatures of wandering embrace but that makes no sense at all 戯画 giga lit caricatures is part of the famous choujuu giga an art piece that mamizou references a lot in her spell cards because of reasons explained earlier giga is commonly translated as scrolls and chouju 鳥獣 lit birds and beasts is commonly translated as frolicking animals thus scrolls of wandering ufos is the most fitting translation the ufos mamizou fires are in the same neon outline art that mimics the art of the chouju giga and is present due to mamizous association with nue houjuu and mamizous urban legend men in black  満員のエイリアンボール crowded alien ball  そろそろ帰ろうエイリアン達よ lets go home soon aliens  both spell cards involve the gachapon capsule and alien motif talked about already see alien capsule for more details also lets go home in the card refers to the tanuki described as aliens returning to the gachapon capsule but it could also refer to actual aliens returning to their home in the stars   宇宙機密漏洩直ちに処置せよ space security leak deal with the situation promptly  mamizous urban legend last word she first attacks the player in a comical fashion with clouds emanating after every hit another reference to one of rocket raccoons ultra combos from ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 like presented in her bellydrumming spell card she then dawns an mib costume and uses a microphone shaped device to flash a blinding light at the opponent this device is a reference to the neuralyzer from the mib men in black franchise which when used against a person emits a flash of light that can erase their past memories its used when someone learns classified information about aliens which is what the spell card name is referring to read alien capsule to find out about mamizous connection to aliens  ポンポコ太鼓の達人 pompoko taiko master  a skill 太鼓の達人 taiko no tatsujin is a reference to the video game franchise of the same name in this skill mamizou has one of her tanuki followers turn into a drum while mamizou herself dawns a taiko drummer outfit and drums releasing leaf projectiles shaped like musical notes pompoko/ponpoko is the sound tanuki make when drumming their bellies  化火符妖怪弾幕変化　葉っぱ発破fire transformation sign youkai danmaku transformation dry leaf detonation  shared with fujiwara no mokou nothing much just a combination of abilities mamizou uses her leaves and mokou makes them burst into flame dry leaves and dry foliage are the main fuel of wildfires by the way this card doesnt have much to do with mamizou  槌化符大判小判弾幕変化mallet transformation sign large and small gold coin danmaku transformation  shared with shinmyoumaru sukuna 大判小判 obankoban lit large coin small coin is a saying that denotes the possession of a large amount of gold coins basically another way to say wealthy/rich shinmyoumarus uchide no kozuchi 打ち出の小槌 lit tapappear little mallet commonly referred to as the magic/miracle mallet is a magic hammer that taps out anything wished for and is a common symbol of wealth the oban large coin and koban small coin are old japanese gold coins the juxtaposition between large and small here connects to shinmyoumarus power to make things large or small using the power of her mallet nothing much to say here about mamizou the card name is self explanatory   雷化符務光と葉っぱの弾幕変化thunder transformation sign mukou and leaf danmaku transformation  shared with kasen ibaraki mukou 務光 is the name of kasens raiju 雷獣 lit thunder beast the card name is self explanatory and doesnt have much to do with mamizou  龍化符ドラゴンズエイリアンカプセル ryu transformation sign dragons alien capsule  shared with kasen ibaraki kasen has pet dragons mamizou utilizes giant gachapon capsules nothing much to add
  cont  化符妖怪弾幕変化　夢見心地  transformation sign youkai danmaku transformation dreamy state of mind  used by dream world mamizou nothing about this card is relevant to her character and the danmaku isnt special or anything   神星符正体不明の怪光人だかりdivine star sign unidentified ghostlight crowd  shared with nue houjuu 怪光 kaikou lit mysterious/ghostly light is not a specific phenomenon or youkai but it refers to any unexplainable floating light sort of like a willowisp this phenomenon is called atmospheric ghost light in english the unidentifiable and mysterious nature of ghost lights goes hand in hand with nues ability to create unidentifiable objects crowd is referring to the humanshaped danmaku mamizou shoots these human danmaku the suddenly turn into birds this could be in reference to the nues call which sounds like the bird call of the scaly thrush toratsugumi nue herself also shoots curving snakelike lasers a reference to the nues snake tail the kanji for divine/god 神 is present in all of mamizous cards in vd because many good hearted tanuki were enshrined as kami including danzaburoudanuki mamizou herself the kanji for star 星 is here because nue has an alien/outer space theme to her   輝神符謎のドンドコ人だかりshining divine sign enigmatic dondoko crowd  shared with raiko horikawa mamizou fires her usual human bullets that then turn to birds while raiko rains exploding drums from the sky ドンドコ dondoko is the sound a taiko drum makes and it rhymes with ponpoko/pompoko the sound of a tanuki drumming its belly 人だかり crowd again because of mamizous humans but in this instance it could be something like a crowd watching raiko perform 謎 mysterious/puzzling/enigmatic in the title is either referencing youkai 妖怪 lit mysterious/strange/mystical apparition a whole mamizou is a bakedanuki and raiko is a tsukumogami or the tanukis nature of transformation allowing it to change things into a number of forms in this case human danmaku to bird danmaku which could be described as strange the kanji for shining/bright/radiant 輝 is in the card name as either a reference to raikos association with lightning/thunder 電光 lit electric light due to her raijin 雷神 lit thunder god motif or is a reference to a shining/rising star a person or thing rising in popularity usually a musician/rock star   神緋符雷雨の中のストーカーdivine scarlet sign stalker in a thunderstorm  shared with iku nagae 雷雨 thunderstorm is in the card name because iku can manipulate weather especially lighting/thunder due to her being a youkai oarfish that can channel the power of dragons 緋 scarlet/crimson/red is in the card name because zun associates the color scarlet with celestials and other beings of the sky like iku why because 緋 hisou scarlet sounds like 非想非非想天 hisouhihisouten bhavagra the highest level of heaven also because oarfish have red accents on their appendages which is what ikus frilly clothes are modeled after ストーカー stalker is probably referring to mamizou but for what reason is a mystery to me i can only assume it refers to the motif in japanese stories of tanuki procuring alcohol during rainy nights which i have explained in post 20293706 i guess a tanuki waiting on a rainy night can be considered a stalker as in stalking a brewery until the coast is clear so they could take alcohol or it could just refer to mamizous human bullets which momentarily pause and continue pursuing the player between ikus lightning danmaku
  final cont  i forgot to mention some of mamizous clothes in her original td appearance she had weird black wristbands which i cant find the inspiration or point of they never appeared again after that she also wore flat strawcolored sandals in td which are probably waraji 草鞋 typical footwear of a tanuki in the fighting games she instead gets weird long blackheeled sandals with bells on them the bells reference kosuzu obviously in the various manga mamizou can be seen wearing geta 下駄 traditional japanese wooden sandals her music themes are obvious too with 佐渡のニッ岩 futatsuiwa from sado reffering to mamizou traveling from sado to gensokyo and 幻想郷のニッ岩 futatsuiwa from gensokyo reffering to mamizous new residence in gensokyo that seems to be all there is to analyze you can read about her personality and plot relevance in the games sopm and the various manga as for mamizous abilities shes of course able to disguise herself and other things as completely different objects zun said that these are merely illusions though and cant take the properties of newly transformer into object for example zun said that if she were to transform a dog into a bird the illusion would be quickly exposed because the dog cannot fly this is kind of bullshit though because mamizou in the fighting games is able to transform her tanuki followers into various youkai large or small flying and terrestrial she can turn her opponents into small helpless animals she even turns one of them into a giant boiling teapot bath that blows off hot steam a tanuki can certainly not match that size and it certainly does not have the ability to blow off hot steam either zun retconned his own words or the fighting games and manga arent canon im going with the former so with this ability in mind id say shes pretty powerful it has endless uses and possibilities shes also described as one of the 3 strongest tanuki of japan and her tail is huge zun states that the size and magnificence of the tail of a beast youkai measures its importance and strength putting all this together it seems mamizou is the strongest beast youkai and one of the strongest youkai in gensokyo along with yukari and the oni ran might be her only true match but shes a shikigami that gets power from being close to her master so without yukari around i think its safe to say mamizou would beat ran in a serious battle so thats pretty much it    i already mentioned them in that post you replied to theyre shibaemondanuki and hagedanuki are you asking if they appear in the series though if so no they dont at least not so far mamizou mentions two other powerful tanuki so that confirms their existence but thats about it theyre probably doing their own thing in the outside world right now        forgot to add something about the chouju giga kyoukous and mystias band is called chouju gigaku 鳥獣伎楽 lit gigaku of the bird and beast 伎楽 gigaku is an ancient form of japanese dance zun really does love referencing the chouju jinbutsu giga
this is a good thread
is this the legendary wall of text otaku
  more like mamizous lore general
  anon was surprised kaguya was based on a legend  the fuck  princess kaguya is literally everywhere especially in old shows and is referenced somewhere somehow in some way
extremely high quality lore thread
  i guess its due to him lacking a contact with japanese culture and its not so much common knowledge if youre on the west
  its actually the opposite  clownpieces leggings inspired abraham lincoln to create the flag
the reason kogasa is a blacksmith is that according to her all creatures with 1 eye and 1 foot all get a bit of ambient faith from ippon datara whos name as a youkai comes from that same tatara     ippon datara are thought to be master blacksmiths by some due to their looks having lost an eye staring into furnaces and lost a leg from years of pumping the bellows due to the connection of having one eye and leg any one eye and one legged youkai gets some ambient ability to be a blacksmith since kogasas form as a youkai is the karakasa obake or umbrella ghost/monster her umbrella is her base form and it only has one eye and one leg    in short the two resemble eachother enough to draw a comparison    kogasa in and of herself seems to have done this intentionally but it is an important distinction for that matter kogasa may actually secretly be an ippon datara thatd be a really cool twist honestly    i tought i had enough informative posts like this saved but most of it is copypastas and trash oh well i wonder for how long can we keep this threads alive
  i remember reading a bit of this after that chapter of wahh pretty nice
could anyone explain to me the meaning/ symbolism behind the name heavenly jade dipper and how is it related to okina and the dancers or the whole game what ive found so far is that heavenly probably is about constellation and the dipper is well the dipper but im not sure if its the major or minor and i have no idea what jade means here but old chinese highly valued the mineral for its meaning of immortality    i also read about the 4 chinese symbols which corresponds to 4 seasons but this is probably not related at all i was just reading about the black turtle stuff    and theres bugang which is a taoist ritual dance related to mai and satono based on the steps of yu tradition in which a taoist priest paces through a supernatural pattern such as stars in the big dipper
where is medichans lore at
i read here somewhere that futo is actually tojikos mom or something like that what was that about

        i will not now nor will i ever call it that other thing  4chan forever
  im finally back after finishing mamizou eiki should thankfully not be all that complicated eiki shikis 四季映姫 shiki eiki name is not all that convoluted thanks to a translation fuck up a lot of western fans think that her first name is shikieiki/sikieiki and that her last name is yamaxanadu this is not correct however shiki eiki is just the japanese order of her full name with the surname appearing before the first name yamaxanadu ヤマザナドゥ is just her title she is a judge after all in true english order her full name  title should have been formated like yamaxanadu eiki shiki eiki 映姫 literally means mirror/reflection princess but 姫 hime pronounced ki in this case doesnt literally mean princess in her name its just a feminine way to end a female name in japanese and was in older times only used in the names of females of noble birth eiki herself is a yama a respected position in hell it most likely refers to 浄玻璃鏡 johari no kagami a type of magical mirror used by enmao and the other judges of hell that reflects all the sins of a persons life the kanji also appears in pofvs title 花映塚 kaedzuka lit flower viewing mound where 花映 flower reflection refers to the japanese cultural custom of 花見 hanami lit flower viewing which connects to the game since the flowers of gensokyo are unusually beautiful due to blooming all at once thanks to souls inhabiting them making it a perfect time to view flowers as expressed by many characters in the ingame dialogue 映 can also mean to transfer or move and can refer to the transferring of souls from higan to the flowers of gensokyo shiki 四季 literally means four seasons and most likely refers to the incident of the game in which wandering souls cause flowers of all four seasons to bloom out of season her name and theming also seems to take inspiration from the obscure chinese god 四季花神 lit four seasons flower god but this is most likely a coincidence and nothing more another probable coincidence is that it could have been inspired by the japanese name for the quarter sessions old english courts that were held 4 times a year is 四季法廷 shiki hotei lit four seasons court eiki is related to the seasons because obviously the game deals with flowers of every season blooming suddenly because of a vast amount of souls inhabiting them due to an event that happens every sixty years sixty year periods a sexegenary cycle was a common way of measuring and marking time in ancient china and japan its associated with the seasons and isnt used much in modern times unless a major event usually a war occurs this makes sense giving the reasoning for so much human souls appearing in higan is apparently due to an event that happens in the outside world about every sixty years probably a tragedy such as a war that would cause death at a large scale pofv was released on august 15th 2005 world war ii ended on september 2nd 1945 shortly after japan surrendered on august 14th of that year days after the nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki pofv was released almost exactly sixty years after japans surrender on august 14th 1945 this implies that the previous flower blooming incident in gensokyo occured because of the mass death that happened due to the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki what happened in the outside world on august 2005 to cause pofvs flower blooming is a mystery but its most likely some sort of war getting back on track eikis title yamaxanadu ヤマザナドゥ combines both yama the hindu god of death and the old name for japans judge of hell enma and xanadu the summer palace of kublai khan which in modern days is just a synonym for paradise thus it would translate to yama judge of paradise which is extremely similar to eikis other title supreme judge of paradise 楽園の最高裁判長 however in touhou yama is a species and not an individual it isnt reserved for enmao eikis omaketxt and pmiss article reveal that yamaxanadu is not a unique title it just goes to the yama currently in charge of gensokyo eiki this implies that many yama were assigned to gensokyo before eiki and that eiki herself wont be gensokyos yama forever a lot of people even japanese fans mistakenly think that eiki is based on the main judge of japanese hell enmao 閻魔王 lit king enma also known as emma or enmadaio 閻魔大王 lit great king enma and used to be referred to as yama eiki is not enma she is never called enma in the series at all enma used to be called yama because hes actually based on the hindu god of death yama यम because buddhism as you probably already know originated in the indian subcontinent and was heavily influenced by hinduism enma is the fifth of the ten kings juo 十王 of hell naraka/jigoku that judge the souls of the deceased in touhou each of these hell kings is still called a yama species not capitalized
  cont  western fans often make the mistake of calling eiki the yama or yama as if shes the only yama when in fact she isnt no one calls her yama or the yama in the japanese fandom and zun himself never refers to eiki this way they always use her name or a yama as mentioned before eiki is not enma and lots of fans western and japanese mistakenly refer to her as so first we must understand the ten kings of hell to progress this discussion each of the ten kings of hell has true form as an epithet of a bodhisattva bosatsu wisdom king myoo or buddha nyorai/butsu the kings and their true forms are as follows  shinkoo fudo myoo  shokoo shaka nyorai  soteio monju bosatsu   gokano fugen bosatsu   enmao jizo bosatsu   henjyoo miroku bosatsu   taizano yakushi nyorai  byodoo kannon bosatsu  toshio seishi bosatsu  gototenrino amida nyorai  enma being the 5th king of hell is supposed to secretly be jizo bosatsu but in touhou eiki is revealed to have been a simple jizo statue not jizo himself reborn as a yama this is said to be true for most yama according to pmiss by the way besides the ten kings there are hundreds or even thousands of other yama who work in the myriads of hells that exist pmiss uses most because its obvious that the ten kings of hell are not jizo statues but bodhisattvas wisdom kings and buddhas in their own right eikis own article in pmiss which comes right after the article on yama does not name her as one of the ten kings of hell at all thus contrary to popular belief eiki is not enma at all but just gensokyos yama who was born from a regular jizo statue moving on eiki as a yama is part of an organization called the ministry of right and wrong 是非曲直庁 this organization formed in hell as a way to properly account for and judge every human soul who didnt immediately enter heaven upon their body dying according to pmiss the organization is headed by ten yama obviously the ten kings of hell below these ten yama are the numerous other lesser yama who control shinigami to reap human souls and kishin 鬼神 who control oni to torture human souls eiki is part of that lower class of yama with the introduction of hecatia its revealed that there are even higher powers than even the ten kings of hell in the organization hecatia is a goddess of hell and is one of the ringleaders of the organization this makes her above eiki in terms of influence and power which should answer your original question the other leaders at the top of the organization seem to be elite kishin with power that rivals hecatias power she opposes their direction for the organization but ultimately chose not to fight with them shes distant from the organization now it seems but she still holds her status she herself says that no one in hell dare challenges her because shes simply the strongest the inhabitants of hell as hecatia describes them are anarchical and power hungry power is status in hell and she describes hells society as a powerbased meritocracy she also talks about powerful evil beings in hell who have the intent to destroy gensokyo and the universe but she worries little about them because she knows they would never pursue such goals for fear that they would be confronted by her basically hecatia is super op and is basically the strongest character that zun has introduced in touhou and she will probably remain so unless he literally puts in god or something ridiculous like that by the way kishin 鬼神 are a type of wrathful japanese buddhist god the ones at the top of the organization are most likely these gods but the ones who order the oni to torture souls below the ten kings are probably just super strong oni as kishin is made up of the characters for oni 鬼 and god 神
  cont  right now lets move on to eikis spell cards  徳の説示 charge of virtue  this is eikis charge attack in pofv 説示 setsuji is a term used in japanese courts to describe the action of a judge explaining  or instructing a case to a jury in terms of its legal implications it literally means instructions or explanations it also in religious buddhist terms means the explanation demonstration or teaching of a religious practice charge in english has many definitions but in this case that japanese term perfectly applies to definition of an official instruction especially one given by a judge to a jury regarding points of law 徳 literally just virtue probably refers to a judges and yamas ability to discern right from wrong and make the right benevolent decision   弾幕裁判 danmaku trial  eikis ex attack in pofv touhou wiki translates 裁判 as judgement for some reason even though its more analogous to trial danmaku has obvious connotations trial in this sense refers to a court trial the name is also likely wordplay on 弾劾裁判 dangai saibansho lit court/trial of impeachment a japanese court that impeaches the position of a judge if they are found guilty of corruption or any other wrongdoing it sounds like danmaku saibansho the name of the card pronounced in japanese  罪符彷徨える大罪punishment sign wandering mortal sin  this spell card is self explanatory and doesnt really have any lore to it 罪 by itself can be translated as guilt crime/sin or punishment/conviction and it isnt clear which the card refers to since eiki is a yama judge i decided that punishment fits best 大罪 taizai lit great sin is used to refer to terrible sins and is most close to the western concept of a grave or mortal sin 彷徨 wandering probably refers to sinful souls making its way across the sanzu towards higan particularly those who didnt have the money to pay for a ferry across the river or it refers to the lost souls who poured over into gensokyo inhabiting flowers and making them bloom  審判ラストジャッジメントjudgement last judgment  last judgement is in katakana meaning it refers to the paiting the last judgment by michael angelo the painting references the apocalypse and the second coming of christ which is considered by some christian denominations to be the final and eternal judgement of humans by god eiki being a yama similarly makes a last judgement when deciding if a soul is to be sent to the realm of hell realm of gaki realm of animals realm of humans realm of asura or realm of heaven eiki also has that specific painting by michael angelo for her spell card backgrounds in stb this isnt the first time zun used the last judgement as a motif it was also the name of the stage 5 theme in ms probably because that game had heavy influence from the smt series which deals with themes from christianity a lot the danmaku in this card consists of eiki sending copious amounts of wooden rods towards you while firing seven lasers three red ones to the left three blue ones to the right and one giant purple one in the middle redguilty blueinnocent and purplethe judgement   虚言タンオブウルフlie tongue of wolf  this spell card references the story the boy who cried wolf arguably greek storyteller aesops most famous tale the tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly tricks nearby villagers into thinking wolves are attacking his flock when a wolf actually does appear and the boy again calls for help the villagers believe that it is another false alarm and the sheep are eaten by the wolf this gave rise of the idiom to cry wolf which means to give a false alarm or to lie a common thing japanese parents tell to children who they suspect are lying is that if you tell a lie the yama of hell will pull out your tongue
  cont  審判十王裁判judgement trial of the ten kings  if you are not sent immediately to heaven upon dying you must traverse the underworld in order to be judged by the ten kings of hell the danmaku in this spell card comes in ten waves each corresponding to a king the fifth wave uses radial lasers and is different from the others because eiki takes her theming from enmao the fifth king of hell although she is not enma herself the last three waves are also different from the rest because meeting with the last three kings of hell means you are already going to hell taizano the 7th judge is the most important judge aside from enmao as he is the final say on whether you enter hell or not the next three judges will meet you in hell and decide what your punishment is in there which is why the last three waves of danmaku are so different   the process of judgement by the ten kings is described in detail here    審判ギルティオワノットギルティjudgment guilty or not guilty  this card is a harder version of judgement the last judgement from pofv with bubble danmaku taking the place of wooden rod danmaku guilty or not guilty refers to the two different verdicts in a court its a common expression in english aya in her comment on this spell card also uses an extremely complicated idiom that has some very minor relation to eiki but im not gonna bother to explain it you can find a japanese explanation here and read it if you can read japanese of course    審判浄頗梨審判 射命丸文judgement cleansed crystal judgement aya shameimaru  浄頗梨 cleansed crystal refers to the johari no kagami lit cleansing/purifying crystal mirror the yama of hell use these mirrors to show a person their past life and past sins in game eiki summons another aya obviously a reflection to attack and ayas own theme wind god girl plays this also perhaps is a reference to a technique in psychology called the johari window named after creators joseph luft and harrington ingham which helps a patient better understand themselves in japanese its called ジョハリの窓 using the kanji 窓 johari lit cleanse/purify the same kanji thats used for the name of a yamas mirror   妖花符バタフライストーム閻魔笏spirit flower sign butterfly storm yama shaku  shared with yuyuko saigyouji yuyuko fires butterflies while eiki shoots out weird glittering rodshaped danmaku that destroys other bullets and breaks them down into smaller bullets that spread out a 笏 shaku is a wooden rod that japanese officials used to write notes on the kings of hell and yama are all depicted wielding shaku during their trials they use it to write notes on in touhou all yama possess a mirror johari no kagami lit 浄玻の璃鏡 lit cleansed crystal mirror and a shaku 悔悟の棒/kaigou no bo lit rod of remorse also yuyuko was appointed princess of the netherworld 冥界 meikai lit dark world by the yama eiki was probably one of the yama who reached that decision the weird reflective danmaku that eiki shoots are probably shaku specifically the yamas shaku rods of remorse in pofv these rods were orange/red/yellow instead 妖 in the spell card references pcbs title or yuyuko herself and can mean many things but its most likely spirit/ghost 花 flower appears in the titles of all of eikis spell cards and refers to pofvs title and eikis connection to flowers  風花符ミシャグジ様の是非wind flower sign mishagujisamas right and wrong  shared with suwako moriya suwako controls the curse/fertility gods called the mishaguji ミシャグジ 是非 right and wrong has an obvious connection to eikis status a yama judge 風 wind in the title references mofs title once again eiki fires her rods which break down suwakos green danmaku into small fragments  風花符オンバシラ裁判wind flower sign onbashira trial  shared with kanako yasaka kanako wears onbashira オンバシラ and a great deal of them are placed around moriya shrine onbashira are giant wooden pillars that harbor religious significance in shinto a great deal of onbashira are placed near the local shrines of suwa and four famous onbashira surround the suwa grand shrine the inspiration and identity of the moriya shrine this is also why kanako specifically dawns four onbashira on her back 風 wind refers to mofs title and kanakos status as a god of weather while 裁判 trial has obvious connections to eiki for the final time in vd eiki shoots her rods that break down kanakos thick red lasers that fall from the sky these are supposed to symbolize onbashira into smaller danmaku fragments
  final cont  天知る 地知る 我知る 人知る heaven knows earth knows i know you know   eikis motto in pofv yama use their mirror to expose the past life of a person so their sins are always known and cannot be hidden the expression comes from the collection of biographies 後漢書 book of the later han in which the knowledgeable yang zen states 天知神知我知子知 heaven knows the gods know i know and you know when a friend of his wants to keep a secret the saying basically states that secrets dont exist and everything will be figured out eventually   music theme  六十年目の東方裁判 fate of sixty years eastern judgment in the sixtieth year  fate of sixty years  the theme references the incident that happens to gensokyo every sixty years in which a event in the outside world causes souls to overflow into gensokyo leading to them to inhabit flowers and cause them to bloom prematurely 東方裁判 touhou saiban lit eastern judgment could be a reference to 東京裁判 tokyo saiban lit tokyo judgment the japanese name for the tokyo tribunal/tokyo trial a military trial against the leaders of the empire of japan that took place on april 29 1946 in order to convict them of war crimes and crimes against humanity as stated before pofv was released and takes place almost exactly one year after wwii implying that the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki was the cause of the previous sixty year cycle event   titles  楽園の最高裁判長 supreme judge of paradise  supreme judge  yama  paradise  gensokyo   口うるさい有難いお話 nagginghelpful lecture  eikis lectures are said to be long boring and annoying  地獄の最高裁判長 supreme judge of hell  self explanatory     now finally her design eiki wears a dark blue top with a black skirt the dark blue top has a mandarin collar the generic name for a chinese shirt with a noticable notch on the collar probably because japans depiction of the yama came from china her undershirt is a white long sleeve and peppered throughout her outfit are juxtaposing red and white ribbons these ribbons birth and death in japanese culture white is the color of death and red is the color of birth her white undershirt and black skirt also serve as motif of the black vs white/wrong vs right theme that emphasizes her status as a yama judge her hat is just the typical headwear of yama with frills added and she has golden shoulder pads that serve to bolster her high status usually the hat of a yama is supposed to have the character for king 王 on it but eikis hat has a scale a traditional symbol of judgment and the symbol of lady justice on it her top is dark blue because zun probably wanted to make her invoke the image of a police officer or other law enforcement official shes carrying her rod of remorse the touhou name for a yamas shaku it looks like gibberish but the rod contains characters that are legible 非 which means wrong since you write notes on shaku eiki probably wrote down the sins or wrongdoings of a person on there i could only make out that and what looks to be 乂 cut/mow or subdue/govern i have no idea what the other symbols read or if theyre supposed to represent kanji at all it seems eiki was originally supposed to be enmao but zun retconned that with pmiss and osp in which komachi states that eiki was a just a jizo statue in the past and not the actual jizo bosatsu like enmao actually is     medicine is always nice ill do this one next then    okina is extremely complicated and is possibly the character with the most background/lore ever and shes new ill do it when i have time probably after medicine
  i forgot mamizous titles  化け狸十変化bakedanuki with ten transformations  mamizou is a bakedanuki she has 10 spell cards in tds extra stage  僅有絶無の外来妖怪 vanishingly rare foreign youkai  mamizou is from sado which is in the outside world she is one of three legendary bakedanuki so that makes her pretty rare tanuki are also known to be great at hiding due to their transformative abilities   佐渡の二ッ岩 futatsuiwa of sado  self explanatory   捕らぬ狸のディスガイザー the uncaught tanuki disguiser  at that point in fs no human knew that mamizou was actually a bakedanuki and not a human also the title is referencing the saying 捕らぬ狸の皮算用 counting the profit from an uncaptured tanukis fur which means that you should not makeplansthatdependon something goodhappeningbefore youknowthat it hasactuallyhappened   いつも驚きを提供する化け狸 the bakedanuki who always provides surprises  mamizou is always deceiving and bamboozling people this title is also supposedly supposed to sound like a corporate slogan highlighting mamizous ulterior motives under her friendly and harmless appearance   侵略せよ宇宙妖怪狸 invade the youkai tanuki from space  mamizou is connected to aliens thanks to nue read more about that on my previous posts about her  変幻自在で喰えない化け狸 phantasmagoric and shrewd bakedanuki   変幻自在  everchanging appearance but its usually translated as phantasmagoric in english referring to mamizous nature as a bakedanuki who can change form at will  喰えない  another way of writing 食えない shrewd refers to mamizous cunning
thank you lore master i hope to see the explanation of heavenly jade dipper soon
bless you  is there a collection of all this wisdom somewhere  the wiki is surprisingly thin on the lore and this is the most interesting stuff
  people here already wrote shitton of lore about okina just search warosu
  player 2 junko
  by the way kishin 鬼神 are a type of wrathful japanese buddhist god  ironic then that sagume isnt very wrothful in fact despite being the kishin she has a bit of angelic motif going on i think
  im not gonna finish okina anytime soon so ill just answer this question now its an easy one anyway   天空璋 tenkuushou  天空 tenkuu  the heavens the presence of the character 天 always signifies divinity so translating it to just sky or firmament is a disservice to the title 天空 literally means heavenly sky but such a translation is redundant as the heavens and sky mean the same thing in english   note 天空 tiankong lit heavenly emptiness/void in chinese is also a concept in confucianism tiankong is the great fluctuation of qi force in the universe responsible for its birth and maturation this has nothing to do with the game however and was likely not even in zuns mind at all  璋 shou  dipper/ladle 璋 comes from the chinese word 璋瓚 zhangzan a jade libation ladle used in relgious ceremonies  璋 when used and pronounced as たま tama is a jade shaku that has nothing to do with the title though and is not what zun meant  in game files reveal that a prototype title was 天星璋 tenseishou lit heavenly star dipper which obviously references the big dipper the symbol of matarajin zun also talked about the title in the hsifs interview it was gonna be 天空障 tenkuushou lit heavenly sky hinderance and yes its still pronunced tenkuushou as well at one point but zun decided against it because that title looked odd 障 hinder refers to 障碍神 literally hindrace obstacle god one of matarajins many roles was as a god of obstacles/hindrances/pestilence that must be worshipped in order to remove said hindrances/obstacles/pestilences when zun made the new title the one he would keep 天空璋 he specifically said he kept the 王 king radical in mind he never revealed why in the interview though the radical for 璋 is actually 玉 jade though but that makes sense in japanese because 玉 and 王 are interchangeable 玉 jade has nothing to do with the title yet zun put it there because its interchangeable with 王 king why would zun want to reference 王 in the title specifically kings have nothing to do with hsifs or so you think okina being matarajin is actually connected to that radical you see as ive said earlier in eikis analysis the hats of the yama specifically the ten kings of hell usually are inscribed with the character 王 one of matarajins many forms is that of taizan fukun otherwise known as taizano the 7th king of hell when i go over okina god knows when ill talk all about it anyway in the interview zun basically confirms that tenkuushou refers to the big dipper which is matarajins symbol the jade in the title literally means nothing its there because zun wanted to allude to the 王 king radical for some unknown reason that i just presented the strongest theory to   heres the full interview by the way      no english site or wiki has this level of depth unfortunately the japanese and chinese wikis go into more detail than their western counterparts but you of course have to know the language by the way the ancient chinese and japanese used the big dipper to forecast the seasons pic related this is why okina is associated with the four seasons it wasnt just something random that zun put in     her last name is spelled 稀神 rare god not 鬼神 oni god theyre both pronounced the same but mean different things    please dont kusopost in this thread
  i dont give shit how much backstory okina have shes shit character and i dont like her
  dont ruin this for us      thank you again lore master so the title only refers to okina and nothing to do with her dancers damn i was having an idea of drawing mai and satono dancing on ursa major sounds nice innit
  fuck off retard
  thank you so much were really looking forward to your okina dump i assume the author of these posts is you i tried to read about matarajin when people were able to figure out who the boss was from the jewel case silhouette but there is next to no material about him in english i would be interested to know about tokoyo no kami and matarajins relation to that cult and the hata clan
can i get some thoughts on this  in pmiss hieda makes this remark about mystia    she is not often seen during the day and there are few witness reports but it is said that she is a humanoid youkai with large wings 1  1 if she would have been sighted in this form first she might have not been called a night sparrow    this implies that mystia had previous forms either through shapeshifting or reincarnation if this is common to all gensokyos cuties the form each youkai appears in now is different than precious possibly more frightening incarnations  if this is true it explains why some 2hus are described as wanting to eat each other and humans the little girl appearance is like the siren that seems appealing only to lure humans to their death the cute facade is merely a trap    that or it shows an effort on the part of the youkai to pacify their former bestial natures and to live civilized like humans this would mesh with their readiness to accept the spell card rules that made combat more fair maybe becoming more humanoid is a step towards purifying themselves of their mythical nature which may be prone to disappear as humans on the outside relegate more and more objects to the realm of myth  am i way off or am i just now realising something obvious that everyone already knew
  this was incredibly interesting i need to increase my japanese studies asap
  nah your fairly on the mark mind you gensokyo literally exists so youkai can continue living since they have massive issues in a lot of places in the outside world  them shifting so they dont require the mysticism of their lore could be argued as an adaptation so it is simply easier to survive
so i have a completely different question why is remilia and flandre so hilariously powerful even compared to most other youkai when by all rights they arnt a legendary vampire like mamizou is literally one of the three strongest tanuki or the big four oni
are there any interesting tidbits and connections involving miko that you guys can tell me about
  vampires are just strong
  not to mention theyre probably one of the few types of yokai that can generally get some amount of fear and recognition from the outside world which probably adds onto the powerlevel  werewolves got the short end of the stick since people only think of them as dumb brutes
  not as cute loving or as sexy as byakuren      considering most vampires in modern fiction are typically based around dracula they typically use the traits popularized by him such as super strength speed haunting beauty the ability to turn into animals dust and fog are immortal unless slain through specific means  and can turn other people into lesser vampire thralls by biting them however some of the less popular abilities that dracula had such as the ability to control animals the ability to shrink to fit through small spaces and other shit such as his really contrived weaknesses like being unable to move past running water having their powers only work at night instead of dying from sunlight and being only able to enter buildings if let in are also unused by modern fiction writers    there isnt exactly one specific quality vampires have due to there being so many different kinds of vampires being described all over the world and that the idea of vampirelike monsters means many kinds of mythological creatures tend to be called vampires as a simplification as the idea of vampire creatures have existed since the rise of early civilization
  that being said ancient creatures that could be considered protovampires would be those found in mesopotamian cultures such as the lilith/lilitu of sumer that was described to be infertile beautiful maidens who after choosing a lover would never let them go and the lilitu would be described as birdfooted demons that were sexual predators who feeded on the blood of babies and their mothers this idea of hauntingly beautiful creatures that feed on the blood of people they manipulate into falling for them is very very old another example of ancient protovampires would be the babylonian goddess lamashtu being described as the malicious daughter of heaven who was a bloodsucking creature with a lions head and the body of a donkey in judaic traditions it was believed lilith was able to transform into animals such as cats in order to charm her victims other examples of protovampires would be the greek empusa and lamia the former were bronzefooted daughters of hecate that seduced men by transforming into young beautiful women only to suck their blood as they slept and the lamia being the daughter of king belus who was smited by hera who preys on young children and sucks their blood at night     the idea of beautiful seductive creatures of the night that drink blood may sound similar to succubi but thats primarily because both mythological creatures shared similar roles in mythologies to begin with as seduction and the hunger for blood are primary traits for vampires
  the lilith from jewish literature is also known for being adams first wive before eva who after copulating with samael ran away from heaven some people consider her as a succubi since she is known for how she is skilled at seducing men
  its basically confirmed that the youkai of gensokyo can switch between monstrous and humanoid forms take mamizous followers for example they can appear as bakedanuki or young looking girls we also see youkai like the okuriinu which are youkai yamainu an extinct japanese wolf better known as the honshu wolf take the form of animals or like kagerou who is also a honshu wolf take the form of a human most youkai are shapeshifters anyway this shouldnt be anything too surprising     vampires are just extremely powerful in physical and magical abilities pmiss makes it clear that their strength allows them to uproot trees with one hand and speed through the human village in the blink of an eye and they can turn into bats or mist on command but they have lots of common weaknesses too many to name since remilia and flandre are the only vampires in gensokyo its possible that theyre just powerful individual also remilia claims ancestry from vlad tepes aka dracula the strongest vampire although she may be lying akyuu only had them to base the entire species entry off after all kurumi is also a vampire but isnt that strong if you consider pc98 to be relevant they get decimated by spiritual attacks though so theyre no match for miko gods hermits and celestials but i doubt theyre as lightning fast as tengu or as ridiculously strong as oni their power lies in their jackofalltrades disposition
  an alternate explanation is her ability to smith tools is what amounts to her kinds version of reproduction
  the douji and okina have almost nothing to do with taoism by the way the dances that the douji perform are just typical noh/sarugaku/kagura and tenguodoshi tengu placating along with haneotori plucking feathers the big dipper is an extremely common symbol in all chinese/japanese religions as far as i know matarajin and his cohorts are not connected to taoism unless you take into account his form of taizan fukun taishan fujun in chinese which was worshipped by some chinese folk taoists
  thank you
  medicine actually has some pretty neat inspirations first off her name メディスン メランコリー / medicine melancholy is a direct reference to american author ray bradburys short story a medicine for melancholy in fact her whole design seems to be connected to that story so ill start with that first in the story a girl named camillia wilkes falls deathly ill and is unable to get better her family tries to find a cure and goes through many lists of medicinal herbs and flowers including stone parsley opobalsam and pontic valerian as suggested by a gypsy the gypsy suggests that camillia has melancholia depression then a dustman comes towards the family and tells them that they must leave her out on a night of a full moon the family obliges and the girl is left outside at night under the full moon the dustman comes to her playing a lute and camillia doesnt seem to recognize him the dustman calls himself bosco after the famous italian priest saint bosco who roamed the streets caring for homeless children he then has sex with her now morning the girl murmurs in her sleep a medicinefor melancholy and wakes up just as her parents approach her she seems to be ecstatic rosycheeked and playful she asks them to dance with her much to their disbelief the story ends okay so theres a lot to explain here first of all the word melancholy is derived from one of the four humors four bodily fluids that classical and medieval people believed existed and influenced health the four humors are black bile melan chole melancholic yellow bile xanthe cole choleric phlegm phlegma phlegmatic and blood haima sanguine an excess of melan chole literally black bile is thought to make a person depressive this is where there word melancholy sad depressed originates according to greek and medieval sources in order to stop depressive symptoms one must empty the body of black bile or balance it out with the opposite blood sanguine note that sanguine now means happy in english in order to raise sanguine levels one must dance listen to music or have sex this is what happens to camillia in the story as the dustman plays the lute for her and then has sex with her she wakes up happy and wants to dance with her parents cured of her melancholia by making her sanguine levels go up this is tied with full moon symbolism as the greek titan of the moon selene is associated with sex and love the humors are greek concepts but are suspected to come from egypt and the story makes various references to egypt egyptian medicine and mummies the egyptian goddess isis became associated with the moon thanks to connections with the greek artemis and another egyptian goddess bastet the deity of fertility in both greek and egyptian cultures the moon was connected to femininity and sex thus when the dustman suggests that camillia be put under the light of the full moon he is saying that she should present herself for sex he calls the coming full moon night boscos eve and when he visits her in moonlight he calls himself bosco bosco was a italian saint that roamed the streets of italy helping poor children the dustman calls himself a saint because hes about help cure camillia of her melancholia by having sex with her in the middle of the night the allusion is perfect because bosco was also known to care for those of poor health with herbs and other technique he could be considered a sort of travelling doctor camillia calls the dustman himself a doctor during their encounter with that out of the way the cure for melancholia is revealed to be the moon or in other words sex the medicine for melancholy is love
  cont  in the story camillia is described as pale with lilac eyes and with hair like a creek of gold in literature lilac refers to the color blue not purple medicine sure enough is pale has blue eyes and has gold hair even further strengthening this connection is the fact that camillia is described again in the story this time as a large pale bartolemy doll a bartolemy doll better known as a bartholomew doll or bartholomew baby was a type of wooden doll sold at the bartholomew fair an old english charter fair that operated from medieval times to well into the 1800s this is why medicine is a doll because zun took inspiration from this short story also the fair was named after saint bartholomew saint bartholomew is famous for having been flayed the most striking features of him in art are his black hair and red exposed body medicine herself wears only red and black this is either a reference to saint bartholomew or to black bile melancholy sadness and blood sanguine happiness as stated before the cure for melancholia was to balance the levels of black bile by increasing the levels of blood sanguine through music dance or sex medicine also has four crosses on her clothes one on the middle of her dress one on the bottom of her skirt and two on each of her sleeves these four crosses could represent the four humors zun chose crosses to represent the universal medicinal symbol a cross or to reference the christian cross which connects when you consider both saint bartholomew and saint bosco it likely is supposed to connect to both medicine is heavily connected to the poisonous lily of the valley flowers called スズラン suzuran in japanese she calls the lilies of the valley that she utilizes for poison スーさん susan a cute proper name made up by her to sound like suzuran she personifies and talks to susan so much in pofv that fans wonder if shes actually referring to the flowers or to the little nameless doll that flies next to her which is why many fans call that little doll susan medicine manipulates poison as her ability and the favorite poison of her choice is the poison of the lily of the valley a toxic mixture of glycosides namely convallatoxin that inhibits the hearts ability to pump blood zun chose to associate medicine with that flower due to many reasons first of all agatha christie one of zuns favorite authors calls the lily of the valley her favorite flower secondly the lily of the valley is connected to happiness in floriography the language of flowers the lily of the valley symbolizes a return to happiness and love lily of the valley is also a popular flower of choice for wedding bouquets as you could recall the cure for melancholia is to return sanguine happiness through dance music or sex love thus zun is brilliantly implying that the medicine for melancholy in touhou is the lily of the valley indeed in real life the flower is used in small amounts in herbal remedies to treat heart issues as the flowers glycosides affect the heart the heart is a common symbol for love and happiness to heal the heart is to cure melancholia medicine herself says in pofv that small doses of poison can be medicine and since medicine is mainly associated with the lily of the valley zun is implying that the flower is medicine in small amounts eirin even gets help from medicine who supplies her with flowers because poisons are vital components to medicine again the medicine for melancholy is the the lily of the valley the lily of the valley also has alternate names such as our ladys tears and marys tears referencing the weeping virgin mary this could also be an alternate reason as to why medicine has four crosses on her clothes medicines story as a doll who became a poisonous youkai after being abandoned on the nameless hill which is full of lily of the valley flowers could come from nathaniel hawthornes story rappaccinis daughter in which dr rappaccini keeps his daughter beatrice confined in a garden of poisonous flowers until she eventually becomes poisonous herself its also worth noting that around the time pofv released rozen maiden a series about living dolls was getting to be extremely popular in japan
  cont  medicines frilly clothes and livingdoll theme may possibly be based on the living dolls of rozen maiden oh yeah and medicine is specifically a tsukumogami a type of youkai that a tool becomes when its been untouched for a long time medicine was a ventriloquist doll a dummy before becoming a youkai after laying in the nameless hill for years since gensokyo is a small time capsule of feudal japan its unlikely that a frilly europeanstyle ventriloquist puppet/dummy/doll would have been made or owned by any human living in gensokyo therefore its entirely possible that medicine slipped through the hakurei barrier and fell into gensokyo as a doll after her owner forgot her pmiss even states in the article for the nameless hill that long ago it was common for lost children from the outside world to slip into the nameless hill perhaps medicine was owned by a lost outside world child who dropped her on the hill only to forget her there   attacks/spell cards  ポイズンビー poison bee  medicines charge attack in pofv medicine can freely control any poison ever it seems she is using the poison of a bee melittin  スウィートポイズン sweet poison  medicines ex attack in pofv the lily of the valley is said to smell extremely sweet medicine is probably using the poison of that flower convallatoxin in this attack   毒符神経の毒poison sign nerve poison  an spell card referencing a common type of poison a nerve agent the most famous nerve poison in japan is that of the fugu pufferfish a delicacy with a extremely important preparation if the poison of the fugu is not removed correctly then the consumer will die or be seriously injured by the puffers tetrodotoxin  毒符憂鬱の毒poison sign melancholy poison  a high amount of black bile melan cholia in the human body caused depression and irrational thinking according to the greeks black bile could be considered poison although it doesnt exist  霧符ガシングガーデンfog sign gassing garden  gassing  to kill or harm by exposure to poisonous gas  medicine commonly expels purple clouds of poison gas in her danmaku the card could refer to the nameless hills garden of lilies of the valley or to the poisonous garden in rappaccinis daughter green yellow and purple riceshaped bullets are medicines danmaku of choice in nearly all her spell cards green and purple are common colors that symbolize poison yellow is the color of the seeds of the lily of the valley also besides white the flower can come in yellow and lavender   毒符ポイズンブレスpoison sign poison breath  medicine uses lots of poison clouds in this card the name doesnt seem to reference anything in particular but it is worth noting that a skill in dragon quest of the name name has appeared in the series every since dragon quest v released in 1992 ブレス buresu means both breath and bless as noted previously medicine has various connections to christianity through the crosses on her clothes saint bartholomew/saint bosco and the lily of the valleys connection to the virgin mary  譫妄イントゥデリリウムdelirium into delirium  touhou wiki translates 譫妄 as confusion but thats completely wrong 譫妄 means delirium and only delirium medicines omaketxt in pofv states that she can use poison to make animals and humans mad and can manipulate them that way there is also a belgian beer called delirium tremens named after the medical condition delirium tremens in pmiss one of the many poisons named that medicine can manipulate is alcohol   毒薬変じて甘露となる poison can be medicine in the right doses  medicines motto in pofv indeed the lily of the valley is the medicine for melancholy  music theme  ポイズンボディ  forsaken doll poison body  forsaken doll  medicines body is said to be poisonous to the touch and simply touching her will irritate your skin she was abandoned on the nameless hill thus the usage of the word forsaken   titles  小さなスイートポイズン little sweet poison  the lily of the valley is known to smell very sweet  体に優しくない人形 doll unpleasant to the body  medicines very presence can cause you to be itchy all over her poison is very unwelcoming  spell card background   psychedelic purple flowers     and thats it for medicine such a minor character yet zun didnt skimp out on her at all zun is truly an artist
lore posts are the best they give me so many insights and ideas to draw a character
  plebs know nothing of princess kaguya ask random people youll see
great thread i want to talk about oni   suika  shuten douji 酒呑童子  kasen  ibaraki douji 茨木童子  yuugi  hoshiguma douji 星熊童子    so theres still one member of big four of mountain oni that hasnt been revealed right
  shuten doujin and ibaraki douji arent part of the big four in the original mythology it was shuten doujin ibaraki doujin and the big four in the original legend meaning the possible 4th oni in touhou could be one of three candidates
  douji
  this once i asked another touhou wiki reader and he mistaken change with kaguya
  man why are japanese people so well versed in western literature this book anne of green gables dog of flanders which i doubt theres a flandre connection with haha bram stoker a lot of kids and adults probably dont even know about these books let alone have read them in fact id say the west is probably less versed on its own classics than japan in some ways i dunno anyone who knows stendhals the red and the black but then it just gets casually brought up in anime this is one reason why i defend being a weeb so hard japan is so deeply interested in other cultures that you often end up learning interesting facts about your own culture through references in anime contrarily though how many western adults even know what momotaro is or how the forty seven ronin got their revernge they dont even take an interest in their own classics
half of the character cast is actually men in dresses
  for that matter kogasa may actually secretly be an ippon datara  this interests me a little is kogasa actually part  ippon datara or is it a case of strong overlapping myths that ends up giving her a subclass for lack of a better way to describe it  we know she is clearly a tsukomogami and a karakasa obake but it seems like she only has some traits of a ippon datara by chance  then again this seems like a case of one myth overlapping with multiple others  ultimately if you were to look at kogasa the tatara part of her name is an effective direct pun on the ippondataras name describing the old bellows black smith used to step on to keep the flames flowing  she seems fairly oddly competent in multiple areas and quite decently strong as goofy as she is presented  i actually wonder if that might also be a nod to one version of the myth which says the ippondatara is actually a fallen mountain god who has reverted back into a yokai  kanako talks about this in large during sopm too    we actually see a lot of the characters in touhou as very liberal takes on their base myths such as remi being considered an oni vampire being literally written as blood sucking oni and therefore sharing all the weaknesses/strengths as well as her own vampiric myth
  she literally fits all the qualifications for an ippon datara up too and including being a hilariously good blacksmith to the point of actually being reimus weaponsmith when her needles and shit go bad  implying shes not one
blessed thread
  im not too sure about other creators but zun said himself that he loves gothic western literature especially the works of agatha christie the japanese are generally more well educated than the rest of the world    let me correct something on my old post eikis rod of remorse only has one character on it it seems 罪 which means crime this makes sense because yama right notes on their shaku about what crimes/sins a person has committed in their lifetime the other symbols seems to be nonsense or maybe hyper stylized kanji that i cant identify also her theme begins very similar to the legend of kage from hrtp possibly because sariel is an angel of death connecting her to shinigami and thus yama the title of that track from hrtp references the legend of kage 影の伝説 and old game by taito while making pofv zun was still working at taito so its probably more than likely a reference to the game whats even more is that another music track from the legend of kage seems to be referenced in eikis theme and touhous main theme as a whole theme of eastern story seems to come from the the legend of kage as well   legend of kage opening vs theme of eastern story    and literally any touhou title screen theme from eosd onwards  the legend of kage vs fate of sixty years      legend of kage rescue attempt vs fate of sixty years     050 mark  it seems zun really loved that game or had fond memories of it he probably associates it with japanese culture on a deep level after all on his comments in eikis theme he says he had japan  rebirth  country of cherry blossoms in mind when creating the theme rebirth obviously refers to samsara the cycle of reincarnation that occurs when you die and are either reborn into hell or another realm the yama oversee this cycle japan because remember the theme references wwii as i explained in a previous post and because i suppose zun wanted a very eastern feel to it touhou is literally in the title country of cherry blossoms 桜の国 was a manga released between 2003 and 2004 it told the story of a family who survived the atomic bombing of hiroshima on another note shiki as you may remember literally means four seasons in the legend of kage the stages switch between the various seasons also something i forgot to mention about the sixty year cycle was that the ancient chinese/japanese thought it was important because its the product of 3x4x5 60 3 stands for the three lights sun moon stars 4 stands for the four seasons winter spring summer autumn and 5 stands for the five elements wood fire earth metal water in the end zun probably has some special soft spot for the legend of kage and he probably thinks its the game with the most quintessential eastern touhou feel zun says in the seasonal dream vision cd that fate of sixty years is his most touhoulike song he also says that its a song that is fitting for a oneyear gap the story is like that too 3x4 12 in 3x4x5 60 represents the 12 months one year since flowers of every season are blooming during pofv it could be said that the game and by extension eiki shiki because shiki means four seasons is a celebration of the whole year which makes sense since pofv as ive said earlier was 60 years after the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and the surrender of japan which led to the tokyo tribunal which is referenced in sixty years title as ive analyzed previously all of this coincides with the sixty year cycle the ancient chinese and japanese held in such high regards zun is brilliant
    oh yes and it seems the one prominent flower on medicines spell card background seems to from the genus rafflesia rafflesia flowers are noted for smelling foul american author carl van vechten wrote in his book the merrygoround that the flower contained poisons such as muscarine and orsere even though the flower is not poisonous in real life at all zun really is a nerd for western literature ive already talked about eikis spell card background which is a scrolling pattern over the last judgement by michelangelo and mamizous luminous full moon spell card background in their analyses so go read it again if you missed it also medicines scope the red field that can be activated with all characters in pofv to reflect bullets from enemy sprites is in the shape of a star this is because the germanic writer and physician paracelsus stated that those affected by melancholy black bile would look toward or be more susceptible to commit acts of divination this includes working with demons and using the stars as a method of divination pic related also if you notice medicines player character danmaku are shaped like crosses the connection between her and christianity is strong as ive explained in depth earlier in those analysis posts eikis scope is just a simple circle and has no inspiration or lore
  thanks after researching further perhaps the structure of the big four is like this    leader of big four  suika/shuten douji 酒呑童子    vice leader of big four  kasen/ibaraki douji 茨木童子    the big four of mountain 山の四天王  yuugi/hoshiguma douji 星熊童子  toraguma douji 虎熊童子  kanaguma douji 金熊童子  kuma douji 熊童子
  so are all of them female or are we just shown female yokais/fairies or are males really rare    sorry if this question is really basic im just not that deep into touhou
  speaking of which ive brought this up before and you seem like a person who knows a lot of in depth info christianity mainly catholicism has had a strong history in japan it was never as influential as buddhism and shinto but japans underground christians are as much a part of japans history as any  persecution beginning mainly in the tokugawa shogunate forced christianity underground in touhou there are only vague indirect references to christianity rumia mentions a crucified saint remilia scoffs at crucifixes and i believe a picture of an inari shrine in one of the manga has a hidden crucifix in it is there any case for christianity having a hidden presence in touhou its been my pet theory that if christianity is present then it would be interesting to have it simply covertly present as it parallels how christianity was only covertly present in japanese history
  the fortune teller was male also unzan is male
  oh yes and it seems the one prominent flower on medicines spell card background seems to from the genus rafflesia  i think i had a stroke when writing this   it seems the one prominent flower on medicines spell card background is from the genus rafflesia  i type these super fast so please excuse typos and confusing grammar    zun said that there are male youkai we see a some in the various manga but it just happens to be that the female characters are more prominent making it seem like there are only females in gensokyo this was just a copout explanation as there really is no true lore explanation for why females are more prominent than males i assume its because zun cannot draw males well he also said that danmaku is feminine and is more suited for girls to use     zun does use christian/catholic images at times in his stories but i doubt there are christians in gensokyo currently unless of course there are and we just havent been introduced yet gensokyo is located in the yatsugatake mountains and historically there werent any catholic missionaries or churches there the same is true for today characters like rumia and seiga who said that mikos resurrection would be more magnificent than jesus resurrection make reference to christianity so it isnt unknown even akyuu a villager who hasnt been outside of gensokyo compared mikos resurrection to that of jesus aya and seiga are familiar with santa claus and kasen compares shaka nyorai gautama buddha to jesus christ in wahh its clear that christianity is not an uncommon topic in gensokyo since even akyuu knows about it then im sure bibles exist in gensokyo kosuzu probably has one jesus being resurrected is real in touhous universe so whos to say what other foreign gods/angels/demons/youkai there are they clearly exist its only a matter of if or when zun chooses to explore the topic in the future  inari shrine   hidden crucifix  i think youre misremembering are you talking about pic related that isnt a crucifix its just part of the wooden frame of the shrine
  the yama no shitennou lit four heavenly kings of the mountain were a group of four of the most powerful oni in gensokyo in japanese mythology the shitennou four heavenly kings are four buddhist deities that each represent a direction bishamonten for the north zouchouten for the south jikokuten for the east and koumokuten for the west the title shitennou can also be used for any four important figures and it was even used in military rankings at one point touhous shitennou are mostly based on the shitennou of oni king shutendouji lit sakedrinking oni shutendoujis oni gang consisted of himself hoshikumadouji lit starbear oni torakumadouji lit tigerbear oni kumadouji lit bear oni and kanekumadouji lit ironbear oni he also had a child named ibarakidouji lit thornbush oni douji literally means child in modern japanese but it used to refer to a variety of other things including servant and oni suika is based on shuten yuugi is based on hoshikuma and kasen is based on ibaraki as you could see gensokyos four heavenly kings dont strictly follow shutens four heavenly kings the final oni could be kuma kanekuma torakuma or a curveball some fans speculate that konngara is the final member because shes based on konngaradouji 矜羯羅童子 japanese phonetic form of the sanskrit kimkara slave the kanji before douji mean nothing konngaradouji is a yaksha in japanese mythology yaksha are considered a type of oni
  eosd is explicitly western that explains like 95 of christian imagery in the series
is there any lore explanation to okinas ability to create doors on the back of anything why exactly on the back
  one of matarajins roles was the god of the back of the shrine okina seems to be able to do anything as long as it relates to the back of things
whats with reimu living in poverty aside from empty donation box memes wahh shows that every business she tries ends up goin wrong one way or another
what if this entire time hecatia thought junko was pissed about houyi shooting down 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘶𝘯 and not 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘰𝘯
  wahh have also chapter that explains it kinda
        nice read on my favorite of the characters its interesting to see how all these details add up    i certainly wouldnt mind trying to relieve her of her melancholy
  im gonna go over okinasoon she really has too much inspirations/connections probably by the end of this month but the door thing is easy to explain so ill tell you about that now one aspect of matarajin is worshipped at the back door ushirodo of shrines matarajin is secretly a manifestation the buddha amida amitabha in tendai the sect of buddhism matarajin is most associated with amida is usually worshipped at front of the shrine with another god at the backdoor in the case of koryuji and some other temples this god is matarajin dances and rituals associated with matarajin are performed near this back door this is why zun gave okina the ability to create doors on the back of anything this ability works like a portal and allows her to travel anywhere she can even open doors on peoples backs and fill them with magic and empower them which is what she did with the protagonists of hsifs they gathered seasonal energy and when they met okina at stage 6 she took their seasonal energy and then forcefully ejected them outside the seasonal door on their backs that they used to collect the energy in the first place in the extra stage the protagonists instead collect doyou the fifth season which exists between every season instead doyou has no vitality according to okina this is because its where nature is at its weakest okina cant take that energy and expel the protagonists out a door so the protagonists get to fight a full fair danmaku battle with okina and win of course okina reveals in ayas extra that she could have closed the door at the protagonists back at any time rendering them powerless against her okina just let the protagonist win is what zun basically implied it wasnt a serious fight anyway okina was just testing the protagonist for fun and in reimus case testing to see if gensokyo was functioning properly besides the ability to make backdoors anywhere okina can manipulate vitality and mental energy vitality is something that life operates on in principle it more accurately translates to life force its the energy of nature itself the fairies and seasons went crazy because okina was pumping vitality into gensokyo to bring attention to herself and to test the emergency response of gensokyo fairies are made up of vitality nature they went crazy in hsifs because okina basically powered them up just like she did with the protagonists she can use vitality to create youkai as she pleases she created aunn by filling up a komainu statue with vitality now manipulate means to move around and use as you please okina can also remove vitality as we see in hsifs when she renders the protagonists powerless by taking their energy and then forcibly ejecting them imagine if she took a youkai or humans actual vitality and not their seasonal vitality its basically an instant death ability all living things are made up of vitality okina could take away that vitality and thus instantly destroy a living being or erase it from existence just as she could create a living being by imbuing something with vitality in fact in wahh okina claims that she can remake destroy then create again the entirety of gensokyo if she so pleases this ability over vitality is extremely powerful it seems fitting for a god and gensokyo sage like okina and we have no idea what mental energy is yet can okina make people go insane make them feel motivated what is manipulation of mental energy this is never elaborated on but if its similar to mind control then okina seems to be the most broken character in terms of power second only to hecatia
  so i legitimately wonder with the fact we know 3 of gensokyos sages that run things in the background which are yukari okina and kasen why is kasen on the same level on the other two enough to be considered equals in being sages    this is obvious on how yukari actually acts respectful around her whenever they meet up  i know what the 3s jobs are with yukari keeps control of the border and keeps the outside from walking in and wrecking it okina is probably why youkai can thrive in gensokyo with keeping vitality up for the mythical creatures and kasen seems to be in charge of keeping things at the status quo but why is she qualified to sit at the same table as them
  i assume kasen has some hidden ability likely related to her secret status as an oni in ulil shes able to open portals through the hakurei barrier and she even says she doesnt want to reveal her full power because it would be too risky were getting close to kasen officially being revealed as an oni in wahh so its only a matter of time before this secret ability is shown    glad you liked it
  anonsensei class is the best
guys what if its not really an anon writing all of these but keine communicating from gensokyo
    kasen is a human hermit not a oni
thank you based loreanon can you provide insight into nue and her delicious zettai ryouiki
  a major hurdle for any theoretical christians coming into gensokyo is the fact that things usually need to be completely forgotten in order to bridge the barrier so long as a christian remains faithful even a destitute homeless person that would otherwise be a prime target to send over as youkai chow and even thats suspect as apparently at one point they were strong enough to fight against vampires on an even footing crosses working or no theyll never be forgotten by their patron diety  what im more interested in is the implications of christianity standing vanguard in the outside world and the outside worlds eventual fate by the time of the cd albums what happened to the christians were they wiped out spirited away into their own bordered realms from a lack of faith did they leave somehow its not made clear if the faithless state of the outside world is specific to japan but given that japan had fallen in morals enough that it was now legal to euthanize senior citizens after a certain age one cant help but wonder how poorly the rest of earth fared
  its never been revealed how remilia and the sdm got into gensokyo so presumably there is some other way in besides crossing the barrier directly since they managed it and did so illicitly since it apparently touched off a war between them and the powers that bed at the time    always hoped that little bit of lore would eventually be explored since it would answer alot of questions
  probably patches magic or sakuya powers presumably both
  the problem is is zun even a good enough story teller to answer these questions without burning the entirety of touhou to the ground  i want to know the answers but what if we dont like them
  thats understood and probably the events themselves should be left alone for interpretation since it works so much better that way for touhou     however if you wanted to introduce a christian character from outside gensokyo its probably going to eventually be whoever or whatever caused remilia to flee to the literal ends of the earth and beyond  she was even interested in potentially moving to the moon theres something out there she is trying to escape from  probably wont be until the endgame when the barrier finally falls if zun ever chooses to go there before he dies from alcohol poisoning
  its never been revealed how remilia and the sdm got into gensokyo  because eosd was created way before this stuff was written into the overarching setting and had to be handwaved a teeny bit to fit in
        you guys are overthinking this way too much no it isnt something zun overlooked and no the sdm doesnt have special powers or magic that allow them to cross the barrier they got in because they were allowed in its that simple yukari made the boundary of fantasy and reality which is seperate from the hakurei border as a beacon in order to encourage the youkai of the world to enter gensokyo remember mamizou got into gensokyo too all youkai are allowed in theyre encouraged to come in theres probably an application process or introduction requirement but that hasnt been elaborated on in any case no where does it say they entered illegally
  not sure why you quote me  since im saying it isnt important and shouldnt be looked into too hard the later explanation of how they get in was justification/modification after the fact much like a lot of zuns writing at the time
yumeko is better than sakuya    swords are better than knives  she doesnt need za warudo to kick your ass  she has big tits so she can give you a paizuri  she serves a hot milf and not some loli brat

  did you not see honma mai
  did you and i listen to the same thing
dare
  azusa and chihhii
why do idols have sex all the time while i have none  this isnt fair
  yeah at least erii remembered the fucking words
  cos theyre generally good looking and cute
  jesus poor girl can even remember the lyric
  chihhiis beautiful chihhiis
  there was at least one other who forgot lyrics as well  i think it was near the end so it must have been an eito
  sato akari
  yuuri 3
yuuri wearing a thong
  shes trash anyway so who cares
  a thong that only goes up halfway so the top half of her ass is 100 bare
  if only that were true
  i really expected her to start crying
  kojima
you guys told me korean training was supposed to be good
  did you not see how impressed the judges were with sato minami
  sato minami was perfect
  i hope she takes 33 under her wing and shows her how to dress like her

yui should do yoga with her sister
  only if she kills okada before the finals
  implying theyll let someone who cant even attend the live final win
  i dont know how she wont be singing live
    where did you find the 4th anniversary concert
  okada did very well too   choosing only one winner is hard   why couldnt they make this a senbatsu
  because nobody cared last year
  yokota mayu is so fucking cute
  inoue is a naachan fanboy

reminder

  what was the special occasion
  thankfully her speaking voice is better than her singing voice
  why does my heart palpitate why i see ikuta
  she just said she is getting ready for a date at odaiba with her boyfriend
  thats normal when you see one of the most beautiful women on the planet
  she is a special girl
what are the rainbow stars for in sr
why didnt shige sing a russian war song
why did ueki have to have that ugly chin  she is such a good girl
nojima will win
  good girls dont smoke pot
  orin forgot part of the lyrics to secret base too
  shes already won my heart
  imagine smoking pot with ueki while someone invades her house to steal her sailor uniform
  webm of her singing please
  new gifts paid ones registered users get 10 for free
  i hope so
  how can you fucking forget secret base
  im assuming she was just nervous as shit  i dont see how anyone can forget the lyrics of such a popular song
  no wonder i moved to the front row
  except you cant pay for them
  you distract her with the pot ill grab my balaclava and get to work
should i give them to an audition girl
  cant wait for maachuns whorebook
  how do you plan dealing with her mad dog
  just buy gold from the pc i recall reading that the will add new purchase methods
did anyone sing a song from cardcaptor sakura maybe platinum
  only if you can slide into them dms
  oh ok that would explain it as i havent been on my pc in a couple weeks
akiyoshi sounds like that guy from the blue hearts truly the getto of hakata

  just watch the latest stuff and forget about the old things
  shukan akb  akb to xx  nemousu tv  ariyoshi akb  every episode and every season  it took me 2 years good luck
  gravures making off  those are the best it should be mandatory for every gravure session  
    why she is in first place
  ske ebi nmb geinin hkt hyakkaten is the standard stuff
  shes an arabhafu so she gets the muslim audience

  now this is really a natural beauty
  best boy and best nose
  my girlfriend haha implying hilarious anon
  mine is because miku is crazy about me
it has been 4 years
  not having all your idoru on plex
  unf
  bbut muh ratio
  bbut my hdd is 50gb and my internet 100kbps
  hahahaha   you called him out again  good job anonkun
  miku is not your girlfriend c  get a fucking grip
shibuya nagisa is literally my girlfriend
  dont underestimate mikus feelings for me that dumb girl really loves me believe it
1771 watching now  japan population 2018 127185332    jpop is life
    my new gf
  we dont deserve nattu
  acnemegu is cute
  hinatan one of the best singers in all 48g did not qualified on the singing contest    there goes my hopes that this time they didnt rigged it
yukikoi is a good song i guess
did this girl go to the singing competition
  what  this shit is janken tier rigged then for shame
  suppin uuka is super cute
the singing contest is not rigged naachan has real talent and all your loser girls cant sing
whats the singing contest and where can i watch
  live shows 
fuck  this toyonaga aki sings very well   im cheering for her no one has even come close to this yet
  mayuyu and ikuchan are great  shame about the lack of ftage tho
  this naachan is the perfect center and deserves to win this contest fuck off you losers
  why does she look like a crazy person
  stop projecting california
  i wouldnt say that everyone else cant sing hell id say naachan has got some serious competition at the finals she is still the best singer in the group by far for me and her performance in the preliminaries was amazing
churi will win
winner is determined who can make the judges cum fastest
  shame about the lack of ftage tho    here is the video audio is kinda bad you can always mix them anyway  
  is not bait naachan is the best of the world reeee
  naachan will only win because the best singer of 48g has left for izone sakura would win otherwise sakura is real talented in everything and most of all talented in being an idol she doesnt even have to resort to things like plastic surgery or permanent diets she is a natural beauty unlike anything ever seen before most of all sakura doesnt resemble michael jackson at all any resemblances are purely coincidental such as the whitened skin the sick look on her face the disfigured face and her weak body she might look disgusting but she is still a proper idol because she is a virgin sakura would never sleep with akip
  yappari it was bait afyer all
  i will pretend that i havent read any of this reeeee
this singing is awful  what does the winner get
  a song just like janken
  i miss cute mayuyu now
someone needs to teach her how to palm mute the low e string
  the real winner
  sakura the only real talent 48g has and ever had
  most girls have no technique at all   some of them cant even sing in tone
  we can be proud of sakura sakura can piggyback on anything even proud koreans
  fuckable fridge
  i look forward to her saying alhamdulillah when she is chosen
  hot
  from here     the composer of the song will be inoue yoshimasa who made uza kibouteki refrain and halloween night to name a few
shige wont age as well as her mother
  if she doesnt get any fatter she will age fine
  the winner will get nothing that sakura hasnt already gotten just because management likes her
  those are some of the best singles pretty based  finals airing on my birthday  guess i wont celebrate alone after all
  since yukos grad yes but it feels as if it was a decade ago
  management makes the members do all kinds of stupid contests like on showroom but actually sakura just gets these things and much better things since the day her career began sakura just gets everything while other members get treatment worse than foreign laborers at least foreign laborers have a guaranteed monthly income
  the winner will get solo single and sakura hasnt gotten one yet
  the winner doesnt get a solo single
  who made shit songs   meh
if youre not at least taller than bossu you dont have a chance at anything really
how shit can one taste in music get    this
i would really love a cooking tournament show there seems to be some competent cooks in the groups
  single handedly triggering wl mario aka and ithetinyc with just one post    dude

  moekas iron bra and mikus padding cant compete
  the can compete by actually stripping

  kimsama can fix that

  koala doesnt have it though its the same as the ao files where the 4th anniversary concert is not included
  missed it anyone has it clipped  dont want to download the whole thing just for erii
  the koreans have it cut up by member
  even though she has a delectable body i remember her saying she cant even cook rice
  remember when everyone used to call eitofags sea and are always telling them to go back to lounge i member
  thats why shes mistress material and not wife material
  she harvested and made rice for a bunch of fans yesterday
  well they are and they should
  neither does that other malware infested shit site
  
not so smug anymore arent you

  うおおああああああああああああああ  what did she mean by this
nagi sneezing  
  sneezed with her mouth  nice she knows the technique

  kurena does that all on her own
  ugly as a sin
  all the resources went to okama push it will work eventually i guess
  any imgur link
  thanks  holy shit that was bad  did she even take it seriously  the song was already too hard for but did she even practice  she couldnt hit a lot of notes and she constantly kept looking at the lyrics  maybe the whole p48 thing got to her head  good for her that she tried i guess
  this was relatively good for her
  based komibro
  do you see anyone else typing like you do on this website maki you gigantic faggot go back to your kpop groups
  i didnt mean to offend you just that i genuinely believe she could do better as she has shown in p48  this girl has potential and i want her to become better but this performance of her is very lacking and i think she couldve done better had she better prepared for it
  fuck off
  lmao that fag has a long way to go      nagi a qt      based
  ywn share karaage with your oshi
  no she does not you only discovered akb a few months ago and have been shitting up this general ever since with your tumblr posts

  please feel free to ignore the whinger and continue enjoying idols whichever way you please
  thanks wlerin
  you aint fooling no one at this point wlerin archive exists

  winter is approaching stay warm anons
  like nagi i can keep her safe and sound in my dungeon
  lovely
  hot
  next miru right here without the wincest tho so a bit of minus points
  janken still has its a purpose though its to give the girls a chance to show off their charm if they can fully utilize the very limited exposure time they have ie try not to make it boring also since competition for media exposure is high senbatsu etc these singing and janken tournaments provide a way to decrease professional tension within the group instead of clawing and backstabbing one another to survive in the entertainment industry
  love
the things i would do to miku
  hugging

i know some visual novels have android ports but are there any vns that are mobile native  what i mean is that they were developed for the mobile phone and use its unique features in creative ways like nintendo ds vns used the dss features for example the graphics in this kind of vn would be done for a vertical screen and you could have fake calls and text messages
  what i mean is that they were developed for the mobile phone   yes  and use its unique features in creative ways  no
  not surprising but still disappointing if true
    modern vns on android do what youre talking about where the plot is advanced in a group message between yourself and the other characters and subplots are advanced in direct sms with each character i cant remember the name but an example of this is a famous bl one where one of the characters is named nine are there examples of this from the older java powered ketai era i dont know and i dont think there are any that do voice calls with audio from the vas

sleepy owl
  im going to make the crown prince my faithful wife /jp/ wish me luck
nyamazon
how wondrous
  sorry to tell you but shes already married
  girl on girl marriage isnt legally valid
  in gensokyo i think reimu will approve it
more like taishit lmao
taishis grace is something you can always rely upon
  hi mamizou
why is miko so good it honestly feels kind of unfair to the other characters
  its her confidence and charisma that draws so many into her service but there are more than enough reasons to appreciate miko not that we dont need any more reasons theyre certainly welcome
is there anyone mikos charms cant win over
  not only is it impossible but there is no reason why it would be a bad thing to be charmed by her
love this girl
pray taoism
zun is able to predict memes  miko is the living proof 
  praise the taishi love her
  i want to pet her tufts
  taishi    taishi    taishi  i love you i love you i love you you
  reimu is a hardcore conservative dude
i wonder what must her voice sounds like
she has company
  she probably puts on a fake deep voice just to remind everyone that she used to be a prince
whats your favorite administrative music 
    my favorite vocal cover cute and rellaxing
  cute custom character
how can one being be so fucking adorable its illogical
  futo is cuter
  its unfortunate but true
  futo is a cute too
  cuto
i want to wake up with miko by my side
  her smile is one of the brightest around
miko is very very cute
i want to give miko lot of candy for halloween
  pot brownies counts as candies
  i want to drink her sweat
taishit more like it
  dont worry anon know that even now in this dark time of your life miko is willing to support you
  knowing that comforts me every day taishisama is beautiful and she has a kind heart
taishi and kokoro
  how royal is this royalty
  that would be nasty
  dont be fooled by her approachable and easygoing nature miko is as royal as they come
i like her cape
  cute
  taishi is not a dyke delete this
  its too late to complain taishi loves having a group of devoted carpet munchers all for her own pleasure
  why is she so mad did i do something wrong
  she can heard all of your impure desire it disgust her
miko paizuri
  shes merely disappointed that you like so many others are neglecting the practices which exist to orient yourself with nature
zun didnt forget to add traps  toyosatomimi no miko looks like a boy
taishisama is such a good and caring parent
  handsome
  3241  1 is too cutesy and moe
  fag detected
i want to shove my face in her floofy hair and suffocate in there
why cant she be real is this some kind of sadistic joke
  i wonder if miko and okina will ever even have the slightest interaction it would be a waste not to but at the same time that sounds exactly like the reason zun wouldnt do it
  i doubt it i expect miko to stop showing up in so many games she seems content to only meddle when everyone else is meddling since things will be fixed one way or another and leaves the usual matters to reimu and the gang unless okina needs mikos help with something the most likely chance is that they bump into each other in a manga
dadhu
  taishi has a nice harem
does the crown prince have good taste
  she should go for byakuren instead  theyd be a cute couple
  reverse traps are top tier
  she knows what she likes in women but i think she enjoys the variety just as much a romantic evening with the wife one day being attended to by your devoted servant the next
  toyosatomiminomikos size
  is truly a mystery
  despite the breasts this still looks like a charming young man to me
  cute sleepy taishi
her hairstyle reminds me of mike score for some reason
what would she think of me jerking off to her
the miko is now a miko
  ill become her faithful servant then
is taishi in favor of overindulgence when she says people should be allowed to chase their desires
  if your desire itself is to overindulge no amount of roundabout thinking will make it a good thing a wise man wants little
miko sure has a lot of followers
the height of grace and the deepest depths of beauty enrapture all that her gaze rests upon
  miko with her handsome looks and previous life as a prince is a skilled alpha lesbian who knows exactly how to get all the ladies no wonder she has such a big harem
taishi cant technology
some nice new images today
id love taishi
  of course shes a very lovable person
  she must be really cold
taishi and mokou should fight to determine who gensokyos true alpha lesbian is
  miko doesnt dress like a hobo so she wins
why is she so desireable
  no one answer can fully encapsulate it her ability to gather desire would naturally draw some to her but its only one part just like her royal demeanor and radiance
  but things are going to get hot pretty quickly if you know what i mean
this is a great picture of miko nothing unusual to see here
my desire is to have taishi as my wife
i want to be in a completely platonic bromance with miko  i want to get drunk with miko and then sneak into the myouren temple and trash the place  i want miko to hold my head as i vomit endlessly into a toilet
seeing the crown prince smile bring me great joy
miko fighting byakuren
  no matter how inebriated i dont think miko would trash myouren temple like that  its more of a futo thing
  i would like to get drunk with futo and burn the myouren temple
  learning pickup lines with miko
taishisama has good taste in fighting games
  it depends  which dark stalkers did she like more
why is the prince crying
  everybody hurts sometimes
what will miko do when she manages to become a celestial like she envisions will she spend afternoons in heaven and the rest of her time in gensokyo will she only visit heaven infrequently she may be a tad selfish but she wouldnt abandon her followers and the only one who has any chance of making it as a celestial is futo
making babies with the crown prince and her followers

so how are humanyoukai marriage viewed by both sides would the human village allow the couple to reside inside the village would reimu even allow such a relationship to happen or how would the sages react to such things whats your take on this /jp/
no the humans wouldnt let youkai openly live in the village
i havent seen any issue the humans had with keine or rinnosuke     since there are at least two halfbreeds i assume there isnt much of an issue
  werent people racist towards  rinnosuke and is the main reason why he set his shop outside of the village
  tengus and kappas are the only youkai with a society how would they react if one if their own chose to marry a human
  so how are humanyoukai marriage viewed by both sides  by humans as something degenerate and wrong by youkai as playing with your food    would the human village allow the couple to reside inside the village  no    would reimu even allow such a relationship to happen  i doubt she would give enough of a fuck one way or another    or how would the sages react to such things  probably not much unless this becomes common enough that half human/youkai children might disrupt the balance of gensokyo
  it would be viewed negatively but the actual consequences would not be substantial the human village would very likely kick you out and whatever societal group your wife came from would likely no longer accept her either  rinnosuke still has friends though so it wont be that bad reimu isnt going to stop you unless this some how is part of an incident but that probably wont happen same with the sages
  you do realize that the human villagers kick you out is basically the gensokyo equivalent of being thrown at the wolfs like once you cease being a villager you might as well kiss your ass goodbye as every youkai is going to be gunning for you looking for a neat snack     best case scenario you spend the rest of life being protected by your wife while living in a home in the wilderness and one mistake and youre dead
  i dont think the kappa would mind one if them marrying a human if there was another factor money business etc involved
  youd probably want to put a fuck ton of forethought into the matter anyway so youre not having to rely on your 2hu white knighting you all the time like having a safety net thatll quickly revive or reincarnate you as a nonhuman if shit goes south or blueballing yourself on the magician process until youre in the clear to apply all the spells thatll convert you fully but the latters debatable since even if you are a human who gave up their internal humanity to go live with what should be his predator it still might be a full offense to shed your outer humanity whichll lead to getting crimson slashed
  trying to get yourself reincarnated or revived when you die is not really a option it would be ridiculously hard even if it didnt carry the death penalty becoming a magician meanwhile is borderline impossible without a good teacher or a whole lot of stolen magical books all in all unless the youkai youre dating is a skilled magician you can probably just forget about the whole thing    i doubt living with a youkai would automatically put you on yukari and reimus depopulation list though not all youkai are predators after all while it might be weird if not downright inhuman behavior to hook up with somebody like rumia or mystia fucking a kitsune is about as human as it gets its kind of what they do after all
just go to eirin and get a pill that makes you smell and taste bad
  no that was because he is flaming homosexual
beautiful human girl from the village
  yes such a fine neck having girl like dont you just hate it when you date a girl only to discover she has no neck just the absolute worst
  human youkai marriage are not legal therefore are illegal the purpose of gensokyo is to keep youkai alive and pure
  yes that beautiful human girl has such a perfect neck that she will only reveal it to her husband on their wedding night she looks forward to becoming a bride human pride world wide
  this is a private matter the gensokyo government should not interfere in the affair of its citizens why shouldnt i get married to the woman of my dreams
  i mean how do human/youkai marriage happen
  the only example of a human/youkai hybrid who presumably is a result of a union of the two species rinnosuke is basically an outcast and his parents have never been mentioned    its probably not even simply a big no no its generally unthinkable i guess there are the konpaku but theyre from a technically different world and their nonhuman half isnt exactly youkai either
  keine wasnt born halfyoukai shes got therianthope disease or whatever
  i suppse it would also matter who/what youkai youve married im sure marrying any of the power players would cause a stir but marrying someone like kogasa or banki might just you being viewed as a pariah
  but then they wouldnt be willing to marry me
im pretty sure byakuren would be willing to host the marriage at the myouren temple
  so no change from your current state then
  rrude
  what if i wanted to marry some from the myouren temple
  i want to marry keine
  a lot of youkai are very sexual beings though it seems weird that they wouldnt be follow that nature and breed
  gensokyo goverment  see that was your first mistake      well you see when a boy and a youkai really love each other the youkai eats the boy and then calls it marriage
  i doubt marrying a power player would actually cause a stir you would just be viewed as a plaything she uses to amuse herself for a few decades     overall marrying somebody actually powerful is the better choice since at least they have a home for you to move into and a general guarantee that other youkai arent going to fuck with you
marriage  why marriage when mainly carnal desires and lot of dicking are essential here
  marrying sensei and having beautiful 1/4youkai children
  what if i wanted to marry someone from the moriya shrine do you think byakuren would like to act as a priest
  why the fuck would you want a buddhist priest when youre about to be married to a literal shinto goddess like i know the two religions are closely linked in japan but i still dont doubt the actual god youre about to marry probably wants to do it her way
what if i would fug 2hus so much i turn into youkai of fuging 2hus
  i doubt she would give enough of a fuck one way or another  isnt her job to maintain balance
  one guy sticking his dick in a youkai is going to fuck up the balance
  technically it would help balance it out if a full human is born the balance is shifted in favor of the humans if a full youkai is born the balance is shifted in favor of youkai  therefore marrying and having children with youkai is optimal solution
  racemixing with youkai  disgusting
  if a full human is born the balance is shifted in favor of the humans  thats not how that works youkai have this little advantage known as being really fucking old
  most youkai dont particularly care about the affairs of other youkai  they would probably view marriage to a human as a sort of game so they probably wouldnt go out of their way to harm the human out of fear of the youkai spouses wrath at her toy being destroyed  no you would not be allowed to reside in the village unless your bride is pic related or can keep her identity secret  reimu would be annoyed but if you give her a donation and dont cause an incident she will let it slide  the sages as sages would not care although yukari may decide to toy with you    kiene is a human 96 of the time  she also takes precautions so she wont harm humans during her transformation
  isnt pic related pretty much a ghost they also pretty much all work for yukari as spies so i doubt any one of them cares enough about humans to actually bother marrying them
  proximity breeds affection and what better way to spy on a particularly volatile human than from his bed
  he set up shop there because he wanted to have both human and youkai customers it failed spectacularly of course but the books never mention anything about how exactly was his relationship with the humans in the village before he opened kourindou
  so how are humanyoukai marriage viewed by both sides  humans would consider the human involved to be a race traitor or something and exile them obviously an attitude fostered by the higherups as it were as they dont want the humans thinking that hey maybe these youkai fellas arent so bad after all that would be very bad  youkai are trickier but i do agree with the others anons here that at least some of them might see it as one of their own just playing a game or be quite confused by the idea but just shrug it off because it doesnt affect them  would the human village allow the couple to reside inside the village  i supposed its possible but i think its far far more likely that theyll get kicked out  would reimu even allow such a relationship to happen or how would the sages react to such things  unless they raised a massive stink that threatened the balance i doubt either reimu or the sages would give two fucks about a human and a youkai boning    like kourin exists that alone proves that interspecies fucking and halfbreeds arent a big deal by themselves
  i doubt a particularly volatile human would trust any youkai even the harmless ones enough to marry them and if they are sociopathic enough to marry somebody thats almost certainly going to end up on yukaris depopulation list they probably wouldnt make the most convincing wifes
i would like to marry reimu
  i cant blame you being the hakurei shrine maidens husband is about the most privileged position a human can have in gensokyo outside of being the hakurei shrine maiden youre essentially untouchable youkai would be terrified of even getting near you     just a shame you would have to be reimus husband lie back and think of privilege i guess
do not marry the youkai     if you do their silly hat wearing rights will be revoked
  why not just put the hat back on after you take it off lol
  all things considered youkai arent much worse than modern women at this point personality wise if anything theyd be slightly better since they would at least know how to cook and clean unlike their competition  this is fucking depressing literal man eating monsters would be better mates than women
  just a shame you would have to be reimus husband  fuck you
  why are they called maidens if they are allowed to marry  why isnt it translated as shrine preiestess
  what makes you think that any given touhou project character other than the literal maid would cook and clean for you
  i said they had the ability  whom they use it for was not part of the statement at all
  presumably the one that is my wife in this scenario
  how would the sages react to such things  yukari and kasen have both shown disdain on both rinnosuke and keine so they would probably not like it at all
  i would still prefer a modern women over serial killers and sociopathic spies like the worst a modern women might do is divorce you and steal all of your money youkai can and will do considerably worse
  good question it was probably just a assumption on the part of early western translators since i am pretty sure shrine maidens are allowed to marry       she would be a terrible wife and you know it
  implying thought was involved
considering what has been said here sanae might be the best choice for a wife
how can normal humans tell the difference between human and youkai if the youkai can blend in among humans this also raises the question of how large the village is and how many humans are left in gensokyo
  how can normal humans tell the difference between human and youkai if the youkai can blend in among humans  they cant unless the youkai is very well known like ran yuuka and remilia     this also raises the question of how large the village is and how many humans are left in gensokyo  going by the manga pretty freaking big at the very least big enough that no single person in the village knows everybody else
  shes alright especially if you are a outsider as well she is probably the best choice her family might be a problem though
  think of it like making a sales pitch to kanako the wedding market is quite lucrative and this is something the moriya shrine hasnt capitalized on    what better way is there to enter the wedding market than host your own      to my mind the following benefits are  sanae wont be as lonely as shell be able to connect with her outsider husband  moriya shrine gains a loyal follower  new business opportunities weddings  with a human around the shrine can be perceived as more human friendly / safe
  but marriages are scam why do you want be scammed
  women can do much much worse lad like taking your kids and filing false domestic abuse reports to nuke your reputation and prevent you from ever seeing your kids as long as you live  my uncle had a bad time
  having to rely on your 2hu white knighting you all the time  but thats great imagine being cornered by a bunch of evil youkai in the forest and just when theyre about to eat you yuugi shows up kicks their asses and princesscarries you home
  my uncle had a bad time  uncle which anon  so that happen with him
  kanako isnt the problem shes pragamatic enough to accept you if you show how it would benefit her its suwako that worries me    considering her nature she would send you on a ridiculously dangerous quest to steal yukaris pillow before shell ever allow you to put your dick in her descendant
  women can do much much worse  i dont know how thats worse than  eaten alive or unpersoned by the youkai secret police
  its kind of romantic the first few times but it gets very tiresome after a while and all it takes is one mistake and you can say both your marriage and your life goodbye
  a youkai can kill and eat you a modern woman can kill you blame it on pms and get away with just a slap on the wrist
  a youkai is a lot more likely to kill you than a human woman and being eaten alive is considerably more painful than being killed in your sleep
    they arent animals  they do have human level intelligence and the capacity for reason  case and point the numerous youkai that are friendly to humans and the few hybrids that exist  and yukaris actions have no bearing on the actions of other individuals
  humans are animals
  youkai arent animals theyre even worse they have the capacity to do good yet still choose to murder and devour humans pretty much just for fun to think such a immoral cruel creature would be preferable to a modern liberated woman is nonsense
  i think part of that would be up for sanae to sell you as well
  humans arent animals theyre even worse they have the capacity to do good yet still choose to murder and devour cows pretty much just for fun to think such a immoral cruel creature would be preferable to a modern liberated bull is nonsense
  modern liberated woman  its easier to reason with a hungry youkai than with one of those
  hu u quot
  if a youkai gets pregnant will their kid inherit their hat
  yes but if they get impregnated by a human the kid will be born with a nonsilly hat  thats why youkai should say no to race mixing
if i marry the tsukumogami will our kid also be a tsukumogami will they be considered as a half youkai even if they dont have any youkai traits
  1 99 of humans think its wrong to fuck a cow/bull 2 we dont eat cows just for fun its often a necessity 3 you cant really compare a cow with a human the existence of one has a lot more value than the other 4 youkai eat cows as well      not really just dont treat them like property and usually everything works out fine
  like kourin exists that alone proves that interspecies fucking and halfbreeds arent a big deal by themselves  but he was discriminated and ultimately driven out
    idk man keines lunchbox hat is pretty silly
    ichirin became a youkai just by being bffs with unzan for a long time youkaism is contagious    13 arent true
  reading comprehension  to reimu and the sages interspecies fucking and halfbreeds arent a big deal by themselves to reimu and the sages
  bitch your face is pretty silly
would a youkai human crave eating itself
  this thread did well
  ichirin became a youkai just by being bffs with unzan for a long time  true but that was mostly because humans started to hate and fear her if you can avoid that you should be able to prevent yourself from turning into a youkai    13 arent true  bestiality is nigh universally viewed as a crime in every culture and you cant compare something as simple as a cow to the complex nature of a human one is simply a lot more unique and special than the other
who gives divorces in gensyoko
    nazrin
  according to modern cannibals human allegedly tastes good not excellent however terrible meat cuts and a taste comparable to monkey our diets are terrible for producing meat that tastes good    the half youkai would likely be aware of its own taste but not pursue it as other meat tastes better and would be much easier to come by
  you cant compare something as simple as a human to a youkai one is simply a lot more unique and special than the other
  both are about equal when it comes to uniqueness and even then thats a more recent development and regardless both human and youkai lives have value and should be treated accordingly
  youkai lives have value   no they dont
i want to marry flan
  look im about as far as you can get from a youkai apologist somebody like rumia mystia yukari and yuuka should be put down for the good of the world and even i think youkai lives have some value if a youkai chooses to overcome their nature and be a boon to society then they should be treated accordingly
  no that was because he is a flaming homosexual    weird there are a lot of hot bitches and how come he is a faggot
sorry to say but dont any youkai would want to marry any of you neets
  dont think
  rumia is a useless lazy neet too and would get along with someone who would let her nibble on them sometimes
  what if i told ran she could eat me afterward
  that is some mighty fine projection
  i wouldnt be so sure of that even youkai are very interested in knowledge from the outside world you might actually have more of a shot with youkai than most human villagers even if they are also far more likely to eat you
  ran isnt really the people eating type of youkai im pretty sure thats not really a thing kitsune do in general
    well they say love is blind
  shes vegan
  sanae ruins marriages if thats what you mean
  im sure patchy would be interested in knowledge you can find in the books from the outside world
  kitsunes are the one species specifically noted to take human husbands
  i think other youkai do it as well but it does seem to be a speciality of kitsune ran is a somewhat special case but i think you might actually have a decent chance of hooking up with a cute fox girl if you can convince her you would be more fun as a husband than as a meal
  as well as kosuzu
  but where would the couple go to give birth to their hybrid child
  if alice marisa and rinnosuke can find random spots to live by themselves no reason the couple couldnt do this either
  the baby has horns birth must have been painful
  could a youkai die during birth
  yes complications during birth are extremely deadly for creatures that give live birth
  maybe those are soft horns just like baby porcupines have soft quills
  amanojaku lay eggs
  youkai are nigh indestructible though if getting cut into several pieces wont kill them would complications during birth
  human/ amanojaku child how will his life turn out
  rinnosuke exists
  would reisen accept my marriage proposal
  because of the plot demanding it so
  thats shit writing
  whats eirin saying
  nothing
  would seija make a good mother
  maybe
  any woman could be if they actively desire to be a good one since theyd be willing to seek advice to get better at it  seija could just ask her mom for advice on the matter
  t themilo54
  whos seija mom
  t somebody from reddit i think or it could be ayrton again
  seija could just ask her mom  its too late for that
  why did she die
  im no doctor but i think those spears deep inside her back might be the reason
  there was a time when humans still knew how to hunt and exterminate youkai
  id put my spear deep inside seijas mom if you know what i mean
  explosives  high caliber guns  flamethrowers  anything mounted on a vehicle  im sure we could make a comeback
  those wont affect youkai
  we could always just capture them but them on a rocket and launch it to space preferably towards the sun
  what if they are magical high caliber guns
  yes they can  it is stated that fire is just as lethal to a youkai as blessed weapons  plus it is implied thst mundane weapons do damage youkai they just regenerate really quickly logically if you hit them with enough damage to outpace their regen they can be forced to retreat or be made vulnerable enough to bring a molotov over to finish it
which baphomet would adjust best to living in our world
  rumia no one would ever suspect an innocent cute little girl  banki as well since she already has experience infiltrating human settlements

this is a japanese language learning thread for those interested in traditional otaku media such as anime manga light novels elementals and japanese video games    if you have no interest in the above or want to request a translation this is not the thread for yousorry nyan    read the guide before asking questions     is the older guide but most anons think its better than the newer and improved one    previous thread 
manga is reading  watching subbed anime is useless  grinding words in anki is not acquiring japanese and is not even necessary but if you find it useful at least limit it to a fraction of your study time  dont bother tweaking the interval modifier or anything else  if the default settings arent good enough nothing will be    you can close the thread now
this is the older guide but most anons think its better than the newer and improved one  still trying to push this meme how asshurt can you be
  its true i dont know why ops bother with posting the new site at all
one of my classic creations
  should close the thread before reading your post to prevent harm desu
reminder to set your interval modifier to 150
このスレも頑張りますように
im adding audio to this dojg deck is that bad
if youre not watching anime with eng subs right now youre fuckin up mucho grande lol
  why must you always laugh at your own shitty posts
the same reason you must reply to them
  only if you dont share it and the audio is of decent quality
  im not sharing it since its probably bad
wow good thing the graded readers have audio because aparently i cant into context
you will someday dont worry and itll be real obvious when you do  
yeah when you just start reading you dont know how to read with a proper tempo or where words start or end sometimes so audio is cool in that case
  if you dont like people talking shit about your site you could always fix it
heres some compelling content everyone 
i just finished my 10th episode of animu in subs2srs bukakke immersion mode    klk ep14  lwa ep8  goblin slayer 14    lets have some cake for celebration   can you feel my powerlevel

ぼくはamerican pigです  ぼくはばかです
whats the point of srsing short anime lines when you can just watch the whole episode and you get all the context and nuance that way
whats the point
listening to dissidia ff story mode in nip while i drive has anyone seen better results in listening comprehension from doing this just listening without reading
yeah i listen to anime and drama ive seen all day when im not doing anything active in japanese for months and its what i contribute my listening skills to now
what does pic related kanji mean
  if its reasonably comprehensible of course it will improve your listening
  read more
  why
  review the guide resource list and look it up
  to optimize srs scheduling
  向かう
  thats robinhood over yonder standing at the top of a cave and looking into its mouth
  if you refuse to elaborate ill just assume youre trolling and move on
  do your best nihongo trick and showcase your epic knowledge snorts
  150 is better than 100 is this not obvious
give me one good reason why i shouldnt just take adderall when i study
because being straight edge and not polluting your human temple is the best
fair enough
  sure increasing it makes reviews more spread out to reduce reps but also lowers your retention rate which causes you to do more reps on missed cards theres a balance between these two things and 150 is it
  your brain rtk
  kanji dont mean anything  the word 向かう means something look that up
  this is why you do core2k
  did you just finish rick and morty
  kanji dont mean anything  wrong they were assigned to particular words for a reason
ok i just looked up 向 in my dictionary and it says the meaning of the kanji is むかう
  wrong that happened sometimes but not always
los bakas
  right so i was wrong but i can stand by this statement
  thats the spirit
the earlier you are in the process the more useful srs will be  in the beginning srs can help you quite a bit because it primes you to notice those words more in your immersion and remember what you learned  the more hours a day you can immerse the less useful srs will be if you only spend 2 hours a day on japanese then srs is very useful because you might not encounter particular words frequently enough within that time to reinforce them properly lets say you get 8 hours of immersion a day by that point you dont need srs because chances are youll encounter that word often enough to reinforce it naturally  its hard to come up with an optimal ratio of srs to immersion but never spend more than 1/3rd of your time on srs and never go over 1 and a half hours of srs      is he completely right on everything
nani the fuck how am i meant to get 8 hours of immersion a day
prolly not considering his japanese is only sort of maa maa lmao
priming lol he doesnt mention the part where you get to the point where you have 2000 cards that pile up from adding to the deck over time resulting in maybe hundreds of reviews a day where you just waste all that precious time reviewing stuff out of context all learning happens in context you dont need a primer you just need to read and listen more you will figure out what words you know and dont know if its in anki you dont need to know it if its not in anki you need to know it its that simple
the only thing u need to prime is deez nutz lol
imagine having so little life in you that you spend 8 hours per day on japanese to be able to read eroge
keep in mind matt has an ego problem and he is purposefully trying to invent stupid shit so he can take credit for it even if it makes no sense or is a shitty idea all the good stuff has already been said and done
  where you have 2000 cards that pile up  cuz he already solved this problem with his deathpoint anki addon hes thinking way ahead of you dude
  meditation     kek
  if its in anki you dont need to know it if its not in anki you need to know it its that simple
  heres a good deathpoint anki addon its called uninstallexe  having shorter lifespans for cards doesnt make it any less of a waste of time doing the actual srs review process it just keeps older cards out of the cycle the problem is putting shit you dont need in there in the first place
  it just keeps older cards out of the cycle  whichalleviates the thousands of piled up reviews problem you were just talking aboutyoure not trying to wiggle away from your point because it got btfo right
  ok tell me why you need to know how to answer an anki question how does this make you better at japanese  the only thing you need to do is understand japanese where its actually encountered irl like when talking to people or watching tv or reading a book  anki will let you memorize the answer to a question but thats not what a language is
you guys must be really bad at memorizing things if you think anki should ever reach 2k plus cards to review    at most you should have new cards  10  about 30 or so
   how does this make you better at japanese  when i read today i encountered a bunch of words that i knew because i learned them through anki mostly stuff id mined before as a result i could understand the sentences i was reading you realize the point is to see something in context and then use anki as a tool to memorize it right
  i think if youre absolutely going to do anki for a language then that deathpoint thing is better than nothing khatz tells you to just delete the card if it pisses you off or you feel like you know it im saying adding stuff in the first place is a mistake and its really just downhill from there
has that extension actually been made yet because id find it extremely useful right now id decrease the interval for my deck and set the deathpoint to 1 or 2 weeks
  if youre encountering a bunch of words in your reading thats in anki either your deck is gigantic and youre wasting time srsing instead of reading or youre a beginner and you would learn those words anyways due to their natural frequency of occurence in japanese
  anki helps you remember better no matter how frequently those words appear while reading   source firsthand experience
ok i guess youre right anki is epic and i yield my argument but i still dont see the point when you can just read or watch anime
  your argument boils down to wasting time yet you have no idea which way of studying is most efficient for anyone but yourself
i do 35 cards a day how long is to long in anki use to do 50 a day for 3 months and reviews were taking like 6 fucking hours a day or so
how many times did you guys have to lookup grammar points in dojg when you started reading before they stuck    inb4 intrinsically understand the meaning by repeatedly reading something you dont understand
  theres a point of diminishing returns which depends on how many words you have already accumulated and the ratio of the time you spend on anki vs actual japanese learning only you can gauge that unless you give more details but if it took you 6 hours a day for 50 cards does it take you 4 hours for 35 thats too much unless youre reading for 67
  no but hes getting warmer  except for everything he said about reading too early damaging your accent hes getting colder there
  only once on average for the meaning i dont bother committing rules like cant be used with x y or z or can/cannot be replaced by x to memory though
  i dont worry about that stuff either but i still look up the same grammar points repeatedly for months
guys have you ever considered youre just not giving me enough credit
  which book have you gotten up to if youre still on beginner/intermediate just read more if youre on advanced try to commit some sentences you find with the structure to memory its probably easier to retain the meaning that way
   intrinsically understand the meaning by repeatedly reading something you dont understand  i look shit up to try to figure out what im missing for sake of interest in the content but the things i look up are usually not the things i improve at  sometimes it gives you the one piece youre missing but most of the time you couldnt guess the meaning from context because youre not ready for what was said and looking up what one bit of the sentence means isnt going to stick no matter how many times you do it
  i was hardly reading if at all
   intrinsically understand the meaning by repeatedly reading something you dont understand  this is exactly what i did though
cant turn nothing into something
  context is something
better do those reviews for 6 hours instead of learning japanese
  babies start from nothing and eventually turn that into the ability to shitpost which is the highest form of human communication
  because you should shit works incredibly well for studying  memory focus and patience will be at your absolute peak  the one thing is that learning japanese is such a long term thing that taking a few pills is a just a drop in the bucket in scope  you really need a perscription or a steady supply to get the huge results  although its fun watching shows and keeping up with everything straight out of limitless  then they wear off and youre retarded again
then it wasnt nothing and it wasnt incomprehensible and there was something you understood about the thing you didnt understand
context kyuubei knockoff gives mc hero transformation powers but he turns into a girl    is 仕立てた自称正義 like made up sense of righteousness  but theyre also talking about clothingえ  probably a pun
  yea thats the point of immersion something is incomprehensible until it isnt
  exactly this  paul nation talks about picking up a piece of meaning every time a word is encountered in a comprehensible context  each piece may not feel like anything but it adds up
  its all modifying 宇宙人  俺を美少女戦士に仕立てた turned me into a 美少女 warrior  自称正義の宇宙人
一打席勝負  this is something about baseball but what does it mean exactly  is it like baseball but only with 2 players total the batter and the pitcher
lol
dont get me wrong everything in life can be rooted in baseball but lol
from kawajapa theres part of a sentence that pisses me off サクラに話した日本語ができる留学生は the first clause サクラに話した modifies 留学生 meaning the foreign exchange student who can speak japanese that i told sakura about but because it was immediately followed by a noun my first impression was that it modified 日本語 so i thought it meant the foreign exchange student who could use the same level of japanese that i used to talk to sakura    my question is this is this a natural ambiguity in japanese that is usually clarified by context/going with the more normal sounding sentence there are similar examples in english after all or is there some trick that i dont know about to figure out which way it would be i havent read very much but it seems like neither construct is particularly uncommon
reminder that you dont really want to learn to read just immerse yourself by watching unsubbed anime and that will be enough
  why ask here just ask dollysensei directly
  oh okay thanks a bunch
  the same level of  were you getting these words from  do we look at the same japanese text  are you a psychic
  djt has people who are so good at japanese that fluent speakers like  get made fun of     surely people on djt are much more qualified to answer these questions than dolly
  because a couple months ago when i was drunk and feeling a bit cheeky i asked her out but she just deleted my comment idk how often she deletes comments so she might still remember me and so messaging him directly would be unnecessarily awkward
  whats the difference
  her  him
  after all all the people on djt got good at japanese the best way which is just to immerse yourself  questions like that should be a piece of cake for people who know the language on contextual level
  lol
  shut your filthy lying mouth no one is more qualified to answer any question on any topic than dolly

i left /djt/ for 3 months and came back to check it out again glad to see youre all still squabbling instead of studying and the thread is full of dekinais as always    see you in another 3 fags i have gains to make
posts epic oc cringe of matthew until jamal gets tsundere hotcold about me posting what he loves but also stealing his shtick
  pretty much me i come by now just for the shitposting and the sometimes useful advice
    i mostly come here for grammar help with porn or degenerate shit so i dont expose my degeneracy to japanese friends/people on discord
this is my first time back on 4chan in about 3 weeks i decided i was wasting too much time here so now instead of having djt and various other threads open all day i have a light novel open instead     i didnt even get close to my 23 hour raw anime goal i only watched 46 hours this month but i read an entire light novel zero no tsukaima volume 2 im not sure if this should be considered a failure or not is reading an ln worth more than watching 18 hours of raw anime    havent decided if i will continue to znt 3 or try something else if i could read 1 ln and meet my raw anime goals this month id be pretty happy but it probably wont happen
  are you nukemarine that would make sense
  no i read znt1 a couple years ago and nuke doesnt watch anime
considering how many words are on a page in a book and how many pages are in a book you probably did read more than the amount of words spoken in 23 hours of anime
  oh either way reading is better than listening for practicing your comprehension
  you aint on the level to fuck with my anus boy      you aint very good at whatever youre doin if you gotta tell me about it

 here  i forgot that i wanted to recommend  one of the most annoying things for me when reading is words that can be read multiple ways with this site i can see what are the most common ways to read words in novels
   uses a larger/more modern sample old version of the djt library
  nuke said he watched znt to get visuals for when he read the ln he mentioned doing it again when he read 君の名は just text wise a light novel is like 24 anime but plot wise its about 4 to 6 anime
  oh yeah i didnt actually look at your picture but it already contains a good example of why that site sucks the common readings for 冠 are かん and かんむり かぶ is rare
    i imagine these are built from text with furigana  which means it is skewed towards readings that are most commonly accompanied by furigana and away from the readings natives actually remember
day 29
  thanks      oh i forgot he watched 君の名は and didnt know he watched znt     it does feel strange that ive read 2 volumes over 500 pages and i still havent covered the first season i havent seen the series in over a decade so im going to rewatch it once i read all the novels it covers        well that isnt good i was worried it was inaccurate because rare readings probably get furigana more often than common ones but it is the best resource i had and i will probably still use it alongside that text file you linked    i eventually decided on かんむり i tried looking it up in japanese but i couldnt find a good way to know which to use it was just referring to a crown that someone was wearing    i think i need to read some books where all kanji have furigana so i can learn the common readings better
can you stop
is it true you shouldnt bother looking up most words if you dont know most of them since the definition will go in one ear and out the other
  yup but with a large enough sample the most common reading still ranks first even though rare readings are inflated eg   今日        きょう866 こんにち139
  if you dont know most of the words and also dont look anything up what exactly do you plan on doing
  immersion lol
  matt said to only look up 1 word per minute or so and be comfortable with not knowing most of the words
  lazily guessing whats being said via the few words i do know and skipping over everything i cant figure out    t n3 esl slash a slash translator
just turned 23 lads my life sucks and i wish i could kill myself thanks for reading
  same here but 26
  is that in his new video i havent watched it yet i can understand something like that for watching anime or reading a physical book but when you have instant lookups with yomi/rikaichan why wouldnt you look up everything
  he says that having to look up every word becomes a chore and you wont retain what you look up
  and hes basing that on
こんな調子でしまくっていればwhat does conditional ば do at the end of sentences
  id estimate his iq to be 130 or higher when youre that smart you can just kind of intuit something like this even if you didnt directly experience it
  probably connect to whatever came before 
why mtt did ajatt makes sense when you think about him sitting there for hours on end hoping for a sentence where theres exactly one word he doesnt know so he can acutally understand what he read
  thats why you repeat back the completed sentence ya dingus
if matt so smart why mia so shit and still not finished due to him making so many mistakes
  what good will that do if youre reading thousands of new words a day
  imagine being this retarded
  dude its just random gobbly goop at that point
  yeah youre right it is you keep doing you
bros i just got back from japan    i lazily memorized hiragana before this but now i am motivated to read write and speak    i wonder if my parents will be angry because i am korean by birth
  ive been wondering if by this he means that you shouldnt even check readings of those words
  you can learn to read hangul in 15mins reading moonrunes is much harder
  yeah but honestly i think knowing korean makes listening by ear pretty intuitive    its just reading thats a different beast as koreans dont need to know hanja
  because i am korean by birth  thanks for ruining the illusion dude
forget that one lookup a page or one minute per lookup just drink from the firehose look up as much as you want and make sure youre understanding whats going on reread newly understood sentences then move on to the next one
as long as youre watchin eng subbed anime every fucken day idgaf what u do otherwise

本当に私のこと好きなの    i was told that this means is it really true that you like me however im not sure why the のこと is there what does it do and why do you need it there instead of just 私
they dont like you they just like your koto
  私のこと is literally my thing so basically hes asking if they like his penis
i mean u can say 本当に私が好きなの also if u want but hehe  
  neocities  isnt that shutting down
  i know this is memery but some poor chap might actually believe it so let set this straight こと usually refers to something more abstract nontangible in your penis case it would probably only be の with the rest being implied   私のこと is probably best understood if you translate it as my person as in about my person internally if you translate something on paper just use me
  alternative answer is you just gotta feel it  just know that 私のこと is something that as for あなた may or may not 好き  that is all that こと needs to be to you  the nuance will come gradually
  youre thinking of geocitiesjp
one might even consider neocities to be  a new geocities
a neogeocities if you will
fuck ur koto
あなたのことファックしたい
  cause when it wears of you will wonder why you even care about japanese also it rots your brain
it means do you like like me instead of do you like meas a friend
i dont like green eggs and ham sam i am
using the stem/infinitive form of a verb to make it into a noun slapping する on the end of it nominalizing it with の and then making the whole thing the object of the sentence and slap an honorific on it for good measure  why you gotta be like this japan
its not a big deal
honorific language is basically youre important so ill acknowledge it by expending a bit more air than usual
  id estimate his iq to be 130 or higher  hes pushing 105 tops he literally made a video over an hour on  what your retention rates should be lol  a variable that has endless factors  ie how long you study the card how hard the deck/card are inherenetly etc
まあたとえばあなたのことは好きなものってことはありますよ
he wants to have a high iq thats why he does all that retarded shit he thinks is imitating smart people lol
after a month or two of looking around at ajatt and other learning methods i have like matt decided i am enough of a big brain iq boy to create my own method    its called fuck you do the work there are no shortcuts youre just wasting time    patreon link in description below please gib mone
also known as read more
i have here the solution to literally any problem in your life
  this ive tried the anki grind and i didnt burn out but i still felt like shit that i couldnt read despite having 8k vocab more or less matured
is the cure dolly method japanese subs and anki good
  anki for word grind  internet/native japanese media for grammar  lots of reading for actually becoming fluent and learning the language properly
  is word grind even valuable
  i find it speeds up internalization of the word and reading in general a lot since i dont need to look at a dictionary anywhere near as much also i think it helps with grammar a lot since i already know most of the words and can concentrate more on learning how the grammar makes them relate to one another    mind you i do the autistic triple decking of having decks for reading and writing words in kanji as well
  anki is good to get words into your long term to the point youll seem them at that frequency in what youre immersing if you dont immerse that much youll need anki more if you immerse a lot you need it less    anki therefore works for those that dont have time to immerse to have a holding pattern however youre not going to get good on anki alone you have to read and listen to actual japanese for that to happen
all you need to do is immerse  30 comprehension is still effective  j/k you should be constantly pausing and looking up words every 3 minutes
  you retain that word you looked up retard and it onlygets easier with practice
  aight babe well see if you remember 芍薬 15 threads from now
  imagine shilling for  this hard
  i dont know who that is because i dont follow e celeb drama like you faggots
  then you completly missed the point of what you are replying to dumb fuck
  take the e celeb drama dick outta ya mouth boi
i failed n2 my dudes i thought i had it down
  yea i saw 3 minutes of a video and noted how dumb the logic was and whats funny is that youre either so stupid you agreed with him or youre so stupid you jump into things without understanding them
  feelsbadman
  you retain that word you looked up  not really  contextual associations are much stronger than translations and definitions    if i read something particularly memorable involving 芍薬 i might remember 芍薬 and otherwise i am not bothered by not remembering 芍薬  what point were you making
キノの旅はホントにキノだ  関係のイメジはこのｌｎの最高のお話と思う
  the point i was making is that just looking a word up isnt enough to remember a word for the long term im not sure what you thought i was implying because your response is to something i didnt say or imply      im glad someone in this thread is fucking reading something and kino of all things that chapter really was interesting huh definitely my favorite from the first book
what the fuck is up with the rtk deck on the site it just skipped from frame 457 to 460 for no apparent reason browsing back in the deck i see it skipped a bunch of cards it says theyre due 2049 and other high numbers why is that im shooting myself in the leg if i keep going with this
  just looking a word up isnt enough to remember a word for the long term  and by consequence what is  you need repeated exposure either way  your response is to something i didnt say  just throwing out that theres also too much obsession with remembering words since you gave a good example of a word that most of us would gain nothing from explicitly memorizing
  his bike talking to him was fucking me up but yea im enjoying it read the first 20 pages like 3 times now
how do i fix this this is going to fuck me over hard if i dont fix it soon
  instead of worrying about the order your cards are gonna come out in how about you worry about the order of words in this section from a light novel you could be reading right now    　夜中の三時    　仕事を終えた私はいつものように原稿をそろえていつものように封筒に入れていつものように机の右側一番下の引き出しにしまった担当編集者が取りに来るまでもうずっとこのままだ
  you shouldnt be worrying about that in the slightest  i believe in the rtk deck but you dont have to beat every facet of the joyo set into your head  when youre done youre going to forget a bunch over time if you dont see them and you dont want to do anki the rest of you life  so do the deck and if youre missing anything youll quickly run into through reading and content in general  dont sweat it
  also there are some rtk/joyo kanji that are hardly ever used  they may have pruned it out for you
  oh nvm just realized you were talking bout the order yea idk whats that about but if its under 2200 you should be ok
i got a pile of cards in the core  ones i mined myself i cannot go through them if i did that diligently itd take too much time  i was anking every day so its not a matter of consistency been adding 10 new cards a day    so whats the consensus on anki is it a waste of time or not i like the idea of getting the most frequent words that you are bound to  by definition  encounter a lot and bare minimum is adding words that you really feel like want to learn  i added a lot of shit that i felt it would be helpful etc but idk
dont deliberately memorize words slows you down just read and listen a lot words will eventually stick same as your first language
  knowing a few hundred useful words is good imo but after that you pick stuff up from reading if you think youre not likely to encounter the word again soon or if you already encountered it multiple times and cant remember the meaning and reading mine it    i find anki to be very useful for remembering words long term
  its very good for helping you remember shit but should never be your main/only source of study the time spent per word is so low that you really dont need to be picky about which words you add though i think making your own deck as you encounter words in context is far far better than just doing a premade deck
  knowing a few hundred useful words is good imo but after that you pick stuff up from reading  so anki is the best for total beginngers to build up the basic vocabulary   if you think youre not likely to encounter the word again soon  why learn it if its not likely to come up
  after those few hundred words you dont use anki to learn you use it to review so that you dont forget even rare words are useful you use anki because youre not likely to remember rare words without it
  わたしはfuckinゲイボイdesu
      you use anki because youre not likely to remember rare words without it  read more and you will remember rarer words until you stop wanting to read more
  is this the guy who said てまね instead of ために  i think he could use some anki drilling
  if you think drilling will fix that kind of mistake and input wont you need jesus also known as read more  dude hasnt used japanese seriously in longer than youve been alive and hes still better than you at it
  the mistake he made was in something so basic that it makes everything he says about retention completely invalid miss me with that brainlet shit
  interesting interpretation of cause and effect
  how would you say there are two types of x 
  when you dont ride a bicycle for years and try to ride it again do you accidentally sit with your back to the handles no youre a fucking retard and so is your idol
  xの二種類がある
  who said kaufmann is my idol hes just one of the dudes most in touch with the reality of language  he also says the same things in every video and shills his website because no ones perfect
  only a retard worshipper would defend someone making that retarded mistake and claim hes in touch with the reality of language  someone here is very out of touch and it aint me
  is this bait you havent denied hes better than you so i presume youre just wanking about the only mistake youve ever recognized
  to  infinitive form of a verb  please somewhere  put in the end of a sentence  why you gotta be like this english
  thats like saying you can only criticize a sports player once youre better than him  i can recognize that mistake and never ever make it because what the fuck while having less advanced knowledge of japanese than him its irrelevant  hes a fucking idiot and nobody should give him clicks
  is he a fucking idiot or is he a sports player  dudes out of your league but youre clinging to the only way you can feel superior
  the only person i feel superior to here is you
  whats your read
  you worship some lame eceleb who cant pronounce the most basic shit
  
  hes not my idol i just take whatever he says by face value because he agrees with me
おはようおにいちゃん    さてこれはなんでしょうか
  i just take whatever he says by face value  you seem confused  i already know what i think  i know kaufmann is in touch because what he says usually agrees with what i think
damn did he realize i was playing
no i just took a nap
you know people wouldnt be so hostile to you if you people actually supported your arguments with something else but kaufmann said so
  polyphasic    usually do when confronted with something intelligent but if you dont try why would i
  yeah just dismiss people who disagree with you as not intelligent thatll keep the conversation productive
  what did you think you were doing that was different here 
what is the actual argument here
  thats not me
  my bad  answer is krashen said so
if there is one thing i got about japanese its that the whole language is literally    kanji chinese characters for chinese words but we say them differently because fuck it  hiragana actual japanese characters are just adapted chinese characters for grammar verb tenses feelings in sentence ending and sounds since the kanji doesnt tell you shit about the way you are supposed to spell a word they also are used to tell you which sounds you are supposed to make  hiragana again but called katakana and with different symbols  that look like they were drawn by some toddler  are used for everything else mostly foreign words because its not like we can use our precious hiragana to type baka gajin words  why the fuck this even still exists in 2018
  why are imperial units still a thing in some shitholes
おにちゃん    たいへん    おおあめ    ８０ミリだって
  for chinese words  also 国語  but we say them differently  surprising no one  actual japanese characters  国字  verb tenses  minna genki  hiragana again but called katakana  it would suck if a language had completely redundant writing systems that people switched between stylistically
  honorable mention to    spaces wtf is that shit what do you mean its used to make sure you can understand where the last word is ending surely this baka gajin isnt telling me i dont have to learn 2000 kanji  hiragana  katakana if only i could move the pen slightly away from the last character right
if english used a syllabary rather than an alphabet spaces would look ridiculous  just a thought it has nothing to do with spaces in nihongo
  minna genki  wut both have a kanji and they arent verbs  皆 元気  inb4 theres the verb to be  no there isnt in japanese you can say that without verbs and it makes sense because its not english    completely redundant  katakana  lel have fun not understanding sentences that have foreign vocabulary or names and they are very commonly used pc immediately comes to mind   パソコン    whether something is nationally used or not doesnt change the fact they are indeed chinese      and thank fuck it doesnt why using it in 2018 even
  皆 元気  tenses is a shitty textbook view of grammar  a couple things can be called tenses and a lot of other things cant  it makes sense because its not english  everyone good  lel  by redundant i meant something else could be used not that it isnt used  such as the redundant english alphabet that im not using and you are but we both know because its still used  doesnt change the fact they are indeed chinese  are 国字 chinese  thank fuck it doesnt  how do you feel about glorious hangwel
  tenses is a shitty textbook view of grammar  a couple things can be called tenses and a lot of other things cant  i specifically said verb    everyone good  minna genki can be translated as everyone is fine/healthy without needing an equivalent for to be    such as the redundant english alphabet  are you talking about uppercase letters i give you that point but gotta admit a good amount of lowercase letters are just the uppercase one but smaller
  i specifically said verb  yeah youre getting distracted by minna genki it wasnt an example it was just lol textbooks sorry for not clearing that up  minna genki can be translated as  i didnt translate it i provided a sentence with similar structure that makes sense and is english  a good amount of lowercase letters are just the uppercase one but smaller  a good amount of katakana are derived from the same kanji as their corresponding hiragana  still more to learn overall though but i think it doesnt really matter
ive learned how to read and write hiragana and katakana and have begun learning some kanji im on the second row at the moment i like this guide because it shows you stroke order and some examples it only teaches you 120 kanji however where should i continue after im done with these hopefully keeping the continuity of more common to less common / lower education level to higher education level
  where should i continue after im done with these  honestly no better way than just reading something written in japanese  manga games vns are a valid answer
  where should i continue after im done with these  by focusing on words rather than kanji unless after this point kanji is still a major point of struggle  memorizing thousands of kanji when you dont know japanese is of questionable value  even better dont focus on words either just read and listen more  youll be amazed how much you improve at reading by just reading without any extra effort into memorizing symbols
  just start going through the 2k/6k deck on anki it gives you vocab thats written with these kanji supplement with it by reading something easy preferrably with furigana so you dont have too look up everything
  do kanji still look like random scribble to you  do you see the difference between 穏やかな and 緩やかな  if so just start reading if not start reading anyway and do some sort of kanji study
  not that anon but i had to zoom my screen several times  how fucked am i 
  if you have no familiarity with kanji you dont know what to look for  the question is if you will build familiarity with kanji naturally or you might benefit from spending some time staring at them and learning strokes  just go forward and see if the problem gets better or not
  did you encounter them already outside of the post if not you are not fucked at all just keep reading   but if you already encountered them and still are unable to tell them apart you should consider not sitting down for every kanji looking similar but instead spending that time going through a radical deck or through the first 500 or so  of rtk/kklc/kanjidamage/whatever there is no reason to do either to completion but you really need to stop seeing kanji as random scribbles otherwise you will have a very hard time telling similar looking ones apart and at that point brute forcing them in anki is less than optimal
  i dont know if this collection of kanji is that useful unless you know the vocab for them already  these are just very basic concepts like numbers elements units of time bodyparts basic adjectives simple concepts things that elementary children understand  its much more useful to learn these in context of a word or a sentence  you will need to learn all the different ways of using these not the singular meaning behind each one  japanese isnt a very logical language just by knowing that 大 is big doesnt prepare you for stuff like 大丈夫 which is daijoubu or ok
  とにかくキノの旅は１ページを読むたびにだんだん良くなりますじゃぁ人の痛みが分かる国多数決の国はいいお話ですけどコロシアムから終わりはすげえキャラ展開があって猛烈なアクションシーンが多くりますまた作家の大好き言葉は慣れる時後で　いつでもみんなのキャラはつぶやくｗ読みやすいと言うか読みやめられない本ですね
          i meant writing practice i already know all of these and a bunch of other words from anki vocab mining
  がああ違う多くなりますとタイポしてしまった
  oh ok check this out and look up the stroke order on jisho  
verbs have tenses  kaufmann fucked up tameni because his little old senile old man brain was in korean mode and he said something in korean instead it was cute  read and listen more and stop treating anki like a minor deity
  steve has repeatedly stated that if he had many hours a day to learn a language itd be faster if he studied the way he studied chinese which involved flashcards with words stop quoting him out of context
  thanks man ill definitely use this
  steve doesnt use flashcards for memorization
  actually he kinda does because he uses an srs features in lingq but learn to read your retarded esl because thats not even what i said i said that given as many hours a day to learn languages as he did with chinese he said hed memorize vocab using flashcards as an old man with a business he only spends about 1 or 2 hours on a language at most
the efficiency paradox as long as something is good enough then the less efficient it is and long it takes to use it the more and better they will remember it and the longer they will talk about and recommend it
  im a native speaker of english i just know more about steve than you which you would have considered if you werent pretentious and thought about the meaning of my post for more than five seconds  he doesnt even grade himself on his cards he just looks at them and answers whatever  he puts everything on the same side lol
  i just know more about steve than you  apparently not because he said hed attempt to deliberately memorize vocab if he had as much time as he did when he learned chinese
  citation needed    there isnt one he was talking about flashcards
  there isnt one he was talking about flashcards  he already uses flashcards in the way you described all info on front so he must be talking about the kinds of flashcards he used when he learned chinese esl
  is that the only word you know again im a native speaker of english i already said so  youre not very good at using your brain man  he almost never actually uses flashcards he was saying that he would use them systematically like he did for chinese instead of haphazardly  he also didnt say it would be a good idea just that he would do it and implied hed see results  seeing results doesnt make something a good idea
  this is why most recommend reading as soon as its possible to do so without spending hours and hours fucking about with a dictionary    honestly the more pages you read in the day the easier it gets every single day if you buy physical lns and stumble into unknown words i recommend just writing a quick jpjp definition on the page so when you see it again and forget it you can quickly refer to it or draw a pic idc anything that helps keep you from breaking your immersion later on    most ln pages have around 300500 characters depending on words/density/spacing the faster you can get your reading down to around a page per minute while getting everything the closer you are to god mode it really is about quantity here because the faster you can read the more often you will see unknown stuff and get used to it its a natural srs but not if you have to refer to the dictionary every 10 seconds    you cant fully appreciate this until you finally do reach the point where youve just cleared like 30 pages in a row without consulting the dictionary a single time    antimoon recommended like 60 pages a week for reading but that seems like the bare minimum that should be the goal every day imo if not more but with japanese its an arduous road to reach that point
  i recommend just writing a quick jpjp definition on the page  what the fuck is wrong with you  just leave the fucking tab up online or something dont write definitions on your books holy shit
  if youre going to physical everything then get a notebook like a good kid
  leave the fucking tab up online  forever  dudes talking about for days or months later  of course hes wrong you only need the reading not a definition
  jamal i know what youre saying but when you didnt learn your basic 1250 vocab from english subtitled anime which functions as definitions btw then you gotta look up some definitions at the start or nothings gonna make sense or youre gonna have to eat like 100 epic volumes of manga to make it work ftw
that wasnt me dude i just fuckin got here
oh sup jamal pretend they were roleplaying as you
  bone a petite
lol writing in the margins of your books ftw definitely do this    also i guess as long as youre watchin anime all that other stuff is good  
  he almost never actually uses flashcards he was saying that he would use them systematically like he did for chinese instead of haphazardly  so then you actually agree with me and people do quote steve out of context its really hard to believe that youre not esl but you insist that you arent so ill have to take your word for it  seeing results doesnt make something a good idea  thankfully no one cares what you consider good
  lol writing in the margins of your books ftw definitely do this  jamal confirmed for false idol    that wasnt be dumbass get some basic social awareness and stop assuming things about people
fuck 4channel bring back 4chan and my dudes fuckin arms
  as long as youre watchin anime  and they said anime isnt reading
mmmm yes just go watch unsubbed anime and read through manga 1 word per 5minutes until you understand it
  he has more character when you have to fill in the arms with your minds eye
  no you definitely want eng subbed anime until youve done it for 10000 hours then you dont need the subs anymore
  one word should not take you 5 minutes that sounds like youre looking up definitions  you just read it which will indeed be slow starting out  and watch that unsubbed anime  but as they say in japanese  ganbaro ne
  no read your manga 10 words per minute until you understand it  if you can do this you will gradually start to understand it and gradually start to learn japanese  im not shitposting its what i did it works pure input works
  i dont mean do it as a real tactic to learn anything just draw wieners and stuff
  he doesnt annotate his books    did you even finish high school my dude making notes in your books is an effective strat for reading on any level whether youre making notes about the deeper meaning of shit or even if youre just writing out a definition so you dont have to guess at it later on this can also help highlight your progress when you read the same book again later on as you will be able to see where you were/what you were thinking/what you didnt know before    if youre too cool to take the pen to the page use sticky notes or something but dont pretend that proven working learning strats dont work
  also i didnt look anything up just looked across it and sounded it out furigana for epic win ftw
  this guy gets it    show and tell day post your margins
  wait why did you  me please hang up and try your post again lol
i just had a ftw idea that might help at least one djt victim finally make it  strip the definitions out of a converted dictionary file for your favorite mouseover dictionary so its just readings  how can you fuck up when your mother was thoughtful enough to give you child safe scissors
by jamming them straight down my dick hole and then swiftly spreading the scissors to cut my dick wide open from the inside
not everyone has the patience or intelligence to just read and listen so djt should include a guide for people who arent smart
i said fuck up  if thats what you want for yourself youre not really fucking up are you
  ok  1 do useless bullshit for two years it doesnt matter what  2 if youre still trying to learn japanese then start reading and listening
guide for anons who cant read or listen  you cant make it
  oh but you can
  its in the filename my man
  thats not a problem depending on who u ask  
  who knew that this whole time the meme was a strategy to help the people who arent smart learn nihongo
  if you lack the patience to read and listen you also lack the patience to learn japanese    theres no shame in selecting an easier language like french anon french media is generally highquality anyway
but is there a girl on yt wearing a full graphic sailor moon shirt that can teach me how to understand the french op for sailor moon    
  id rather understand the german op for nartuo

i came across this 一句 while reading 戦国妖狐    五月雨は  嬉し涙や   不如帰  我は至れり  雲の上まで    i was wondering what kind of grammar is used for 至れり as well as its specific meaning any help would be much appreciated thanks
you could just learn about that 四段 shit and 已然形 shit but why not just do pic related
  some people need to analyze grammar to be able to feel  its a serious problem
  多分読んだり感じたりすると理解します  文法は自然に学んだホウがいいと
ill give you a real tip that none of these yt fakes are capable of giving you    至れり the verb itself is doing what you prolly think it does then take the り put it in romanji ri and flip the letters to ir and then say ir in japanese out loud and then feel the blinding flash of satori as you never get lost on this type of thing ever again cuz now you know what it signifies    prolly still too cryptic but ill pass the mostly done rubix cube to my lil homies to finish it

  that cape was all that was needed to be epic why did koba have them dress up like wicked clowns instead
reminder that megu fucking stupidly perfect
  the only explanation is that he wants to kill babymetal
  nah man hes living the dream  his band and by proxy him has shared the staged and rubbed elbows with some of the biggest dad rock bands and grandpa rock bands alive today  he likely felt dirty when they opened for lady gaga and maybe skrillex too cause thats as close to idol as they got since sg graduation
  i mean it legit looks like some christmas shit that they spraypainted black
  babymetal wont die until koba fulfills his dream of babymetal  x japan collab and photo and gets to meet iron maiden and have his band photographed with them
  his dream of babymetal  x japan    at this point i dont even know that he even cares about japanese metal bands  since day one of them getting big hes been all about western shit    and gets to meet iron maiden and have his band photographed with them    arent they playing with them in australia or whatever  or is that another grandpa roock band im thinking of      su is a pretty girl she dont need this cirque du soleil bullshit
  
  one really cute girl
  i like this pic
      well the girls are nice at least shame about literally everything else
  
  can cover them all they want but moa and su are still moa and su and their performance at least musically has not suffered
  and their performance at least musically has not suffered    im the anon who was hating on metal resistance since day one so even i cant find the silver lining through their music
  are you trying to get me to rotate your pics

  happy birthday 8
  she asking for a diploma
  my angel why did you leave me
  reminder momoko is incredible  reminder ayami is back  reminder theres no reason to believe momoko wont come back
  such a fine body perfect and smooth thighs  hana is pretty close to a goddess
  jesus fucking christ
  hana and megu are as we know butt sisters and here we see hana jiggling much alike megus
  really the best gaku body by far  i dont think we will ever get something like that again
      taking everything into consideration hana is the hottest and most attractive gaku
  was that what she was wearing on stage today hope some chad recorded audio/video
  yup
holy shit that is a full ass long set i thought shed only do like 5 songs and keep it small scale and not a full show like she did
  i love you ayami
  i bet she still reeks of kiwi cum
  and videos do her no justice torahime live is something to be witnessed nearly all the women in that production have flawless bodies and yet  hana stands out
  why so mad you legit had the chance to fly to nz and date her pretending to be just a random guy the easiest it will ever be to date a gaku there probably even was an english speaking fukei doing exactly that while you sat at home crying into your cumstained pillow listening to aym
  isnt momoko studying in some english speaking country now time to go over there and fuck her then shes probably easy game too she has the laugh of a slut
  also nz
  so the same guy who fucked ayami is going to fuck momoko lucky
  guy  only one
  statistically speaking it seems rather unlikely one foreign fukei would allow another foreign fukei to fuck these ladies
  has the laugh of a slut  brilliant analysis
lol the bitta possessive incel homos on here with their creep theories xd
  we could have had a nice ayami picture thread going but they rather bicker about semen form nz lol
  dats the face she gon make when 20 kiwi fuccbois bukkake her
  i wanna fuck her tits so bad
  dayyyyyum  kawaiiko rockin dem side boobers
  she doesnt look like a 16 year old girl at all but then again 24 years from now aiko at 40 shell look pretty much the same
  who the fuck allowed you to talk nigger
  2 big reasons to support aiko
  i dont care about it she is so beautiful that i would let her cuck me with any nz er
  u mad bro
  u mad bro  hurr durr u mad bro i only post lame reddit memes because i lack creativity
  the only goblina i want to fuck
  
  aiko deserves love and support
  i want to support her chest with my dick
guys after lots of investigation talking to japanese fans who know them very closely i finally found out why yui left the last time they were on tour in the usa yui was raped by a fan in the bathroom of the plane apparently that guy stalked them and managed to get on the same flight in order for yui to not lose face everything was kept quiet but she was never the same she has lots of therapy sessions to help her cope but it doesnt look like shell recover the agreement with her family was reached that the contract with amuse will terminate end of this year and the mizuno family will receive a giant payout for the trouble amuse cost them we can be lucky if she doesnt kill herself all because of that fucking white devil rapist
  aikos only redeeming qualitiddies
  yawn lame pasta this shit got boring so fast
  sounds plausible  lets kill this fag doesnt matter if he did it or not such a miserable life needs to end asap anyway
  still better than the aiko cave exploring meme that those two goblina fags claims to be god tier comedy gold lul xd trololol2
  get a load of this faggot
  rude
  well you know what he did and he wasnt even ashamed of it quite the opposite he bragged about it theres something wrong with his brain i bet he wants it too
  i bet he wants it too  as if you wouldnt want to have sex with yui
  faggots pushing anons to be more creative with their jokkes xd  best example of what they consider creative is calling aikos nonexistent hank hill ass a cave  xd top laugh anon  very clever
  i thought you were talking about how its okay for yui to just die  my bad sorrymachine anon for my illiterate ass
  i didnt like the cave arc either youre not alone but i enjoy the idea of anons being enthusiastic about things
    cant we all just be friends
  only if you suck my dick  with care and love 
  who the fuck takes their coat off when they enter a store

yui hated bm  koba had her chained up  yui killed self  sana is yuis pale ghost  sana/yui joins sg  yui happy
  toasting in an epic bread
  sana is nowhere near as cute as yui was
  death can be rough
  youre right shes cuter
is sana exotic to the jap fukeis
  kitsune up xd
sana is too white the japanese summer will kill her sooner or later
  what an unfathomably stupid thing to say
  you want to see sana suffer and be miserable
  shes already exotic to us sea
  id hold her tits ii mean her coat for her
  sana/yui is happy now that she is back in sg  she already found a friend to replace moa but this friend will not molest her
  just chink her eyes up and shell be on par with sg yui
  woah
    we can tell sana is cuter merely by looking at that last pic of yui
  we  just you my friend
  you dont even know what yui looks like now m8
  this person   isnt me
  
  youre right    sana is nowhere near as cute as yui was  was
raurasempai pls step on my face and verbally abuse me
ayama yama muto has returned and she looks pretty cute apparently she does does naturally have a bit of a chubby face even when shes skinny so i guess its her curse to never eat more and enjoy life without looking extremely bloated   also memes aside she was most likely only hanging out with other japanese in nz i wonder what her views on gaijin are like now i bet if you analyzed the lyrics in her new songs you could come up with something
  raura is love minus the japanese mom haircut but why are they all holding up packs of cookies like a bunch of autistic weebs posing with their pockys
  unfortunately most girls arent into femdom even girls who seem like doms if anything those girls especially prefer to be verbally abused and dommed themselves    t virgin hugless kissless never made eye contact with a girl
  theyre shilling hana does it too all the time
  i dont understand the hate for that haircut i think it looks cute and fits her
  torahime use hana to shill aggressively they arent fools
  because in rauras case she is pure sex when not hiding behind a bowl cut see spica no yuro era etc i just think wota/weebs dont get hard unless they see that hime/bowl cut for some sick reason and she wants to get in on that demographic
  but she still looks super hot though
  its just an extremely smug hair style
  those pictures those kill the raura hair style debate dead forehead raura all the way or obvious homo
  sara had the best short hair yuzu comes close at second place id even say that the short hair contributed a lot for her that she went from goblina to pure sex  aiko and shirai had the worst
japanese mom hairstyle is a boner killer for me but im glad at least some of you guys like that
  me too fuck the incel wota/weebs pushing that haircut on every idol highfive other foreheadbro
  it just looks like an old lady to me to be honest
  put megu on the worst list too just look at how pretty she is with her hair back same with raura
  when did megu have short hair
  megan doesnt have mom hair
  the alignment of her eyes makes her look retarded
  not short but had the hime bowl cut for a short while kinda same effect better with forehead
  what did she even study at nz
  define study
  raura loves it though
  handson learning of new positions
  well then she has phd by now
  girl got signed as model by multiple companies  community both in japan and overseas went crazy about how beautiful she is    and then you come along probably a fat ugly unkissed virgin shitposting on the internet about little girls    her eyes are weird    wow youre really the mgk of trolls go fuck yourself idiot
  savage
if youre not attracted to youre oishi even if shed shave her bald youre doing it wrong
  she was in auckland performing in that japanese festival so guess thats where she also studied maybe to become a horse veterinarian if she aint gonna tell we aint gonna know for sure
  shave her what bald
  cringe
  head    or whatevs 
      found le cucks
  i wonder who of the gakus if they shaved it bald would produce the biggest pile of hair i think they should keep track of this during orientation
  megu is shaved for sure
  and she probably has the job done by someone
  managersan is other word for sugar daddy
  megu has a person who gives her massages regularly and probably a showbiz aesthetician who shaves her   these people are the only truly happy people
  so that is why aiko and megu used to fight a lot megu got someone else to shave her
  kissu
  imagine being cucked aiko shaving megu just for sara to eat her
  as long as i got to be near megu pussy i would not complain
  thats the right mentality
  her feet will never touch you
only 1 week until i finally get to see bm
  i care so much
bm live triggers the sgfag
  anybody for pics
  slighty triggered
  got
  you can always imagine ill just leave this here forinspiration
  see this hairstyle fits her so much better  she is looking way hotter here
  i love su
  onegaishimasu
  you should tweet her anon let her know what hair style you find more sexuallly attractive on her no point in just posting it here man up and let her know
  indeed thats the babe hiding behind the bowl cut
  kek  why should i bother her i rather leave our poor girls alone she probably would appreciate adivice from a hot guy she is interested in not an anonymous gaijin from the internet  the farthest we are from them the better      she looks amazing with the right styling
  ayaka is model hot hana is fit hot and forehead raura is hot hot
  raura is next door girl hot
  tell me what fantastic neighborhood you live in nao
  she has the image and air of a next door girl thats what i meant
  coward
  dont want to bother the poor girl  coward  if you say so id rather leave her alone enjoying her life without having to interact with pieces of shit from internet
  cute kawaiiko
  she tries
  i agree put yourself in her place even if she liked gaijin she doesnt want kawaiikofan1981 commenting on her twitter pics no matter how handsome he is irl all she sees is their profile picture of her coworker from when she was 11
  yeah it must be an uncomfortable experience
  i dont see anyone here getting triggered about it my friendo
op here i might be unable to make the next edition today so if it gets to late page 10 and i havent made anything please go ahead and make one thank you

you are just asking for a thread war with yukarin that you will not win
  there are an equal amount of threads now no problem as long as you guys stop your spam everything will be dandy
  would okina post threads about yukari on /jp/

  now youve done it
  oh no okina is finally getting exercise
  destroys gensokyo  psh nothing personal kid
dumb girl  wear traffic cone for a hat  outfit she clearly bought at a drug store  no friends  often mistaken for a homeless guy
  these were dumb observations her threepointed hat looks nothing like a traffic cone her clothes are exotic and ornate she has lots of friends like aunn miko kokoro marisa the dancers yukari and probably other gods as well she has her own pocket dimension shes far from homeless
  traffic cone wearer has posted
  you just sound really stupid
  the touhou is reclining
which discord spamming us this time
  this phenomenon has happened plenty of times with yukari threads and reimu threads you seem to be obsessed with discord perhaps you should go back there
god fuck i want an okina gf

sad sips
i didnt like blondes until i met her
  why is the keenster so sad
  she didnt realize strong zero had alcohol and shes drunk now
  strong zero tastes like shit

  strong zero is a girlish drink so its aok if toehoes likes it  if youre a male and like that shit then you should be slurping dicks instead

  okina is so stronk that she can btfo memehus and secondaries while sitting down
  real man drink strong zero piss from your favorite toehoe

a thread for discussion and recommendation of japanese tv and movies    faq     previous thread     please put the sauce in the filename if posting pictures/gifs/webms
  just wanted to give a quick thanks for trying to keep this board alive outside of the usual fud
  and i should probably contribute  its not exactly anything new but i just watched honto ni atta kowai hanashi  about as cheesy as youd expect still highly entertaining
  youre welcome i enjoy watching japanese stuff even cheesy and trashy ones i will check this out
komatsu nanas koi was ameagari no you ni is out
  always a fun thread
  i recognize most celebs there
東大王    
ナニコレ珍百景    
  how does it compare to the anime version
  im still going to watch it later
reccommend me something interesting to watch  something that is niche or obscure
  maybe be specific if its a drama or movie and maybe add a genre
anyone got anything like this  i really liked this movie
takeshi such a beast wish he made more comfy movies like this
i watched gintama 2 yesterday it was so hilarious i think fukuda was given unlimited budget so he could parody most of the popular anime and cast anybody he wanted jiro sato had a scene for himself to ramble where the leads fell out of character yuya yagira is so good in acting too like watching him in aoi honoo again the story though is still your typical shonen drivel but the comedy is on spot i rec this film very much
anyone knows where to find tv shows like supreme skills sugowaza  cant found it on avistaz  i like those fun science shows
  i watched the outrage trilogy this weekend pacing was outstanding
  i still havent watched kids return
  you totally should
will there be another yoikos deserted island special this year or hamaguchi and arino are finally too old and have to stick with minecraft instead
this weeks suiyoubi  its been a while since we had a tamuken koyabu and kasuga collab best presenters i hope they do more of these  fun little segments the best were kurochans cameos  next week gonna be wild
  your video was deleted so i dont know if shes in it but suzuki hikaru is a fucking reallife angel shes too pure for tv and must be protected at all costs
  im normally never on /jp/ but i just finished my boss my hero as my second jdrama ever after densha otoko and i didnt know where else to at least have a chance to talk about it that last episode was such a sucker punch of emotion holy fuck i loved it also any other recommendations based on those two shows
  also just to add is it just me or would nagase tomoya be fucking perfect for playing kiryu if there ever were to be another yakuza movie his face just looks perfect for the role to me
  nagase has lot of great dramas try tiger and dragon or ikebukuro west gate park the storytelling here is insanely done well or if you want to see aragaki yui as a tsundere lead watch zenkai girl
  the rec list in the pastebin was made by people with similar taste as you so make sure you check it out as well
    good to know ill check that stuff out i ended up googling a bit though and found out about the great teacher onizuka drama never finished the anime even though i found it pretty decent but the dramas got me hooked on the first episode
  yeah gto is really good slight alterations to the story but the show did not suffer
love exposure 2008 extended edition   here u go jaypee  might as well post it here    
  filmstruck dies today and were losing one of the best nikkatsu noirs that ever came into existence    absolute kino i assure you
  well i watched it not that much romantic but it was poignant at least has some nice cinematography and natural dialogue i have no idea bout the anime because i just watched this for the lead actress
  whats new in the extended edition compared to regular one im sure as hell not rewatching the whole 4 hours
  this looks like a chore to watch
wtf i love time travel now
    how hyped are you gakifags
  i havent been excited for gaki since 2013 or so ill watch it because theres nothing else on thats about it
  and i finished it in 2 days because it was great
  the year went by so fast goddamn im stoked  cant wait to see big money chono slapping the shit outta hosei
  reasonably hyped    theres always kouhaku
  yes
  shes a regular on toudaioh and recently appeared on nepleague and she cut her hair
  dumbest webm ive ever seen
did anyone else watch the m1 grand prix
  im watching it right now ive been avoiding twitter for the past few hours so i dont spoil the results on myself
  i really cant stand japanese skit comedy
do they remove stuff from the nhk site after a while    i was going to watch an older cycle around japan episode but it seems like its not there anymore
  where should go now that i have watched and liked aalcc
  forgive me but what is aalcc
  where is this from
  i didnt know she was on nep league i watched all her 東大王 appearances i could find and i even watched the female 東大 students specials on 有田哲平の夢なら醒めないで and 本能z where she was on    she has miraculously managed to stay pure because she spends an almost autistical amount of time studying and memorizing stuff she also plays guitar and has a fraternal twin sister 東大王 asked her to start an instagram account and she was surprised at first that she had to upload a picture of herself because she thought instagram was a textbased social media site like twitter    heres her instagram    
  last sundays gaki the crew talked about the upcoming batsu game the upcoming 30th year anniversary of the show and a story of cocorico about to be replaced by football hour at one point but matsumoto vetoing it
  cocorico about to be replaced by football hour  this was definitely the most interesting part of the episode  gakis dynamic is so set in stone it would be weird to see anything else even though football hour are hilarious
started watching kyou kara ore wa since more subs are out not sure if the over the top style fits well with live action but since its chill i will probably watch it prefered the anime version though
  start recording/ripping them yourself desu
  its a nice show strikes the balance being comical and actually having a story every episode has something interesting going on
i cant recommend this one enough very relatable and warm
yamabiko
scum
  at least it killed byakusos thread
  where are these cute echodogs even from
    this manga is prime material for cropping adorable kyouko pictures
  kyouko
nicoms/sm14201348
  so is it a dog or a monkey
  a pigmonkey
  yamabiko are most likely based on monkeys as monkeys actually live on mountains and howl/hoot to their hearts content i imagine this would cause echoing but lmao it has floppy ears and a tail so it must be a le doggo 3
  cute
  based if true
shes a musician too
  i want to hear choujuu gigaku perform live
i mostly just wanna cuddle this cute yamabiko girl
hello
  hello
i guess no one cares about kyouko
edgy kyouko
  none know that she has secretly mastered the blade
shes a good girl
  good girls get headpats
good yamabiko
  smugabiko
how much for the dog
ah its cold outside today
sleepy
fluffy
    i want to rub her fluffy ears too
even if shes not a dog she deserves headpats and stuff
  there are no dogs in gensokyo but there are a lot of doglike youkai that might as well be considered dogs
kyouko and mystia have invited you to karaoke will you go
  id obviously go but id bring some protection i dont want to go deaf from kyouko screaming into the mic
  sure i would love to hear their beautiful music  
  i wonder if choujuu gigaku ever considered expanding their band officially theres a bunch of living percussion and string instruments flying around since the events of th14 no
i want to pat kyouko on the head vigorously and scratch her chin
  i like how kyouko always gets pregnant in those doujinshi
ms kyouko kasodani who is in charge of sweeping the myouren temple grounds and other odd jobs spoke her mind in this issue according to her words this socalled temple training makes the youkai work without compensation furthermore the subjects and the forced engagement are absolutely harsh and rigorous overtime every month can reach up to 140 hours the number of annual service days is 356 out of which 349 days require consecutive attendance ms kasodani spoke about her wishes to downsize the temple grounds    why is this allowed
  badass looking
byakuren is a evil women that need to be stop we need to rescue kyouko from her
  this is why kyouko needs to be bullied you let up on her for even a minute and she starts whining and complaining

i think my oshi hates me now how do i deal
  unfollow her
  unless your oshi literally dies or graduates you must remain loyal
  now is your chance to go all out
why does old yurumerumo member yui keep posting photos with that disgusting clown from runaten
maybe this is also tangibly related to akb48 but how do japanese idols avoid the same trap that befalls any kind of teenage star sensation where upon hitting 18 their music career takes a slutty turn like ariana grande or miley cyprus despite all the gravure or javs they possibly debut in their work on the casting couch never affects their music at all from my experience    are there idols whos solo career had their music shift from cute and innocent to generic disney/nickelodeon actress solo career
  is that the one she keeps kissing that might be your answer
  doesnt exist these are underground idol   also fuck off
i had it in the airport    yuzu shocked
  jesus fuck   is the one third from the left the producers niece or something fucking hell get her out
  but shes cute and they love each other   see  
  shut up she has is charming and has a nice voice
  so emi gets a fringe and yuzu is growing out her bangs wonder what karin will do
  maybe should have stopped posting and tweeting about how to you are going to fuck them tweeting your mentally deranged crossdress cosplays tweeting pictures of your revolting otaku cumencrusted den magically grew your hair back and gained about a foot of height
  based
  what the hell are you talking about get out of this thread
if your oshi isnt mentally ill whats the point if i wanted a basic bitch id go get a girlfriend

  whats the chance it will sound the same    it does only different i mean its different but still the same its maison book girl you never have to wonder what youre getting
  what youre getting is a front for the producers art project disguised as idol while he fucks them and pays them
    get out
  couldnt this post have been made without talking about him fucking them
  but that part is true he tried to fuck another idol he produced for
  yeah but that doesnt necessarily mean hes porking them all

  i dont care about them    t no one
anyone here cares for music first and only then the members
  people that belong on a blog or facebook group do
  edgy
  to have good music they need at least some considerable level of recognition and for that they need cute members so members first
  bish are ugly as fuck though
  imagine believing this
  idol in the antithesis of buddhism
  why would a good and recognised songwriter even consider writing a song for a bunch of ugly nobodies underground idols
  i will fucking cut you mother fucker
  rent free
say something nice about this old lady
  she knows how to scam wota out of money
  recognized doesnt equal good faggot   and being doesnt mean youre always recognized  iv hardly seen any idol i would truly call ugly  in other words youre a faggot

  lmao theres a ton of smaller groups with songs by notable songwriters youre just an idiot  like
  who are you quoting
  kyary pamyu pamyu
  kyary pamyu pamyu  small
  shes 5ft 2
  think thats an example of the song writer
  shes 5ft 2  average for a jap    think thats an example of the song writer  shes not a songwriter
  i mean calling her a notable songwriter is less of a stretch than calling her a small act i figured she just threw something together    why even care about songwriters
explain how rinahamu is a scammer
  dyor
good sample view of some female pikarin fans  
  for instance nhmbase does songs for a few smaller idol im not sit here an name idol groups for you     japan isnt the same as the west there are a ton of good producers with basically no recognition because well frankly not that many people care about idol theres a lot of good musicians without many fans because people outside of tokyo just simply dont care that much about indie shit besides youre random anisong hit or whatever the only time good producers/musicians get recognition is when they became popular in the west

  she never tans
  never heard of them   you like wasuta dont you
  ttts are the spiritual descendants of brgh exactly the same concept except with a dorkier name sorta like bis and bish except not really
  checking them out they seemed to drop the sing extra shitty on purpose gimmick though    like if you watch ト  すなっちゃんなっぽー s mv and then watch a ttts mv they sound significantly better
  i enjoy wasuta sometimes but also enjoy a lot of other groups as well task niji cy8er rabbit hutch brats lb etc
  nice all trash
  sorry i dont like your shitty le meme idol group with zero talent
gang
  im squealing
this event        has caused some of the best crossovers in /alt/ history and everyone is silent
  they seemed to drop the sing extra shitty on purpose gimmick though  yeah i agree with that they are maybe more about the music now and less about the performance art for lack of a better description of the original bellring
  rie has moved on from rei and found herself a ruka    she likes when theyre under 18 i guess
gokigen are so desperate for new members they tried to steal ayaka sasaki away from momoclo she listened until they told her how much money she would wouldnt make then she laughed and laughed and laughed
  is this ruka
  its nakamura akari
  please stop posting every word you type is absolute bollocks
  nothing wrong with her but wanted see ruka
    from a live performance point of view they also toned down a little bit the bringing chaos at every events they appear and driving organizer crazy even if it still happens when tanaka see it fits setlistwise
please gib hachi gf
smug kiki will cast a spell to deliver you some smug love
fuukas sweaty armpit
yurasmile
  this is a good pic of her
  used to enjoy beruha but the only time ive had fun at a ttt show was when task were on the same lineup
  the bubble wrap 3man with cy8er a few month ago    the setlist was pretty good iirc  i really like current state of ttts floor i just feel nostalgia for brgh pinchike hell even if it ghost come to visit from time to time
d
  wow she is so pure 3
  hazuki did it better
  out of all the kiki costumes this halloween by idols hazukis was indeed the best
  yes but i must keep her locked away from now on its not safe in the outside world
azu
princess sui is still out there waiting waiting for someone to remember her
    first time watching this pretty fucking cringe
  how the fuck are they so retarded that the white guy thinks uk is russia   embarrassing
  wtf i love suposter now   utterly based
  jump off a cliff
  task  rabbit hutch  subtle
nike airforce 1s  good taste komaki
  dope kicks faggot
  yikes
  i think rie and rei do everything possible to make each other jealous as scorned ex lovers generally do i really wish they would burry the hatchet and just dyke out publicly like they use to
here i go
me on the left
  youre a chain
  she looks like a wallace and gromit character
  ayuni is so fat and ugly
  yeah really makes you want to put your dick in her  right
just imagine this laugh while she is torturing you and taking your life off    
please stop projecting your own obesity onto idols  nanase yuka and ayuni are not fat
  gross
  now this is epic
do they fugg
    thoughts
  thats a hard yikes from me
  blogfag defenders out in full force   ちび屁こき君  holy shit thats gold
  people like hep nyo are an embarrassment
  typical white people deluded into thinking they care about westerners it is awful in every possible way though
  you dont know anything about codomomental do you   of course they care about westerns thats over half of their fanbase how else would they make money   they put that deathcore fag fronz from atilla or whatever on an album for another group solely for western appeal japanese dont even know about that band  its all about western appeal if you want to make it
  ちび屁こき君  what does that mean
  its all about western appeal if you want to make it  for an idol group lmao get real they make all their money from goods and cheki sales like everyone else its just a thinly veiled attempt at being edgy like anything watanabe has ever done maybe one of the shitty cringerock bands under their label has some tieups to appeal to westerns but you have to be delusional if you think they care about western fans for their idol groups
  are you retarded honesty  the group in question was yukueshirezutsurezure an idol group who even toured canada   they have a fucking official western fan site that they make money you idiot   
  she actually is chanmomo but literally unironically
  she doesnt even look like her reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  in a literal way it says amazing chibismall/midget farter kun but im not sure if there is a meaning to it
  wow they went to canada one time and they even spent 10 minutes setting up a shitty website  half of their fanbase is western and they make half of their money from the west  white people lol    im sure you think oyasumi hologram make all of their money from the west too
  nani nani  yes she does  and why is that so bad a thing surely not reeworthy i mused
  no i dont think that that would be stupid  oysm came to the west because japanese fans funded that tour     its clear codomomental are trying to build a western/global fanbase youd have to be delusional to think otherwise
  so an entirely different group that hasnt even taken the bare minimum steps to appeal to western fanss new edgy mv is edgy because theyre trying to appeal to their western fanbase that is over half of their fanbase and thats how you make it    its definitely just not an edgy mv because all of the companys groups have shitty edgy concepts and they totally dont make all of their money from cheki and goods sales like every other idol group    okay white boy i got it
  i never said they make all their money from westerners fuckwit what i meant was how else would they make money from westeners   and yes indeed half of their fanbase is fucking westerners and they make money on them from youtube views and online goods sales  just shut the fuck up im not even white   if you hate white americans so much why dont you fucking leave oh thats right cant milk those food stamps in japan can you
ummm ok thread just turned really racist ugh what am i reading _
  theres quite a bit of backpeddling there buddy are you okay and its still d e l u s i o n a l  half of their fanbase is westerners   lol  they make money from them on youtube views   lol  oh yeah the 80 bucks they make from youtube ad revenue from westerners   online goods sales  lol  the twitter wota are totally setting up an address forwarding and mass purchasing goods    im sure they make some money from westerners but its a small percentage just because another group once got invited to a festival in canada and decided to use the opportunity to setup a shitty website and make a couple extra stops to make the trip worth its time does not suddenly mean that another groups strategy is to appeal to westerners to make it how delusional yikes     its such a delusional thought process to think hmmm all of this companys groups have edgy concepts including this group their new edgy mv is suddenly edgy not because thats they way theyve always been but because theyre appealing to westerners    and of course the typical welfare attack on me
  are you saying half of their fanbase arent westerners prove me wrong   also codomomental are currently working with a european company to distribute all their physical cds but im not sure if they made anything work out yet but they are currently selling their digital music on english sites like amazoncom/couk etc they wouldnt do any of this if they didnt care about westerners
  fronz from attila  oh shit i remember that band i used to like their suck my fuck shenanigans man that was like 4 years ago wth yeah they were edgy asf  did they really collab /blog
  big  meaty  claws
  wait until someone includes kpop and how kpop gets more money from the japanese market than the western market
  or how kpop music choreography and overall performances are better than that of japanese idosl
  they did  
  y i k e s  my 16 yrs old self would like this tho fuck
  i think youre missing the point nobody likes kpop here the point is yukueshirezutsurezure and kaqriyo terror architect suck
  true its one of the reasons why zenkimi is one of the best they shine like a little gem amongst the sea of garbage
  correct
  i think the real issue here is how much of a whore nayuta became
everything devolves from chanmomo she is the mother succubus she turned a nice girl into a raging whore  no one can escape her grasp
  inst she supposed to blur her tie or no
  tried to shitpost and got called out for being gormless  y i k e s
  this group is meant to compete more directly with wack than the others
    are you saying half of their fanbase arent westerners prove me wrong    how many westerner spend 50 a week on average for the group tho   because thats what most of the regular japanese wota spend at any live    i think most of money is still and will probably always be in japan at least for a group that didnt breakout   world tours are however good for members spirits and add purpose in addition of being fun
  of course it is  i dont why anyone bothered trying to explain that to this delusional youtube wota yikes even the so called blogfags this guy was trying to shitpost about understand that
when did nayuta got so hot
  i still dislike and think shes a bottom tier nijicon but she has nice lips for sure
  who
  natsukichan from the group task have fun
  is that ketchup on some cheesy pastry  g i g a  y i k e s  idol life is rough
  all cute girls in japan eat that stuff it is a trendy snack right now
  it looks pretty gross
  thank you
    theyre made for kissing ao
now that shes 18 how long until jav
  never she is happy making rock music and will never do that type of thing
  unlikely she doesnt need that kind of audience however i wouldnt doubt she does the occasional gravure stuff here and there to get brats more pub
  why does every other post from you contain some kind of disdain for white people on a predominantly white imageboard created by a white man   how about you try 5channel
dear me the silly things you little boys argue about you need some karin in your life let her sing your cares away
  oink gang
  i love cheeky idols where misa poster at
  i do apologise i posted karin because i didnt have any fresh misa on hand here she is in all her cheeky glory ready to brighten your day
  how about some smug
  and do not leave out cheeky chirimen
gokigen are so desperate for new members they are even auditioning blonde europeans that girl is definitely swedish or something
  based
  ちび屁こき君
  who even toured canada  went on a free vacation to canada on stevens dime
  this   is  epic
  they should just disband
  neverforgethepnyo  would laugh but your earlier posts made you look like an embarrassment to the thread
  i unironically love her
giggleho
i want nayuta to peg me
who the fuck is nayuta
  they should just disband  i think ponto pero wants to you can see it in her eyes shes had enough
  ponto pero shops her photos harder than any idol in the game gokigen even has a youtube video showing off their filter apps and techniques they use disgraceful
  i like the old ponto pero   what went wrong
  幻
  drugs staying high is the only way she can cope
today i finally admit that i am a machineilliterate i faced two hours with a personal computer but only a small amount of progress sad idiot on the pc i want to beat up my personal computer and my lesson tomorrow good night    please send your thoughts and prayers to lisa noodles during these trying times
gang squealers rise up
  i didnt feel much nostalgia even though i used to like anna  bpm15q too only took cheki with fuuka  noe summer 2015 is always prime to me
  me on the right
  has the light blue girl done lewd things like yuzu  asking for a friend
we should ban al nondempa and nonniji posters these threads would be much better
  go make  your own thread then see how much traffic it gets if wasuta cant sustain their own thread no way in hell dempa/niji could
    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  not like that
  wasu what
  ugly troll attacks innocent child on camera
    i love how this is supposed to be super hard ass but he looks like such a sweet guy in the second picture
  nope i like niji and /alt/ fuck off
gumi is dating/has dated/is in a casual relationship with salu a very handsome boy
  yes yes yes
  they dont call em max nakadashi for nothing
  they do call them that for nothing because theyre not called that theyre called maxx nakayoshi
  i guess you cant read
  you literally cant read japanese if you think that
    cool it with the asinine memes
  is that a vape
  if wasuta cant sustain their own thread  they can but the posters refuse to use it out of stubbornness
  out of stubbornness  or because over half of the posters in it are literally just trolls
  those are the group members
  i chuckled
  just got off the phone with chief he said this aint it
  and i dont know why i fucking love ketchup but thats way too much of it for that kind of food
oh no  will desu rabbits become a wack subunit    
  nah theyre really not ready for it even with the trolls bumping it and stuff     theres just not a big enough fan base outside of japan yet which is kind of odd consdering wasuta has had subbed mvs and stuff like that since they began
next thread            lewd miri edition
  they look more unique
  im into zeazea for the music i dont even know the members names
  literally fucking who
shibuya rin just knocked you the fuck out
